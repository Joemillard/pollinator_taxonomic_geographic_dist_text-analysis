"26909","Production and meiotic analysis of autotriploid Triticum speltoides and T. bicorne","1990","Autotriploid Triticum speltoides and T. bicorne (2n=3x=21) were produced by pollinating autotetraploids with pollen from their respective diploids. The autotriploid plants were vigorous, male sterile, and morphologically resembled their diploid parents. At meiosis, T. speltoides (3x) averaged 2.52 univalents, 0.42 rod bivalents, 2.03 ring bivalents, 4.48 trivalents, and 0.03 chain quadrivalents per cell, and T. bicorne (3x) had 2.30 univalents, 0.20 rod bivalents, 2.10 ring bivalents, and 4.70 trivalents. Panhandle trivalents made up 27% of the total trivalents, and involved 18% of the total number of chromosomes observed in T. bicorne (3x), and 26% and 17% in T. speltoides (3x), respectively. The observed chromosome pairing in both triploids was predicted well from the expressions developed by Alonso and Kimber. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-3342893545"
"23566","Genetic diversity in coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) revealed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers","1998","A study of the genetic diversity in coconut by RFLP analysis was performed in 100 individuals representing 10 Tall and seven Dwarf local populations or 'ecotypes' from various geographical origins. Nine cDNA clones from rice, one mitochondrial DNA clone (CoxI) and one genomic clone (rDNA) from wheat were used as probe for southern hybridization. The distribution of the 40 polymorphic bands revealed by rice cDNA clones was studied using a multivariate analysis and allowed to identify two main genetical groups. The first one includes the ecotypes from the Far East and from the South Pacific, whereas the other one comprises the ecotypes from India, Sri Lanka and Western Africa. The rDNA and the CoxI probes confirm this distinction. The Far East and the Pacific regions which were the most likely center of origin also exhibit the widest polymorphism. The associations between the Panama Tall and the Pacific group and between the West African Tall and the Indian Ocean group reflect their likely origin. The Comoro Tall appears to be intermediate between the two main groups, and could reflect the old migration route between Indonesia and Madagascar. All Dwarf varieties belong to the first group, even those collected in West Africa. Those were probably introduced from Asia and Pacific at the beginning of the century. The cross-pollinating Tall ecotypes were generally more polymorphic than the self pollinating Dwarf ecotypes. The legitimacy of two hybrids between ecotypes was confirmed and maternal inheritance of mitochondrial genome was observed.","2-s2.0-0031981285"
"8554","Convergent specialization - the sharing of pollinators by sympatric genera of sexually deceptive orchids","2013","Pollinator sharing can offer powerful insights into the floral traits associated with the evolution of a pollination system and the consequences of floral differences for pollinator behaviour. Here, we investigate the first known case of pollinator sharing between two sexually deceptive plant genera. Floral manipulations were used to test the importance of floral traits for pollinator behaviour and pollination efficiency. We also explored the ecological differences enabling species co-occurrence. Drakaea livida and Caladenia pectinata (Orchidaceae) exhibit dramatic differences in floral display and the insectiform appearance of the labellum, yet both are pollinated by sexually attracted males of the thynnine wasp Zaspilothynnis nigripes. Because of the prevalence of cryptic species in some genera of thynnine wasps, we confirmed pollinator sharing by a mark-recapture study and sequencing of the mtDNA CO1 region. Floral dissections revealed that semiochemicals used to attract the pollinator are released from the labellum in D. livida and sepaline clubs in C. pectinata. Drakaea livida was more efficient at converting pollinator attraction into potential pollen deposition leading to higher fruit set. Floral manipulations showed that pollinator contact with the labellum increases when it is the point of semiochemical release. However, sexual attraction to the labellum remained infrequent in C. pectinata in all experimental treatments. While their distribution and climatic range show extensive overlap, the differences in edaphic requirements of the two orchid species suggest that they rarely co-occur. Therefore, the potential cost of sharing the same pollinator species is not realized. Synthesis. This case of pollinator sharing confirms that morphological traits do not place a strong constraint on the evolution of sexual deception. However, interspecific differences in floral traits have important consequences for converting attraction into pollination, suggesting that selection can act to increase efficiency at multiple steps of the pollination process. This system provides a novel opportunity to elucidate the chemical, visual and morphological adaptations underpinning the evolution of sexual mimicry. Synthesis.

"30057","Effects of soil management, pollination, and nitrogen fertilizers on Williams' pear trees","1969","The effect of soil management, pollination, and level and timing of nitrogen fertilizer on mature spurpruned Williams' pear trees under irrigated conditions was studied. The dominant response was due to soil management; straw mulch was better than cultivation, and cultivation was equal to clover sward in yield, but was inferior in vigour. Cross pollination improved yield, and tended to depress growth for both straw mulch and clover sward plots, but had little or no effect in cultivation. The various nitrogen treatments produced no important differences except that unfertilized trees declined in growth though not in yield, and the growth decline was slower than expected. After the fertilizer trials were concluded, the clover sward treatment was lifted in production to almost equal straw mulch. This improvement was probably due to the introduction of less severe pruning and the use of weedicides along the tree line. © 1969 ASEG.","2-s2.0-84971036336"
"2801","Pollen release mechanisms and androecium structure in Solanum (Solanaceae): Does anther morphology predict pollination strategy?","2016","Most species of Solanum L. (Solanaceae) exhibit a floral morphology typical of the genus: Yellow poricidal anthers with rigid walls contrasting in color with the corolla. However, some species of Solanum sect. Cyphomandropsis differ from most of the other species of Solanum by having flowers without contrasting colors and large anthers with flexible walls. These features resemble those of some closely related species belonging to Solanum sect. Pachyphylla that exhibit a bellows pollination mechanism whereby male euglossine bees cause the compression of thin anther walls and trigger pneumatic pollen release without vibration. Herein we studied the reproductive and pollination biology of a population of Solanum luridifuscescens (sect. Cyphomandropsis), a species with purple corolla and anthers, expecting to find a bellows mechanism of pollination. Both artificial mechanical stimuli applied with forceps and vibrations transmitted with an electric toothbrush resulted in the release of pollen from the anthers. Females of six species of bees visited the flowers and vibrated the anthers to collect pollen. Only one male euglossine bee visited the flowers, without causing pollen release. Solanum luridifuscescens exhibits pollen flower characteristics that are common among species of Solanum, such as the absence of nectar and the presence of poricidal anthers that release dry pollen by vibration. However, it also exhibits features that resemble mature anthers of perfume flowers typical of Solanum sect. Pachyphylla, such as a dorsally developed connective covered with purple papillae that do not contrast with the corolla plus flexible anther walls that are two or three cell layers thick on the lateral and ventral surfaces. Despite this distinct anther morphology, pollen of the flowers of S. luridifuscescens was removed exclusively by female bees using a typical vibratory mechanism. Morphological traits alone, thus, are not sufficient to predict the pollination mechanism of species of Solanum. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH","2-s2.0-84986571434"
"2169","Uncertain portfolio selection with high-order moments","2017","In the mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis framework, this paper discusses an uncertain higher-order moment portfolio selection problem when security returns are given by experts' evaluations. Based on uncertainty theory and the assumption that the security returns are zigzag uncertain variables, an uncertain multi-objective portfolio optimization model is proposed by considering the maximization of both the expected return and skewness of portfolio return while simultaneously minimizing the risk and kurtosis of portfolio return. Subsequently, the proposed model is transformed into a single-objective programming model by using fuzzy programming approach, in which investor preferences for high moments are incorporated. Furthermore, a modified flower pollination algorithm (MFPA) is developed for solution, in which PSO in local update strategy (PSOLUS) and dynamic switching probability strategy (DSPS) are employed to enhance the local searching and global searching abilities. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model and solution comparisons are also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

"10043","Optimization of a SNP assay for genotyping Theobroma cacao under field conditions","2012","The tropical tree crop Theobroma cacao L. is grown commercially for its beans, which are used in the production of cocoa butter and chocolate. Although the upper Amazon region is the center of origin for cacao, 70% of the world's supply of cacao beans currently comes from small farms in West Africa. While cacao breeding programs in producer nations are the source of improved planting material, modern marker-based breeding is difficult to perform due to the lack of genotyping facilities in these countries. While DNA extraction can be routinely performed, the equipment needed to analyze simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is seldom available, forcing the outsourcing of genotyping to foreign laboratories and delaying the breeding process. We describe a 5? nuclease (TaqMan)-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay for genotyping cacao plants under conditions similar to those found in most cacao-producing areas. The assay was tested under field conditions by planting open pollinated seeds of seven pods from four different maternal plants. The resulting 171 seedlings were successfully genotyped with 18 SNP markers representing 12 loci. The ability to use temperature-stable reagents and rapid DNA extraction methods is also explored. Additionally, by examining the seedling genotypes for the SNP markers and 14 additional SSR markers, we investigated whether seeds in a pod are the result of single or multiple pollination events. This simple, effective method of genotyping cacao seedlings in the field should allow for more efficient resource management of seed gardens and is currently being implemented in Ghana. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

"21934","Bean seed dissemination systems in malawi: A strategy","2000","Farmers have shown considerable interest in purchasing seed of newly released dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties in Malawi. However, this seed is not available on a large scale to farmers at present. The private seed sector in the country is not interested in bean seed production due to low profit margins. As a self-pollinating crop, once farmers have obtained initial seed stock, it can be recycled for some time. A strategy has been developed to focus on alternative sustainable informal seed production and dissemination systems, which builds on lessons learnt from previous experiences within Malawi and other African countries. These include: (i) informal seed multiplication, using smallholder farmers; (ii) informal seed distribution channels, using grocery shops, rural traders, extension agents, health clinics, and NGOs; and (iii) intensified variety promotion through publicity, using posters, leaflets, brochures and radio messages. These activities are carried out in close collaboration with farmers, NGOs, extension agencies, village traders and various other institutions. The results from initial sales through informal distribution channels were encouraging and 80% of the seed was sold. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-0033306050"
"23229","A clarification of pollen discounting and its joint effects with inbreeding depression on mating system evolution","1998","Given the predominance of outcrossing by angiosperms, large costs must often overwhelm the genetic benefit of selfing derived from contributing two haploid genomes to each offspring rather than one. In addition to the well-studied genetic cost of inbreeding depression, selfing imposes a mating cost whenever self-pollination reduces opportunities for pollen export. Because self-pollination is a heterogeneous process, pollen discounting and its evolutionary consequences vary with pollination conditions. In this article we model self-pollination as comprising discounting and nondiscounting components, and we consider the consequences of this heterogeneity for outcross siring success. Aided by this depiction of pollination, we then compare previous theoretical representations of pollen discounting and consider their relative virtues. Finally, we consider conditions that would allow a population to be invaded by a variant with different pollination characteristics. This analysis exposes the pollination conditions implicit in standard results of mating system theory. It also identifies associations between four possible changes in pollination expected in different reproductive environments, including the incidence of positive or negative correlations between self-pollination and pollen export. These results emphasize the benefits of expanding the theory of plant reproduction to recognize explicitly when and how pollination mechanisms affect mating outcomes.","2-s2.0-0031734208"
"60","Can the reproductive system of a rare and narrowly endemic plant species explain its high genetic diversity?","2018","The reproductive system of flowering plants can be highly variable, affecting their biology, gene flow and genetic variability among populations. Petunia secreta is a rare annual endemic species of Pedra do Segredo, located in the municipality of Caçapava do Sul, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Although rare, the species possesses a high level of genetic variability. We investigated the reproductive system of P. secreta, including fruit production and seed germinability, in order to determine if its reproductive system can explain its genetic diversity. We sampled five populations and conducted five greenhouse hand-pollination treatments: 1) autonomous apomixis; 2) self-pollination; 3) hand self-pollination; 4) geitonogamy; and 5) cross-pollination. We analysed a total of 40 plants, 468 flowers, and 6,500 seeds. Only autonomous apomixis and self-pollination did not produce fruit. No differences in fruit weight were observed among pollination treatments (P > 0.05). Seeds of two colours were produced, with no differences in germinability. Considering all plants, populations, and treatments, the average germinability was 73 % (range 9 % to 100 %). These results, along with other previous studies, indicate that the reproductive systems of P. secreta, and its large effective population size, can explain its high genetic diversity. © 2018, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

"5898","Correlations of life form, pollination mode and sexual system in aquatic angiosperms","2014","Aquatic plants are phylogenetically well dispersed across the angiosperms. Reproductive and other life-history traits of aquatic angiosperms are closely associated with specific growth forms. Hydrophilous pollination exhibits notable examples of convergent evolution in angiosperm reproductive structures, and hydrophiles exhibit great diversity in sexual system. In this study, we reconstructed ancestral characters of aquatic lineages based on the phylogeny of aquatic angiosperms. Our aim is to find the correlations of life form, pollination mode and sexual system in aquatic angiosperms. Hydrophily is the adaptive evolution of completely submersed angiosperms to aquatic habitats. Hydroautogamy and maleflower-ephydrophily are the transitional stages from anemophily and entomophily to hydrophily. True hydrophily occurs in 18 submersed angiosperm genera, which is associated with an unusually high incidence of unisexual flowers. All marine angiosperms are submersed, hydrophilous species. This study would help us understand the evolution of hydrophilous pollination and its correlations with life form and sexual system. © 2014 Du, Wang.","2-s2.0-84919667878"
"13857","Contemporary pollen flow, characterization of the maternal ecological neighbourhood and mating patterns in wild cherry (Prunus avium L.)","2009","Conversion of lowland woodland to agricultural land and resulting fragmentation in Britain has been ongoing since Neolithic times. To counteract this decline, plantations of native species, often based on non-British planting stock, have been established. This may ultimately be detrimental to the integrity of the native gene pool. We explore the genetic and ecological factors influencing the success of components of the local pollen pool, including the effect of a non-native planting on an ancient woodland population of wild cherry. Wild cherry exhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) and vegetative reproduction, both of which may be determinants of paternal success. The majority (61%) of the successful pollen originated from within the study site with a maximum pollen transfer distance of 694 m. There was a distinct departure from random mating, with over half the successful pollen originating from trees which occur within 100 m of the mother tree. Self-incompatibility, clonality, tree size and proximity to the mother tree were all found to influence paternal success. Kinship of pollen gametes within a maternal progeny was highest when a mother tree was surrounded by a large number of ramets of a single, compatible clone consisting of large, adult trees. Although the contribution from the non-native plantation is currently low, it is likely that this will increasingly contribute to the progeny of the adjacent ancient population as it matures. The results clearly show that in self-incompatible species, such as P. avium, close neighbours may be pollinated by very different components of the local pollen pool. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-68349128985"
"9874","Bats and bees are pollinating Parkia biglobosa in The Gambia","2012","A pollination experiment was conducted with Parkia biglobosa (Fabaceae) in The Gambia. P. biglobosa is integrated in the farming systems and produces fruit pulp and seeds used in cooking. The species is bat-pollinated, and in areas with few bats the main pollinators are assumed to be honey bees. A higher rate of effective pollination will in many instances increase fruit production, and the aim of this study was to investigate pollination efficiency of different pollinators. Access of flower visiting animals to flowers was controlled by nets with differently sized mesh, using five trees as replicates. The pollinators' identity, efficiency, and relative effect were determined. Bats, honey bees, and stingless bees were able to pollinate the species. Bat-visited capitula produced more pods, but not significantly more than honey bees. Honey bees were more efficient than stingless bees, resulting in significantly less aborted seeds. The treatment which excluded all flower visitors developed no mature pods, indicating that P. biglobosa was not autonomous autogamous, apomictic, or parthenocarpic, while the treatment with confined honey bees showed that geitonogamy is possible. Sugar content of fruit pulp was analysed and a positive correlation between number of seeds per pod and the sugar content was found. Improved pollination success may thus result in sweeter fruits. We conclude it is important to strive against a pollinator-friendly environment in order to attract bats and bees. Furthermore, we suggest beekeeping in the vicinity of P. biglobosa as a way to increase yield. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-84864292929"

Thus, genes encoding these receptors have great potential for use in integrated pest management. The hover fly Scaeva pyrastri (L.) is an important pollinating insect and a natural enemy of aphids, mainly distributed in the Palearctic and Nearctic regions. However, a systematic identification of their chemosensory receptor genes in the antennae has not been reported. In the present study, we assembled the antennal transcriptome of S. pyrastri by using Illumina sequencing technology. Analysis of the transcriptome data identified 60 candidate chemosensory genes, including 38 for odorant receptors (ORs), 16 for ionotropic receptors (IRs), and 6 for gustatory receptors (GRs). The numbers are similar to those of other Diptera species, suggesting that we were able to successfully identify S. pyrastri chemosensory genes. We analyzed the expression patterns of all genes by using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and found that some genes exhibited sex-biased or sex-specific expression. These candidate chemosensory genes and their tissue expression profiles provide information for further studies aimed at fully understanding the molecular basis behind chemoreception-related behaviors in S. pyrastri. ï¿½ 2016 Li et al.

During metaphase I, the chromosomes were associated mostly in 6-8 quadrivalents and the remaining ones as bivalents with no trivalents or univalents. Anaphase I and subsequent stages of meiosis were normal. The observation of quadrivalents in the tetraploids provides cytological evidence for autotetraploidy. The autotetraploid males and females were highly fertile and they produced viable seeds on artificial pollination. Pollination between diploids (2n = 40) and tetraploids (2n = 80) were also successful via embryo rescue, producing triploid (2n = 60) progenies. The discovery of fertile autotetraploids could initiate polyploidy breeding in D. alata by conventional hybridization for the first time. The reduced number of quadrivalents and the high fertility of the autotetraploids are thought to be the result of partial diploidization of meiosis. The findings also refute the assumption of the allopolyploid origin of D. alata from two putative progenitors. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84874799215"

"15076","Ethylene signaling is required for pollination-accelerated corolla senescence in petunias","2008","Senescence in Petunia × hybrida 'Mitchell Diploid' (MD) flowers is characterized by petal wilting, which is observed approximately 8 days after flower opening. Pollination accelerates corolla senescence and associated wilting symptoms are observed within 48 h. This pollination-accelerated corolla senescence was not observed in transgenic petunias with reduced ethylene sensitivity (35S{proportion}etr1-1). The growth of the pollinated etr1-1 ovary physically separated the corolla from the receptacle and the corolla was shed. Under most conditions the growing ovary resulted in the separation of a nearly turgid corolla. When this occurred, the up-regulation of the senescence specific cysteine protease, PhCP10, and the endonuclease, PhNUC1, was not detected. While a reduction in the N, P, and K content of the corollas accompanied the senescence of wild type MD flowers, a similar decrease was not detected in etr1-1 corollas. Lowering production temperatures increased the time until pollinated etr1-1 corollas were shed, and the growing ovary did not begin to separate the corolla from the receptacle until after the petals were wilting. Senescence was induced in wilted etr1-1 corollas, as evidenced by the induction of PhCP10 gene expression and PhNUC1 activity. A reduction in the macronutrient content of the wilted, pollinated etr1-1 corollas was also observed, although P levels were not reduced as much as in pollinated MD flowers. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The Iberian Peninsula harbours the highest number of species (18 Iberian of the 20 species of Antirrhinum) that potentially share similar pollinator fauna. Crossing experiments with 18 Iberian species from this study and literature revealed a general pattern of self-incompatibility (SI)  failure in this SI system has been also observed in a few plants  which indicates the need for pollinator agents in Antirrhinum pollination. Field surveys in natural conditions (304 h) found flower visitation (>85%) almost exclusively by 11 species of bee (Anthophora fulvitarsis, Anthophora plumipes, Anthidium sticticum, Apis mellifera, Bombus hortorum, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus ruderatus, Bombus terrestris, Chalicodoma lefebvrei, Chalicodoma pyrenaica and Xylocopa violacea).

It does so by addressing whether and to what extent the WSF's organizational ethos of bounded diversity plus decentralization has fostered the creation and cross-pollination of movements at the transnational level of contention by analyzing the emergence of a global anti-war movement within the WSF. It finds that the Forums have provided a hospitable environment for movement crossovers to shift priorities, resources, frames, claims, campaign strategies, and coalitions in response to the emergent threat of war. It then addresses the more polemical critique of whether the WSF inhibits alliance-building with the most decisive anti-neoliberal and anti-imperial forces of our time, by examining the Beirut and Cairo anti-war conferences. It finds that the polarization and power imbalances exacerbated in these two initiatives suggest that the proscriptions delineated in the WSF Charter aimed at preserving and promoting diversity within the Forum milieus should be maintained. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-79956179635"

The first leaf date (FLD), leaf coloring date (LCD) and first flower date (FFD) are revealed as strong biological signals of climatic change. The FLD, LCD and FFD of most species are sensitive to average temperature during a certain period before phenophase onset. Regional precipitation also has a significant impact on phenophases of about half of the species investigated. Affected by climate change, the FLD and FFD of these species have advanced by 5.54 days and 10.20 days on average during 2003-2011 compared with the period 1963-1996, respectively. Meanwhile, the LCD has delayed by 10.59 days, and growing season length has extended 16.13 days.

"2133","Effects of waste water irrigation on soil properties and soil fauna of spinach fields in a West African urban vegetable production system","2017","The usage of inadequately processed industrial waste water (WW) can lead to strong soil alkalinity and soil salinization of agricultural fields with negative consequences on soil properties and biota. Gypsum as a soil amendment to saline-sodic soils is widely used in agricultural fields to improve their soil physical, chemical and hence biological properties. This study aimed at analysing the effects of intensive WW irrigation on the structure and composition of soil-dwelling arthropods on spinach fields (Spinacia oleracea L.) in a West African urban vegetable production system. We used gypsum as a soil amendment with the potential to alleviate soil chemical stress resulting in a potentially positive impact on soil arthropods. A total of 32 plots were established that showed a gradient in soil pH ranging from slight to strong soil alkalinity and that were irrigated with WW (nï¿½=ï¿½12) or clean water (CW; nï¿½=ï¿½20), including eight plots into which gypsum was incorporated. Our study revealed a high tolerance of soil-dwelling arthropods for alkaline soils, but spinach fields with increased soil electrical conductivity (EC) showed a reduced abundance of Hymenoptera, Diptera and Auchenorrhyncha. Arthropod abundance was positively related to a dense spinach cover that in turn was not affected by WW irrigation or soil properties. Gypsum application reduced soil pH but increased soil EC. WW irrigation and related soil pH affected arthropod composition in the investigated spinach fields which may lead to negative effects on agronomical important arthropod groups such as pollinators and predators. ï¿½ 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85009375740"

Erythrina comprises 36 species of hummingbird-pollinated trees and shrubs, distributed principally in Mesoamerica. Avian floral visitors - including nectar thieves as well as pollinators - were observed at 17 populations of 13 species in S Mexico and Costa Rica. Legitimate pollinators were all ""high-reward traplining' hummingbirds with long bills and non-territorial foraging behavior, including in particular 3 species of Heliomaster. Nectar thieves included a variety of short-billed hummingbirds and passerine birds. Measurements of nectar volume, sugar concentration, and flowering behavior indicate that the caloric value of nectar in open flowers produced by one tree per day is insufficient to support a single hummingbird's energetic requirements; therefore, territorial defense by a hummingbird of a single tree is precluded. The traplining hummingbirds appear to be effective agents of pollen flow among conspecific trees in the typically low-density Erythrina populations. -from Author","2-s2.0-0023582554"

"1964","Resource- and pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits","2017","Female reproductive success is predicted to be simultaneously limited by the availability of pollen and resources. Selection on floral traits results from both factors, but their relative importance and interaction is poorly understood. We increased nutrient and pollen availability of the orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica in a factorial experiment to quantify resource- and pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. Hand-pollination increased female fitness (number of fruits × mean fruit mass) by 74% in both nutrient treatments, whereas nutrient addition did not significantly affect female fitness. There was selection for more flowers and longer spurs, and selection on spur length was significantly pollinator-mediated and of similar strength across nutrient treatments (??poll= 0·54 and ??poll_ NPK = 0·59). There was no statistically significant resource-mediated selection. Nutrient addition increased flower size the following year, but did not affect flower or fruit production, or selection on any trait. The results demonstrate that D. lapponica does not increase flower production in response to nutrient addition, that the increase in female fitness in response to hand-pollination is not resource limited, and suggest that natural resource variation does not influence selection on floral traits. The study illustrates that crossed manipulations of pollen and resources can clarify their relative importance for selection on floral traits.

"20682","Aristolochia spp. (Aristolochiaceae) pollinated by flies breeding on decomposing flowers in Panama","2002","This study presents breeding and pollination systems of Aristolochia maxima and A. inflata in a seasonal tropical forest of Panama. Aristolochia is the most diverse genus of Aristolochiaceae, with ?120 species distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics. All the Aristolochia species studied so far are pollinated by saprophagous flies of different families, which are presumably deceived by floral odor. Flowers of many species have trap-and-release mechanisms. The flowers attract and imprison pollinators during the female stage first day of flowering and release them after anther dehiscence. Pollination systems of A. maxima and A. inflata are different from those of other Aristolochia in lacking trap mechanisms. Furthermore, the pollinators oviposit in the flowers, and their larvae grow on the fallen, decaying flowers on the ground. Therefore, the plants have a mutualistic relationship with their pollinators. Self-compatible A. inflata is pollinated by Megaselia sakaiae (Phoridae, Diptera). The pollinator may be specialized to Aristolochia flowers, which is the only substrate for larval development. On the other hand, self-incompatible A. maxima is pollinated by Drosophila spp. (Drosophilidae, Diptera), which utilize Aristolochia flowers as a breeding site only occasionally. This pollination mutualism might have evolved from deceit pollination.","2-s2.0-0036203343"
"10137","Temporal variation in coffee flowering may influence the effects of bee species richness and abundance on coffee production","2012","Accurately estimating the contribution of pollinators to production in crop species is important but could be challenging for species that are widely cultivated. One factor that may influence the pollinator-production relationship across regions is phenology, or the timing of recurring biological events, because crop phenology can be proximately controlled by climatic variables and phenology can affect plant reproductive success. For the economically important crop, coffee (Coffea arabica), at least three aspects of flowering phenology (onset, density and frequency) are influenced by precipitation, which varies across coffee's cultivated range. Of these aspects of flowering phenology, flower density may particularly impact production in coffee because high-density flowering can severely limit outcrossing which is a major contributor to high yields and larger, high quality beans. We studied the C. arabica coffee plant-pollinator interaction over 3 years and across two distinct types of coffee blooms: (1) low-density, synchronous flowering and (2) high-density, synchronous (mass) flowering. Bee species richness was similar for four out of five flowering periods (9.8 ± 2.7 95% CI), but nearly tripled during one high-density flowering period (26 ± 8.6 95% CI). During low-density flowering coffee fruit set rates were varied, but when coffee flowered at high-density, initial fruit set rates remained close to 60% (the rate obtained from manual self-pollination of coffee flowers in pollination experiments). We discuss how changing precipitation patterns may alter coffee flowering phenology and the coffee plant-pollinator relationship, providing insight into how climate change may influence this interaction as well as the resultant coffee production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-84861228527"
"13719","Formation of hydroxymethylfurfural in domestic high-fructose corn syrup and its toxicity to the honey bee (Apis mellifera)","2009","In the United States, high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has become a sucrose replacement for honey bees and has widespread use as a sweetener in many processed foods and beverages for human consumption. It is utilized by commercial beekeepers as a food for honey bees for several reasons: to promote brood production, after bees have been moved for commercial pollination, and when field-gathered nectar sources are scarce. Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a heat-formed contaminant and is the most noted toxin to honey bees. Currently, there are no rapid field tests that would alert beekeepers of dangerous levels of HMF in HFCS or honey. In this study, the initial levels and the rates of formation of HMF at four temperatures were evaluated in U.S.-available HFCS samples. Different HFCS brands were analyzed and compared for acidity and metal ions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Levels of HMF in eight HFCS products were evaluated over 35 days, and the data were fit to polynomial and exponential equations, with excellent correlations. The data can be used by beekeepers to predict HMF formation on storage. Caged bee studies were conducted to evaluate the HMF dose-response effect on bee mortality. Finally, commercial bases such as lime, potash, and caustic soda were added to neutralize hydronium ion in HMF samples, and the rates of HMF formation were compared at 45°C. © 2009 American Chemical Society.","2-s2.0-70349196352"

"5697","An epiallele at cly1 affects the expression of floret closing (Cleistogamy) in barley","2015","The swelling of the lodicule is responsible for floret opening in many grass species, allowing for pollen dispersal and crosspollination. In barley, the closed floret habit (cleistogamy) is under the control of cly1, a gene that operates by inhibiting the development of the lodicule. In non-cleistogamous cultivars, cly1 mRNA is degraded by miR172-directed cleavage, allowing the lodicules to swell; however, in cultivars carrying the recessive allele cly1.b, a single-nucleotide substitution destroys the miR172 target site preventing mRNA cleavage. Barley cv. SV235 is cleistogamous; its cly1 coding sequence is identical to that of cly1.b, but its lodicules do develop, although insufficiently to produce a non-cleistogamous flower. In this cultivar, the downregulation of cly1 is unrelated to miR172-directed mRNA degradation, but rather is caused by an epiallele that represses transcription. Allelic relationships between known cly1 alleles were explored by the quantification of lodicule vascularization and an assessment of the response of the spike to the supply of exogenous auxin. The SV235 phenotype can be manipulated by a pre-anthesis application of 2,4-D, a feature that could be of interest in the context of hybrid barley grain production based on cleistogamy. © 2015 by the Genetics Society of America.","2-s2.0-84920873756"

Willd., Lepidium campestre (L.) R. Br. and Sisymbrium altissimum L]. Pearson product moment and Mann Whitney U tests indicated that regardless of whether Coulter Counters or microscope counts were used to count pollen, there was sufficient pollen transfer from the Alliaria petiolata and Hesperis malronalis to all spp. except Cardamine diphylla, where its pollinator is more fidelous. When there was a relatively low maximum of 10 pollen grains of either Alliaria petiolata or Hesperis malronalis on stigmas of Alyssum alyssoides, Lepidium campestre and Sisymbrium altissimum, the pollen tube generation declined by 80% and the difference compared to stigmas with no heterospecific pollen was significant (Pearson product moment tests, P < 0.001). While this is typical for pollen allelopathic impacts, our conclusion is more cautious, because after 5-days in a sterilized environment, fungi that already existed on pollen and stigmas began to grow. This is unlike the situation in our research group's previous studies, where there was no ""contamination"" from fungi or any other organism or chemical. As such, we conclude that while there is evidence of pollen allelopathic impacts, it is still possible that the declines in pollen tube generation in species receiving pollen from Alliaria petiolata or Hesperis malronalis may be due to immediate exudation from fungal spores carried on pollen or stigmas rather than pollen.","2-s2.0-70349911966"

Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate this process can facilitate the production of this agriculturally valuable fruit crop. Over the years, it has been well established that tomato fruit set depends on successful pollination and fertilization, which trigger the fruit developmental programme through the activation of the auxin and gibberellin signalling pathways. However, the exact role of each of these two hormones is still poorly understood, probably because only few of the signalling components involved have been identified so far. Recent research on fruit set induced by hormone applications has led to new insights into hormone biosynthesis and signalling.

The two plants differed morphologically from the maternal and other offspring, and had 2n = 56 chromosomes. Both likely resulted from the fertilization of an unreduced egg from the apomictic BC1 hybrid (2n = 35) by a 21-chromosome gamete possibly produced by a hexaploid Interspecific hybrid (2n = 42) Involving Pennisetum purpureum Schumach. At metaphase I, chromosomes remained as univalents (X&amp;macr; = 10.50) paired as bivalents (X&amp;macr; = 11.97) or associated in multivalents. Both offtypes were partially male fertile with 37 percent and 47 percent of pollen stainabillty, respectively. Offtype I was obligatoly apomictic with 98 percent aposporous embryo sacs, but completely female sterile. Offtype 2 was a facultative apomict with 16 percent and 73 percent of ovules with eight- and four-nucleate mature embryo sacs, respectively. Offtype 2 set a mean of 5 open-pollinated seed per head.

"19952","The relationship between nectar spur curvature in jewelweed (Impatiens capensis) and pollen removal by hummingbird pollinators","2003","Floral nectar spurs are hypothesized to have had a major role in the evolution of floral diversity and plant-pollinator coadaptation. We examined variation in the degree of nectar spur curvature in two species of jewelweed (Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida) pollinated by different sets of pollinators. To distinguish between adaptive and nonadaptive explanations for between-species differences in curvature, we determined the relationship between spur curvature and pollen removal, which is one estimate of male reproductive success. Spur curvature exhibited considerable variation both within and among three populations, with spur angles ranging from 0° to 297°. A greenhouse experiment determined that spur curvature of I. capensis flowers has a broad-sense heritability of 0.636. Laboratory experiments indicated that flowers having recurved spurs deposit significantly more pollen grains on hummingbird visitors than flowers having perpendicular spurs, apparently as a result of greater contact between the androecium of curve-spurred flowers and the upper bill of hummingbirds. We also found a significant relationship between spur curvature and flower length, suggesting a developmental link between the two traits. We discuss the degree of spur curvature in bird-pollinated I. capensis as a function of both adaptive evolution and developmental constraint.","2-s2.0-0038532561"
"7897","Changes of effective gene dispersal distances by pollen and seeds across successive life stages in a tropical tree","2013","Pollen and seed dispersal are the two key processes in which plant genes move in space, mostly mediated by animal dispersal vectors in tropical forests. Due to the movement patterns of pollinators and seed dispersers and subsequent complex spatial patterns in the mortality of offspring, we have little knowledge of how pollinators and seed dispersers affect effective gene dispersal distances across successive recruitment stages. Using six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci and parentage analyses, we quantified pollen dispersal, seed dispersal, and effective paternal and maternal gene dispersal distances from pollen- and seed-donors to offspring across four recruitment stages within a population of the monoecious tropical tree Prunus africana in western Kenya. In general, pollen-dispersal and paternal gene dispersal distances were much longer than seed-dispersal and maternal gene dispersal distances, with the long-distance within-population gene dispersal in P. africana being mostly mediated by pollinators. Seed dispersal, paternal and maternal gene dispersal distances increased significantly across recruitment stages, suggesting strong density- and distance-dependent mortality near the parent trees. Pollen dispersal distances also varied significantly, but inconsistently across recruitment stages. The mean dispersal distance was initially much (23-fold) farther for pollen than for seeds, yet the pollen-to-seed dispersal distance ratio diminished by an order of magnitude at later stages as maternal gene dispersal distances disproportionately increased. Our study elucidates the relative changes in the contribution of the two processes, pollen and seed dispersal, to effective gene dispersal across recruitment. Overall, complex sequential processes during recruitment contribute to the genetic make-up of tree populations. This highlights the importance of a multistage perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of animal-mediated pollen and seed dispersal on small-scale spatial genetic patterns of long-lived tree species. © 2013 The Authors.","2-s2.0-84886239856"
"18177","Cyclic climate fluctuations during the last interglacial in central Europe","2005","Differentiating natural climate change from anthropogenic forcing is a major challenge in the prediction of future climates. In this context, the investigation of interglacials provides valuable information on natural climate variability during periods that resemble the present. This paper shows that natural cyclic changes in winter climates affected central European environments during the last interglacial, i.e., the Eemian, 126-110 ka. As a result of the extraordinarily high counting sums performed at Eemian pollen samples, it was possible to reveal a robust presence - absence pattern of the insect-pollinated, and therefore in the pollen rain underrepresented, taxon Hedera. This plant is known to require the influence of oceanic winter climates, i.e., moist and mild, in northwest and central Europe. By analogy with recent findings from the North Atlantic's Holocene interglacial, the trigger of the Eemian climate variability may have been changes in solar activity, possibly amplified by changes in North Atlantic ocean currents and/or in the North Atlantic Oscillation. Our findings suggest natural cyclic changes to be a persistent feature of interglacial climates. © 2005 Geological Society of America.","2-s2.0-20444459456"
"1170","Sex-biased oviposition by a nursery pollinator on a gynodioecious host plant: Implications for breeding system evolution and evolution of mutualism","2017","Dioecy, a breeding system where individual plants are exclusively male or female, has evolved repeatedly. Extensive theory describes when dioecy should arise from hermaphroditism, frequently through gynodioecy, where females and hermaphrodites coexist, and when gynodioecy should be stable. Both pollinators and herbivores often prefer the pollen-bearing sex, with sex-specific fitness effects that can affect breeding system evolution. Nursery pollination, where adult insects pollinate flowers but their larvae feed on plant reproductive tissues, is a model for understanding mutualism evolution but could also yield insights into plant breeding system evolution. We studied a recently established nursery pollination interaction between native Hadena ectypa moths and introduced gynodioecious Silene vulgaris plants in North America to assess whether oviposition was biased toward females or hermaphrodites, which traits were associated with oviposition, and the effect of oviposition on host plant fitness. Oviposition was hermaphrodite-biased and associated with deeper flowers and more stems. Sexual dimorphism in flower depth, a trait also associated with oviposition on the native host plant (Silene stellata), explained the hermaphrodite bias. Egg-receiving plants experienced more fruit predation than plants that received no eggs, but relatively few fruits were lost, and egg receipt did not significantly alter total fruit production at the plant level. Oviposition did not enhance pollination; egg-receiving flowers usually failed to expand and produce seeds. Together, our results suggest that H. ectypa oviposition does not exert a large fitness cost on host plants, sex-biased interactions can emerge from preferences developed on a hermaphroditic host species, and new nursery pollination interactions can arise as negative or neutral rather than as mutualistic for the plant. © 2017 The Authors.

The abandonment of traditional land-use practices is causing forest recovery throughout the Mediterranean mountains, by increasing reduction and fragmentation of open habitats. We investigated the population genetic structure and habitat dynamics of Plantago brutia Ten., a narrow endemic in mountain pastures of S Italy. Some plants were cultivated in the botanical garden to explore the species' breeding system. Genetic diversity was evaluated based on inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) polymorphisms in 150 individuals from most of known stands. Recent dynamics in the species habitat were checked over a 14-year period. Flower phenology, stigma receptivity and experimental pollinations revealed protogyny and self-incompatibility. With the exception of very small and isolated populations, high genetic diversity was found at the species and population level. amova revealed weak differentiation among populations, and the Mantel test suggested absence of isolation-by-distance. Multivariate analysis of population and genetic data distinguished the populations based on genetic richness, size and isolation. Landscape analyses confirmed recent reduction and isolation of potentially suitable habitats. Low selfing, recent isolation and probable seed exchange may have preserved P. brutia populations from higher loss of genetic diversity. Nonetheless, data related to very small populations suggest that this species may suffer further fragmentation and isolation. To preserve most of the species' genetic richness, future management efforts should consider the large and isolated populations recognised in our analyses. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","2-s2.0-73349092458"

Two different series have been developed: the Pi- and the Re-series. Pi- as prefix indicate that cultivars were bred mainly for quality (Pi for Pillnitz) whereas Re- as prefix indicate the main aim resistance (Re for resistant). Although in apple breeding the protection of flowers with bags, before and after pollination with desired pollen is usual to prevent outbreeding, outbreeders occur. We were interested in verifying the expected parentage of the Pillnitz apple cultivars. Therefore a couple of microsatellites were applied to the Pillnitz cultivars and their parents. Since only three cultivars used as pollen donors for Re-cultivars were still available, only the maternal cultivar of the most Re-cultivars could be checked. The female parent for all Pi-cultivars tested and the male parent for 16 cultivars could be verified. 'Pimona' and 'Pikora' seems to descend from a cultivar different from the cultivar used as pollen donor. 'Pikkolo' descends from a cross of 'Clivia' pollinated with a pollen mixture of the three cultivars 'Auralia', 'Kurzcox', and 'Undine'. The pattern of the SSRs confirmed 'Auralia' as male parent of 'Pikkolo'.

Nevertheless, the female parents of 'Realka', 'Reanda', 'Rebella', 'Rebecka', and 'Reglindis' could not be verified. This might be due to the exchange of seeds or budwood for grafting.

Phylogenetically, Aristolochiaceae represent the first angiosperm lineage that developed trap flowers. Here we report the structure and function of specific trichomes contributing to the highly specialized trapping devices. Investigations were carried out on six Mediterranean Aristolochia species. The morphology and arrangement of the trapping trichomes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM. To demonstrate frictional anisotropy of the trapping trichome array, a microtribological approach was used. The results of our experiments support a hypothesis long proposed, but never tested, regarding the trapping mechanism in proterogynous Aristolochia flowers: that an array of highly specialized trichomes arranged eccentrically to the underlying surface is responsible for the easy entrance of insects into flowers but impedes their escape. As they enter the male stage of anthesis, flowers significantly modify their inner surface characteristics, allowing insects to leave. We have demonstrated the substantial contribution of trapping trichomes to the capture, retention and release of pollinators, an important prerequisite for making cross-pollination possible in most Aristolochia species. Finally, we compare trapping trichomes of Aristolochia with similar structures found in other trapping flowers as well as in pitchers of carnivorous plants not optimized for insect release. © 2009 New Phytologist.","2-s2.0-70449363964"

There was limited transmission in cages without a hive and no transmission when healthy field bushes were caged with trap plants either with or without honeybees. Infective pollen survived within the hive for 1 but not 2 weeks. Western flower thrips did not transmit BlShV when they were allowed to feed on caged flowering trap plants in the presence of a source of infected pollen. Results of pollen washes, cell disruption, and electron microscopy show that particles of BlShV were on, in, and between the cells of the pollen tetrad. Pollen from infected plants germinated as readily as pollen from healthy plants. BlShV was seedborne, but at a low level. All 42 cultivars tested were susceptible to BlShV when inoculated by grafting. The primary mechanism of transmission appears to be the transfer of BlShV-contaminated pollen by honeybees from flowers on infected plants to flowers on healthy plants.","2-s2.0-0032950839"
"12381","Pollinator diversity and specialization in relation to flower diversity","2010","In the face of global decline in biodiversity, the relationship between diversity and species interactions deserves particular attention. If pollinators are strongly dependent on floral diversity due to mutual specialization, declines in plant diversity, e.g. caused by land use intensification, may be associated with linked extinctions of pollinators. However, the general extent of pollinator specialization is still poorly known. To explore the dependence of local bee and hoverfly communities on flower diversity, we recorded flower supply and flower-visiting insects on 27 meadows with varying flower diversity in southern Germany and analyzed (a) whether the diversity of flower visitors is correlated with flower diversity, (b) whether the degree of dietary specialization of flower visitors changes with flower diversity and (c) whether flower preferences of individual flower visitor species are constant or variable between different communities. Flower-visitor interaction webs were compiled during a single day on each meadow. This approach prevents relating pollinator species to flowers they never encounter because of non-overlapping phenology or spatial segregation. (a) Flower diversity and flower visitor diversity were positively correlated. (b) Flower visitor assemblies were significantly specialized at a relatively high level, contrasting to the opinion that plant-pollinator webs are highly generalized, and providing a possible explanation for the positive diversity correlation. However, the level of specialization did not change significantly across the gradient of flower diversity, suggesting that pollinators are partitioned to a similar extent in each meadow. (c) In the analysis of ten common flower visitor species previously categorized as generalists, strong evidence was found for both, consistent preferences and preferences that differ between sites. These results indicate a flexibility in flower preferences and a dynamic resource partitioning among pollinators. Generally, our findings highlight the complexity of plant-pollinator interactions and confirm the importance of flower diversity for bee and hoverfly communities. © 2010 The Authors.","2-s2.0-77956644885"

Apparently, the closely related homoeologous chromosomes of the J1 d and J2 d genomes regularly formed bivalents during megasporogenesis, and egg cells mostly received a random, yet balanced set of seven Thinopyrum chromosomes. F, plants were tested for salt tolerance and a set of fifteen highly salt-tolerant F1 plants were selected and maintained as clones for several years. These were C-banded and the Thinopyrum chromosomes contained in each were determined. By comparing segregation patterns it was now possible to group the Thinopyrum chromosomes into seven homoeologous pairs. For each of four homoeologous pairs, one of its members occurred at a higher than expected frequency, implying that these chromosomes are expressed under salt stress conditions. The results could be confirmed by backcrossing two of the most tolerant F1 plants to diploid rye. While the critical chromosomes can be identified through C-banding, an attempt was made to also find a RFLP marker for each. RFLP probes, diagnostic for the group 2, 3, 4 and 5 homoeologues of wheat, detected polymorphisms on the respective critical Thinopyrum chromosomes. However, the preliminary allocation of the critical chromosomes to homoeology groups needs to be confirmed using more and varied markers. © 2003 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-0348195627"
"2159","Contrasting effects of ploidy level on seed production in a diploid-tetraploid system","2017","Previous studies demonstrated the effects of polyploidy on various aspects of plant life. It is, however, difficult to determine which plant characteristics are responsible for fitness differences between cytotypes. We assessed the relationship between polyploidy and seed production. To separate the effects of flowering phenology, flower head size and herbivores from other possible causes, we collected data on these characteristics in single flower heads of diploid and tetraploid Centaurea phrygia in an experimental garden. We used structural equation modelling to identify the main pathways determining seed production. The results showed that the relationship between polyploidy and seed production is mediated by most of the studied factors. The different factors acted in opposing directions. Wider flower heads displayed higher above the ground suggested higher seed production in diploids. In contrast, earlier flowering and a lower abundance of herbivores suggested higher seed production in tetraploids. However, because phenology was the strongest driver of seed production in this system, the sum of all the pathways suggested greater seed production in tetraploids than in diploids. The pathway linking ploidy level directly to seed production, representing unstudied factors, was not significant. This suggests that the factors studied likely are drivers of the between-cytotype differences. Overall, this study demonstrated that tetraploids possess overall higher fitness estimated as seed production. Regardless of the patterns observed here, strong between year fluctuations in the composition and diversity of insect communities have been observed. The direction of the selection may thus vary between years. Consequently, understanding the structure of the interactions is more important for understanding the system than the overall effects of cytotype on a fitness trait in a specific year. Such knowledge can be used to model the evolution of species traits and plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator interactions in diploid- polyploid systems. © The Authors 2016.","2-s2.0-85040186300"

We introduce a general method using numerical simulations to test several alternative models of frequency-dependent selection on S-locus data from sporophytic systems, taking into account both genetic drift and observed patterns of dominance interactions among S-locus haplotypes (S-haplotypes). Using a molecular typing method, we estimated S-haplotype frequencies in a sample of 322 adult plants and of 245 offspring obtained from seeds sampled on 22 maternal plants, collected in a single population of Arabidopsis halleri (Brassicaceae). We found eight different S-haplotypes and characterized their dominance interactions by controlled pollinations. We then compared the likelihood of different models of frequency-dependent selection: we found that the observed haplotype frequencies and observed frequency changes in one generation best fitted a model with (1) the observed dominance interactions and (2) no pollen limitation. Overall, our population genetic models of frequency-dependent selection, including patterns of dominance interactions among S-haplotypes and genetic drift, can reliably predict polymorphism at the S-locus. We discuss how these approaches allow detecting additional processes influencing the evolutionary dynamics of the S-locus, such as purifying selection on linked loci. © 2008 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-53149120643"
"8435","The most effective pollinator revisited: Pollen dynamics in a spring-flowering herb","2013","Most flowers are visited by a wide range of potential pollinators. However, their efficiency in pollen removal and deposition, and other behavioural factors affecting pollination effectiveness may greatly differ among taxa, and even individuals. Fritillary (Fritillaria meleagris L., Liliaceae) is a spring-flowering, critically endangered plant in the Polish flora, red-listed in most of the European countries of its range. Based on indirect evidence, that is, body pollen loads, visitation frequency and seasonal abundance, it is estimated that its key pollinators are queen bumblebees, but, as shown in the literature, the largest Fritillaria pollen loads are carried by solitary bees. To study pollinator effectiveness for floral visitors to F. meleagris, we performed a garden experiment, where we analysed pollen deposition and assessed pollen removal per single flower-visit in the plant. Similarly to field conditions reported in the literature, our experimental plants were serviced by nectar-seeking bumblebee queens and two taxa of solitary bees, small pollen-collecting Andrena and large, nectar-seeking Anthophora males. When ""quality"" component was addressed, despite the character of visits, insects from all groups deposited more pollen than was found on unvisited flowers, but they did not differ significantly from each other in pollen deposition on virgin stigmas. We also found some differences in pollen removal both within- and among-visitor species and control flowers, unfortunately due to extremely high variation of the results they were all statistically insignificant. However, when ""quantity"" component of insect performance was concerned, we observed that over 81 % of visits were by bumblebees. Bombus queens stayed on flowers significantly less time than small Andrena individuals (13 % of recorded visits) and equally long as Anthophora males (only 6 % of visits). We conclude that although all the visitor groups can pollinate the flowers of F. meleagris, bumblebee queens indeed proved to be the most effective pollinators of the plant, when both quality and quantity components of pollination are concerned. © 2013 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-84878110776"

They are pollinated by male Euglossini bees. It is widely know that these bees collect volatile compounds in Catasetum from structures called osmophores. However, there is little information on morpho-anatomy and histochemistry of secretory tissues for this neotropical genus and data are lacking. Based on these arguments members of the Catasetum cristatum alliance, namely C. arietinum, C. ariquemense, C. barbatum, C. carolinianum, C. cristatum, C. lanciferum, C. multifidum, C. multifissum, C. rivularium and C. semicirculatum were analyzed. The labellum of male flowers of this alliance is elongate and with fimbriate margins, possessing two protuberances and a median saccate portion. The labellum of female flowers is galeiform and there is no ornamentation. The entire adaxial surface of the labellum is secretory in both sexes, including the fimbriae of male flowers. The structure of the secretory tissue is similar among species, and they are composed of a simple epidermis and five layers of underlying parenchyma. In most species the epidermis is flat, and cells are elongated in the saccate portion. In C. ariquemense and C. carolinianum the epidermal cells are papillous, while in C. semicirculatum they have convex surface (male flowers). The histochemical analysis detected lipophilic droplets and starch grains inside the secretory cells.

"15629","Genetic structure and population differentiation of the Mediterranean pioneer spiny broom Calicotome villosa across the Strait of Gibraltar","2008","The region around the Strait of Gibraltar is considered to be one of the most relevant 'hot spots' of biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin due to its historical, biogeographical, and ecological features. Prominent among these is its role as a land bridge for the migration and differentiation of species during the Pleistocene, as a consequence of the lowering of sea level and climate changes associated with the Ice Ages. In the present study, we report a multilevel hierarchical investigation of the genetic diversity of Calicotome villosa, a common pioneer legume shrub, at the regional scale. The results of genetic analysis of progeny arrays are consistent with a predominantly outcrossing mating system in all the populations analysed. Geographically, a pattern of population isolation by distance was found, but the Strait accounted for only approximately 2% of the among-population genetic differentiation. Consequently, extensive historical gene flow appears to be the rule for this species in this area. According to the natural history traits of C. villosa (pollination, dispersal, and colonization ability), we hypothesize that gene flow must be strongly influenced by seed dispersal because pollen flow is very limited. Based on the history of trade and land use, cattle and human movements across the Strait must have strongly favoured seed dispersal. We review and discuss these results and compare them with those of other reported studies of genetic and phylogenetic differentiation across the Strait of Gibraltar. It is stressed that colonization ability, which depends upon seed dispersal and life form, can be a more critical factor in gene flow than pollination. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.","2-s2.0-37249016341"

Judging the maturity of young coconut is difficult and thus a harvested crop typically features fruit of varying levels of maturity, which currently require manual grading. In an attempt to help reduce the time and costs associated with the grading process, the correlations between the physical, mechanical, physiological and acoustic properties of coconuts and their maturity levels were investigated. The analyses showed that specific gravity, husk rupture force and husk firmness showed a decreasing trend with progressing days after pollination. Other properties including resonant frequency, shell rupture force, shell firmness, total soluble solids, flesh thickness, wet flesh weight and dry flesh weight indicated an increase in values with days after pollination. The flesh thickness was the parameter best correlated with days after pollination. Maturity index based on the flesh thickness can be quantitatively predicted by multivariate partial least squares model. The best model used a combination of husk rupture force, shell firmness, shell rupture force, wet flesh weight and husk firmness (R2 = 0.991, standard error of prediction of 0.133 and bias of 0.004). A non-destructive model based on resonant frequency gave relatively good accuracy of prediction with R2 = 0.927, standard error of prediction 0.386 and bias of 0.034. © 2009 IAgrE.","2-s2.0-67349155996"

The melliferous plants were analyzed individually from the aspect of their flowering phenology, abundance, and the intensity of nectar and pollen production, as well as the production of honeydew. The melliferous potential of each investigated plant community was theoretically assessed on the basis of the coenotic coefficient of melliferousness incorporating a phytocoenotic analysis, the coenotic coefficients of nectar and pollen production, and the percentage of melliferous species in relation to the total number of species that characterize the association. The highest percentage of the melliferous species was noted in the meadow association Petasitetum hybridi (70%) and the forest association Piceetum-Abietis serpentinicum (63.6%). The highest values of the coenotic coefficient of melliferousness were established for the forest association Querco-Carpinetum iliricum, and the meadow association Rhinantho-Cynosuretum cristati. Trees notable for their honeydew production in good quantities were Pinus nigra Arnold, Picea sp. Fagus sylvatica Linnaeus, Populus tremula Linnaeus, and Quercus cerris Linnaeus. Because, the vegetation in the study area is forest dominated, forest bee pasture including early flowering herbaceous and woody plants, is of the greatest significance for the honey bee, both in the early spring because of pollen and nectar production, and in the autumn as a source of honeydew. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.","2-s2.0-84881450628"
"682","Are food-deceptive orchid species really functionally specialized for pollinators?","2017","Food-deceptive orchid species have traditionally been considered pollination specialized to bees or butterflies. However, it is unclear to which concept of specialization this assumption is related; if to that of phenotypic specialization or of functional specialization. The main aim of this work was to verify if pollinators of five widespread food-deceptive orchid species (Anacamptis morio (L.) R.M. Bateman, Pridgeon & M.W. Chase, Anacamptis pyramidalis (L.) Rich., Himantoglossum adriaticum H. Baumann, Orchis purpurea Huds. and Orchis simia Lam.) predicted from the phenotypic point of view matched with the observed ones. We addressed the question by defining target orchids phenotypic specialization on the basis of their floral traits, and we compared the expected guilds of pollinators with the observed ones. Target orchid pollinators were collected by conducting a meta-analysis of the available literature and adding unpublished field observations, carried out in temperate dry grasslands in NE Italy. Pollinator species were subsequently grouped into guilds and differences in the guild spectra among orchid species grouped according to their phenotype were tested. In contradiction to expectations derived from the phenotypic point of view, food-deceptive orchid species were found to be highly functionally generalized for pollinators, and no differences in the pollinator guild spectra could be revealed among orchid groups.

"3300","Collateral effects of beekeeping: Impacts on pollen-nectar resources and wild bee communities","2016","Due to the contribution of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to wild flower and crop pollination, beekeeping has traditionally been considered a sustainable practice. However, high honey bee densities may have an impact on local pollen and nectar availability, which in turn may negatively affect other pollinators. This is exacerbated by the ability of honey bees to recruit foragers to highly rewarding flower patches. We measured floral resource consumption in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in 21 plots located at different distances from apiaries in the scrubland of Garraf Natural Park (Barcelona), and related these measures to visitation rates of honey bees, bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and other pollinators. In the same plots, we measured flower density, and used pan traps to characterize the wild bee community. Flower resource consumption was largely explained by honey bee visitation and marginally by bumblebee visitation. After accounting for flower density, plots close to apiaries had lower wild bee biomass. This was due to a lower abundance of large bee species, those more likely to be affected by honey bee competition. We conclude that honey bees are the main contributors to pollen/nectar consumption of the two main flowering plants in the scrubland, and that at the densities currently occurring in the park (3.5 hives/km2) the wild bee community is being affected. Our study supports the hypothesis that high honey bee densities may have an impact on other pollinators via competition for flower resources. © 2015 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","2-s2.0-84949476555"

They differ from one another in time of bract opening (which determines when the flowers are pollinated), amount of resin (the pollinator attractant) secreted and the position of the flowers relative to the gland which secretes the resin. As a consequence of these differences, D. scandens is pollinated by euglossine bees and D. cissifolia is pollinated by Hypanthidium nr. panamense (Megachilidae). In the vicinity of Manaus, Brazil, a different ecotype of D. scandens occurs sympatrically with D. affinis. Here S. scandens differs from its sympatric congener in time of bract opening, amount of resin secreted and position of flowers in the inflorescence. As a consequence, D. scandens and D. affinis are pollinated by different bees; however, near Manaus D. scandens is pollinated by Hypanthidium nr. melanopterum and D. affinis is pollinated by euglossine bees. The differences in polination systems between members of these pairs of sympatric species may reduce interspecific pollen flow and competition for pollinators. The 2 ecotypes of D. scandens differ from one another in relatively minor floral characters, yet exhibit divergent pollination relationships. These differences may have arisen as a result of disruptive selection resulting from occurrence with different congeners. These evolutionary processes may have occurred elsewhere in the genus and could account for some of the diversity of floral characters exhibited by species of Dalechampia.-from Authors","2-s2.0-0020387710"

However, its physiological function remains to be elucidated. Our results showed that Pru p 3 usually carries a lipid ligand that play an essential role in its function in plants. Using ESI-qToF, we observed that the ligand was a derivative of camptothecin binding to phytosphingosine, wich that is inserted into the hydrophobic tunnel of the protein. In addition, the described ligand displayed topoisomerase I activity inhibition and self-fluorescence, both recognized as camptothecin properties.

Nonetheless, data showing effects of insect visit patterns and intensity of mutualistic and/or antagonistic plant-insect interactions on plant reproduction over structured ecological gradients remain scarce. We investigated how changes in flower-visitor abundance, identity and behaviour over a forest-open habitat gradient affect plant biotic interactions, and quantitative and qualitative fitness in the edge-specialist Dianthus balbisii. Composition and behaviour of the insects visiting flowers of D. balbisii strongly varied over the study gradient, influencing strength and patterns of plant biotic interactions (i.e. herbivory and pollination likelihood). Seed set comparison in free- and manually pollinated flowers suggested spatial variations in the extent of quantitative pollen limitation, which appeared more pronounced at the gradient extremes. Such variations were congruent to patterns of flower visit and plant biotic interactions. The analyses on seed and seedling viability evidenced that spatial variation in amount and type of pollinators, and frequency of herbivory affected qualitative fitness of D. balbisii by influencing selfing and outcrossing rates. Our work emphasizes the role of plant biotic interactions as a fine-scale mediator of plant fitness in ecotones, highlighting that optimal plant reproduction can take place into a restricted interval of the ecological gradients occurring at forest edges.

Transformation was achieved using a vector that targets genes to the trnA/trnI intergenic region of the lettuce plastid genome employing the aadA gene as a selectable marker against spectinomycin. Spectinomycin resistance and heterologous gene transcription were shown in T1 plants derived from self-pollinated primary regenerants demonstrating transmission of the plastid-encoded transgene to the first seed generation. Crossing with male sterile wild-type lettuce showed that spectinomycin resistance was not transmitted via pollen.

In this study, the influence of landscape simplification on the composition of pollinator communities and the provisioning of pollination services to cultivated strawberry was evaluated (Fragaria×ananassa). Additionally the relative pollination efficiency for the five most common bee genera visiting strawberry flowers was measured. Pollinators were collected during bloom with pan traps on 14 commercial farms all growing the same strawberry variety in the Finger Lakes Region, NY, USA. The farms were chosen to represent a gradient in the proportion of agricultural land uses in the surrounding landscape from 0.09 to 0.60. Landscapes with greater proportions of agricultural area had lower pollinator abundances and species richness. While yield was positively correlated with pollinator abundance, species richness had little effect on the level of pollination services. This conclusion was supported by the finding that visitor identity did not explain pollination efficiency in strawberry. Our results show that a high proportion of agricultural land in the landscape negatively impacts wild pollinators and pollination services to strawberry. © 2015.","2-s2.0-84930638666"

The salt tolerance, which was the highest in the RCG clones and their next generation for the plants collected from the site beside the reservoir, decreased with increasing distance from the reservoir. Under saline water culture conditions, Na and free-proline contents in shoots, K content in shoots and roots, water potential of leaves and plasmalemma ATPase activity of roots increased in the RCG clones and their next generation along with a higher salt tolerance. In conclusion, responses to saline conditions were similar between the RCG clones and the next generation that were cross-pollinated. It was considered that, even within a confined range of the grassland, salt-tolerant RCG plants that had adapted to the urine-contaminated soils were selected, and that high salt tolerance was genetically controlled. It appears likely that the maintenance of the water potential and K-absorbing function under NaCl stress contributed to the high salt tolerance. © 2006 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","2-s2.0-33644759415"
"961","Using the response-effect trait framework to disentangle the effects of agricultural intensification on the provision of ecosystem services by Mediterranean arable plants","2017","Agricultural intensification structures arable plant communities, including shifts in species assemblages and trait distributions, which affect the provision of ecosystem services. We used a response-effect trait framework to characterize the impact of agricultural intensification on two ecosystem services delivered by arable plants to pollinator and non-pollinator insects and birds. Agricultural intensification was characterized by field position as a gradient of the impact of crop management at field scale and the surrounding landscape heterogeneity, which can be divided into compositional and configurational heterogenenity. Shifts in functional assemblages of response and effect traits were analyzed by multivariate analyses, whereas changes in single trait metrics were analyzed by mixed-model effects. At field scale, we found a trade-off between ruderal and competitive species. The contrasting disturbance regime from boundaries to inner-fields overflows the potential shifts in functional assemblages both for response and effect traits due to the gradient of landscape heterogeneity. Conversely, some response and effect single trait metrics changed along gradients of landscape heterogeneity. We thus propose a response-effect trait framework to capture functional relationships along different trophic levels. Compositional heterogeneity affected traits linked to the provision of suitable habitat for insects and birds, whereas configurational heterogeneity affected traits linked to pollination. Incorporating this framework into decision-making processes may help to focus conservation efforts on maintaining the delivery of ecosystem services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85029492737"
"12372","Ambient temperature influences Australian native stingless bee (Trigona carbonaria) preference for warm nectar","2010","The interaction between flowers and insect pollinators is an important aspect of the reproductive mechanisms of many plant species. Several laboratory and field studies indicate that raising flower temperature above ambient can be an advantage in attracting pollinators. Here we demonstrate that this preference for warmer flowers is, in fact, contextdependent. Using an Australian native bee as a model, we demonstrate for the first time a significant shift in behaviour when the ambient temperature reaches 34°C, at which point bees prefer ambient temperature nectar over warmer nectar. We then use thermal imaging techniques to show warmer nectar maintains the flight temperature of bees during the period of rest on flowers at lower ambient temperatures but the behavioural switch is associated with the body temperature rising above that maintained during flight. These findings suggest that flower-pollinator interactions are dependent upon ambient temperature and may therefore alter in different thermal environments. © 2010 Norgate et al.","2-s2.0-77957809537"

A new species of Tridactyle (Vandeae, Epidendroideae, Orchidaceae) from Gabon and Equatorial Guinea","2015","Nine plants specimens of an apparently new Tridactyle species were collected in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. They have an erect habit and a particular leaf shape which makes the species unique in the genus. The flowers and inflorescences share the general morphology of Tridactyle tridactylites, one of the most frequently collected species of Tridactyle in Central Africa. Four other Tridactyle taxa possess a 3 to 6 cm long inflorescence and a labellum with entire side lobes, and one species, Tridactyle stevartiana, has leaves of similar width and length. We here show that these new 9 specimens represent a new species, described as Tridactyle minutifolia. The diagnostic traits include linear thin leaves, and erect habit. Interestingly, many specimens of Tridactyle minutifolia lack spur; this phenomenon is sometimes found in orchids growing in an environment where their pollinators are absent.

"17489","Hybridization between wild and domesticated types of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae) in Argentina","2006","A polymorphic population of Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. aborigineus (Burkart) Baudet growing in northwestern Argentina was studied. In order to know the origin of this polymorphism, plants belonging to the var. aborigineus, others showing floral dimorphism and individuals with weedy type characters were collected. Their seeds, obtained after fieldwork treatments of autogamy and free pollination in order to know their reproductive system, were sown in a greenhouse. Information of their growth was recorded and several numerical analyses were performed. With the results obtained, we concluded that those individuals that showed floral dimorphism are probably a result of hybridization and/or introgression between the var. aborigineus and cultivated forms that grow in the area. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of divergent segregation in the offspring. Also, the offspring of the F1 was followed and allowed us to conclude the possible existence of degeneration of the hybrid progeny. This degeneration indicates that an unwanted gene flow in the area could lead to a decline in the wild bean population. The vigour and high reproductive success of the offspring belonging to the individuals corresponding to the var. aborigineus, whose progenitor was treated for outcrossing, and the existence of plants with weedy type characteristics, are indicative of the necessity to preserve this germplasm in order to evaluate its agronomic potential as brief as possible.

"27334","Size distribution and coning behaviour of the Australian cycad Lepidozamia peroffskyana","1989","Leaf numbers as an estimate of sexual maturity and presence of current and previous season's cones were determined for individuals sampled in two populations of Lepidozamia peroffskyana near Dorrigo and Sealy Lookout, New South Wales, Australia. Average leaf numbers of known males and females were not significantly different. Average leaf numbers of plants showing no evidence of coning were lower than for coning individuals, suggesting that both populations contain substantial numbers of immature plants. About half the plants in both populations were putatively mature, but only 12% of such individuals in the Dorrigo population bore current season's cones compared with 51% in the Lookout population; 28% of the Dorrigo plants and 5% of the Lookout plants showed evidence of prior coning. Thus, in each population, not all mature plants produce cones during a given reproductive episode. The proportion that does so appears to vary from year to year. Cone production by individuals of each sex appears to be separated by several?year intervals. The few plants with current season's cones in the Dorrigo population prevented determining a phenotypic sex ratio there, but for the Lookout population it was not statistically different from 1:1 male:female. The weevil Tranes lyterioides was abundant on two male cones that were entering the pollination phase in the Lookout population, suggesting that it may be involved in the pollination of this cycad.

"11831","Nocturnal mammals, diurnal lizards, and the pollination ecology of the cryptic flowering Acrotriche serrulata (Ericaceae)","2011","Acrotriche serrulata exhibits a complex and uncommon form of flowering. It starts with a male-phase flower that shows secondary pollen presentation on the perianth and follows with a female phase after the corolla is removed or abscissed. We examined the potential for insects, lizards, and mammals to act as pollinators. Observations and experiments on breeding system, phenology, floral scent, flower visitors, and lizard feeding were undertaken in southern Australia. Acrotriche serrulata sets little fruit by autonomous selfing but readily sets fruit after facilitated geitonogamy and xenogamy. Flower anthesis is diurnal and nocturnal. The nectar profile includes acetaldehyde, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. The nocturnal mammals Trichosurus vulpecula and the introduced Rattus rattus were the only visitors observed to actively forage on the flowers. In contrast, the skinks Egernia whitii, Niveoscincus ocellatus, and Niveoscincus metallicus routinely passed flowers full of nectar and foraged only on those presented during feeding observations. Insects visited the flowers but did not behave as pollinators. Acrotriche serrulata is likely to be pollinated by nocturnal mammals attracted to its flowers by scent. Effective pollinators appear to be rare over some of its range. This may have implications for the long-term reproductive success and conservation of A. serrulata. © 2011 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-79951520395"

Few data exist to test the prediction that this floral syndrome pattern reflects an important role for hawkmoth pollination in the evolution and ecology of these orchids. The pollination biology of five aerangoid orchid species (Rangaeris amaniensis, Aerangis brachycarpa, A. confusa, A. thomsonii, and A. kotschyana) was investigated in Kenya. Four of these have long spurs (>10 cm) and were pollinated by Agrius convolvuli and Coelonia fulvinotata. Aerangis confusa, which has relatively short spurs (ca. 4 cm), was pollinated by the short-tongued hawkmoths Hippotion celerio and Daphnis nerii. Nectar frequently filled the entire spur in some of the study species, even at anthesis. Sugar concentration of the nectar of four species was found to vary from ca. 1% at the mouth of the spur to 20% at the tip. Gradients were expressed more strongly in species with long, straight spurs. Species with spirally twisted spurs showed both steep and shallow nectar gradients. These gradients, previously unknown in plants, may function as a ""sugar trail,"" enticing longtongued hawkmoths to probe deeply into spurs without incurring the cost of filling an entire spur with concentrated nectar. In addition, the most concentrated nectar is kept out of reach of short-tongued pollinators.","2-s2.0-34250787142"
"15085","Uncoupled geographical variation between leaves and flowers in a south-Andean proteaceae","2008"," Background and Aims: Geographical variation in foliar and floral traits and their degree of coupling can provide relevant information on the relative importance of abiotic, biotic and even neutral factors acting at geographical scales as generators of evolutionary novelty. Geographical variation was studied in leaves and flowers of Embothrium coccineum, a species that grows along abrupt environmental gradients and exhibits contrasting pollinator assemblages in the southern Andes.  Methods: Five foliar and eight floral morphological characters were considered from 32 populations, and their patterns of variation and covariation were analysed within and among populations, together with their relationship with environmental variables, using both univariate and multivariate methods. The relationships between foliar and floral morphological variation and geographical distance between populations were compared with Mantel permutation tests.  Key Results: Leaf and flower traits were clearly uncoupled within populations and weakly associated among populations. Whereas geographical variation in foliar traits was mostly related to differences in precipitation associated with geographical longitude, variation in floral traits was not.  Conclusions: These patterns suggest that leaves and flowers responded to different evolutionary forces, environmental (i.e. rainfall) in the case of leaves, and biotic (i.e. pollinators) or genetic drift in the case of flowers. This study supports the view that character divergence at a geographical scale can be moulded by different factors acting in an independent fashion. © The Author 2008.

With over 124,000 described species, and countless more awaiting discovery, they are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth. This series of ten papers explores the diversity of Diptera. Several authors describe the diversity of dipteran lifestyles and behaviours, both as larvae and adults. They also reveal the various roles that these animals play in the ecological interactions of the planetcountless numbers of flies feed on plants, control pest arthropods (including other flies!), break down rotting vegetation and excrement, pollinate flowers, provide food for other species, and of course, spread diseases. Indeed, because of their role as vectors of disease, flies have almost single-handedly prevented the economic development of countries in tropical Africa and South America. But flies are used in positive ways by humans, too, and several authors describe their use in forensic science, molecular research, and even as main attractions in the tourism industry. The intent of this series of papers is to encourage a broader interest in Diptera that, ideally, will lead to further research and conservation efforts. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84975155329"

"6317","Evaluating the Interacting influences of pollination, seed predation, invasive species and isolation on reproductive success in a threatened alpine plant","2014","Reproduction in rare plants may be influenced and limited by a complex combination of factors. External threats such as invasive species and landscape characteristics such as isolation may impinge on both pollination and seed predation dynamics, which in turn can strongly affect reproduction. I assessed how patterns in floral visitation, seed predation, invasive ant presence, and plant isolation influenced one another and ultimately affected viable seed production in Haleakal? silverswords ( Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) of Hawai'i. Floral visitation was dominated by endemic Hylaeus bees, and patterns of visitation were influenced by floral display size and number of plants clustered together, but not by floral herbivory or nearest flowering neighbor distance. There was also some indication that Argentine ant presence impacted floral visitation, but contradictory evidence and limitations of the study design make this result uncertain. Degree of seed predation was associated only with plant isolation, with the two main herbivores partitioning resources such that one preferentially attacked isolated plants while the other attacked clumped plants; total seed predation was greater in more isolated plants. Net viable seed production was highly variable among individuals (0-55% seed set), and was affected mainly by nearest neighbor distance, apparently owing to low cross-pollination among plants separated by even short distances (>10-20 m). This isolation effect dominated net seed set, with no apparent influence from floral visitation rates, percent seed predation, or invasive ant presence. The measured steep decline in seed set with isolation distance may not be typical of the entire silversword range, and may indicate that pollinators in addition to Hylaeus bees could be important for greater gene flow. Management aimed at maintaining or maximizing silversword reproduction should focus on the spatial context of field populations and outplanting efforts, as well as on conserving the widest possible range of pollinator taxa. © 2014 Paul Krushelnycky.","2-s2.0-84895887447"
"27398","Reproductive correlates of mating system variation in Eichhornia paniculata (Spreng.) Solms (Pontederiaceae)","1989","Comparative studies of related plant species indicate that evolutionary shifts in mating systems are accompanied by changes in reproductive attributes such as flower size, floral morphology, and pollen/ovule ratio. Recent theoretical work suggests that patterns of investment in reproduction should also change with the mating system. In a glasshouse study, we investigated the extent to which mating system differences among populations of Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae) were correlated with changes in allocation to male and female function, floral display, and the regulation of investment in reproduction through fruit and ovule abortion. Significant differences in the amount of biomass allocated to reproductive structures were evident among six populations of E. paniculata. As predicted by sex allocation theory, the proportion of dry weight allocated to male function decreased with the outcrossing rate of populations. Six of the eight attributes used to characterize floral display also differed significantly among populations. However, with the exception of two attributes describing the number of flowers produced by inflorescences, these were not correlated with outcrossing rate. Levels of fruit and ovule abortion were determined in two populations with contrasting mating systems under different nutrient and pollination treatments. Virtually all fruits initiated by plants from a self?fertilizing population were matured, while the amount of fruit abortion in an outcrossing population increased with flower production. Ovule abortion was low in both populations. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of self?fertilization in E. paniculata is associated with changes in investment to reproduction that normally distinguish selfing and outcrossing species.

Isonuclear alloplasmic cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines with Moricandia arvensis (mori), Diplotaxis erucoides (eru), Diplotaxis berthautii (ber) cytoplasms were developed in the six diverse Brassica juncea genetic backgrounds (NPJ 112, NPJ 139, LES 1-27, SEJ 8, EC 308575 and Pusa Agarni). Each of these 18 CMS lines were crossed with six locally developed restorers possessing fertility restorer gene from Moricandia arvensis to assess the effect of sterile cytoplasms and nuclear backgrounds of parental lines (A and R) on fertility restoration. Comparison of 108 single cross hybrids, 36 hybrids in each cytoplasm, revealed that the hybrids based on mori cytoplasm was significantly different from the ones possessing ber and eru cytoplasms for mean percent pollen fertility. Further, paired comparisons of the mean per cent pollen fertility of hybrids revealed that the per cent pollen fertility in hybrids was influenced by the genetic backgrounds of parents. However, this effect was not consistent for any cytoplasm or nuclear background of parents. Regression analyses involving percent pollen fertility and seed set in the hybrids, both under open and self pollinated conditions, did not observe any significant association.

Seventeen of those hybrids were more vigorous than either parent. The most common chromosome association at metaphase I was 18 bivalents plus 5 univalents. At anaphase I and telophase I laggards, fragments, and unequal chromosome distribution were observed. Fifteen of 17 interspecific hybrids reproduced by facultative apomixis, one was sexual and one was an obligate apomict. Ovules with aposporous embryo sacs ranged from 1 to 93%in facultative apomictic plants. Morphological characteristics and chromosome numbers of open-pollinated progeny from the apomictic interspecific hybrid were identical to those of the seed parent indicating obligate apomictic reproduction.

There are individuals with flowers where anthers and stigma are at the same height but the rule is variable herkogamy, the most common type (75%) being that with an exerted stigma. Self- and cross-tubes did not differ in their capability to reach the ovary (t = -0.67, P &lt; 0.53); they had a high growth rate (6.95 ± 2.28 mm h-1). There is not autogamy but mostly self-incompatibility. Fruits from controlled cross-pollination showed the highest seed set and seed viability. The nectar sugar is characterized by a similar amount of glucose and fructose, and by the absence of sucrose. Although nectar secretion was continuous throughout the life of the flower, most nectar was secreted during the first 24 h after flower opening. Nectar production costs appear to be lower than in other species since nectar secretion is neither inhibited after a removal (i.e. a pollinator visit) nor reabsorbed as the flower ages. Sphingids visit the flowers mainly after midnight. They insert their proboscis down to the base of the corolla tube to reach the nectar. The upper limit to fruit production is set by pollinator visits. Fruits produced from open-pollinated flowers are often predated by numerous larvae (mainly lepidopteran ones). Considering that this species is mostly self-incompatible and pollination is limited, that each plant displays only a low number of flowers throughout the flowering season, and that there is a high rate of fruit predation, it is not surprising that fruits of J. integrifolia are so rare.","2-s2.0-0034495774"

When plants from the different lines were manipulated so that they appeared to be a single plant, 69.5% of honey bees remained constant to the line visited.

Fresh weight was more in the pollinated group 4-12 days after anthesis (DAA) in both winter and spring, and 2-6 DAA in the summer. In winter, mitotic index increased from anthesis to 2 DAA and then decreased gradually in the pollinated group but immediately after anthesis in the non-pollinated group.

"4510","Spatial dynamics of pollination in dioecious Shepherdia canadensis (Elaeagnaceae)","2015","The immobility of plants and the need for third-party vectors to enact pollen transfer render pollination an inherently spatial process. Little is known about the spatial scales over which pollen transfer and plant reproductive success are dependent on mate availability in natural plant populations. Dioecious plants provide useful study systems for examining the dependence of reproductive success on spatial patterns of mate availability because potential pollen donors and recipients are unambiguous. We examined the spatial dynamics of pollination in the dioecious shrub Shepherdia canadensis (L.) Nutt. (Elaeagnaceae) at a range of spatial scales in Ivvavik National Park, Canada. On average, males occurred at higher frequencies than females across ten study sites with at least 60 S. canadensis plants per site. Although we detected substantial variation in sex ratios across sites, there was no association between sex ratio and fruit set. Instead, patterns of fruit set were significantly correlated with male density within sites, over distances of 46 m. The density of females and males was spatially cross correlated. Therefore, density effects appear to be driven by pollinator responses to the overall density of shrubs. A pollinator exclusion experiment indicated that syrphid flies (Family: Syrphidae) were the most important pollinators in these populations. This study demonstrates that female reproductive success in S. canadensis is limited by plant density over small spatial scales, corresponding with the short foraging distances characteristic of its fly pollinators. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84951568664"

We collected pollen from the fur of 192 individuals throughout the year from April 2004 to March 2005. We recorded pollen from nine plant species of eight families and found five unidentified pollen types, with the highest pollen species richness recorded in June. A. jamaicensis moved pollen of Erythrina standleyana and Mimosa bahamensis, which have not hitherto been reported as visited by this species. The most abundant pollen in the samples was found to be that of three tree species: Ceiba pentandra, C.aesculifolia and Lysiloma latisiliquum. Very few samples contained pollen in the rainy season, when the bats fed mainly on fruits. A. jamaicensis can fly several kilometres among foraging locations and dispersed large amounts of pollen from tree species growing near cenotes as well as those not present at cenotes but occurring in other forest fragments, highlighting its importance as a pollen vector among forest fragments in the largely deforested landscape of the Yucatan Peninsula, helping to reduce the negative effects of forest fragmentation.

Data from the survey was used to classify production systems and management intensities among watermelon producers. Cluster analysis was used to identify the most closely associated of 24 abiotic and biotic variables affecting productivity. Five clusters were identified each year, or when data were pooled across years. Cluster I combined factors of grower experience, crop rotation, fertilization, and cultivation (mechanical weed control). Cluster II combined factors of cultivar ploidy, black plastic mulch, irrigation frequency, hoeing frequency, row arrangement, pollination, and planting method. Close distances among components implied that these two clusters had the strongest associations; indicating that two primary production systems exist. To measure management intensity of these production systems, a method was developed by: (1) partitioning four economic categories as machinery, labor, supply, and risk for each survey variable; (2) assigning weight scores of 0 or 1 to each category; and (3) summing the weight scores across economic categories for all factors involved in each production system. The most commonly used production system (50%) consisted of Cluster I, which was considered of intermediate management intensity with scores 12 and 36. The production system considered as high management intensity with scores 36 was rarely used, but always combined components within Clusters I and II. This is the first attempt to describe complete production systems for watermelon in terms of analytical methods and measurements of crop management intensity.","2-s2.0-67650074802"

"24797","The comparative biology of pollination and mating in flowering plants","1996","The diversification of many flowering plant families has been attributed to adaptive radiation of pollination and mating systems accompanying changes in ecology and life history. Reproductive traits in seed plant therefore provide a potentially rich source of diversity for comparative and phylogenetic studies. Here we address three topics in reproductive biology: floral allocation strategies, mating systems and life history, and the origin complex reproductive syndromes using various comparative methods. Results from these studies generally complement and inform those obtained from previous micoevolutionary work at the population level. Historical inferences concerning reproductive character evolution in some taxa can be hampered by topological uncertainties in tree reconstruction and a lack of resolution in molecular phylogenies. Future insights into the ecology and evolution of plant reproductive adaptations using comparative approaches will require well resolved phylogenies, particularly at the species level.","2-s2.0-0030435238"
"29683","Studies on the ecology and biology of a cocoa pollinator, Forcipomyia squamipennis I. & M. (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae), in Ghana","1975","From field observations and laboratory rearings, the biology of Forcipomyia squamipennis I. & M. in cocoa plantations in Ghana was established as follows. Adult midges are found between buttresses of large shade trees, in crevices of decayed old logs, in hollow tree stumps and cocoa husk heaps. Swarming takes place at any time during the day in or around the resting place, while dispersal occurs in the early morning and in the late afternoon, the normal flight range being 56 m. The largest populations occur in the rainy season. Eggs are laid on moist decomposing wood, cocoa husks and other plant debris in batches of 4090; the larvae hatch in 23 days and pupate after four moults, when about 12 days old; the pupal stage lasts 23 days. Adult females require liquid plant food for survival and oviposition, although the maturation of ova is independent of adult food intake or mating; unfertilised eggs do not develop. The maximum adult life span for both sexes is eight days in captivity. F. squamipennis undergoes at least 12 generations a year. Due to its abundance and continuous breeding in cocoa plantations, F. squamipennis is probably the most important Ceratopogonid cocoa pollinator in Ghana. Both sexes are efficient pollinators, but four times more males than females visit cocoa flowers. © 1975, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-84922365595"
"24795","Some cytological, ecological and evolutionary aspects of pollination","1996","Different types of pollen dispersing units are described. The pollen of angiosperms may be dispersed in monads, tetrads, polyads, massulae or compact pollinia. The monads and tetrads may form larger clumps of pollen with the aid of the following substances: a) pollenkitt, a product of in situ degeneration of the tapetum; b) tryphine, a product of tapetal extra situm degeneration, found only in Cruciferae; c) elastoviscin, a highly viscous product of the degeneration of a limited number of tapetal cells, found only in certain Orchidaceae; d) viscin threads or sporopollenin filaments arising from the pollen exine. The number of pollen grains composing the clumps depends on pollen diameter and the cohesive forces holding the pollen grains together. The various types of pollen dispersing unit are discussed in relation to the type of pollination and number of ovules per ovary.","2-s2.0-0030489020"
"26613","Pollination drop in relation to cone morphology in Podocarpaceae: a novel reproductive mechanism","1991","Observation of ovulate cones at the time of pollination in the Podocarpaceae demonstrates a distinctive method of pollen capture, involving an extended pollination drop. Ovules in all genera of the family are orthotropous and single within the axil of each fertile bract. In Microstrobus and Phyllocladus ovules are erect (the micropyle directed away from the cone axis) and are not associated with an ovule-supporting structure. Pollen in these two genera must land directly on the pollination drop in the way usual for gymnosperms. In all other genera, the ovule is inverted (the micropyle is directed toward the cone axis) and supported by a specialized ovule-supporting structure. In Saxegothaea there is no pollination drop and gametes are delivered to the ovule by pollen tube growth. Pollination drops were observed in seven of the remaining genera. Increased pollination efficiency may relate to the reduction of ovule number in each cone, often to one in many genera. Animal dispersal of large seeds may be the ultimate adaptive driving force that has generated the need for greater pollination efficiency. -from Authors","2-s2.0-0026342334"

The pollen tube growth between the ovules seems directed and the pollen tubes do find the inner integument. A reaction to the inner integument or the micropyle is observed, but rarely results in ovule penetration. Attempts to activate the ovules did not increase the percentage penetration. Only grafting a style with pollen tubes to the placenta gave a 5-fold increase. The low penetration percentage after placental pollination seems to have its basis in an inability of the pollen tubes to react to signals from the micropyle. The poor results from placental pollination and grafted style pollination are compared mutually and with those from the routinely used cut-style pollination technique in order to give more insight in the processes that attract the pollen tubes to the micropyles. © 1993.","2-s2.0-38249006789"
"23147","Reproductive behaviour and incompatibility in 'stella' sweet cherry","1998","Most sweet cherries express gametophytic self-incompatibility controlled by alleles of the S gene. 'Stella' is self-fertile and is heterozygous for the mutant S4' allele. Thus, 'Stella' is semi-compatible when selfed. Heterozygotes and S4'S4' homozygotes were expected to segregate in the ratio 2:1. Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (GOT) isoenzymes have previously been shown to be linked to the 5 gene in cherry. 'Stella' is heterozygous, be, for GOT and, after selfing, resultant progeny would be expected to segregate for heterozygous to homozygous genotypes in a ratio of 2:1, with the homozygote being bb or cc, depending on which allele was linked to the S4' allele. Isoenzyme analysis of seedlings from the selfing of 'Stella' revealed a deficiency of GOT homozygotes; all the progeny had the heterozygous genotype be. This indicated that S4'S4' homozygotes had not been formed, suggesting S4' pollen was still being recognised. Controlled pollinations combined with fluorescence microscopy provided evidence that the incompatibility genotype of 'Stella' is S 4S4'and that ovarian rather than stylar recognition/inhibition of S4' pollen tubes occurred.","2-s2.0-0008033904"
"10744","Effects of a nonnative, invasive lovegrass on Agave palmeri distribution, abundance, and insect pollinator communities","2011","Nonnative Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) has invaded large areas of the Southwestern United States, and its impact on native plants is not fully understood. Palmer's agave (Agave palmeri), an important resource for many pollinators, is a key native plant potentially threatened by E. lehmanniana. Understanding potential impacts of E. lehmanniana on A. palmeri is critical for anticipating the future of the desert community where they coexist and for addressing management concerns about associated threatened and endangered species. Our study provides strong indications that E. lehmanniana negatively impacts A. palmeri in several ways. Areas of high E. lehmanniana abundance were associated with significantly lower densities and greater relative frequencies of small A. palmeri, suggesting that E. lehmanniana may exclude A. palmeri. There were no significant differences in species richness, abundance, or community composition when comparing flower associates associated with A. palmeri in areas of high and low E. lehmanniana abundance. However, we did find significantly lower connectedness within the pollination network associated with A. palmeri in areas with high E. lehmanniana abundance. Although E. lehmanniana forms thick stands that would presumably increase fire frequency, there was no significant association between E. lehmanniana and fire frequency. Interestingly, medium to high densities of A. palmeri were associated with areas of greater fire frequency. The complex ramifications of E. lehmanniana invasion for the long-lived A. palmeri and interlinked desert community warrant continued study, as these species are likely to continue to be found in close association due to their similar soil preferences. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Annatto (Bixa orellana) is a buzz-pollinated neotropical tree. We compared the pollination service provided by AHBs and native Melipona beecheii (Mb) to annatto in the Yucatan. As a result of the different abilities of both species to sonicate, a prediction of the present study is that AHBs on individual visits would result in less efficient pollinators on this crop. A higher frequency of AHBs on flowers (73.8%) compared with Mb (21.3%) was found. However, AHBs deposited significantly less pollen on the stigma and produced less fruits, with fewer seeds and weight, than Mb. A higher pollination index efficiency was obtained for Mb (0.9) compared with AHBs (0.6). AHBs did not sonicate annatto and gleaned the pollen released after Mb visits, which suggests that they act as commensals of the latter. By acting as commensals, AHBs, despite their high abundance, appear to marginally contribute to the pollination of annatto. Studies conducted under scenarios with a differential abundance of AHBs and efficient sonicating species are necessary to test this hypothesis on annatto and other buzz-pollinated plants in the neotropics. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society","2-s2.0-85007048964"

It was found that A. ovata produced enough seeds for the propagation of the plant by seeding, that the seed production was, however, closely related to the flowering phenology, and that the seed production of the 1 year old plants was less than that of the 2 year old plants, because the flowering period of the 1 year old plants was one month later than that of the 2 year old plants. It was also found that, when isolated from any pollinater during the flowering period, A. ovata produced only a few seeds, and that, however, when artificial pollination was performed, the isolated A. ovata, produced many seeds. The results strongly suggest that A. ovata requires cross fertilization.","2-s2.0-0026700527"

"14905","Cockroaches as pollinators of Clusia aff. sellowiana (Clusiaceae) on inselbergs in French Guiana","2008"," Background and Aims: A report is made on a new species of Clusia related to C. sellowiana that dominates the vegetation of the Nouragues inselberg in French Guiana. The focus is on the pollination biology and on the remarkable relationship of this plant species to Amazonina platystylata, its cockroach pollinator. This appears to be only the second record of pollination by cockroaches.  Methods: Pollination ecology was investigated by combining morphological studies, field observations and additional experiments. Floral scent was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The role of acetoin, the major component of the scent of this species of Clusia, in attracting pollinators was examined in field attraction experiments. The ability of cockroaches to perceive acetoin was investigated by electroantennography (EAG).  Key Results: The Clusia species studied produces seeds only sexually. Its nocturnal flowers are visited by crickets, ants, moths and cockroaches. A species of cockroach, Amazonina platystylata, is the principal pollinator. The reward for the visit is a liquid secretion produced by tissues at the floral apex and at the base of the ovary. Although the cockroaches have no structures specialized for pollen collection, their body surface is rough enough to retain pollen grains. The cockroaches show significant EAG reactions to floral volatiles and acetoin, suggesting that the floral scent is a factor involved in attracting the cockroaches to the flowers.  Conclusions: The results suggest that the plant-cockroach interaction may be quite specialized and the plant has probably evolved a specific strategy to attract and reward its cockroach pollinators. Acetoin is a substance involved in the chemical communication of several other cockroach species and it seems plausible that the plant exploits the sensitivity of cockroaches to this compound to attract them to the flowers as part of the pollination syndrome of this species. © The Author 2008.

The dwarf honeybee Apis florea L. was the most abundant flower visitor and comprised more than 94% of flower visiting insects. Commencement of flight activity occurred when a minimum threshold of environmental variables was surpassed, while cessation was governed mainly by declining values of light intensity and radiation. In between commencement and cessation, the foraging population correlated significantly and positively with air temperature, light intensity, solar radiation and nectar-sugar concentration and negatively with relative humidity. Path coefficient analysis, however, revealed that the direct effect of temperature was high and positive followed by light intensity and solar radiation while the direct effect of relative humidity was high and negative. The direct effect of nectar-sugar concentration was negative and negligible. Path coefficient analysis gave a more comprehensive picture of effects than did simple correlation analysis.

"20495","Geographic structure and dynamics of coevolutionary selection","2002","Coevolution of species is one of the major processes organizing the Earth's biodiversity. Recent coevolutionary theory has indicated that the geographic structure of species has the potential to impose powerful and continuing effects on coevolutionary dynamics, if that structure creates selection mosaics and coevolutionary hotspots across landscapes. Here we confirm that current coevolutionary selection in interspecific interactions can be highly divergent across both narrow and broad geographic scales, thereby fuelling continuing coevolution of taxa. Study of a widespread plant-insect interaction across a broad range of habitats for several years showed that an insect functioning both as a pollinator and a floral parasite can be strongly mutualistic in some habitats but commensal or antagonistic in neighbouring habitats. The results for one of the habitats span seven years, demonstrating that the local structure of coevolutionary selection can remain stable across multiple generations. Conservation of the evolutionary processes maintaining long-term biological diversity may require preservation of the conditions that allow a long-term shifting geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots.","2-s2.0-0037071852"
"27781","Reproductive success, spontaneous embryo abortion, and genetic load in flowering plants","1987","Reproductive success is divided into two phases: preemergent (the number of viable seeds that enter the ambient environment) and postemergent (the percentage of progeny that survive to reproduce). We studied preemergent reproductive success (PERS) in flowering plants by measuring the fruit/flower (Fr/Fl) ratio and the seed/ovule (S/O) ratio in a number of species of outcrossing and inbreeding plants, where PERS=the product of (Fr/Fl) and (S/O). In order to determine the influence of the ambient environment (including resource availability) we studied pairs of outcrossing and inbreeding species occurring in the same habitat. Among outcrossing species PERS averaged about 22%, whereas in inbreeding species the average was approximately 90%. The progeny/zygote (P/Z) ratio was studied in hand-pollinated populations in Epilobium angustifolium (a strongly outcrossing species) from populations in Oregon and Utah, by direct observation of embryogenesis at twoday intervals throughout the course of seed development. The P/Z ratio in both populations averaged near 30%, and the developing embryos showed a surprising array of abnormalities that resulted in embryo death. During early development >95% of the ovules had normally developing globular embryos, but beginning with differentiation (cotyledon formation) about 70% of the original globular embryos aborted during the course of embryogenesis and seed development. The clustering of developmental lethals during peroids of major differentiation events parallels the animal model of development. We found little evidence that PERS was limited by the ambient environment (including resource availability), pollination, or factors associated with the inbreeding habit. Instead, PERS was found to be inextricably linked to outcrossing plants, whose breeding systems promote genetic variability. The high incidence of developmental lethals in E. angustifolium and the resulting low P/Z ratio (ca. 30%) is attributed to genetic load (any lethal mutation or allelic combination) possibly working in combination with developmental selection (interovarian competition among genetically diverse embryos). Examples of maternally controlled, fixed patterns of ovule abortion with respect to position or number are discussed. However, we found no need to employ ""female choice"" as a hypothesis to explain our results for the extensive, seemingly random patterns of embryo abortion in E. angustifolium and other outcrossing species. A more parsimonious, mechanistic explanation based on genetic load-developmental selection is sufficient to account for the differential survivorship of embryos. Likewise, the traditional concept of a positive growth regulator feedback system based on the number of surviving ovules in an ovary can account for subsequent fruit survivorship. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-0023470939"
"22758","Allergy to parietaria officinalis pollen","1999","Purietaria pollen allergens (officinalis, judaica, lusitanica, creatica) are one of the most common causes of pollinosis in the Mediterranean (Spain, France, Italy, and Croatia). Parietaria has very long period of pollination, often reaching peaks of more than 500 grains/m3 of air at the beginning of June, and very strong allergenic properties. There is a significantly positive correlation for the newcomers between the intensity of the skin test reaction and concentration of specific serum IgE with the length of residence in the area, whereas autochthonous patients show a negative correlation between the age and intensity of hypersensitivity. This suggests that the environment encountered at birth may have a decisive role in the development of allergic respiratory diseases. Due to structurally similar pollen antigens in different Parietaria species, they are all equally useful in diagnosis and treatment of allergy, regardless of the pollen species to which the patient is sensitive or the prevalent species in the area. In our hands, specific immunotherapy with subcutaneous injections of partially purified, characterized, and standardized pollen extract of Parietaria allergen proved effective. It was possible to define an optimal maintenance dose of antigen per injection. During (years of) therapy, we observed an initial increase in total serum IgE concentration and increase in allergen-specific serum IgG blocking antibodies, decrease in allergen-specific serum IgE concentration and amount of histamine released from peripheral blood leukocytes challenged in vitro with the allergen, as well as in symptom and additional medication scores.","2-s2.0-0032904841"
"23451","Three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase genes regulated by primary and secondary pollination signals in orchid flowers","1998","The temporal and spatial expression patterns of three 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase genes were investigated in pollinated orchid (Phalaenopsis spp.) flowers. Pollination signals initiate a cascade of development events in multiple floral organs, including the induction of ethylene biosynthesis, which coordinates several postpollination developmental responses. The initiation and propagation of ethylene biosynthesis is regulated by the coordinated expression of three distinct ACC synthase genes in orchid flowers. One ACC synthase gene (Phal-ACS1) is regulated by ethylene and participates in amplification and interorgan transmission of the pollination signal, as we have previously described in a related orchid genus. Two additional ACC synthase genes (Phal-AC52 and Phal-ACS3) are expressed primarily in the stigma and ovary of pollinated orchid flowers. Phal-AC52 mRNA accumulated in the stigma within 1 h after pollination, whereas Phal-ACS1 mRNA was not detected until 6 h after pollination. Similar to the expression of Phal-ACS2, the Phal-ACS3 gene was expressed within 2 h after pollination in the ovary. Exogenous application of auxin, but not ACC, mimicked pollination by stimulating a rapid increase in ACC synthase activity in the stigma and ovary and inducing Phal-ACS2 and Phal-ACS3 mRNA accumulation in the stigma and ovary, respectively. These results provide the basis for an expanded model of interorgan regulation of three ACC synthase genes that respond to both primary (Phal-ACS2 and PhalACS3) and secondary (Phal-ACS1) pollination signals.","2-s2.0-0031757702"

Pollen-mediated gene flow to related species and conventional triticale varieties is one pathway for transgene movement. A tier 1 quantification of triticale hybridization was conducted by emasculating and hand pollinating flowers under greenhouse conditions. Approximately 2000 manual pollinations were conducted for each cross and its reciprocal between two triticale genotypes: a modern triticale cultivar (AC Alta) and primary triticale (89TT108), and common wheat, durum wheat and rye. The frequency of outcrossing, hybrid seed appearance and weight, and F(1) emergence and fertility were recorded. Outcrossing, F(1) emergence and fertility rates were high from crosses between triticale genotypes. Outcrossing in inter-specific crosses was influenced by the species, and the genotype and gender of the triticale parent. In crosses to common and durum wheat where triticale was the male parent, outcrossing was > or =73.0% and > or =69.5%, respectively, but < or =23.9% and < or =3.0% when triticale was the female parent. Overall, outcrossing with rye was lower than with common and durum wheat. F(1) hybrid emergence was greater when triticale was the female parent. With the exception of a single seed, all wheat-triticale F(1) hybrid seeds were non-viable when triticale was the male parent in the cross. Only seven durum wheat-triticale F(1) hybrids emerged from 163 seeds sown, and all were produced with triticale 89TT108 as female parent.

"6312","Floral volatiles play a key role in specialized ant pollination","2014","Chemical signals emitted by plants are crucial to understand the ecology and evolution of plant-animal interactions. Scent is an important component of floral phenotype and represents a decisive communication channel between plants and floral visitors. Floral volatiles promote attraction of mutualistic pollinators and, in some cases, serve to prevent flower visitation by antagonists such as ants. Despite ant visits to flowers have been suggested to be detrimental to plant fitness, in recent years there has been a growing recognition of the positive role of ants in pollination. Nevertheless, the question of whether floral volatiles mediate mutualisms between ants and ant-pollinated plants still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the documented cases of ant pollination and investigate the chemical composition of the floral scent in the ant-pollinated plant Cytinus hypocistis. By using chemical-electrophysiological analyses and field behavioural assays, we examine the importance of olfactory cues for ants, identify compounds that stimulate antennal responses, and evaluate whether these compounds elicit behavioural responses. Our findings reveal that floral scent plays a crucial role in this mutualistic ant-flower interaction, and that only ant species that provide pollination services and not others occurring in the habitat are efficiently attracted by floral volatiles. 4-oxoisophorone, (E)-cinnamaldehyde, and (E)-cinnamyl alcohol were the most abundant compounds in Cytinus flowers, and ant antennae responded to all of them. Four ant pollinator species were significantly attracted to volatiles emitted by Cytinus inflorescences as well as to synthetic mixtures and single antennal-active compounds. The small amount of available data so far suggest that there is broad interspecific variation in floral scent composition among ant-pollinated plants, which could reflect differential responses and olfactory preferences among different ant species. Many exciting discoveries will be made as we enter into further research on chemical communication between ants and plants. © 2013 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.","2-s2.0-84892560784"
"1893","What are the most important variables for Poaceae airborne pollen forecasting?","2017","In this paper, the problem of predicting future concentrations of airborne pollen is solved through a computational intelligence data-driven approach. The proposed method is able to identify the most important variables among those considered by other authors (mainly recent pollen concentrations and weather parameters), without any prior assumptions about the phenological relevance of the variables. Furthermore, an inferential procedure based on non-parametric hypothesis testing is presented to provide statistical evidence of the results, which are coherent to the literature and outperform previous proposals in terms of accuracy. The study is built upon Poaceae airborne pollen concentrations recorded in seven different locations across the Spanish province of Madrid. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85028278678"
"19556","Improved seed yield in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) from two generations of phenotypic selection","2003","Two generations of recurrent phenotypic selection for seed yield per plant under controlled pollination were carried out to combine improved seed yield with improved forage grass performance in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Selected and unselected varieties (AberDart and AberElan respectively) and control varieties were grown for seed in pots in a glasshouse experiment and in two field plot experiments over 5 harvest years. Seed yield components and seed yield were measured. Significant improvements in seed yield of the selected AberDart over the unselected AberElan were observed both in individual plants grown in the glasshouse and in field plots. Detailed observations of the individual components of seed yield showed that the increased seed yield of AberDart can be attributed to a higher proportion of ovules forming seeds (% seedset), greater seed number per tiller and more reproductive tillers per plant. This improvement in seed yield of AberDart was also observed when it was grown in field plots with AberElan, experimental selection lines and commercial varieties. AberDart produced more seeds per tiller than the other commercial varieties and selection lines studied. The implication of this approach for the breeding of perennial ryegrass varieties that combine good agronomic performance and acceptable seed yields is discussed.","2-s2.0-0141726882"
"13243","Genetic structure and breeding system of a rare understory herb, Dysosma versipellis (Berberidaceae), from temperate deciduous forests in China","2010","To evaluate the role of Quaternary refugial isolation in allopatric (incipient) speciation of East Asian temperate forest biotas, we analyzed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and the breeding system in Dysosma versipellis. The study revealed that D. versipellis is mostly self-incompatible, genetically highly subdivided and depauperate at the population level (e.g., ? ST =0.572/ H E = 0.083), and characterized by a low pollen-to-seed migration ratio (r ? 4.0). The latter outcome likely reflects limited pollen flow in a low-seed disperser whose hypothesized ""sapromyophilous"" flowers undergo scarce, inefficient, and likely specialized cross-pollination by small Anoplodera beetles, rather than carrion flies as assumed previously. In consequence, fruit set in D. versipellis was strongly pollen-limited. Our AFLP data support the hypothesis of a long-standing cessation of gene flow between western and central eastern populations, consistent with previous chloroplast DNA data. This phylogeographic pattern supports the role of the Sichuan Basin as a floristic boundary separating the Sino-Himalayan vs. Sino-Japanese Forest subkingdoms. Our genetic data of D. versipellis also imply that temperate deciduous forest elements to the west and the east of this basin responded differently to Quaternary climate change, which may have triggered or is leading to allopatric (incipient) speciation.","2-s2.0-73249120622"
"15988","Phenology and pollination of Manilkara zapota in forest and homegardens","2007","Knowledge on reproductive phenology and pollination biology are basic elements that should be considered in the management and exploitation of plant species that offer non-timber products. The tropical tree Manilkara zapota is a species from which non-timber products have been obtained for centuries by Mayan communities in Mexico. Nevertheless, there are no quantitative reports on its reproductive biology and the factors that limit fruit production. The present study describes the reproductive phenology, breeding system and pollination of this species in two contrasting environments: medium-height, subdeciduous forest, and homegardens (""solares"") in a Mayan community in the state of Yucatan. Significant differences were found between environments both in the temporal distribution of flower and mature fruit production, as well as in the proportion of mature fruits. Homegarden trees showed the greatest fruit production, although flower production did not differ between environments. Mature fruits were of better quality (i.e., greater fresh weight) in homegardens. Hand pollination experiments showed that M. zapota is self-compatible, and that there is pollinator limitation for fruit production in trees that grow in homegardens. We propose that water and soil nutrients are the main factors limiting M. zapota fruit production in forests, while in homegardens the main factor appears to be pollinator availability. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It is estimated that in 2010, UK crops worth £715 million were lost to insect pests. Pesticides are crucial to controlling them, but the development of pest resistance, key products being withdrawn from sale and fears about human and environmental health mean that alternative methods are increasingly important. One solution is to promote native biodiversity that will kill pests within crops. It is by gaining a more detailed understanding of which insects are pollinating crops that we can map their UK distribution using data collected by the volunteers of the Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Scheme and the Biological Records Center.

The objective of this study was to investigate the direct contact toxicity of five technical grade insecticides - imidacloprid, clothianidin, delta-methrin, spinosad, and novaluron - currently used, or with potential for use in canola integrated pest management on bees that may forage in canola: common eastern bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson); hereafter bumble bees], alfalfa leafcutting bees [Megachile rotundata (F.)], and Osmia lignaria Cresson. Clothianidin and to a lesser extent imidacloprid were highly toxic to all three species, deltamethrin and spinosad were intermediate in toxicity, and novaluron was nontoxic. Bumble bees were generally more tolerant to the direct contact applications > O. lignaria > leafcutting bees. However, differences in relative toxicities between the three species were not consistent, e.g., whereas clothianidin was only 4.9 and 1.3× more toxic, deltamethrin was 53 and 68× more toxic to leafcutting bees than to bumble bees and O. lignaria, respectively. Laboratory assessment of direct contact toxicity, although useful, is only one measure of potential impact, and mortality under field conditions may differ greatly depending on management practices. Research conducted using only honey bees as the indicator species may not adequately reflect the risk posed by insecticides to wild bees because of their unique biology and differential susceptibility.

"18903","Estimating the outcrossing rate of barley landraces and wild barley populations collected from ecologically different regions of Jordan","2004","The results of previous studies conducted at the University of Hohenheim and the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) indicated that the yielding ability and stability of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) could be improved in environments with drought stress by increasing the level of heterozygosity. This would require increasing the outbreeding rate of locally adapted breeding materials. As a first step, we estimated the outcrossing rate of 12 barley landraces (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare, in short H. vulgare) and 13 sympatrically occurring populations of its wild progenitor [Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum (C. Koch), in short H. spontaneum] collected from semi-arid localities in Jordan during the 1999/2000 growing season. In each H. vulgare or H. spontaneum population 28-48 spikes were sampled, and up to six offspring (seeds) per spike (called a family) were used for PCR analyses. Collection sites covered high-low transects for rainfall and altitude in order to detect possible environmental effects on the outcrossing rate. Four microsatellite markers located on different chromosomes were used to genotype the samples for estimating the outcrossing rate. Low season-specific multilocus outcrossing rates (tm) were found in both cultivated and wild barley, ranging among populations from 0-1.8% with a mean of 0.34%. Outcrossing rates based on inbreeding equilibrium (te), indicating outcrossing averaged across years, were two- to threefold higher than the season-specific estimates. Under high rainfall conditions somewhat higher - though not significantly higher - outcrossing rates were observed in H. spontaneum than in H. vulgare. The season-specific outcrossing rate in H. spontaneum was positively correlated (r=0.67, P=0.01) with average annual precipitation and negatively correlated (r=0.59, P=0.05) with monthly average temperature during flowering. The results suggest that outcrossing may vary considerably among seasons and that high precipitation and cool temperatures during flowering tend to enhance outcrossing. The rather low levels of outcrossing detected indicate that increased vigour due to heterozygosity has not been a major fitness advantage in the evolution and domestication of H. spontaneum and H. vulgare, respectively. Stable seed production to secure survival under extreme heat and drought stress may have been more important. Cleistogamy may be considered as an effective mechanism to warrant pollination even in drought-stunted plants with non-extruding spikes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","2-s2.0-4344614623"

We utilized inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers for identifying putative F<inf>1</inf> hybrids from six cross combinations whose morphological characteristics were very similar to those of their respective female parents and could not be visually discriminated from the self-pollinated progeny. Based on 10 ISSR primers, polymorphisms were found between female and male parents of all six cross combinations. The highest value of genetic differentiation (21.4%) was found between male and female parents of the SUT3 x M5-1 cross. These 10 ISSR primers gave 2.8- 25.0% polymorphism between male and female parents, with a mean of 12.1%, and 0-13.0% polymorphism between F<inf>1</inf> hybrid and female parents, with a mean of 4.8%. F<inf>1</inf> hybrids of all six cross combinations could be differentiated from the self-pollinated progeny of their female parents by using only either ISSR 841 or 857 primers, together with the ISSR 835 primer. We conclude that ISSR markers are useful and efficient for identifying mungbean F<inf>1</inf> hybrids in controlled crosses from different genetic background. © FUNPEC-RP.","2-s2.0-84930479742"
"720","Sensitivity analysis of the Aquacrop and SAFYE crop models for the assessment of water limited winter wheat yield in regional scale applications","2017","Process-based models can be usefully employed for the assessment of field and regional-scale impact of drought on crop yields. However, in many instances, especially when they are used at the regional scale, it is necessary to identify the parameters and input variables that most influence the outputs and to assess how their influence varies when climatic and environmental conditions change. In this work, two different crop models, able to represent yield response to water, Aquacrop and SAFYE, were compared, with the aim to quantify their complexity and plasticity through Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA), using Morris and EFAST (Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test) techniques, for moderate to strong water limited climate scenarios. Although the rankings of the sensitivity indices was influenced by the scenarios used, the correlation among the rankings, higher for SAFYE than for Aquacrop, assessed by the top-down correlation coefficient (TDCC), revealed clear patterns. Parameters and input variables related to phenology and to water stress physiological processes were found to be the most influential for Aquacrop. For SAFYE, it was found that the water stress could be inferred indirectly from the processes regulating leaf growth, described in the original SAFY model. SAFYE has a lower complexity and plasticity than Aquacrop, making it more suitable to less data demanding regional scale applications, in case the only objective is the assessment of crop yield and no detailed information is sought on the mechanisms of the stress factors affecting its limitations. © 2017 Silvestro et al.

We explored the role of Hadena bicruris, a pollinating seed predator, as a selective agent on its host, the dioecious plant Silene latifolia. We exposed females from artificial-selection lines (many, small flowers (SF) vs. few, large flowers (LF)) to this moth. Infestation did not differ significantly between lines, but the odds of attacked fruits aborting were higher in SF females. We partitioned selection between that caused by moth attack and that resulting from all other factors. In both lines, selection via moth attack for fewer, smaller flowers contrasted with selection via other factors for more flowers. In LF females, selection via the two components was strongest and selection via moth attack also favoured increased fruit abortion. This suggests that the moths act as more of a selective force on flower size and number via their predating than their pollinating role. © 2011 The Authors.

Reproductive correlates of floral variation","1990","This paper examines the relationship between quantitative variation in floral morphology (sizes of petals, spur and peduncle) and maternal reproductive success (seed production) in Viola cazorlensic (Violaceae), a narrowly endemic violet of south?eastern Spain pollinated by day?flying hawkmoths (Sphingidae). This plant is characterized by broad intraspecific variation in size and proportions of floral parts. Floral morphology does not influence significantly the probability of fruit set. Among flowers setting fruit, spur length and size of petals have no significant effect on seed production, but capsules from long? and short?peduncted flowers contain significantly more seeds than capsules from flowers with intermediate peduncles. Individual plants differ significantly in average floral characteristics. Plants with comparatively long and short peduncles tend to produce more seeds than those with intermediate ones, even after accounting statistically for individual differences in flower production. These findings are interpreted as evidence of disruptive selection on peduncle length during the study season. Floral variability in this species may be explained by the combined action of disruptive selection on peduncle length (the character most variable among individuals) and little, if any, stabilizing selection on spur length and size of petals Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

"2958","The Consequences of Predation Risk on the Male Territorial Behavior in a Solitary Bee","2016","Territorial males may adopt a mating tactic that yields greater reproductive success but that at the same time increases the risk of predation. Plasticity in reproductive behavior can reflect a balance between sexual selection and natural selection. In this study, we sought to verify the effect of predation risk on territorial behavior of males of the solitary bee Ptilothrix fructifera (Apidae). Males of the species employ alternative mating tactics and can be territorial in defense of larval food sources. By manipulating predator models in the field, we tested whether (1) males avoid perch flowers containing predator models; (2) males alternate between mating tactics when their territory is associated with a predation risk; and (3) female foraging on flowers in a territory is altered in the presence of a predator model. We measured the responses of males and females in flowers containing and not containing a model of a spider or a stuffed bird. The results show that territorial males of P. fructifera alter their territorial behavior when faced with a high risk of predation. They do not abandon their territory or change to a non-territorial mating tactic, but instead change the use of their territory, avoiding flowers containing predator models or perching on other flowers when the previous flower presented a potential predation risk. Female P. fructifera decreases the frequency of their visits to flowers and the length of time spent there in the presence of a spider model. In short, in the face of predation risk, females and males alter their behaviors at the cost of less efficient foraging and searching for partners, respectively. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","2-s2.0-84977592743"

"14625","Positive interactions among plant species for pollinator service: Assessing the 'magnet species' concept with invasive species","2008","Plants with poorly attractive flowers or with little floral rewards may have inadequate pollinator service, which in turn reduces seed output. However, pollinator service of less attractive species could be enhanced when they are associated with species with highly attractive flowers (so called 'magnet-species'). Although several studies have reported the magnet species effect, few of them have evaluated whether this positive interaction result in an enhancement of the seed output for the beneficiary species. Here, we compared pollinator visitation rates and seed output of the invasive annual species Carduus pycnocephalus when grow associated with shrubs of the invasive Lupinus arboreus and when grow alone, and hypothesized that L. arboreus acts as a magnet species for C. pycnocephalus. Results showed that C. pycnocephalus individuals associated with L. arboreus had higher pollinator visitation rates and higher seed output than individuals growing alone. The higher visitation rates of C. pycnocephalus associated to L. arboreus were maintained after accounting for flower density, which consistently supports our hypothesis on the magnet species effect of L. arboreus. Given that both species are invasives, the facilitated pollination and reproduction of C. pycnocephalus by L. arboreus could promote its naturalization in the community, suggesting a synergistic invasional process contributing to an 'invasional meltdown'. The magnet effect of Lupinus on Carduus found in this study seems to be one the first examples of indirect facilitative interactions via increased pollination among invasive species. © 2008 The Authors.","2-s2.0-57649244778"

We report the first interspecific test of these rules for inflorescence size and branch diameter. We derived a simple corollary of Corner's rules; since leaf size and inflorescence size are both correlated to branch thickness, they may be correlated to each other. This corollary holds for Leucadendron and Protea (Proteaceae), and in certain other taxa in the Asteraceae, Bruniaceae and Pinaceae which also have leaves and reproductive structures on the same shoot. For such taxa this implies that selection for aspects of floral display (inflorescence size, pollination type) may also be expressed at the level of leaf size and vice versa.

We describe the expressions of multiple mAbs in a single F1 tobacco line obtained through cross-pollination between a transgenic line expressing anticancer mAbP CO17-1A (mAbP CO) and another expressing anticancer mAbP BR55 (mAbP BR), which recognize GA733 and Lewis-Y antigens, respectively, which are found on human colorectal cancer cells. The presence of heavy chains (HCs) and light chains (LCs) in mAbs and their protein sizes were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. N-glycan structure analysis showed similar glycan structure profiles between individually expressed mAbs (mAbP CO and mAbP BR) and multiple mAbs (mAbP CO × BR). The interaction of GA733 with mAbP CO was tested using surface plasmon resonance, and the results showed that mAbP CO × BR had lower binding affinity to the antigen compared to individual mAb CO. Boyden chamber assay indicated that mAbM CO, mAbP CO, and mAbP CO × BR had similar inhibitory properties against migration of colon cancer cell. The antibody-dependent cell-mediated cyctotoxicity assay showed a significant synergistic effect of mAbP CO × BR on colorectal cancer cell.

Z. sulphurea (2n=48) when pollinated with Z. candida (2n=40 and 41) has consistently given rise to seedlings with maternal chromosome number and morphology. Z. lancasteri and cv. 20 also behave similarly. This is a strong pointer for their being agamospermous, although a final proof will come from an embryological study. The intraspecific polymorphism within agamospermous taxa in the genus may be the result of autosegregation. On the other hand, the crosses involving sexual species like Z. candida (2n=41) as the female parent have generated a large heterogeneous progeny ranging in chromosome number from 2n=33 to 48 depending upon the number in the male parent.

Following a previous study of flower and inflorescence morphology, I here report the embryology of the genus based on P. tenuidens and compare its characteristics with those of other aquifolialean families, namely, Aquifoliaceae, Cardiopteridaceae, Helwingiaceae, and Stemonuraceae. Comparisons indicate that although Phyllonoma resembles all the other families embryologically, it more closely resembles Aquifoliaceae and Helwingiaceae in lacking a vascular bundle in its integument and bearing ab initio Cellular endosperm. The genus especially resembles Helwingiaceae by possessing a tenuinucellate ovule. This result corroborates molecular and floral morphological evidence, supporting the distinctness of Phyllonoma as a family and its sister-group relationship to East?Asian Helwingiaceae. However, Phyllonoma is clearly distinguished from Helwingiaceae by seed coat structure. In Phyllonoma, the seeds (dispersed in berries) have a thick seed coat composed of irregularly enlarged, thick-walled exotestal cells, whereas the seeds (dispersed in drupes) have a thin membranous seed coat in Helwingiaceae. Taken together with earlier information on pollination (entomophily in Phyllonoma versus ambophily in Helwingiaceae), embryological evidence shows that distinct evolution has occurred in reproductive characters relating to pollination and seed dispersal in Phyllonoma. © 2015, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan.","2-s2.0-84931566281"

This rapid and severe modification has threatened species, local biological communities, and the ecological services that they provide, such as seed dispersal, insect predation, and pollination. Bats are important pollinators of the Cerrado (woodland savanna) because of their role in the life cycles of many plant species. However, there is little information about how these bat species are being affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. We used radio-tracking to estimate the home ranges of Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1776) and Lonchophylla dekeyseri Taddei, Vizotto & Sazima, 1983. The home range of G. soricina varies from 430 to 890 ha. They combine shortrange flights of up to 500 m to nearby areas with longer flights of 2 to 3 km that take them away from their core areas. The maximum flight distance tracked for L. dekeyseri was 3.8 km, and its home range varies from 564 to 640 ha. The average distance travelled by this species was 1.3 km. Our data suggest that G. soricina and L. dekeyseri are able to explore the fragmented landscape of the Central Brazilian Cerrado and that they are likely to survive in the short- to medium-term.

In some cases, these defects have been tied to the inheritance of epigenetic alterations (such as chromatin imprints and DNA methylation patterns) that do not involve changes in DNA sequence. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a gene (DDM1, decrease in DNA methylation) from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana required to maintain normal cytosine methylation patterns. Additional ddm1 alleles (som4, 5, 6, 7, 8) were isolated in a selection for mutations that relieved transgene silencing (E.J.R., unpublished data). Loss of DDM1 function causes a 70% reduction of genomic cytosine methylation, with most of the immediate hypomethylation occurring in repeated sequences. In contrast, many low-copy sequences initially retain their methylation in ddm1 homozygotes, but lose methylation over time as the mutants are propagated through multiple generations by self-pollination. The progressive effect of ddm1 mutations on low-copy sequence methylation suggests that ddm1 mutations compromise the efficiency of methylation of newly incorporated cytosines after DNA replication. In parallel with the slow decay of methylation during inbreeding, ddm1 mutants accumulate heritable alterations (mutations or stable epialleles) at dispersed sites in the genome that lead to morphological abnormalities. Here we report that DDM1 encodes a SWI2/SNF2- like protein, implicating chromatin remodelling as an important process for maintenance of DNA methylation and genome integrity.","2-s2.0-0032907728"
"26319","Predominance of flowers and newly formed pods in reproductive abscission of Lupinus angustifolius L","1992","The stage of development at which reproductive organs abscised on the main inflorescence of Lupinus angustifolius L. plants was studied in field plot trials which incorporated site, sowing date, density and cultivar treatments. The average number of pods on the main inflorescence at final harvest ranged over 1.8 to 8.4, the Reproductive Index (number of seeds per gram total above-ground dry weight, excluding seeds) varied from 3.1 to 7.6, and the Harvest Index from 0.17 to 0.50. Four stages at which abscission occurred were identified (flower [ovaries 7-8 mm long], pl [pods 9-10 mm], p2 [pods 11-13 mm], p3 [pods 14-27 mm long]) and used to assess reproductive development on a week by week basis. In all treatments, losses of flowers and pl pods accounted for 92% or more of total reproductive abscission and, of this, the majority was due to flower abscission. The number of abscised pl pods was relatively stable across treatments, but the number of p2 and p3 pods which abscised varied markedly with sowing date, possibly indicating a relationship with changes in environmental conditions. Examination of ovaries following cryosectioning and fluorescence microscopy showed that pollination of ovules occurred with a similarly high frequency in flowers destined to abscise (77%) compared with those destined to form pods (88%). The difference was due to a 50% probability of pollination of the fifth ovule in ovaries of flowers forming pods and only a 25% probability in those which abscised. The data are discussed in relation to the likely physiological basis for the regulation of reproductive abscission in the species. © 1992 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved.","2-s2.0-84970564799"
"7769","Effect of manipulated sex ratio on insemination of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis L. under net cage conditions","2013","The red mason bee Osmia bicornis L. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a solitary gregarious species that is known to be a good pollinator of pear, apple, and several other Rosaceae fruit plants. Mainly females are active in plant pollination, and therefore they are of strong interest to farmers. As natural populations are usually male biased, here we studied the possibility of rearing a female-biased population of Osmia bicornis by examining the effects of sex ratio changes on female survival, insemination rate, and sperm count in the spermatheca. Using bees that had completed their winter diapause and were maintained in flying cages, we created three groups with different male:female sex ratios: 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. The 1:3 sex-ratio group exhibited the best survival of females, but the lowest spermathecae sperm count. The insemination rate did not differ between groups. Our results indicate that-at least among bees housed in isolator cages for plant breeding- skewing the sex ratio towards more females does not affect bee survival, and efficient insemination can be expected with twice as many females as males.","2-s2.0-84893367565"
"3532","Association among stability measurements in rubber tree traits","2016","The simultaneous use of different methods of stability analysis is becoming more widely used in the selection of genotypes in breeding programs. Knowing how these different methods are associated can contribute to a more efficient selection. The objective of the present study was to assess association among different methods of stability analysis in the rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell.-Arg], using different traits and different groups of genotypes for the same trait. Two open-pollinated progeny populations (POP1 and POP2) and a group of clones (Group 1) were analyzed. POP1 contained 22 progeny, assessed in the municipalities of Pindorama, Votuporanga and Jaú, São Paulo state, Brazil. POP2 included 30 progeny assessed in Selvíria, Mato Grosso do Sul state, Votuporanga and Colina, São Paulo state, Brazil. Group 1 consisted of 25 clones assessed in Votuporanga. The following traits were assessed in POP1: girth, rubber yield, bark thickness and number of latex vessel rings. Rubber yield was assessed in POP2 and Group 1 clones. The following methods of stability analysis were used: Wricke; Eberhart and Russell; Lin and Binns; AMMI (Principal Additive Effect and Multiplicative Interaction) and HMRPGV (Harmonic Mean of the Relative Performance of the Genetic Values) predicted by Blup (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction). The Spearman correlation was used to verify the association between the stability parameters. Three scenarios were observed; in the first, some parameters did not show significant association in any of the analyses: Eberhart and Russell with Lin and Binns; Eberhart and Russell with HMRPGV; Wricke with HMRPGV; AMMI with Lin and Binns and AMMI with HMRPGV. In the second, some parameters showed significant associations in all the analyses such as: Wricke with AMMI, Lin and Binns with HMRPGV. Finally, in the third, the significance of association varied according to the analysis: Eberhart and Russell with Wricke, Eberhart and Russell with AMMI and Wricke with Lin and Binns. Therefore, the association among some stability parameters varies according to the trait and/or the group of genotypes analyzed. The association observed in one analysis cannot be applied to another analysis. In this data analysis is possible to observe that the AMMI method can be used with HMRPGV or Lin and Binns. In addition, Eberhart and Russell can be used with HMRPGV or Lin and Binns, since they offer differentiation and provide additional approaches to the study of stability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84949309719"

"7546","Strength through unity: spatial affinity between morphs improves fitness in incompatible heterostylous Melochia (Malvaceae) species","2014","In heterostylous plants, both stylar polymorphism and incompatibility system favor legitimate pollination among individuals. Weak or partial expression of incompatibility may ensure progeny when mates or pollinators are scarce in unstable habitats, but under these conditions plants with heteromorphic incompatibility would be in disadvantage. In this work we determine how the spatial distribution of morphs and the effect of proximity to the nearest potential mates affect plants reproductive output in four Melochia species. The general prediction of decreasing reproductive success with an increasing isolation of floral morphs in plants with heteromorphic incompatibility was corroborated only in one species (i.e. M. tomentosa). Meanwhile, the other species exhibit a spatial affinity between morphs (i.e. the number of individuals with the nearest neighbor of the opposite morph exceeds expectations upon a random distribution). For M. savannarum and M. villosa we could not detect any effect of proximity to potential mates on the seed-ovule ratio. This may be due to: (1) existence of pollinators with long flying distances, like butterflies, in the populations and/or, (2) the possible occurrence of resource limitation. Spatial affinity between morphs in populations of heterostylous plants with heteromorphic incompatibility system increases reproductive success and may facilitate colonization of ephemeral habitats. © 2014, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan.","2-s2.0-84921325064"

We used five allozyme loci and the mixed mating model to estimate the outcrossing rates of experimental populations of Cuphea lanceolata Ait. grown at Corvallis, Oregon in 1987 and 1988. Populations were grown using densities of one and 27 plants m?2. Multilocus out?crossing rate estimates of populations grown at low and high density ranged from 0.61 to 0.85 and 0.93 to 0.94, respectively. Density caused differences may be caused by differences in pollinator movement. In open plantings, e.g., space?plant nurseries, selfing rates are increased by increased within plant pollination by bumblebees, the primary pollinators of C. lanceolata in temperate zones. The movement of pollinators between plants is enforced in dense plantings. We found C. lanceolata is predominantly al?logamous, but selfing rates as great as 39.0 % were observed among space?plants; thus, the progeny of an open?pollinated individual plant grown in this type of nursery is a mixed half?sib and S1 family.

"93","Influence of environmental variation on the pollination of the ambophilous sedge Rhynchospora ciliata (Cyperaceae)","2018","In typically anemophilous families, there are species, such as Rhynchospora ciliata (Cyperaceae), in which both wind and insects have been registered as pollen vectors (ambophily). However, the contribution of each vector to pollination of ambophilous species can change under different environmental conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the primary pollination system, abiotic or biotic, of R. ciliata, comparing wet and dry seasons. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) in dry months, wind is the main pollen vector of R. ciliata; (2) in wet months, insects will contribute more to the reproductive success of R. ciliata and compensate for low fruit formation by the abiotic vector. Our hypothesis was not confirmed. We found that higher wind speed can favor pollination by wind in R. ciliata even in wetter months. Because insects were less susceptible to environmental variation, they contributed more in dry months when wind speed was low, thus compensating for lower fruit set by wind. High rainfall and humidity can result in faster settling of pollen grains suspended in the air; however, rainfall does not prevent pollination by wind. Since individuals of R. ciliata are located near the edge of the forest, grouped quite close together, and as the inflorescence is located at the apex of the floral scape, wind can act as pollen vector and the inhibiting effects of rainfall can be minimized. The contribution of each pollen vector is important to the reproductive success of R. ciliata and the effectiveness of wind varies with local environmental conditions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85041187822"

"15265","Do resources or natural enemies drive bee population dynamics in fragmented habitats?","2008","The relative importance of bottom-up or top-down forces has been mainly studied for herbivores but rarely for pollinators. Habitat fragmentation might change driving forces of population dynamics by reducing the area of resource-providing habitats, disrupting habitat connectivity, and affecting natural enemies more than their host species. We studied spatial and temporal population dynamics of the solitary bee Osmia rufa (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in 30 fragmented orchard meadows ranging in size from 0.08 to 5.8 ha in an agricultural landscape in central Germany. From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002. Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of independent time series showed on average a negative impact of population size on population growth rates but provides no support for top-down regulation by natural enemies. We conclude that population dynamics of O. rufa are mainly driven by bottom-up forces, primarily nest site availability. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","2-s2.0-46749141310"

CBPs derived from different allergen sources along with different pollination periods could be the causative factor responsible of symptom persistence of sensitised patients in this geographic area. We compared 58 consecutive grass-pollen allergic patient sera with specific IgE towards CBPs with 132 sera obtained from grass-pollen allergic patients without specific IgE antibodies to CBPs in order to evaluate their symptoms. Specific IgE antibodies for the timothy recombinant and natural allergens rPhl p 1, rPhl p 2, nPhl p 4, rPhl p 5, rPhl p 6, rPhl p 7, rPhl p 11, and rPhl p 12, birch major allergen Bet v 1 and Phl p 7-homologous Bet v 4 were evaluated using the immunoenzymatic CAP method (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden).

"9782","Differentiation of endosperm transfer cells of barley: A comprehensive analysis at the micro-scale","2012","Barley endosperm cells differentiate into transfer cells (ETCs) opposite the nucellar projection. To comprehensively analyse ETC differentiation, laser microdissection-based transcript and metabolite profiles were obtained from laser microdissected tissues and cell morphology was analysed. Flange-like secondary-wall ingrowths appeared between 5 and 7 days after pollination within the three outermost cell layers. Gene expression analysis indicated that ethylene-signalling pathways initiate ETC morphology. This is accompanied by gene activity related to cell shape control and vesicle transport, with abundant mitochondria and endomembrane structures. Gene expression analyses indicate predominant formation of hemicelluloses, glucuronoxylans and arabinoxylans, and transient formation of callose, together with proline and 4-hydroxyproline biosynthesis. Activation of the methylation cycle is probably required for biosynthesis of phospholipids, pectins and ethylene. Membrane microdomains involving sterols/sphingolipids and remorins are potentially involved in ETC development. The transcriptional activity of assimilate and micronutrient transporters suggests ETCs as the main uptake organs of solutes into the endosperm. Accordingly, the endosperm grows maximally after ETCs are fully developed. Up-regulated gene expression related to amino acid catabolism, C:N balances, carbohydrate oxidation, mitochondrial activity and starch degradation meets high demands for respiratory energy and carbohydrates, required for cell proliferation and wall synthesis. At 10 days after pollination, ETCs undergo further differentiation, potentially initiated by abscisic acid, and metabolism is reprogrammed as shown by activated storage and stress-related processes. Overall, the data provide a comprehensive view of barley ETC differentiation and development, and identify candidate genes and associated pathways. © 2012 The Authors.

"1934","Melon fruit sugar and amino acid contents are affected by fruit setting method under protected cultivation","2017","This study investigated the effect of different fruit setting methods on fruit quality of melon (Cucumis melo L.) under protected cultivation. The results showed that artificial and honey bee pollination decreased single fruit weight compared with 1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU) treatment, whereas the lowest value was observed in artificial pollination. Artificial and honey bee pollination apparently increased sucrose content, and the increased activity of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was the key reason. In addition, total content of amino acids (17 kinds) were increased by 31% and 28% in artificial and honey bee-pollinated fruits compared with CPPU treatment, respectively. Honey bee pollination also improved single fruit weight and taste compared with artificial pollination. Therefore, we can conclude that artificial and honey bee pollination can improve the quality of melon fruits.

As a wind-pollinated species, maize produces a large quantity of pollen grains that heavier and larger compared to Arabidopsis. Maize is an important model plant in pollen biology of monocots. The pollen coat, the outermost layer of pollen, plays a vital role in pollenstigma interactions and successful fertilization. Pollen coat proteins (PCPs), which confer species specificity, are required for pollen adhesion, recognition, hydration, and germination on the stigma. Thus, PCPs have attracted intensive research efforts in plant science for decades. However, only a few PCPs in maize have been characterized to date, whereas the functions of most maize PCPs remain unclear. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of maize PCPs with regard to protein constituents, synthesis and transport, and functions by comparison with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica plants.

"14893","Pollination characteristics of the ephemeroid plant Eremurus anisopterus","2008","This study was conducted to examine the pollination characteristics of Eremurus anisopterus, an ephemeroid plant in the Gurbantunggut Desert in Xinjiang, China. An integrative approach combining field studies with lab analysis was adopted. Pollen traps were used to measure air-borne pollen loads and artificial isolation experiments were applied to test the potentiality of cross-pollination or apomixes. Results show that the duration of the flowering of Eremurus anisopterus varied from late April to mid-May. Anthesis of a single flower often lasted for 1 d. However, if the daily maximum air temperature was under 20°C, the anthesis of a single flower could be prolonged up to 2 d. The pollen dispersion period of the single flower could last for 4 to 5 h, from 10:30 to 15:00 local time, with the duration of pollen dispersion for a single anther lasting approximately 40 min. The heterotypical maturation of the stigma could significantly prolong the pollen dispersion period of the single flower suggesting an adaptation to the habitat of E. anisopterus in the desert where the pollinators were not reliable. The timing of the blossoms of the ephemeroid plant show close correlations with the wind velocity and the habit and characteristics of the pollinators in the desert. Plant pollens may be spread to over 70 m by wind with approximately 60% of the pollens falling within 20 m away from the plant. Insects, especially bees, hover flies, flesh flies, mason bees and Halictus sp. were very important pollinators. Bees and hover flies usually landed on the yellowish green spot on the tepal and then entered the flower along the purple vein on the pink tepals. The yellowish green spot might be a mimetic structure of nectar that could attract insects to visit. This was also an adaptation of the plant to the sandy desert environment. A higher visiting frequency was reached between 10:30 and 13:30. The pollen-ovule ratio (P/O) of E. anisopterus (6164) suggested that the species was from cross-pollination according to Cruden's criterion. However, the artificial isolation experiment shows that E. anisopterus is self-compatible which might act as a compensation mechanism for the inadequate opportunities for breeding in the desert environment. Since there was no seed set in the bagged emasculated flowers, apomixes did not occur. In conclusion, E. anisopterus might adapt to the unreliable pollinator habits by self-pollination and by lengthening the pollen dispersion period of a single flower. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","2-s2.0-47649097243"

We measured selection acting on flower number flower size, stigma exsertion, and ovule number per flower using field data on lifetime female fitness (seed production) in wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum. The patterns of selection were reasonably consistent across three field seasons, with strong directional selection for increased flower production in all three years, weaker selection for increased ovule number per flower in two years, and selection for increased flower size in one year. The causes of the selection were investigated using path analysis combined with multiplicative fitness components. Increased flower production increased fruit production directly, and increased numbers of ovules per flower increased the number of seeds per fruit in all three years; pollinator visitation did not influence either of these fitness components. Increased flower size was associated with increases in both the number of fruit and the number of seeds per fruit in one year, with the latter relationship being stronger. Total lifetime seed production was affected more strongly by differences in fruit production than by differences in either the number of seeds per field or the proportion of fertilized seeds that were viable, but all three fitness components were positively correlated with total seed production.","2-s2.0-0029661299"

DHLs have been generated by in vitro rescue of in vivo induced parthenogenic embryos. The protocol developed involves the following: 1) induction of parthenogenic embryos by pollinating with pollen irradiated with a Co 60 ?-ray source at 500 Gy; 2) in vitro rescue of putative parthenogenic embryos identified by their morphology and localized using a dissecting scope or X-ray radiography; 3) discrimination of undesirable zygotic individuals from the homozygous plants using cucumber and melon SSR markers; 4) determination of ploidy level from homozygous plants by flow cytometry; 5) in vitro chromosome doubling of haploids; and 6) acclimation and selfing of selected lines. Codominant markers and flow cytometry confirmed the gametophytic origin of plants regenerated by parthenogenesis, since all homozygous lines were haploids. No spontaneous doubled haploid plants were rescued. Chromosome doubling of haploid plants was accomplished by an in vitro treatment with 500 ?M colchicine. Rescue of diploid or chimeric plants was shown by flow cytometry, prior to their acclimation and planting in the greenhouse. Selfing of colchicine-treated haploid plants allowed for the perpetuation by seed of homozygous lines. The high rate of seed set, 90% of the lines produced seed, facilitated the recovery of inbred lines. Despite some limiting factors, parthenogenesis is routinely used in a cucumber-breeding program to achieve complete homozygosity in one generation.

Outcrossing was variable, ranging from 5% to 82%, and long-distance pollen dispersal was observed in all populations with up to 43% of pollen sourced from outside the populations over distances of up to 5 km. This extensive pollen immigration was positively associated with population size but not isolation. Comparison of two populations of similar size but different density showed greater internal pollination and less selfing in the denser population, suggesting an influence of density on pollinator behaviour.

Open inflorescences of both species yielded significantly higher seed-set than excluded inflorescences, which showed zero to near zero seed-set. Inflorescences shown on video to have been visited by sunbirds showed significantly higher seed-set than those for which video footage was not obtained, suggesting sunbirds are effective pollinators. Besides being the first documented pollinator information on these two species, our results expand upon the known traits associated with sunbird-pollination systems and suggest that low-growing sunbird-pollinated plants need not evolve perching structures in order to achieve effective visitation. © 2015 South African Association of Botanists","2-s2.0-84939556757"
"16370","Scale-dependent effects of habitat fragmentation on hawthorn pollination, frugivory, and seed predation","2007","Habitat fragmentation is a major cause of functional disruption in plant-animal interactions. The net effect on plant regeneration is, however, controversial because a given landscape change can simultaneously hamper mutualism and attenuate antagonism. Furthermore, fragmentation effects may emerge at different spatial scales, depending on the size of the foraging range of the different interacting animals. We studied pollination by insects, frugivory by birds acting as seed dispersers, and postdispersal seed predation by rodents in 60 individual hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna Jacq.) trees in relation to structural fragmentation in the surrounding habitat. We evaluated fragmentation at three spatial scales by measuring the percentage of forest cover in three concentric areas around each tree of, respectively, 10-m, 20- to 50-m, and 50- to 100-m radius. The number of developing pollen tubes per flower style and fruit set decreased in proportion to the decrease of forest cover. Similarly, the magnitude of frugivory in focal trees was negatively affected by habitat loss. In contrast, seed predation was higher under plants in highly fragmented contexts. The effect of fragmentation was additive in terms of reducing the potential of plant regeneration. Moreover, the functional scale of response to habitat loss differed among interactions. Fragmentation effects on pollination emerged at the largest scale, whereas seed predation was mostly affected at the intermediate scale. In contrast to expectations from the larger foraging range of birds, fragmentation effects on frugivory mainly operated at the finest scale, favored by the ability of birds to cope hierarchically with spatial heterogeneity at different scales. Given that two opposing demographic forces (frugivory and seed predation) would be potentially affected by fine-scale features, we propose structural scale as the primary spatial dimension of fragmentation effects on the process of plant regeneration. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.","2-s2.0-33947496686"

"17529","Variation in effective pollination rates in relation to the spatial and temporal distribution of pollen release in rejuvenated perennial ryegrass","2006","Genebank accessions stored as seed populations require periodic rejuvenation in order to maintain sufficient numbers of viable seeds. During rejuvenation the genetic composition of accessions may be altered for a variety of reasons, of which variation in pollination rates between plants is the least understood. In the present study, a paternity exclusion analysis was performed on a rejuvenated accession of perennial ryegrass. In addition, flowering data of the 49 parental plants were collected during the flowering season. The aim of the study was to determine how accurate variation in pollination rates between plants can be predicted from data on the spatial and temporal distribution of pollen release. The parental population and a total of 551 offspring from 12 progeny arrays were genotyped by means of molecular analysis. Using 25 microsatellites, paternity was identified for 81.9% of the offspring, while remaining ambiguities were resolved by AFLP analysis, except in four cases. Within the total sample 9 cases of contamination were observed. Mating within the study population was clearly non-random, as 61.9% of the identified pollen donors were located within 1 m distance from the mother plant. Observed pollination rates were very well described by an inverse quadratic function of inter-plant distance between potential mating pairs. Incorporation of the recorded flowering data in the calculation of expected pollination rates improved the goodness of fit with observed values by only 0.77%. Suggestions to reduce the variance in paternal contributions were presented. However, contamination was considered more threatening to the genetic integrity of perennial ryegrass germplasm than variation in pollination rates between plants, and indicated the need for improved measures to avoid gene flow from other germplasm. © Springer 2006.","2-s2.0-33646439254"

The maximum fruit-retention was recorded under open pollination followed by sibbing and geitonogamy, whereas bagging resulted in no-fruit retention. Improvement in fruit retention under sibbing and open pollination compared with the geitonogamy might be due to the effect of foreign pollen grains having high pollination stimulus. Poor-fruit retention under geitonogamy and bagging indicated the possibility of self-incompatility in all the aonla cultivars/genotypes.","2-s2.0-0031811237"

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is an important fibre-producing and oil-producing crop worldwide. However, few MAPKs and their interaction partners have been functionally characterized in cotton. In the present study, the group A MAPK G. hirsutum (Gh)MPK6a was identified and characterized. GhMPK6a expression can be induced through multiple defence-related signal molecules and abiotic and biotic stresses. The ectopic expression of GhMPK6a in Nicotiana benthamiana reduced drought and salt tolerance, with elevated malondialdehyde content, higher reactive oxygen species content and lower abscisic acid content than in wild-type plants. Moreover, plants overexpressing GhMPK6a were sensitive to the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. Histochemical analysis of ?-glucuronidase activity revealed that GhMPK6a showed tissue-specific expression during postgermination development, mixed bud differentiation, and pollination. Most importantly, GhMPK6a interacts with the upstream MAPK kinase GhMKK4, as shown by the use of yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation systems, compensating for a deficiency of MAPK interaction partners in cotton crops. Taken together, these results suggest that GhMPK6a negatively regulates osmotic stress and bacterial infection, and plays an important role in developmental processes. These results provide useful information for elucidating the roles of MAPK cascades in cotton crops. © 2013 FEBS.","2-s2.0-84885297382"

"14245","Limited mate availability decreases reproductive success of fragmented populations of Linnaea borealis, a rare, clonal self-incompatible plant","2009","Background and AimsSmall populations of rare plant species are increasingly reported to have high levels of reproductive failure. The objective of this study was to understand the principal constraints on sexual reproduction in small fragmented populations of a rare clonal self-incompatible plant.MethodsThe pollinator spectrum, diversity of flower colour, natural pollination and fruit-set levels of L. borealis were examined in Scotland. Artificially crossed seed production was compared within and between different flower colour types and patches.Key ResultsLinnaea borealis was pollinated by a diverse spectrum of insect species and the principal pollinators were muscid, syrphid and empid flies which mostly moved only small distances (<0·25 m) between flowers when foraging. Natural pollination levels were high, indicating high pollinator effectiveness, but fruit set was very low in most patches. Flower colour diversity was low in most patches and only those with a diversity of flower colour types had high fruiting success. Pollination experiments showed L. borealis to be highly self-incompatible and artificial crosses within and between patches and flower colour types confirmed that low fruit success was the result of a lack of compatible mates and limited pollen movement between them. Evidence of isolation from pollen exchange was apparent at as little as 6 m and severe at 30 m and beyond.ConclusionsLimited mate availability and isolation from pollen exchange compromise the reproductive success of fragmented populations of L. borealis in Scotland. A diversity of compatible mates situated within close proximity (<6 m) is the key requirement to ensure high natural fruiting success. This study emphasizes that an understanding of the breeding system, pollinator spectrum and potential for interconnectivity via pollinator movement are fundamental to identify isolation distances and to establish when conservation intervention is necessary for rare species.","2-s2.0-64949184737"

A complete 4x4 diallel cross was carried out between 4 Asiatic Lilium hybrids/cultivars, namely 'Prato', 'London', 'Alaska' and 'Shiraj' including self and cross pollinations using three pollination methods' viz normal stigmatic pollination, cut style pollination and intrastylar implant. All crosses pollinated by normal stigmatic methods produced fairly more seed counts. Maximum (90.0) seed and mean seed set (54.3) was obtained following stigmatic pollination in 'Alaska' x 'London' which was significantly higher than all other crosses. No seed set was observed in 'Prato' x 'Shiraj' using either of the pollination methods indicating cross-incompatible nature and also similar could be observed from the reciprocal crosses of these 2 cultivars. Upon selfing no seed set was obtained in 'Shiraj' and 'Prato' which showed that these two cultivars may be of triploid nature or due to disturbed chromosome division during meiosis, genetic incongruity, slow pollen tube growth or self-incompatibility. When pollination methods were taken into consideration a general trend of seed set was maximum in stigmatic > cut stylar > stylar implant.","2-s2.0-34548760827"

The objective of this study was to develop an efficient technique for using 1EBN species in breeding by crossing to 2EBN bridge species S. verrucosum. Success was obtained with several 1EBN diploid species: S. bulbocastanum, S. pinnatisectum, S. polyadenium, S. commersonii and S. circaeifolium. Use of 2x(2EBN) S. verrucosum as a receptive female avoided prezygotic interspecific incompatibility, and double ""rescue"" pollination was done using haploid-inducing clone, S. phureja IvP35 to minimize postzygotic failure due to abortion of berries with few or small seeds. In total, 4,646 hybrid seeds were obtained in crosses between S. verrucosum and the 1EBN species. Rescue pollination particularly improved seeds per pollination for S. pinnatisectum hybrids. The hybrid seeds were normal in appearance and had high germination (47-88 %). They produced plants with the distinctive phenotypic characteristics and molecular markers specific to their 1EBN parents.

"27045","The complex S?gene system for control of self?incompatibility in the buttercup genus Ranunculus","1990","Continued research into the S?gene mechanisms in the genus Ranunculus, their genetic architecture and mode of cooperation, applied a backcross analysis in two steps to the three diploid, perennial, closely related, but reproductively perfectly isolated species R. acris. R. bulbosus. and R. polyanthemos. Parental plants were preferably taken from remote provenances, an F1 plant was selected to be crossed with pollen from the maternal parent, and the backcross offspring, altogether about 2300 plants in five backcross families, were tested individually with their pollen onto this parent. Backcross plants failing with their pollen on their backcrossed parent were selected and tested to one another in a diallel scheme of cross pollinations. The analyses based on these selected backcross plants showed 4 S?loci to be at work in all three species; in no case was it necessary to presume more than four. There were no indications that the higher levels of heterozygosity were favoured in any way. The main influence on the frequencies with which the different S?genotypes appeared among the selected backcross plants was seen to be associated with individual S?genes and not with specific S?gene constellations. The data are interpreted to testify to the ancient state of the complex S?gene system, to indicate that the 4 loci form the genuine number, at least for these three species, and to favour the view that they cooperate through a complex recognition molecule, at least a heterotetramer, where each of the four S?loci contribute by its specific polypeptide. The presumption of a restrictive supply of alleles in the team is supported by four of the five F1 plants showing S?gene identities between the crossed parental plants.

Wide-based crosses within C. sativus [i.e., C. sativus var. sativus × C. sativus var. hardwickii (R.) Alef.] and interspecific hybridization attempts before 1995 have not substantially increased genetic diversity for plant improvement. However, in1995, anamphidiploid(Cucumis hytivus Chen and Kirkbride) was derived fromaC.sativus × Cucumis hystrix Chakr. mating. A derivative of this amphidiploid was used herein to broaden the genetic base of cucumber through backcross introgression [(C. sativus × C. hytivus) × C. sativus]. Initially, the combining ability of eight genetically diverse lines was investigated for days to anthesis (DA), sex expression (SEX), lateral branch number (LBN), fruit per plant (FP), fruit length:diameter ratio (L:D), and salt-processing ability [i.e., processed fruit color (exterior and interior), shape, and seed cavity characteristics]. Based on the combining ability, inbred backcross lines [IBL (BC2S3)] were developed from an original gynoecious determinate line WI 7023A [C. sativus (recurrent parent)] × monoecious indeterminate line WI 7012A (C. sativus × C. hytivus derived) mating, where 30 of 392 (8%) BC1 progeny were selected based on their diversity at 16 mapped marker loci. These progeny were used to develop BC2 progeny, which were then self-pollinated without further selection to produce 94 IBL. These IBL were genotyped and evaluated in the open field in two plantings in 2008 for DA, SEX, LBN, leaf size, FP, and L:D. The genetic distance (GD) between parental lines was 0.85, and the GD among IBL ranged between 0.16 and 0.75. Multivariate analyses indicated that IBL differed from parental lines and possessed considerable morphological and genotypic diversity that could be used to broaden the genetic base of commercial U.S. processing cucumber.","2-s2.0-77954902952"

These liposomes were induced to fuse with tobacco mesophyll protoplasts by polyethyleneglycol treatment. Kanamycin-resistant clones were reproducibly isolated from transfected cultures at an average frequency of 4 X 10(-5). Plants regenerated from these resistant colonies were confirmed to be transformed according to three criteria. Protoplasts isolated from their leaves were resistant to 100 micrograms/ml kanamycin. The enzyme aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II encoded by the plasmid pLGV23neo was detected in leaf extracts. Approximately 3-5 copies of the gene encoding for kanamycin resistance were inserted in the genome of at least one of the studied transformants. The restriction pattern of inserted DNA was best explained by assuming a tandem integration of the pPLGV23neo sequences, implying an homologous recombination event between these sequences during transformation. Kanamycin resistance was transmitted as a single dominant nuclear marker to the progeny of resistant plants after selfing or cross-pollination with the wild-type.","2-s2.0-0022154062"
"21406","Flower sex ratio, pollinator abundance, and the seasonal pollination dynamics of a protandrous plant","2001","The separation between staminate and pistillate phases in protandrous, long-lived hermaphroditic flowers results in a seasonal shift in sex ratio from a pure male to a pure female flower population. In theory, temporal sex ratio associated with dichogamy may affect pollination, promoting the evolution of sexual specialization in plants when pollinator visitation does not limit seed output. Alstroemeria aurea, a perennial herb native to the temperate forests of southern South America, bears strongly protandrous flowers. Over a three-year period, I assessed the influence of seasonal changes in flower sex ratio and pollinator abundance on the pollination dynamics of this plant species. Workers of Bombus dahlbomii accounted for >90% of all visits to A. aurea flowers and were the most efficient pollinators on a per-visit basis. As the season progressed, pollen loads carried by bumble bees decreased by almost one order of magnitude, and the amount of pollen deposited per visit decreased as well from >40 to <4 pollen grains from the beginning to the end of the flowering season. As flowering patches became more female, the number of male-phase flowers visited uninterruptedly during each bumble bee foraging bout decreased, while the number of sequential visits to female-phase flowers increased. A laboratory experiment of manipulating dried bumble bees showed that the number of male- and female-phase flowers visited in uninterrupted sequence strongly influences the amount of pollen deposited on a flower's stigma. Pollen deposition in this experiment closely mimicked the relationship between sex ratio and the observed seasonal decline in per-visit pollen deposition in the field. Because overall rate of bumble bee visitation increased monotonically over the flowering season, total pollen receipt per flower also increased during the first half of the season. Nevertheless, pollen deposition decreased during the second half of the season when visitation rates saturated pollen removal, and low pollen availability associated with an increasingly female-biased sex ratio apparently became the limiting factor in pollen transfer. Despite pronounced seasonal changes in pollinator and pollination levels, comparisons of seed output between open- and hand-pollinated flowers showed no evidence that seed production was ever limited by total pollen receipt. Because flower sex ratio influenced pollinator visitation and pollination patterns, and pollinator availability did not limit seed output, protandry should favor the evolution of female and male specialists flowering at the tails of the flowering season. Neither unisexuality nor any other form of sexual polymorphism is found in A. aurea, however. Likewise, I found no evidence that plants might be compensating for a seasonal shift in sex ratio through differential allocation into pollen and ovule production within flowers or to relative duration of male and female sexual phases. These results suggest that a seasonal shift in operational sex ratio within a dichogamous species can profoundly affect pollination without necessarily driving the evolution of floral polymorphism.","2-s2.0-0035135771"

The pollen was collected from a few pine plants of Tozan-matu, a local variety, which were planted in a control field of the Institute of Radiation Breeding in 1962, and the pollen was irradiated at the gamma field of the same institute in May 1966. Exposure rates per day (20 hours) were 3.9 × 103, 7.8 × 103 and 11.7 xyt lO3R for the pollen pollinated in the Institute of Radiation Breeding, and 3.9 × lO3R for the pollen used in the Tohoku Forest Tree Improvement Station, respectively. At the institute, as female, six-year-old plants of open pollinated progeny of a plus tree, Miyoshi No. 4, were used. At the Tohoku Forest Tree Improvement Station, grafted pines, about ten years old, of seven plus trees were used as female. Mature cones were collected in the fall of 1967. There was observed no apparent correlation between the cone maturity and exposure of the pollen as shown in Tables 1 and 3. Percentage of full seeds was 90.1% and 95.3% in the control and in open pollination. On the other hand, it decreased to 48.5% and 11.1% by the gamma ray exposures of 3.9 × 103 and 7.8 × l03R. One thousand-seed-weight was not affected by the exposure. As shown in Fig. 1, number of full seeds per cone seems to be reduced to zero at the exposure of about 8 × l03~9 × l03R in the crosses in both places. Fifty per cent reduction dose for number of full seeds per cone was estimated to be 5 × lO3R. Total seed number per cone was slightly reduced in the exposure range of zero and 7.8 × lO3R, and, at 11.7 × l03R, even number of empty seeds was reduced. Germination percentage of the full seeds was very high in all exposure plots showing mean values of 97.5%, 99.2%, 93.3% and 93.3% for respective exposures of the pollen in the crosses at the Institute of Radiation Breeding. For the crosses at the Tohoku Forest Tree Improvement Station, mean germination percentages of the full seeds were 97.1% and 97.5% for the control and 3.9 × lO3R plot, respectively.

Genetical and environmental influences are considered as problems of adaptation. Cold tolerance, susceptibility to smut, and fungi attacking ripening grain are under genetical control, but modified by environmental conditions. Analysis of these factors helps to control these diseases. Strains differ in resistance to frit fly attacks, and this is modified by sowing time. Frit flies and wireworms, acting independently or together, may limit sweet corn growing in some areas, while aphids also attack some inbred lines. Various methods of insect control are suggested. Mice and birds eat seeds, and bird damage may also limit maize growing.

Spiroplasma melliferum can be spread through honeybee pollination, which causes severe economic losses to apiculture. The design of this study was based on previous studies that utilized an in vitro bioassay to investigate the effects of S. melliferum CH-1 infection. We identified invasive S. melliferum CH-1 within Apis mellifera using transmission electron microscopy and investigated the immune response of honeybees infected with S. melliferum CH-1 by assaying the cellular immune response of the haemocytes, the plasma level of phenoloxidase activity and the transcript levels of 5 antimicrobial peptides, including the Abaecin, Apidaecin, Defensin 1, Defensin 2, and Hymenoptaecin gene products. The percentage of granulocytes in the haemolymph of infected honeybees was significantly higher than those of the controls during the early phase of infection, but the percentage of plasmatocytes was significantly higher than those of the controls at the fifth day post-infection. The phenoloxidase activity of the infected honeybees reached a maximum at the second day, and then decreased continuously. Moreover, the transcript levels of the 5 evaluated antimicrobial peptide genes were significantly increased during the early phase of infection and all 5 antimicrobial peptides were significantly decreased during the middle phase of infection. During the late phase of infection, only Defensin 2 and Hymenoptaecin showed significantly increased transcription. These results suggest that the honeybee immune responses could be activated by S. melliferum CH-1 during the early phase of infection and that S. melliferum CH-1 is also capable of circumventing the host defensive mechanisms to complete its life cycle within the honeybee during the middle phase of infection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85030838044"

Meiotic analysis of the hybrids Mv9 kr1 x 'Igri' and 'Asakazekomugi' x 'Manas' and their in vitro regenerated progenies with the Feulgen method revealed 1.59 chromosome arm associations per cell in both initial hybrids. The number of chromosome arm associations increased after in vitro culture to 4.72 and 2.67, respectively, in the two combinations.

"820","Phylogenetic trends in the evolution of inflorescence odours in Amorphophallus","2017","The chemical composition of inflorescence odours of 80 species of Amorphophallus (Araceae) were determined by headspace-thermal desorption GC-MS. When compared to published molecular phylogenies of the genus, the data reveal evidence both of phylogenetic constraint and plasticity of odours. Dimethyl oligosulphides were found as common constituents of Amorphophallus odours and were the most abundant components in almost half of the species studied. Odours composed mainly of dimethyl oligosulphides, and perceived as being gaseous, were only found among Asian species, and some of these species clustered in certain clades in molecular phylogenies; e.g. in two clades in Amorphophallus subgenus Metandrium. However, some species with gaseous odours were found to be closely related to species producing odours more reminiscent of rotting meat in which various minor components accompany the dominant dimethyl oligosulphides. These two broad types of odours have co-evolved with other inflorescence characteristics such as colour, with species with rotting meat odours having darker inflorescences. Species producing pleasant odours characterised by benzenoid compounds constitute two broad groups that are not related in published phylogenies. Species having fruity odours containing 1-phenylethanol derivatives mainly occur in a clade in subgenus Metandrium while those with anise odours composed almost solely of the 2-phenylethanol derivative 4-methoxyphenethyl alcohol are restricted to a clade in subgenus Scutandrium. Phylogenetic mapping of odours also indicates that the evolution of some odour types is likely to have been influenced by ecological factors. For example, species producing fishy odours dominated by trimethylamine and occurring in N and NE Borneo are not all closely related. Conversely, two sister species, A. mossambicensis and A. abyssinicus, which are morphologically very similar and have overlapping geographical distribution, produce odours which are very different chemically. The pressure of pollinator resource has therefore been a factor influencing the evolution of odours in Amorphophallus, driving both the divergence of odour types in some taxa and the convergence of odour types in others. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85025446103"
"12627","Dispersal capacity and diet breadth modify the response of wild bees to habitat loss","2010","Habitat loss poses a major threat to biodiversity, and species-specific extinction risks are inextricably linked to life-history characteristics. This relationship is still poorly documented for many functionally important taxa, and at larger continental scales. With data from five replicated field studies from three countries, we examined how species richness of wild bees varies with habitat patch size. We hypothesized that the form of this relationship is affected by body size, degree of host plant specialization and sociality. Across all species, we found a positive species-area slope (z = 0.19), and species traits modified this relationship. Large-bodied generalists had a lower z value than small generalists. Contrary to predictions, small specialists had similar or slightly lower z value compared with large specialists, and small generalists also tended to be more strongly affected by habitat loss as compared with small specialists. Social bees were negatively affected by habitat loss (0 = 0.11) irrespective of body size. We conclude that habitat loss leads to clear shifts in the species composition of wild bee communities. © 2010 The Royal Society.","2-s2.0-77955095333"
"21092","Competition between mutualists: The role of differential flower abscission in yuccas","2001","Competition among yucca moths occurs because retention of flowers is resource limited: The more flowers that are visited the lower the probability that a visited flower will become a fruit. However, an unusual mechanism causes asymmetric competition between two species of yucca moths, with the asymmetry being based upon differential retention/abscission of flowers. Flowers containing eggs of yucca moths that oviposit through the carpel wall (= deeps) are more likely to abscise when other flowers on the same plant contain only the eggs of yucca moths that oviposit into the surface of the carpel wall (= shallows). The advantage of shallows over deeps suggests that shallows should be able to invade sites occupied by deeps, and outcompete deeps. However, proportions of deeps and shallows on Yucca kanabensis have been relatively stable for the last 12 years, and shallows have failed to invade sites with only deeps. We examined four factors that could affect the ability of deeps to coexist with shallows. 1) The competitive advantage of shallows over deeps was greatest on plants with intermediate levels of visitation. With low visitation few pollinated flowers abscised, competition was weak, and the differential success of shallows was weak. With high visitation intra- and interspecific competition was strong, but the differential success was low because most flowers received eggs from both deeps and shallows. 2) There was a partial seasonal segregation of deeps and shallows, with deeps emerging earlier than shallows, thereby increasing the probability of some deeps occurring on plants with relatively few shallows. 3) Although independent aggregation of deeps and shallows at the level of plants could promote coexistence by generating plants where deeps encounter few shallows, association of deeps and shallows was positive. 4) Deeps aggregated among flowers within plants much less than did shallows, which decreases the number of flowers with only shallow ovipositions and decreases the opportunity for asymmetric competition.","2-s2.0-0034802962"
"14415","Causes of spatial patterns of fruit set in waratah: Temporal vs. spatial interactions between flowers on an inflorescence","2009","Spatial patterns of fruit set within inflorescences may be controlled by pollination, nutrient allocation, or inflorescence architecture. Generally, flowers that have spatial and/or temporal precedence are more likely to set fruits. We sought to separate these factors by comparing patterns of fruit set on inflorescences of two species of Telopea (Proteaceae); one that flowers from the tip to the base of the rachis, the other from base to tip. In both species, most fruits were set at the top of the inflorescence (the last flowers to open for T. speciosissima) and this was extreme for T. mongaensis, where the top flowers open first. Fruit set was not generally limited by inadequate pollination for either T. mongaensis or T. speciosissima, as hand pollinations did not increase fruit set and many abscised flowers contained pollen tubes. In T. speciosissima, we tested whether removal of developing topmost fruits would 'release' those that had initiated but not yet aborted lower down. There was no significant effect. Plant hormones can increase the degree to which a developing fruit is a sink for nutrients, so we applied cytokinin to the developing lower fruits on some inflorescences. There was no significant effect of the hormone treatment. We conclude that temporal precedence may contribute to the skewed pattern of fruit set in T. mongaensis, because there was an extreme concentration of fruit set on the distal part of the inflorescences, but it cannot explain this pattern of fruit set in T. speciosissima, where the distal flowers are the last to open. Some other process must therefore constrain fruit set to the topmost flowers in an inflorescence. While cytokinin application had no significant effect, the power of this experiment was low and we consider that the hypothesis of hormonal control is worth further exploration. © 2009 The Authors.","2-s2.0-58249116643"
"4165","Declining resilience of ecosystem functions under biodiversity loss","2015","The composition of species communities is changing rapidly through drivers such as habitat loss and climate change, with potentially serious consequences for the resilience of ecosystem functions on which humans depend. To assess such changes in resilience, we analyse trends in the frequency of species in Great Britain that provide key ecosystem functions - specifically decomposition, carbon sequestration, pollination, pest control and cultural values. For 4,424 species over four decades, there have been significant net declines among animal species that provide pollination, pest control and cultural values. Groups providing decomposition and carbon sequestration remain relatively stable, as fewer species are in decline and these are offset by large numbers of new arrivals into Great Britain. While there is general concern about degradation of a wide range of ecosystem functions, our results suggest actions should focus on particular functions for which there is evidence of substantial erosion of their resilience.","2-s2.0-84949603832"

Effect of fertilizer placement on plant survival, yield, and fruit size","1989","A field study was conducted to investigate the effects of three fertilizer placement methods and 11 fertilizer formulations on plant survival, economics of replanting, yield, and fruit size of two rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade) cultivars Tifblue and Woodard. Fertilizer rates were either mixed with the soil under plants (before planting), sidedressed, or half-rate was placed under plants with the other half sidedressed. Fertilizers at planting caused a total of 34% 'Woodard' and 12% 'Tifblue' plants to die as compared to 6% for 'Woodard' and none for 'Tifblue' when no fertilizer was applied. Fertilizer formulas 2-1-1 and 5-10-10 oxide ratios placed under 'Woodard' plants caused 100% mortality whereas 'Tifblue' fertilized with oxide ratios 2-2-2 and 5-10-10 under plants reached the maximum 50% mortality. Splitting fertilizer placement under the side of the plants resulted in less 'Woodard' plant mortality (30%) than placing all the fertilizer under plants (54%). However, plant mortality for the side/under group was not different than sidedressing all fertilizer (23%). A planted hectare in this experiment consisted of 1852 'Tifblue' and 926 'Woodard' plants, providing one 'Woodard' plant to pollinate two 'Tifblue' plants. Based on the results obtained, the 5-10-10 fertilizer placed under plants would be expected to cause half the 'Tifblue' (926 plants) and all the 'Woodard' (926 plants) to be replanted. Plant costs alone was estimated to be $2315 with additional replanting costs of $93 for 'Tifblue' and much higher for 'Woodard'. Sidedressing 5-10-10 fertilizer eight weeks after planting would have prevented plant mortality. Placement of various fertilizers under 'Woodard' or 'Tifblue' plants resulted in a significant increase in plant mortality as compared to side placement of fertilizers. Yield loss due to plant mortality increased linearly with the N level of the fertilizers (ranging from 0 to 2) for both cultivars. 'Woodard' fruit size was not affected by fertilizer placement but placing fertilizers under 'Tifblue' plants produced smaller yields with larger fruit than sidedressed plants. Blueberry plants in a virgin acidic soil may experience no reduction in yield if fertilization is completely eliminated. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","2-s2.0-34249966186"

"13776","Pollen clumping and wind dispersal in an invasive angiosperm","2009","Pollen dispersal is a fundamental aspect of plant reproductive biology that maintains connectivity between spatially separated populations. Pollen clumping, a characteristic feature of insect-pollinated plants, is generally assumed to be a detriment to wind pollination because clumps disperse shorter distances than do solitary pollen grains. Yet pollen clumps have been observed in dispersion studies of some widely distributed wind-pollinated species. We used Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed; Asteraceae), a successful invasive angiosperm, to investigate the effect of clumping on wind dispersal of pollen under natural conditions in a large field. Results of simultaneous measurements of clump size both in pollen shedding from male flowers and airborne pollen being dispersed in the atmosphere are combined with a transport model to show that rather than being detrimental, clumps may actually be advantageous for wind pollination. Initial clumps can pollinate the parent population, while smaller clumps that arise from breakup of larger clumps can cross-pollinate distant populations.","2-s2.0-70349685260"

Twenty-six populations surveyed in N Utah contain a majority of perfect-flowered hermaphrodites, but most (22) also contain male-sterile individuals (females), at frequencies of up to 0.16. The hermaphrodite selfing rate is low (0.00-0.20 in four populations). Maternal gender does not consistently affect components of offspring vigor, such as seed size, germination rate, seedling survivorship, and vegetative size. Plants of the two genders do not differ in number of seeds per fruit or mean seed mass. Females produce significantly more fruits and seeds than hermaphrodites in natural populations. The ratio of the mean lifetime seed production of females to the mean lifetime seed production of hermaphrodites ranged from 1.31-2.52 in six natural populations. Females have greater shoot biomass than hermaphrodites and produce more seeds at any given shoot biomass than hermaphrodites, suggesting that their seed-production advantage arises from gender-specific patterns of resource allocation to growth and reproduction. Nuclear gynodioecy appears to be evolutionarily stable mainly because of resource compensation by females, without a large outcrossing advantage of females. -from Author","2-s2.0-0027047128"

"17504","Compartmentalization of S-RNase and HT-B degradation in self-incompatible Nicotiana","2006","Pollen-pistil interactions are crucial for controlling plant mating. For example, S-RNase-based self-incompatibility prevents inbreeding in diverse angiosperm species. S-RNases are thought to function as specific cytotoxins that inhibit pollen that has an S-haplotype that matches one of those in the pistil. Thus, pollen and pistil factors interact to prevent mating between closely related individuals. Other pistil factors, such as HT-B, 4936-factor and the 120 kDa glycoprotein, are also required for pollen rejection but do not contribute to S-haplotype-specificity per se. Here we show that S-RNase is taken up and sorted to a vacuolar compartment in the pollen tubes. Antibodies to the 120 kDa glycoprotein label the compartment membrane. When the pistil does not express HT-B or 4936-factor, S-RNase remains sequestered, unable to cause rejection. Similarly, in wild-type pistils, compatible pollen tubes degrade HT-B and sequester S-RNase. We suggest that S-RNase trafficking and the stability of HT-B are central to S-specific pollen rejection. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.","2-s2.0-32844456925"
"17112","Sexual selection: Lessons from hermaphrodite mating systems","2006","Over the last 130 years, research has established that (a) sexual selection exists and is widespread in the plant and animal kingdoms; (b) it does not necessarily entail sexual dimorphism; even hermaphrodites have it; (c) it does not require intelligence or a sophisticated sense of esthetics; even tapeworms and plants choose mates; and (d) it does not require brawn or even mobility for competition; plants may compete for pollinators, and broadcast spawning invertebrates may also compete for matings. Although discussions of sexual selection often focus on sexual dimorphism, several phenomena that are commonly associated with sexual selection are widespread and highly developed in hermaphrodites. These phenomena include (a) bizarre and expensive courtship and copulatory behavior, (b) multiple mating and sperm competition, (c) rapid evolution of genitalia, (d) special structures associated with courtship, and (e) sexual polymorphism. The skewed breeding sex ratios associated with sequential hermaphroditism have long been recognized as contributory to sexual selection. In many simultaneous hermaphrodites, although the sex ratio at mating may be one to one, the actual reproductive sex ratio may also be skewed, creating a high potential for sexual selection. Reproductive biology in hermaphroditic taxa also involves a lot of complexity unknown in dioecious taxa, such as sex change, facultative sex allocation and conditional reciprocity that offers opportunities to enrich our understanding of sexual selection and to test the assumptions and predictions of theory. © The Author 2006.

Corn breeders and researchers have considered using haploids to develop inbred lines; however, this procedure has not been practically applied because of the inefficiency of chromosome doubling of maize haploid seedlings. In this report, a procedure has been developed to overcome this difficulty. Maize haploid seedlings obtained from eight different genotypes were treated with nitrous oxide gas (2 days at 600 kPa). Treatment at the six-leaf stage (flower primordia formation stage) significantly increased the occurrence of fertile sectors on both tassels and ears so that approximately half (44%) of the treated haploids produced kernels after self-pollination. In the control, only 11% of haploids produced selfed kernels owing to spontaneous chromosome doubling. A strong genotypic effect on the occurrence of fertile sectors after the treatment was observed. This procedure can be used for inbred line development in maize breeding programmes.","2-s2.0-0036807885"
"21574","Predicting preharvest sprouting susceptibility in barley: A model based on temperature during grain filling","2001","Preharvest sprouting (PHS) susceptibility in cereals is a consequence of low grain dormancy before harvest. Dormancy loss rate depends on genotype and may also be affected by environmental conditions during seed formation. To establish a quantitative relationship between temperature and PHS susceptibility, a malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar, 'Quilmes Palomar', was sown on different dates over a 3-yr period to obtain a range of thermal conditions during grain filling (soil type: Aeric Argiudoll). The period from pollination to physiological maturity (PM) was adjusted to a thermal time (TT) scale, which was then divided into 50°C-day intervals. Mean temperature within each interval was calculated for the different sowing dates. Grain dormancy was monitored using a germination index (GI). We sought a linear relationship between temperature during grain filling and GI at some moment after PM. The strongest correlation (P &lt; 0.0001) was obtained between mean temperature values within the TT interval ranging from 300 to 350°C-day (Tm300-350) and GI values 12 d after PM (GI12DAPM). This indicates that temperature during this sensitivity window explains variability in dormancy level among years and locations for this cultivar, and may therefore explain differences in PHS susceptibility. A regression model (GI12DAPM = 7.14 × (Tm300-350) - 99; r2 = 0.95, n = 9) was generated for predicting GI values 12 d after PM, and tested on commercial plots. The linear relationship between temperature and GI after PM was confirmed, though the effect of one or more undescribed, environmental factors differing among tested locations was revealed.","2-s2.0-0034808710"

The percentage of polymorphic loci was 31.8 and the mean expected heterozygosity was 0.153. Segregation patterns for five polymorphic loci met Mendelian expectations. Outcrossing rates were estimated using single and multilocus methods, and in most cases were not statistically different from 1.0. An excess of heterozygotes, both for seeds and adults, was found, as shown by the fixation indices estimated in 1987 (mean F for adults = -0.41, mean F for seeds = -0.19). Low but significant levels of genetic differentiation were found, especially for adults (mean Fst for adults =0.040, mean Fst for seeds =0.009). There was a positive relationship for adults between trunk growth and an individuals heterozygosity. No significant correlation was found between heterozygosity and fecundity. The genetic structure of A. mexicanum appears to be the result of a balance between cross-pollination and long distance movement of pollen by pollinators (beetles) that reduce genetic differentiation among plots, and natural selection that could operate during the long life cycle of this palm, and may increase the genetic differentiation among sites and the proportion of heterozygotes. The relatively high level of genetic variation, low genetic spatial differentiation, excess of heterozygotes, high outcrossing rate and heterosis found in A. mexicanum seem to be common in tropical trees. These population genetics characteristics appear not to satisfy the conditions necessary for non-adaptive evolution, a hypothesis commonly invoked to explain high tropical tree diversity. Management and conservation strategies aimed at preserving tropical trees high intrapopulation genetic variation will probably require the maintenance of large tree populations. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.","2-s2.0-0027044501"

"27056","Plant Parenthood in Milkweeds: A Direct Test of the Pollen Donation Hypothesis","1990","Abstract For hermaphroditic plant species whose fruit production is limited by maternal resources, the pollen donation hypothesis views large floral displays as an adaptation to enhance the probability of fathering seeds on other plants. This hypothesis has frequently been used to describe the evolution of large floral displays in milkweeds (Asclepias). Most tests of the pollen donation hypothesis, however, have used indirect measures, such as flower production or pollen removal, to estimate male reproductive success. To test the pollen donation hypothesis directly, we performed a paternity analysis and determined the number of seeds sired by individual genotypes in a natural population of poke milkweed, A. exaltata, in southwestern Virginia. Seeds sired (male success) and seeds produced (female success) were significantly correlated with flower number per plant (for male success: r= 0.32, P < 0.05; for female success: r= 0.66, P < 0.0001). Functional gender of plants that reproduced both as males and females (N = 17) was not correlated with flower number per plant (r= 0.35, P>0.05), indicating that plants with large floral displays did not reproduce primarily as males. Percent fruit?set and seed number per fruit were higher in 1986, when levels of pollinarium removal also were higher. Furthermore, several umbels that experienced high pollinator activity selectively matured fruits that contained many seeds. We argue that the evolution of large floral displays in milkweeds is the result of selection to increase overall reproductive success rather than male reproductive success alone.

S-allele diversity of cultivars has been extensively investigated; however, no mutant alleles conferring self-compatibility have been reported. In this study, two European pear cultivars, 'Abugo' and 'Ceremeño', were classified as self-compatible after fruit/seed setting and pollen tube growth examination. S-genotyping through S-PCR and sequencing identified a new S-RNase allele in the two cultivars, with identical deduced amino acid sequence as S 21, but differing at the nucleotide level. Test-pollinations and analysis of descendants suggested that the new allele is a self-compatible pistil-mutated variant of S 21, so it was named S 21 °. S-genotypes assigned to 'Abugo' and 'Ceremeño' were S 10 S 21 ° and S 21 °S 25 respectively, of which S 25 is a new functional S-allele of European pear. Reciprocal crosses between cultivars bearing S 21 and S 21 ° indicated that both alleles exhibit the same pollen function; however, cultivars bearing S 21 ° had impaired pistil-S function as they failed to reject either S 21 or S 21 ° pollen. RT-PCR analysis showed absence of S 21 °-RNase gene expression in styles of 'Abugo' and 'Ceremeño', suggesting a possible origin for S 21 ° pistil dysfunction. Two polymorphisms found within the S-RNase genomic region (a retrotransposon insertion within the intron of S 21 ° and indels at the 3?UTR) might explain the different pattern of expression between S 21 and S 21 °. Evaluation of cultivars with unknown S-genotype identified another cultivar 'Azucar Verde' bearing S 21 °, and pollen tube growth examination confirmed self-compatibility for this cultivar as well.

Within the populations, according to the spatial relation to the nearest opposite morph clone, individual clones were assorted into two spatial types, i.e., clones that congregated with clones of the opposite morph (congregating clones), and clones that occurred singly at a considerable distance from the nearest opposite-morph clone (single clones). The pollination success, i.e., the proportion of legitimately pollinated flowers, and seed set were severely limited in the single clones compared to the congregating clones. Since artificial legitimate pollination improved the seed set in single clones, at least to some degree pollination failure was responsible for the reduced seed set in the single clones.","2-s2.0-0032219070"

Pollens of elite cultivars may not be available at hand. Properly stored pollens provide an opportunity for cross hybridization at unavailable time. Results: Pollen of a Phalaenopsis hybrid was evaluated for the storage ability at different temperatures, including room temperature, 4, ? 20, and ? 80 °C for up to 96 weeks. The viability of pollen was assessed by TTC staining, in vitro germination and hand pollination during and after storage. Pollen stored at all temperatures for 4 weeks remained viable and capable of successful pollination. Pollen lost its viability after 4 weeks at room temperature. Pollen remains viable after 40 weeks at 4 °C, and after 96 weeks at both ? 20 and ? 80 °C of storage. Viable pollen could be successfully pollinated to the female parent at all effective storage conditions and produced seeds. Conclusions: Our results indicate that Phalaenopsis pollen can be stored at 4 °C up to 40 weeks for short-term purpose.

We examined the effects of pollinator visitation and time of season on male- and female-phase duration, using experimental manipulation and survey data from naturally occurring populations of Chamerion (= Epilobium) angustifolium (L.) J. Holub (Onagraceae). 2. Based on the observation that male mating opportunity (numbers of female flowers/numbers of male flowers) increases seasonally, we predicted that individual flowers should spend more time in the male phase early in the season when mating opportunity is low. We predicted that if seasonal changes in mating opportunity select for phase duration, male-phase duration should decline when pollinator effects are experiment controlled. 3. A comparison of phase duration in naturally pollinated and pollinator-excluded plants supported this prediction: male-phase duration in the pollinator-exclusion treatment was longer and declined faster than in the naturally pollinated group. 4. A population survey revealed that once the effects of temperature were controlled for, male-phase duration was negatively correlated with date, while female-phase duration was positively correlated with date. 5. These findings suggest that seasonal variation in mating opportunity, and not just pollination rate or temperature, may play a significant role in phase duration in dichogamous plants.","2-s2.0-0033825612"

This technique is potentially useful in studying pollen flow within and between populations and in detecting flower constancy of pollinators. This technique is advantageous when compared with the use of radioactive tracers because potential health and environmental hazards inherent in the field use of unstable isotopes are eliminated. © 1974, The New York Botanical Garden.

"13893","Multilocus genomics of outcrossing plant populations","2009","The structure and organization of natural plant populations can be understood by estimating the genetic parameters related to mating behavior, recombination frequency, and gene associations with DNA-based markers typed throughout the genome. We developed a statistical and computational model for estimating and testing these parameters from multilocus data collected in a natural population. This model, constructed by a maximum likelihood approach and implemented within the EM algorithm, is shown to be robust for simultaneously estimating the outcrossing rate, recombination frequencies and linkage disequilibria. The algorithm built with three or more markers allows the characterization of crossover interference in meiosis and high-order disequilibria among different genes, thus providing a powerful tool for illustrating a detailed picture of genetic diversity and organization in natural populations. Computer simulations demonstrate the statistical properties of the proposed model. This multilocus model will be useful for studying the pattern and amount of genetic variation within and among populations to further infer the evolutionary history of a plant species. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

After subsequent culture in a greenhouse, the treatment resulted in an improved production of flowers, hips and seeds resulting either from self- or cross-pollinations. It also determined a specific morphology of the styles and an improved in vitro elongation of the pollen tubes. The cold pre-treatment effect could be explained by its influence on fertility. This influence, although diminishing, could still be demonstrated after pollination on the second flush of flowers. © 1992.","2-s2.0-44049118483"
"10109","Pollinator attraction of the wasp-flower Scrophularia umbrosa (Scrophulariaceae)","2012","Certain species of Scrophularia (Scrophulariaceae), such as S. nodosa and S. umbrosa, are mainly pollinated by social wasps and are consequently described as wasp-flowers. Because plants attract their pollinators with the help of various floral cues, such as floral odour and/or optical cues, we have investigated the role of olfactory and visual floral signals responsible for wasp attraction in S. umbrosa. Using a combination of chemical (GC, GC-MS) and electrophysiological analyses (GC-EAD), we identified ten compounds in the complex floral odour bouquet that are detectable by the wasps' antennae. As in the wasp-flower Epipactis helleborine, we found so-called 'green leaf volatiles' (GLVs) in the floral odour; these GLVs are highly attractive to the wasps. GLVs, mostly six-carbon aldehydes, alcohols and acetates, and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are emitted by many plants infested with herbivores, e.g. caterpillars. In contrast to other investigated wasp-flowers, behavioural experiments have demonstrated that, in addition to the floral odour of S. umbrosa, visual cues are involved in pollinator attraction. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","2-s2.0-84859424750"
"26167","Developmental expression of tobacco pistil-specific genes encoding novel extensin-like proteins","1992","We have sought to identify pistil-specific genes that can be used as molecular markers to study pistil development. For this purpose, a cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from tobacco stigmas and styles at different developmental stages. Differential screening of this library led to the isolation of cDNA clones that correspond to genes preferentially or specifically expressed in the pistil. Seven of these cDNA clones encode proteins containing repetitions of the pentapeptide Ser-Pro4, which is a typical motif found in extensins. Unlike extensin genes, the extensin-like genes described here are not induced under stress conditions. RNA gel blot hybridizations demonstrated the organ-specific expression of the extensin-like genes and their temporal regulation during pistil development. After pollination, the transcript levels of the pistil-specific extensin-like genes change relative to levels in unpollinated pistils. In situ hybridization experiments showed that at least one of these pistil-specific genes is specifically expressed in cells of the transmitting tissue. The possible roles of the extensin-like proteins in pistils are discussed.","2-s2.0-0026914536"
"21594","The costs of mutualism","2001","Mutualisms arc of central importance in biological systems. Despite growing attention in recent years, however, few conceptual themes have yet to be identified that span mutualisms differing in natural history. Here I examine the idea that the ecology and evolution of mutualisms are shaped by diverse costs, not only by the benefits they confer. This concept helps link mutualism to antagonisms such as herbivory, prédation, and parasitism, interactions defined largely by the existence of costs. I first briefly review the range of costs associated with mutualisms, then describe how one cost, the consumption of seeds by pollinator offspring, was quantified for one fig/pollinator mutualism. I compare this cost to published values for other fig/pollinator mutualisms and for other kinds of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms, notably the yucca/yucca moth interaction. I then discuss four issues that fundamentally complicate comparative studies of the cost of mutualism:. problems of knowing how to measure the magnitude of any one cost accurately; problems associated with using average estimates in the absence of data on sources of variation; complications arising from the complex correlates of costs, such as functional linkages between costs and benefits; and problems that arise from considering the cost of mutualism as a unilateral issue in what is fundamentally a reciprocal interaction. The rich diversity of as-yet unaddressed questions surrounding the costs of mutualism may best be investigated via detailed studies of individual interactions.","2-s2.0-33746029457"

These seeds were germinated and both diploid embryos and haploid gametophytes were analyzed by starch-gel electrophoresis. Eleven variable loci were resolved for both kinds of tissue and used as genetic markers for estimating outcrossing rates. Estimates made with single-locus and multilocus methods both indicated that the proportion of viable embryos resulting from outcrossing is about 0.90 for the natural stands, and for the seed orchard. Comparison of single-locus and multilocus estimates of outcrossing rates indicated that little or no inbreeding other than selfing occurred. Estimated outcrossing rates were higher for seeds from the upper portion of the crown than for seeds from the lower crown. It was also found that some trees selfed at a much higher rate than other trees. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.","2-s2.0-34250225878"

The genomic changes that occur in resynthesized or natural neopolyploids have been extensively studied, but little is known about the effects of the reproductive mode in the initial generations that may precede its successful establishment. To truly reflect the early generations of a nascent polyploid, two resynthesized allotetraploid Brassica napus populations were obtained for the first time by open pollination. In these populations, we detected a much lower level of aneuploidy (third generation) compared with those previously published populations obtained by controlled successive selfing. We specifically studied 33 resynthesized B. napus individuals from our two open pollinated populations, and showed that meiosis was affected in both populations. Their genomes were deeply shuffled after allopolyploidization: up to 8.5 and 3.5% of the C and A subgenomes were deleted in only two generations. The identified deletions occurred mainly at the distal part of the chromosome, and to a significantly greater extent on the C rather than the A subgenome. Using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (BAC-FISH), we demonstrated that four of these deletions corresponded to fixed translocations (via homeologous exchanges). We were able to evaluate the size of the structural variations and their impact on the whole genome size, gene content, and allelic diversity. In addition, the evolution of fertility was assessed, to better understand the difficulty encountered by novel polyploid individuals before the putative formation of a novel stable species. © 2017 Rousseau-Gueutin et al.","2-s2.0-85012897028"
"28191","The self fertility status of some sunflower cultivars in Australia","1986","Sunflower self fertility, as measured by the effects of autogamous pollination and genetic self compatibility, was found to vary between hybrids and between seasons. Of 24 hybrids tested under uniform fertile, irrigated conditions, only two achieved high yields without honey bees. Three were self fertile in terms of seed numbers. Seven achieved self fertility in terms of seed yield due to artifact effects (e.g. compensatory seed growth), and of these only three were high-yielding and satisfactory agronomically. A good seed set of 80% or more in terms of seed number needs to be supported by an artifact ratio (AR) for self fertility (% by weight divided by % by number) of between 1.25 and 1.30 to ensure 100% self fertility in terms of seed yield. For Sunfola 68.2, the open-pollinated cultivar, and for most of the 23 hybrid cultivars examined, a significant positive response in seed set was obtained due to the presence of honey bees. For exclusion of insects tulle net bags were greatly superior to paper bags, and for trials on farmers' properties bags were much easier to use than cages. Pollination due to wind and insects smaller than honey bees did not exceed 9%, confirming that wind was of neglegible importance, and that the honey bee was the principal insect pollinator. Consequently, until self fertility is achieved genetically under a wide range of environmental conditions, honey bees are needed to maximize sunflower yields, especially under ideal growing conditions. © 1986.","2-s2.0-46149135161"

The flowers of both genders of G. schomburgkiana (sect. Polythecandra) and of C. columnaris (sect. Omphalanthera) offer resin as a reward for small bees acting as pollinators. In both species the androecial morphology is highly derived. Functionally, this can be interpreted in terms of minimization of contact of the sticky resin and the pollen. Male flowers of C. pusilla and Clusia sp. of sect. Clusiastrum offer pollen as a reward for large, middle-sized and small bees, who vibrate the anthers to collect pollen. Female flowers are rewardless and unusual in the gems by the presence of long styles. The pollinating bees are probably deceived by the combination of papillose stigmas and the yellowish staminodes directly below these. The bees pollinate the stigmas when trying to vibrate them. The evolution of the flower biology in the genus Clusia is briefly discussed.","2-s2.0-0030449788"
"313","Dichogamy and style curvature avoid self-pollination in Eremurus altaicus","2018","This paper gives a systematic study of Eremurus altaicus in terms of flowering characteristics, pollinating features, style movement pattern, stigma receptivity and mating system. The result showed that it was protandrous and that the stigma had no receptivity until the end of pollen dispersal. Its style showed a regular movement pattern during the flowering phase. The style was upright, very close to anthers at first; then it quickly curved down 90° from the base just before the dehiscing of anthers, but went back to the former upright state after pollen dispersal of all 6 anthers. From the blossoming to the end of pollen dispersal, the stigma was smooth and dry, and had no receptivity to pollens until the style went back to the upright state with papillae, and mucus appeared. The curving down movement of the style significantly widened the relative distance between the stigma and the dehiscing anthers. Therefore, protandry and style movement are double safeguard mechanisms for avoiding selfing and promoting outcrossing in Eremurus altaicus, which has important significance in its reproduction and evolution potential.","2-s2.0-85040929876"

In this study, we tested this suspicion in one species of Plagiostachys (Plagiostachys austrosinensis). Field observations suggested that flexistyly was present in this species, and stigmatic behavior was similar to that reported for Alpinia and Amomum species. Two phenotypes (anaflexistylous and cataflexistylous) occurred in a ratio of 1:1 in natural populations. Anthesis began around 1530-1600 h and lasted for about 24 h. Pollen viability and stigma receptivity remained high throughout the flowering process. Mean nectar volume (4.15-11.30 ?L) and mean sugar concentration (>32%) also remained at a high level during the flowering process. No fruit set occurred in unpollinated bagged plants. Two pollinators (Bombus pyrosoma and Vespidae spp.) and one pollen robber (Mutillidae spp.) were found as flower visitors. Fruit set following self-pollination and cross-pollination did not differ significantly in the cataflexistylous morph. Partial self-incompatibility was apparent in the anaflexistylous morph.

This study was performed morphologically and anatomically to investigate reproduction in this species for the purpose of conservation. The duration from reproductive bud formation to fertilization in C. wilsoniana lasts about one year and five months. Buds are initiated in late January and differentiate into one vegetative bud and 3 female cones in late February. A female cone is constructed with 4 pairs of decussate opposite bracts. A small ridge-like secondary axis sits on the axil of each bract. Two ovules are borne on both sides of each secondary axis. A lysogenous pollen chamber begins to be formed from the degenerative tissues on the top end of the nucellus in early March. In late March the megasporogenous tissue is differentiated in the core center of the nucellus, and the micropyle closes gradually after pollination. By late July, pollen tubes have developed in the pollen chamber, and the megaspore mother cell appears. Then the functional megaspore becomes active in mid-October. The 8 free nucleate macrogametophyte appears in late December. From January to late March of the following year, the elliptical cyst-like female gametophyte keeps growing through continuous divisions of its free nuclei. The cyst layer of protoplast thickens in early April. In mid-April, cell walls begin to form among free nuclei. The archegonia are initiated in late April. Pollen tubes extend their tips to the macrogametophyte in early May, and each tube with 2 spermatozoids reaches a mature archegonium with an egg needed to perform fertilization in late May. Generally, only 1-(3) ovules in each cone can become mature.","2-s2.0-0035319050"
"1842","Pollinator-mediated interactions in experimental arrays vary with neighbor identity","2017","PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Local ecological conditions influence the impact of species interactions on evolution and community structure. We investigated whether pollinator-mediated interactions between coflowering plants vary with plant density, coflowering neighbor identity, and flowering season. METHODS: We conducted a field experiment in which flowering time and floral neighborhood were manipulated in a factorial design. Early- and late-flowering Clarkia unguiculata plants were placed into arrays with C. biloba neighbors, noncongeneric neighbors, additional conspecific plants, or no additional plants as a density control. We compared whole-plant pollen limitation of seed set, pollinator behavior, and pollen deposition among treatments. KEY RESULTS: Interactions mediated by shared pollinators depended on the identity of the neighbor and possibly changed through time, although flowering-season comparisons were compromised by low early-season plant survival. Interactions with conspecific neighbors were likely competitive late in the season. Interactions with C. biloba appeared to involve facilitation or neutral interactions. Interactions with noncongeners were more consistently competitive. The community composition of pollinators varied among treatment combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator-mediated interactions involved competition and likely facilitation, depending on coflowering neighbor. Experimental manipulation helped to reveal context-dependent variation in indirect biotic interactions. © 2017 Botanical Society of America.","2-s2.0-85013500023"

"8418","How pollen organic matter enters freshwater food webs","2013","Huge amounts of pollen can accumulate at the air-water interface during the floral bloom of wind-pollinated trees. We hypothesized that such pollen rains act as subsidy pulses, promoting the development of a neustonic microbial food web and the transfer of pollen organic carbon to aquatic consumers. During a pine pollen rain event on an oxbow lake, microorganism concentrations were by far higher in the neuston, where pollen grains accumulated, than in the seston. Zooplankton species were also unevenly distributed in the two compartments. Bulk isotope and isotopes of fatty acid analyses revealed trophic partitioning among these zooplankton species, with some of the taxa foraging specifically on neuston, where they benefit from pollen-derived carbon. Microorganisms were identified as a key element in the trophic upgrading of pollen food quality and in the transfer of pollen carbon to metazoan consumers. Pollen rains may thus contribute, as an allochthonous food pulse, to aquatic production at specific seasons, but they may also act as a structuring factor in lake habitats. © 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.","2-s2.0-84878763643"

The distyly is characterized by the presence of pin (L) and thrum (B) floral morphs in different individual and the dependence on intermorph pollinations (L x B or B x L) of fruit set, is expected to be at balanced proportions (isopleths) of the individuals in the population. The purpose of this study was to determine, for the species mentioned above, the proportion of floral morphs in an area of seven hectares, the dependence on pollinators by testing the intramorph incompatibility (L x L and B x B) by in vivo controlled pollinations; the viability of pollen grains and the existence of grain size dimorphism among floral morphs, and to quantify the production of fruits and seeds per morph. The floral morphs of the species was found in balanced proportions. There was an incompatibility and the viability of pollen grains was high (> 64%). Grains presented dimorphism; the highest diameters were the B. The production of fruits and seeds (one or two) of the morphs of P. sessilis and P. conjugens were similar and in P. hastisepala they were higher in B.

"5355","The generalist Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana (Fabaceae): Negative effect of floral visitors on reproductive success?","2015","Inga species are characterised by generalist or mixed pollination system. However, this feature does not enhance reproductive rates in species with very low fruit set under natural conditions. Some ecological and genetic factors are associated with this feature, and to test the effect of massive visits on pollination success in Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana, we studied the efficacy of polyads deposited on stigmas of flowers isolated from visitors and polyads exposed to visitors. The proportion of polyads fixed in stigmas decreased after exposure to visitors (24 h) in comparison to stigmas isolated from visitors (hummingbirds, bees, wasps, hawkmoths and bats), and fruit set was very low. Furthermore, nectar production, sugar composition and other floral biology traits were evaluated. Increased nectar production, sugar availability and sucrose dominance during the night indicates adaptation to nocturnal visitors and supports their role as main pollinators; although the brush-flower morphology, time of anthesis, nectar dynamics and chemical composition also allow daytime visitors. Thus the species is an important resource for a diverse group of floral visitors. We conclude that excess visits (diurnal and nocturnal) are responsible for the decrease in fixed polyads in stigmas of I. subnuda subsp. luschnathiana flowers, thus contributing, with others factors, to its low fruit set. Therefore, the generalist pollination system does not result in reproductive advantages because the low fruit set in natural conditions could be the result of a negative effect of visitors/pollinators. © 2014 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","2-s2.0-84927689605"
"1231","Quantification of the zygotic barrier between interbreeding taxa using gene flow data","2017","Hybridization and introgression via interspecific gene flow are common processes in the plant kingdom. The effectiveness of these processes is governed by the strengths of multiple zygotic barriers. These barriers have often been quantified in artificial settings using laborious and time-consuming hand-pollination experiments, but their quantification is nonexistent in the landscape. In this study, we utilized gene flow data within a spatially explicit simulation to assess the strengths of zygotic barriers. Our model system consisted of Populus nigra and its hybrid, P. × canadensis, which interbreed under natural conditions. The study population was located in the floodplain of the Eder River in central Germany. Pollen-mediated introgression rates from hybrid males into the seeds of individual female trees were used as the target pattern using an inverse modeling approach. Simulations that treated pollen from both taxa equally revealed a large discrepancy between the observed and modeled rates of introgression for both taxa. The discrepancy was reduced by introducing a zygotic barrier against the pollen from the hybrid males. The best model outcome values indicated comparably strong zygotic barriers acting against pollen-mediated introgressive gene flow into the two parental taxa, P. nigra and P. × canadensis. The sensitivity of our model was tested by applying different dispersal functions. Four common probability density functions were used along with a pollen dispersal function that had previously been fitted to gene flow data from the same dataset. The best barrier value was almost independent of the dispersal functions used here. Moreover, it was within the range previously determined in hand-pollination-based investigations, validating our model. These data indicate that the inverse modeling approach is a powerful method for quantifying hidden processes, and we discuss its use as a valuable tool for generating new insights into plant mating systems that are relevant to evolutionary biology and risk analyses in conservation efforts. © 2016 The Authors","2-s2.0-85006981558"

However, the extent to which separate traits that attract different mutualist guilds display negative or positive relationships remains largely unstudied. We asked whether correlations exist among extrafloral nectary traits to attract arthropod bodyguards and floral traits to attract pollinator mutualists. For 37 species in the cotton genus (Gossypium), we evaluated correlations among six extrafloral nectary traits and four floral traits in a common greenhouse environment, with and without correction for phylogenetic non-independence. Across Gossypium species, greater investment in extrafloral nectary traits was positively correlated with greater investment in floral traits. Positive correlations remained after accounting for the evolutionary history of the clade. Our results demonstrate that traits to maintain multiple mutualist guilds can be positively correlated across related species and build a more general understanding of the constraints on trait evolution in plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-83555174497"

Stachys annua is an excellent nectar-producer, and from the nectar collected in its habitats popular stubble-honey was produced. This vegetation type has suffered significant decline, mainly due to the early ploughing of stubbles associated with the intensification of agriculture. In the present study, the floristic composition of this community is assessed based on 213 phytosociological records, and its distribution in the past ten years in western Hungary is mapped. Sixty-five percent of the species are of Eurasian, European and Mediterranean elements, and the largest proportion of the species are spring-germinating summer annuals. The proportion of insect-pollinated plant species is approximately 70%, and the species composition also offers significant seed food sources for farmland birds, e.g. Coturnix coturnix and Perdix perdix. Therefore this community should deserve a high conservation priority for biodiversity.

"10765","The habitat disruption induces immune-suppression and oxidative stress in honey bees","2011","The honey bee is a major insect used for pollination of many commercial crops worldwide. Although the use of honey bees for pollination can disrupt the habitat, the effects on their physiology have never been determined. Recently, honey bee colonies have often collapsed when introduced in greenhouses for pollination in Japan. Thus, suppressing colony collapses and maintaining the number of worker bees in the colonies is essential for successful long-term pollination in greenhouses and recycling of honey bee colonies. To understand the physiological states of honey bees used for long-term pollination in greenhouses, we characterized their gene expression profiles bymicroarray.We found that the greenhouse environment changes the gene expression profiles andinduces immune-suppression and oxidative stress in honey bees. In fact, the increase of the number of Nosema microsporidia and protein carbonyl content was observed in honey bees during pollination in greenhouses. Thus, honey bee colonies are likely to collapse during pollination in greenhouses when heavily infested with pathogens. Degradation of honey bee habitat by changing the outside environment of the colony, during pollination services for example, imposes negative impacts on honey bees. Thus, worldwide use of honey bees for crop pollination in general could be one of reasons for the decline of managed honey bee colonies. © 2011 The Authors.","2-s2.0-84864326049"
"6404","Assessing the risk of exotic gene flow from Eucalyptus globulus plantations to native E. ovata forests","2014","The recent rapid expansion of Eucalyptus plantations in Australia has raised concern that exotic gene flow could pose a genetic risk to indigenous eucalypt species. The most widely used plantation species Eucalyptus globulus, now covers about 538,000ha of southern Australia. Eucalyptus ovata is a common plantation neighbour, and this paper assesses the likelihood of exotic gene flow from E. globulus plantations to remnant E. ovata forests by assessing three key processes. Firstly, the effect of patch size on the rate of F1 hybridisation was investigated. Open pollinated seed was collected off native E. ovata trees from five patch-size classes in and around plantations (142 trees from 25 patches). Hybridisation was then assessed in 24,322 open pollinated progeny. The overall rate of exotic hybridisation was 1.62%, with small patches having higher rates than larger patches, as did trees on the edges of patches and paddock trees in open pasture 50-200m from the plantation edge. Secondly, natural hybrid establishment was investigated along 3.9km of plantation-native forest boundary that was classified as being high risk for hybridisation and establishment. Of the 745 seedlings found, only 1% of seedlings were identified as E. ovata×globulus F1 hybrids, with 73% being pure E. ovata and 26% pure E. globulus seedlings (wildlings). Finally, evidence for selection against hybrids was found when assessing the survival of naturally established E. globulus×ovata F1's that were paired with E. ovata in fire affected native forest beside a plantation. After six years the exotic hybrids were 78% less likely to survive than the pure E. ovata seedlings. It is concluded that hybrid fitness appears to be an important barrier to exotic gene flow and introgression between E. globulus and E. ovata. However, E. globulus wildlings are establishing along the boundaries of native forest, and could have a greater impact on the integrity of E. ovata populations close to plantations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84888128209"
"23569","Relationships of chestnut species and New Zealand chestnut selections using morpho-nut characters","1998","Forty-nine morpho-nut characters were measured over the period 1994-1996 to study the relationships of 23 accessions of chestnut representing five lines of known chestnut species and 18 lines of New Zealand (NZ) chestnut selections. The study was prompted by the lack of knowledge of the parentage of NZ chestnut selections. These are presumed to be hybrids resulting from uncontrolled open pollination of the introduced chestnut species in NZ, most especially, Castanea sativa (European species) and C. crenata (Japanese species). Data were analysed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Unweighted Pair Group Mean (UPGMA) method of cluster analysis. Thirty-one characters out of the 49 used in the study accounted for the major variations among accessions. Results from both methods agreed and showed the separation of the chestnut species and NZ selections along geographic lines. The South Island selections were found to be mostly C. sativa-like while the North Island selections were mostly C. crenata-like. The discrimination between groups and description of differences between groups were more strongly marked from the PCA than in the UPGMA cluster analysis.","2-s2.0-0031886618"

"18538","Comparative analysis of early embryonic sunflower cDNA libraries","2005","To gain information concerning cell functions and activities during sunflower embryogenesis, an expressed sequence tag (EST) approach was used to analyse gene expression in the early stages of sunflower embryos development. Confocal microscopy observations of whole-mounted embryos allowed us to identify precisely the major steps of the zygotic embryonic development. A time-course analysis was then employed to collect the embryonic material. Three cDNA libraries were constructed from microdissected embryos, and three other cDNA libraries were created using a classical day after pollination schedule. A total of 7106 ESTs were produced and assembled. The total number of putative different genes represents about 43.1 (3064 tentative contigs and singlets) of the analysed sequences. The unigenes that showed similarity to proteins with known or predicted functions (50.3) were classified into 15 different functional categories. The functional profiles were found to be quite similar for all studied embryo stages but statistical analysis revealed that successive and coordinate sets of genes are expressed at each embryonic stage. The analysis allowed us to identify abundant and differentially expressed genes at the early stages of embryos development as well as some putatively interesting genes, showing strong similarities with genes playing key roles in plant and animal embryogenesis. The data presented in this study not only provide a first global overview of the genes expression profile during sunflower embryogenesis but also represent an original and valuable tool for developmental genomics studies on exalbuminous dicots. © Springer 2005.","2-s2.0-20244368684"

This study was conducted to increase efficiency by investigating effects of genotype, medium, and ovule removal age on ovule elongation, embryo recovery, growth, and plantlet formation. Ovules from self-pollinated berries of seedless varieties Sunmuscat, Merbein Seedless, and Marroo Seedless were cultured at 30, 43, 60, and 70 days after flowering (DAF) in a range of media, some of which were supplemented with gibberellic acid (GA3) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The effect of activated charcoal (AC) in media on rescued embryos was also investigated. Ovules exhibited continuous growth in vivo and in vitro. The most vigorous growth was observed for ovules cultured at 30 and 43 DAF, but more embryos were recovered from ovules cultured at 60 and 70 DAF. Ovule growth and embryo production in vitro were improved in Bouquet and Davis (BD) and Nitsch and Nitsch (NN) media. Supplementation with GA3 increased embryo recovery rates. Highest embryo recovery rates were 18.1%, 9.6%, and 12.2% for Sunmuscat, Merbein Seedless, and Marroo Seedless, respectively, when ovules were excised and cultured at 60 or 70 DAF in either BD or NN media. In vitro embryo survival and plantlet formation were higher for torpedo-shaped embryos, and improved greatly in 6-benzyladenine (BA)-supplemented woody plant (WP) medium containing 0.3% AC. Embryo recovery was improved by excising and culturing ovules at 60 DAF in BD or NN media and then by transferring embryos to WP medium supplemented with BA and AC.","2-s2.0-0142027928"

Although autogamy with selfing is hypothesized to reduce levels of inbreeding depression, both populations showed similarly high inbreeding depression manifested as reduced fruit set. Autogamy may be uncorrelated with selfing rate because autogamy is not obligate and because geitonogamy is likely. Autogamy in the Virginia population seems most likely to have evolved for reproductive assurance under competition for pollinator service. Fruit set was pollination limited in the Virginia population apparently because bumblebee pollinators were more attracted to a coflowering species, Vaccinium erythrocarpum. -from Authors","2-s2.0-0027800712"

The effects of flower number on the success of individual flowers at three levels (inflorescence, individual, and population) were considered. During 1995 and 1996, variations in size, light availability to branches, floral display size, and fruit set were monitored in 37 out of 211 individual S. obassia trees in a 4-ha forest plot. In addition, the locations of the 211 trees in this plot were mapped and the number of inflorescences in each tree was counted. A multiple regression analysis showed that flower number per inflorescence and inflorescence number per individual had negative effects on fruit set, and inflorescence number of aggregated clumps of flowering trees, tree size, and light resource had positive effects on fruit set although significant level were marginal. It is concluded that pollinator attraction may occur not at the individual tree level, but at the level of a clump of flowering trees. It is also suggested that geitonogamy increased with inflorescence number of tree and inflorescence size and that resource limitation was related to the light condition and variation of tree size.","2-s2.0-0033302707"

Fourty hybrid embryos from each cross were sampled at 6 different times from 3 to 13 days after pollination. In all of the crosses, chromosome elimination occurred very frequently by about 9 days after pollination and a number of dihaploid cells were observed. The maximum rate of chromosome elimination was observed in the period of 3 to 5 days after pollination. It was deary indicated that degree of chromosome elimination or dihaploid frequencies were quite different between the crosses with #191 and #487 but not different between reciprocals. This strongly suggests that the chromosome elimination is mainly controlled by nuclear gene(s) involved in bulbosum parents, but affected little by cytoplasms of these two species. © 1983, The Genetics Society of Japan.

"14623","Little evidence for negative effects of an invasive alien plant on pollinator services","2008","Many invasive alien plants occur in large populations with abundant flowers which are highly attractive to pollinators, and thus might affect pollination of co-occurring native species. This study focuses on the invasive Heracleum mantegazzianum and distance-dependent effects on pollination of Mimulus guttatus in abandoned grassland over 2 years. First, we examined pollinator abundance in yellow traps at 0, 10, 30 and 60-200 m from H. mantegazzianum. We then placed M. guttatus plants at the same distances to monitor effects of the invasive species on pollinator visitation and seed set of neighbouring plants. Finally, we conducted a garden experiment to test if deposition of H. mantegazzianum pollen reduces seed set in M. guttatus. No distance effect was found for the number of bumblebees in traps, although the invasive species attracted a diverse assemblage of insects, and visitation of M. guttatus was enhanced close to H. mantegazzianum. This positive effect was not reflected by seed set of M. guttatus, and heterospecific pollen decreased seed set in these plants. Overall there is little evidence for negative effects of the invasive species on pollination of neighbouring plants, and flower visitation even increases close to the invaded patches. The functional role of the invader and suitable control strategies need further clarification, since removal of H. mantegazzianum may actually damage local pollinator populations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-54849424631"

Discriminant analyses of 15 quantitative traits separated C. sargentii and C. forbesii from taxa within the C. arizonica complex (C. arizonica, C. glabra, C. stephensonii, C. nevadensis, and C. montana); aligned a population of C. arizonica from Sierra de Arteaga, Mexico, with families of the same taxon from southwestern United States; and described a close relationship between C. nevadensis and C glabra, but nevertheless separated taxa within the C. arizonica complex. Analyses of wind-pollinated progenies of single trees showed the narrow endemic, C. glabra, to have a greater degree of population differentiation than the more broadly dispersed C. arizonica. In addition, genetic variances within the numerically small populations of C. arizonica were about the same as in the much larger populations of C. glabra. The results also suggested that genetic variability in C. stephensonii, a taxon occurring in a single population, may occur primarily among inbred lines. While the genetic structures of C. arizonica and C. glabra have counterparts among broadly dispersed conifers, that of C. stephensonii appears to be unique. Together, the results support the view that genetic structure primarily reflects the uncertain, chance events thai are interspersed throughout evolutionary history.","2-s2.0-0030617050"
"3191","Small bees overheat in sunlit flowers: Do they make cooling flights?","2016","Although thermoregulation by large bees in cool climates has been well studied, less is known about the very different thermoregulatory strategies of small bees, especially those subjected to heat stress. Studies were carried out on small (<20mg fresh weight), dark-coloured, solitary bees (mostly halictids and hylaeine colletids) experiencing an extreme radiative heat load, enhanced by the high-altitude location and by reflection of incident radiation by the high-albedo petals of the flowers of Potentilla lancinata. When foraging in the flowers, such bees experienced peak operative temperatures exceeding 44°C. In these conditions, males largely stopped foraging but females continued, usually limiting their flower visits to a few seconds and making frequent short flights. These flights would cool the bees down, because bees suspended in air were cooler than bees in sunlit flowers, and convective cooling during flight would further enhance the cooling effect of departure from the flower. As far as is known, cooling flights in small bees have not been proposed before, providing a new avenue for exploration of bee thermoregulatory strategies. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.","2-s2.0-84961785407"

(Moraceae), a critically endangered species distributed in the Bonin Islands of Japan, we need to distinguish between pure M. boninensis and hybrid (M. boninensis x M. acidosa Griff.) seedlings within populations derived from M. boninensis mother trees. Therefore, we developed three co-dominant SCAR (Sequence Characterized Amplified Region) markers to distinguish between M. boninensis, M. acidosa and their hybrids. All three markers could clearly identify the species and the hybrids, although we observed one case of a putative null allele or a backcross at one locus (Mos0251-l). Hence, we suggest that pure and hybrid seedlings could be unambiguously identified by the simultaneous use of the three markers. When we investigated a seedling population produced by a single mother tree growing in the Iguma-bay population of Haha-jima Island, the proportion of embryos formed by pollination from M. acidosa pollen was about 13%. All hybrid seedlings identified according to the molecular markers showed incisions in their leaves, a morphological character that has never been observed in pure M. boninensis individuals. Our results suggest that M. boninensis can potentially be multiply by excluding hybrids from the seedling pools, using incisions on the leaves as morphological markers to identify them.","2-s2.0-0141503906"

Batsch] using QTL analysis and deep sequencing","2015","Peach and nectarine quality traits such as flavor, texture, and juiciness are important for consumer acceptance. Maturity date (MD) also plays a role in the fruit-ripening process and is an important factor for marketing fresh fruit. On the other hand, cold storage produces a physiological disorder known as chilling injury where the most important symptom is a lack of juice in the flesh or mealiness (M). In this study, we analyzed an F2 population obtained from a self-pollination of Venus nectarine that segregates for MD and M. We built a linkage map with 1,830 SNPs, 7 SSRs and two slow-ripening (SR) morphological markers, spanning 389.2 cM distributed over eight linkage groups (LGs). The SR trait was mapped to LG4 and we compared the whole genome sequences of a SR individual and Venus and identified a deletion of 26.6 kb containing ppa008301m (ANAC072) co-localized with the SR trait. Three Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for MD were detected; they all co-localize on LG4 between 31.0 and 42.0 cM. Four co-localizing QTLs on LG4 between 33.3 and 40.3 cM were detected for M, explaining 34 % of the phenotypic variation. We identified five and nine candidate genes (CGs) for MD and M from the QTL regions, respectively. Our results suggest that the transcription factors (TFs) ANAC072 and ppa010982m (ERF4) are CGs for both traits. LG4 contains a cluster for genetic factors that possibly regulate M and MD, but functional validation is necessary to unravel the complexity of genetic control responsible for fruit traits. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-84938359731"

The S-allele associated ribonucleases (S-RNases) in the pistil are involved in pollen rejection. In this work, we analyzed two newly isolated lines of Petunia hybrida, termed PB and PF. They both had the same set of S-RNases (SB1- and SB2-RNases), however the PB was a self-incompatible diploid while PF was a self-compatible tetraploid. Cross pollination tests between PB and PF indicated diploid pollen from PF lost the incompatibility phenotype. In order to clarify the effects of polyploidy on pollen phenotypic change, we artificially induced tetraploid plants from a diploid SB1SB2 heterozygote (=PB) and a diploid SB1SB1 homozygote. The obtained SB1SB1SB1SB1 homoallelic tetraploid remained self-incompatible, whereas the SB1SB1SB2SB2 heteroallelic tetraploid became self-compatible. These data suggested that the diploid heteroallelic pollen lost the incompatibility phenotype and had the characteristics of self-compatibility with SB1SB2 style. © 1999, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Purple carrot production for this purpose is concentrated in Ere?li District in Konya Province, and open-pollinated local purple carrot cultivars or landraces have been used for this production. Genetic variation within the local purple carrot populations in this region is of interest to plant breeders worldwide for the development of new purple carrot cultivars. Therefore, in this study, genetic variation within the purple carrot population grown in Ere?li District was assessed using SSR markers. Purple carrot samples were collected by visiting 14 purple carrot growing fields in this region. A total of 20 SSR markers were used. Two SSR markers were monomorphic and the remaining 18 SSR markers amplified 106 SSR alleles. The number of polymorphic alleles per SSR marker ranged from 1 to 14. The polymorphism information content varied from 0.29 to 0.85, and the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.32 to 0.87. STRUCTURE analysis indicated the presence of two distinct populations within the purple carrot genotypes used in carrot production in Ere?li District. The genetic similarity of the genotypes ranged from 0.20 to 0.70.

SRAP (Sequence-related Amplified Polymorphism) was used to determine true hybrids among 184 progeny of Z136 × Z039 and 103 progeny of Z039 × Z136. Two hundred SRAP primer combinations were tested to discriminate between Z136 and Z039. Twenty-six primer combinations revealed bands specific to Z039 but absent in Z136, and 35 primer combinations revealed the specific bands present in Z136 and absent in Z039. Eleven primer combinations with the specific bands of Z039 and other eleven primer combinations with the specific bands of Z136 were used to identify the true hybrids among the progeny. The results showed that 168 progeny of Z136 × Z039 and 99 progeny of Z039 × Z136 showed bands specific to the male parent, which were identified to be true hybrids. The remaining progeny were considered to be the result of self-pollination.

S. viridis is considered to be the new model plant for the study of C4 system in monocots and so an effective crossing protocol is urgently needed. S. viridis is a small grass with C4-NADP (ME) type of photosynthesis and has the advantage of having small genome of about 515 Mb, small plant stature, short life cycle, multiple tillers, and profuse seed set, and hence is an ideal model species for research. The objectives of this project were to develop efficient methods of emasculation and pollination, and to speed up generation advancement. We assessed the response of S. viridis flowers to hot water treatment (48° C) and to different concentrations of gibberellic acid, abscisic acid, maleic hydrazide (MH), and kinetin. We found that 500 ?M of MH was effective in the emasculation of S. viridis, whilst still retaining the receptivity of the stigma to pollination.

"6800","Sugar type and concentration preference of the cape white-eye, Zosterops virens","2014","Differences in nectar characteristics of bird-pollinated plants were originally attributed to whether the plant was pollinated by non-passerine hummingbirds or passerine nectarivores. Subsequently this has been refuted and it is now hypothesized that these differences reflect whether the plants are pollinated by occasional or specialist nectarivores (feeding niche hypothesis). The volumetric intake, sugar preference and sugar concentration preference of the Cape white-eye (Zosterops virens), a small occasional nectarivore that also feeds on fruit and insects, was determined. This was done over a range of concentrations of both hexose and sucrose sugars using equicaloric solutions in pairwise choice tests. Birds exhibited no significant sugar type preference at any sugar concentration, but showed a preference for the lowest concentration (10%) of both hexose and sucrose solutions when presented with a range of sugar concentrations. The birds were able to meet energy demands on a dilute diet by adjusting volumetric intake and did not lose body mass. A significant preference for the 10% hexose and sucrose solutions may suggest that these occasional birds exert a selective pressure on the plants they pollinate to produce dilute nectar.","2-s2.0-84901054591"

The peanut is an allotetraploid with an AABB genome formula derived from diploids A. duranensis (A genome) and A. ipaënsis (B genome). The success of an introgression program that aims to improve cultivated varieties of the peanut depends on whether the chosen B genome species is homologous with the B genome of the peanut. While not directly involved in the origin of the peanut to the best of our knowledge, Arachis valida is a B genome species that could potentially be a bridge species or a source of new and different alleles, because of its resistance to diseases and pests. In this study, we investigated the crossability of A. valida with five other B genome species of section Arachis. Eight cross-combinations were made with A. valida and A. gregoryi, A. ipaënsis, A. magna, A. valida, and A. williamsii. Two hundred and forty pollinations were made yielding 61 fruit segments, 61 seeds, one abortion, and 24 hybrid plants. An analysis of the morphological characteristics and pollen viability confirmed that the plants were hybrids. Our results indicated that higher pollen viability of hybrid plants corresponded with higher affinity between parent plants used in crossings.

We developed a transcriptome resource covering key developmental stages of megagametophytes over time: prefertilization, fertilization, embryogenesis, and early, unfertilized abortion. RNA sequencing reads were assembled de novo into 105,505 predicted high-confidence transcripts derived from 34,521 predicted genes. Expression levels were estimated based on alignment of the original reads to the reference. Megagametophytes express a distinct set of genes compared to those of vegetative tissues. Transcripts related to signaling, protein turnover, and RNA biogenesis have lower expression values in vegetative tissues, whereas cell wall remodeling, solute transport, and seed storage protein transcripts have higher expression values in megagametophytes. Seed storage protein transcripts become very abundant in both pollinated and unpollinated megagametophytes over time, even in aborting ovules. However, the absence of protein storage bodies in unfertilized megagametophytes suggests extensive posttranscriptional mechanisms that either inhibit storage protein translation or their aggregation into protein bodies. This novel transcriptome resource provides a foundation for further important insights into conifer seed development. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2-s2.0-84989935386"

"1016","Distasteful Nectar Deters Floral Robbery","2017","Toxic nectar is an ecological paradox [1, 2]. Plants divert substantial resources to produce nectar that attracts pollinators [3], but toxins in this reward could disrupt the mutualism and reduce plant fitness [4]. Alternatively, such compounds could protect nectar from robbers [2], provided that they do not significantly alter pollinator visitation to the detriment of plant fitness [1, 58]. Indeed, very few studies have investigated the role of plant toxins in nectar for defense against nectar robbers [4, 9, 10]. Here, we compared two Aconitum species (A. napellus and A. lycoctonum) that have flowers specialized for long-tongued bumblebee pollinators (Bombus hortorum) but are occasionally robbed by short-tongued bumblebees (B. terrestris) [6, 1113]. Pollinator visits to flowers were much more frequent than by robbers, but visits correlated negatively with nectar alkaloid concentration and declined sharply between 200 and 380 ppm. However, alkaloid concentrations of >20 ppm were deterrent to B. terrestris, suggesting that robbers were less tolerant of nectar alkaloids. Nectar of both plant species contained similar concentrations of carbohydrates and toxic alkaloids, but A. lycoctonum was more likely to secrete nectar in each flower and was also visited more frequently by pollinators and robbers. We conclude that alkaloids in Aconitum spp. nectar affect rates of both pollinator visitation and robbery but may have co-evolved with nectar availability to maintain the fitness benefits of specialized plant-pollinator relationships. Chemical defense of nectar is, however, ultimately constrained by pollinator gustatory sensitivity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85028358977"
"2025","Parameter estimation of photovoltaic modules using a hybrid flower pollination algorithm","2017","Building highly accurate model for solar cells and photovoltaic (PV) modules based on experimental data is vital for the simulation, evaluation, control, and optimization of PV systems. Powerful optimization algorithms are necessary to accomplish this task. In this study, a new optimization algorithm is proposed for efficiently and accurately estimating the parameters of solar cells and PV modules. The proposed algorithm is developed based on the flower pollination algorithm by incorporating it with the Nelder-Mead simplex method and the generalized opposition-based learning mechanism. The proposed algorithm has a simple structure thus is easy to implement. The experimental results tested on three different solar cell models including the single diode model, the double diode model, and a PV module clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm. The comparisons with some other published methods demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior than most reported algorithms in terms of the accuracy of final solutions, convergence speed, and stability. Furthermore, the tests on three PV modules of different types (Multi-crystalline, Thin-film, and Mono-crystalline) suggest that the proposed algorithm can give superior results at different irradiance and temperature. The proposed algorithm can serve as a new alternative for parameter estimation of solar cells/PV modules. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85018508991"
"3602","Adaptive governance to promote ecosystem services in urban green spaces","2016","Managing urban green space as part of an ongoing social-ecological transformation poses novel governance issues, particularly in post-industrial settings. Urban green spaces operate as small-scale nodes in larger networks of ecological reserves that provide and maintain key ecosystem services such as pollination, water retention and infiltration, and sustainable food production. In an urban mosaic, a myriad of social and ecological components factor into aggregating and managing land to maintain or increase the flow of ecosystem services associated with green spaces. Vacant lots (a form of urban green space) are being repurposed for multiple functions, such as habitat for biodiversity, including arthropods that provide pollination services to other green areas; to capture urban runoff that eases the burden on ageing wastewater systems and other civic infrastructure; and to reduce urban heat island effects. Because of the uncertainty and complexities of managing for ecosystem services in urban settings, we advocate for a governance approach that is adaptive and iterative in natureadaptive governanceto address the ever changing social order underlying post-industrial cities and offer the rise of land banks as an example of governance innovation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","2-s2.0-84931097477"

Pollination biology in a palm swamp community in the Venezuelan central plains. In a palm swamp community that differs strongly from the surrounding savanna in the Venezuelan central plains, the pollination and floral biology of 33 plant species were studied during three years: 1983, 1984 and 1989. The most frequent flower colours were white, pink, yellow, and in a lesser proportion green, brown, purple and red. Floral symmetry was found in roughly equal proportion for actinomorphic and zygomorphic flowers. Most flowers were short?lived (612 hours); in monoecious species the female flowers were longer?lived than the male flowers. The most frequent rewards were pollen and nectar (36.4%) and pollen (30.3%). At the community level, bee? and wasp?pollination prevailed in 57.1% of plant species studies, followed by wind? (14.3%), fly? (11.4%), butterfly? (8.6%), bird? (5.7%) and beetle?pollination (2.9%). Between one and five plant species were simultaneously visited by the visitor species. The vast majority of the pollinating species displayed a high degree of load specificity: 26 pollinator species (65.0%) carried pollen from only one plant species, eight (20.0%,) carried pollen from two plant species, three (7.5%) carried pollen from three plant species and one (2.5%) carried pollen from five plant species. Visitor specificity and pollen transportation were similar amongst the visiting agents. Plant pollination?system specificity and pollen transportation were statistically significant among plant species with different pollinator types, but plant pollination system and pollen transportation were not different among floral symmetry, floral longevity, reward type, plant sexuality, breeding system and plant life form. The visitor species/plant species ratio was 1.6, and the pollinator species/ plant species ratio was 1.3. Among different guilds, birds, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera showed the highest pollinator species/plant species ratio, and wind pollination exhibited the lowest. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

"1998","Style length variation in male and female figs: development, inheritance, and control of pollinator oviposition","2017","Fig trees (Ficus spp., Moraceae) depend on female fig wasps to transport their pollen and as a reward provide nutrition for pollinator fig wasp larvae. Most pollinators are host specific, but natural plant hybrids occur if atypical hosts are pollinated. Female fig wasps lay their eggs into ovaries of female flowers in receptive figs by inserting their ovipositors through the styles, and relative style and ovipositor lengths are believed to largely determine their ability to oviposit. In dioecious fig trees, flowers in receptive male figs have short styles and support larval development, whereas flowers in receptive female figs have long styles and only develop into seeds. Using the dioecious fig tree species Ficus montana Burm. f. and Ficus asperifolia Miq., we recorded the comparative ontogeny of style lengths to determine whether style growth in the two sexes is coordinated with the attraction of pollinators, and how maximum style lengths relate to the ovipositor lengths of their pollinators. F1 hybrids between these species produce viable seeds, but no pollinator offspring. We examined style lengths in F1s and backcrosses, relative to those of their parents, and whether coordination of style growth with pollinator attraction is disrupted. The ovipositor of Kradibia tentacularis (Grandi) (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae), the pollinator of F.ï¿½montana, could reach some of the ovaries in female figs, but fails to lay eggs there. Styles in male F1 figs were intermediate in length between those of the two parents, but in female F1 figs styles grew longer than in either parent. Maximum style lengths in F1s were partially decoupled from receptivity, especially in female figs. Our results illustrate how timing of stigmal growth is coordinated with pollinator attraction, and that this coordination can be disrupted in hybrid individuals. ï¿½ 2017 The Netherlands Entomological Society","2-s2.0-85011020027"

Stigma receptivity was maintained at a high level under moderate temperature and low humidity conditions. Mean seed set on plants pollinated seven days after flowering was 41.2 per cent at the moderate temperature compared with 0.5 per cent at the high temperature, and 43.2 per cent at the low humidity compared with 7.1 per cent at the high humidity. The effects of temperature and humidity were additive. With a moderate temperature-low humidity combination seed set was as high as 77.4 per cent on plants pollinated seven days after flowering.

"8471","High population variability and source-sink dynamics in a solitary bee species","2013","Although solitary bees are considered to play key roles in ecosystem functions, surprisingly few studies have explored their population dynamics. We investigated the population dynamics of a rare, declining, solitary bee (Andrena humilis) in a landscape of 80 km2 in southern Sweden from 2003 to 2011. Only one population was persistent throughout all years studied; most likely this population supplied the surrounding landscape with 11 smaller, temporary local populations. Despite stable pollen availability, the size of the persistent population fluctuated dramatically in a two-year cycle over the nine years, with 490-1230 nests in odd-numbered years and 21-48 nests in even-numbered years. These fluctuations were not significantly related to climatic variables or pollen availability. Nineteen colonization and 14 extinction events were recorded. Occupancy decreased with distance from the persistent population and increased with increasing resource (pollen) availability. There were significant positive correlations between the size of the persistent population and patch occupancy and colonization. Colonizations were generally more common in patches closer to the persistent population, whereas extinctions were independent of distance from the persistent population. Our results highlight the complex population dynamics that exist for this solitary bee species, which could be due to source-sink dynamics, a prolonged diapause, or can represent a bethedging strategy to avoid natural enemies and survive in small habitat patches. If large fluctuations in solitary bee populations prove to be widespread, it will have important implications for interpreting ecological relationships, bee conservation, and pollination. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.","2-s2.0-84879599612"
"958","Do artificial nectar feeders affect batplant interactions in an Ecuadorian cloud forest?","2017","Plantpollinator interactions are critical to ecosystems. However, when artificial nectar feeders are available in an area, they could draw pollinators away from plants. We tested the effects of artificial nectar feeders in an Ecuadorian cloud forest on four aspects of batplant interactions: (1) bat relative abundance; (2) bat pollen loads; (3) flower visitation rates, and (4) breeding success of a bat-pollinated species (Burmeistera glabrata). We divided the study site into areas close to (~30 m) and far from (~500 m) three different feeder sites. At each distance, we captured nectar bats (Anoura caudifer, Anoura cultrata, and Lonchophylla robusta) to estimate their relative abundance and to collect pollen from fur and fecal samples. We also videotaped flowers to estimate bat visitation rates and recorded different breeding success variables of B. glabrata. We found that areas close to feeders have higher relative bat abundance by a factor of 40. In spite of this, the presence of feeders did not affect bat pollen loads, nor the flower visitation rates and breeding success of B. glabrata. Interestingly, there were differences in pollen loads between the three bat species, in that L. robusta individuals rarely carried pollen and were only captured near feeders. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","2-s2.0-85021328656"
"7683","Prolonged postdiapause: Influence on some indicators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of the red mason bee, Osmia rufa","2013","Bees of the genus Osmia are being used in crop pollination at an increasing rate. However, a short life expectancy of adult individuals limits the feasibility of their use. Cocoons of the red mason bee, Osmia rufa L. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), can be stored at 4° C in a postdiapause state, and adult bees can be used for pollination outside their natural flight period. The period of storage in this form has an unfavorable influence on the survival rate, life expectancy, and fertility of the bee. It was suggested that the negative results are connected with exhaustion of energy reserves. To test this hypothesis, the present study examined the contents of protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and the activities of some enzymes, and their degradation in red mason bees that emerged in spring according to their biological clock and in summer after elongated diapause. It was found that postdiapause artificially elongated by 3 months caused significant decreases in body weight, total sugar, glycogen, lipids, and protein content in O. rufa. Glucose level was highest in bees that emerged in the summer, which was coincident with increased activities of maltase and trehalase. The activities of sucrase and cellobiase were not changed, while amylase activity was considerably decreased. The activities of triacylglycerols lipase and C2, C4, C10 carboxylesterases were highest in bees that emerged in July. Low temperatures restrict O. rufa emergence, and during prolonged postdiapause, metabolic processes lead to significant reductions of structural and energetic compounds. © This is an open access paper.","2-s2.0-84888634870"

The results showed that flowers of both Nigella species were visited by seven different bee visitors. However, flowers of N. damascena were more attractive to bees than N. sativa flowers. N. damascena produced on average significantly higher plant, more number of branches per plant, more seed yield, total seed weight and higher number of capsules per plant. On the other hand, N. sativa produced its flowers and matured nearly two weeks earlier than N. damascena. There is no interaction between Nigella species and pollination treatments for all yield parameter. N. damascena was higher in number of ovaries, seeds per capsules, seed set percentage, seeds per plant and total seed weight than N. sativa under treatments conditions.

"18725","Dissection of floral pollination syndromes in Petunia","2004","Animal-mediated pollination is essential in the reproductive biology of many flowering plants and tends to be associated with pollination syndromes, sets of floral traits that are adapted to particular groups of pollinators. The complexity and functional convergence of various traits within pollination syndromes are outstanding examples of biological adaptation, raising questions about their mechanisms and origins. In the genus Petunia, complex pollination syndromes are found for nocturnal hawkmoths (P. axillaris) and diurnal bees (P. integrifolia), with characteristic differences in petal color, corolla shape, reproductive organ morphology, nectar quantity, nectar quality, and fragrance. We dissected the Petunia syndromes into their most important phenotypic and genetic components. They appear to include several distinct differences, such as cell-growth and cell-division patterns in the basal third of the petals, elongation of the ventral stamens, nectar secretion and nectar sugar metabolism, and enzymatic differentiation in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In backcross-inbred lines of species-derived chromosome segments in a transposon tagging strain of P. hybrida, one to five quantitative trait loci were identified for each syndrome component. Two loci for stamen elongation and nectar volume were confirmed in introgression lines and showed large allelic differences. The combined data provide a framework for a detailed understanding of floral syndromes from their developmental and molecular basis to their impact on animal behavior. With its molecular genetic tools, this Petunia system provides a novel venue for a pattern of adaptive radiation that is among the most characteristic of flowering plants.","2-s2.0-10844261728"

(Orchidaceae)","2007","If left unpollinated, the flowers of Aerides multiflora (Roxb.) and Rhynchostylis retusa (L.) Bl. can remain fresh for 17 and 24 d, respectively. However, they begin to wilt at 2 to 3 days after pollination (DAP) and 3 to 4 DAP, respectively, and become senescent at 5 DAP and 7 DAP, respectively. When measured at two developmental phases - Stage 1, start of wilting and Stage 2, progression to senescence - all the floral organs from pollinated flowers had higher contents of total soluble sugars, reducing sugars, and free amino acids than those from unpollinated flowers. A corresponding increase was noted in the activities of hydrolytic enzymes, i.e., ?-amylase, ?-amylase, and invertase, and proteolytic enzymes (proteases) in those organs. This indicated that signals related to pollination had up-regulated those activities, leading to a breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones for mobilization. The amounts of sugars and enzyme activity were relatively greater in the pollinated flowers of A. multiflora compared with R. retusa, and levels were always higher in the floral lips and perianths. When inhibitors of auxin (0.25 mM TIBA) or ethylene (0.25 mM AgNO3) were applied to the pollinated flowers, their senescence was partially prevented, thus signifying hormonal involvement in governing the pollination-induced biochemical alterations normally found in those organs.","2-s2.0-36549087295"
"4173","Evolutionary Interactions between Plant Reproduction and Defense Against Herbivores","2015","Coevolution is among the most important evolutionary processes that generate biological diversity. Plant-pollinator interactions play a prominent role in the evolution of reproductive traits in flowering plants. Likewise, plant-herbivore interactions select for myriad defenses that protect plants from damage. These mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, respectively, have traditionally been considered in isolation from one another. Here, we consider whether reproductive traits and antiherbivore defenses are interdependent as a result of pollinator- and herbivore-mediated selection. The evolution of floral traits, self-fertilization, and separate sexes frequently affects the expression and evolution of plant defenses. In turn, the evolution of defense can affect allocation to reproductive traits, and herbivores often impose strong selection directly on floral traits. Theory and empirical evidence suggest that herbivores can influence the evolution of selfing from outcrossing and potentially the evolution of separate sexes from combined sexes. We identify several areas in which future research is needed to increase our understanding of the evolutionary interplay between reproduction and defense in plants.

(canola) seed-cDNA library representing 15 days after pollination (DAP) were differentially screened for highly expressed genes at the early stages of seed development. Analysis of 104 differentially expressed sequence tags revealed 54 unique genes, of which 33 had putative homologues described in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. or B. napus. These encoded diverse proteins, ranging from proteins of unknown function to metabolic enzymes and proteins associated with cell structure and development. Twenty-five genes were only expressed in seeds, and 11 of these started to express as early as 5 or 10 DAP. The majority of the seed-specific genes that are expressed at early stages of seed development encoded proteins with high similarity to hypothetical Arabidopsis proteins. Tissue-specificity determined by Northern analysis revealed that four seed-specific genes were expressed only in seed coats and another five in both embryos and seed coats. Analysis of transcript profiles of seed-abundant as well as seed-specific genes, and their expression patterns, implies that the B. napus seed is undergoing an active cell proliferation during 10-20 DAP, while establishing metabolic networks for subsequent seed maturation.","2-s2.0-0742285077"

Merrill)","1995","Progenies from 13 artificial and six open-pollinated intervarietal pineapple crosses were analyzed for leaf spininess and leaf color. A new hypothesis for the inheritance of the leaf spininess trait based on the observed segregations is put foward. It clearly explains the segregation of 11 out of the 13 artificial crosses, whereas the current accepted hypothesis (Collins and Kernes, J. Heredity 37: 123-128, 1946) explains only eight of the 13 crosses. Three crosses were crucial for the acceptance or rejection of both hypotheses. The crosses Boituva x Smooth Cayenne and Perola x Smooth Cayenne, which involve 'non-piping' and heterozygous for the S locus (Ss) parents, gave rise to spineless individuals in the offspring, at the expected frequency of three spiny to one spineless. This fact cannot be explained by Collins and Kernes' (1946) hypothesis. The cross Roxo-de-Tefe x Rondon resulted in nearly 100% spiny descendants, different from the frequency expected by the Collins and Kernes' hypothesis (50% spiny: 50% spineless). The new hypothesis allows the identification of two new clones as 'piping' types (Manauara Inerme and Pina Negra) and confirms that the genotypic constitution of the Rondon clone is probably ppss (spineless 'non-piping'). When the genotype is pp, the S locus produces the completely spiny phenotypes (ppSS and ppSs), which are dominant over the spineless one (ppss). The partial leaf spininess of the cultivar Smooth Cayenne, described as heterozygous for the S locus (ppSs), must be caused by genotype x environment interactions, genetic background effects, modifying genes and/or other unknown facts. Green leaf color has incomplete dominance over purple leaf color, but green predominates.","2-s2.0-0029567043"
"26740","A restorer gene for genetic-cytoplasmic male sterility in cultivated potatoes","1991","Fifty-nine clones (cultivars and advanced selections) of Solanum tuberosum Group Tuberosum were pollinated with two Group Phureja-haploid Tuberosum hybrids, which produce FDR 2n pollen (ps/ps) and are heterozygous for a dominant gene (Ms/ms) which interacts with Tuberosum cytoplasm to result in male sterility. Twenty-eight and thirty-four plants from each family were transplanted to the field in two different locations, respectively. Pollen samples were collected from each plant and stained with acetocarmine glycerol jelly. Plants with over 95% unstainable pollen were considered male sterile. The families could be put into distinct classes according to the ratio of male sterile to male fertile plants; 3 sterile: 1 fertile (23 clones), 2 sterile: 3 fertile (24 clones), 1 sterile: 5 fertile (3 clones), and 0 sterile: 1 fertile (3 clones). Four families deviated significantly from any expected ratio. The variation for male fertility among families resides in the tetraploid parent, since the male parents have the same genotype (Ms/ms) for the Ms locus. The locus of this gene is very distal to the centromere such the 2n gametic output is 1 Ms/Ms : 2 Ms/ms : 1 ms/ms. The variation in male sterility is explained by the presence or absence of a dominant allele of a restorer gene (Rt) in tetraploid Tuberosum. This locus is also very distal to the centromere. The frequency of the Rt gene was estimated to be 0.20 in Tuberosum. The finding of Rt gene explains some of the conflicting results in male fertility of haploid Tuberosum x 2x cultivated and wild species hybrids. It also provides an opportunity to partially circumvent this male sterility. Haploids (2n = 2x = 24) extracted from 4x clones with Rt genes would have male fertile progeny in crosses with species carrying the Ms gene. © 1991 Springer.","2-s2.0-0038091206"

Pollen viability was evaluated in culture medium with and without boric acid with pollen collected at different times after anthesis. Pollen germination of six genotypes was quantified before and after storage. P. trunciflora and P. jaboticaba are self-compatible, however the polinizer increase fruiting. The P. cauliflora requires polinizers for fruiting, because it has flowers with greater stigma-anther distance than the other two species, which prevents the passive self-pollination. Boric acid ads in the culture medium improve in vitro germination of jabuticaba tree pollen. The pollen viability is greater six hours after anthesis. It is possible the conservation of pollen for up to 90 days in freezer (-18°C), if it has high initial germination (greater than 80%).

"641","Proteomic insight into fruit set of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) suggests the cues of hormone-independent parthenocarpy","2017","Background: Parthenocarpy is an excellent agronomic trait that enables crops to set fruit in the absence of pollination and fertilization, and therefore to produce seedless fruit. Although parthenocarpy is widely recognized as a hormone-dependent process, hormone-insensitive parthenocarpy can also be observed in cucumber; however, its mechanism is poorly understood. To improve the global understanding of parthenocarpy and address the hormone-insensitive parthenocarpy shown in cucumber, we conducted a physiological and proteomic analysis of differently developed fruits. Results: Physiological analysis indicated that the natural hormone-insensitive parthenocarpy of 'EC1' has broad hormone-inhibitor resistance, and the endogenous hormones in the natural parthenocarpy (NP) fruits were stable and relatively lower than those of the non-parthenocarpic cultivar '8419 s-1.' Based on the iTRAQ technique, 683 fruit developmental proteins were identified from NP, cytokinin-induced parthenocarpic (CP), pollinated and unpollinated fruits. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that proteins detected from both set and aborted fruits were involved in similar biological processes, such as cell growth, the cell cycle, cell death and communication. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that 'protein synthesis' was the major biological process that differed between fruit set and fruit abortion. Clustering analysis revealed that different protein expression patterns were involved in CP and NP fruits. Forty-one parthenocarpy-specialized DEPs (differentially expressed proteins) were screened and divided into two distinctive groups: NP-specialized proteins and CP-specialized proteins. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis indicated that NP-specialized proteins showed hormone- or hormone-inhibitor insensitive expression patterns in both ovaries and seedlings. Conclusions: In this study, the global molecular regulation of fruit development in cucumber was revealed at the protein level. Physiological and proteomic comparisons indicated the presence of hormone-independent parthenocarpy and suppression of fruit abortion in cucumber. The proteomic analysis suggested that hormone-independent parthenocarpy is regulated by hormone-insensitive proteins such as the NP-specialized proteins. Moreover, the regulation of fruit abortion suppression may be closely related to protein synthesis pathways. © 2017 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85034741401"

It has evolved many times in flowering plants and is widespread among distinct Angiosperm families. It is viewed as a reproductive strategy to reduce endogamy, and to promote optimal resource allocation between male and female sexual functions. Neea theifera is a common species in Cerrado, neotropical savannas in Brazil, but information regarding its reproductive biology is still incomplete. In order to investigate how environmental conditions possibly affect this dioecious species, we studied its floral biology, sex ratio and spatial distribution of sexual morphs along a soil-altitudinal gradient. The sex ratio did not significantly deviate from the expected 1:1 ratio. However, flower abundance in the population was significantly biased towards staminate flowers. Female individuals were larger than male individuals and plant size was negatively correlated with altitude, but did not differ between sexual morphs. The population did not show spatial segregation of sexes and male individuals were sexually mature earlier than female ones. Staminate flowers were larger than pistillate flowers and presented high pollen viability. Meliponini bees, small flies and thrips were potential pollinators, but pollination success was very low. Dioecy in N. theifera corroborates many general features of this reproductive strategy, such as woody habit, inconspicuous flowers, pollination by small generalist insects and differential resource allocation between male and female plants. However, reproduction in this species seems to be impaired by pollinator limitation. The results showed that the soil-altitude gradient influenced the growth pattern of the species and may play an important role in its reproductive biology but did not affect dioecy directly.","2-s2.0-84856606258"
"6640","Same but different: Larval development and gall-inducing process of a non-pollinating fig wasp compared to that of pollinating fig-wasps","2014","The receptacles of fig trees (Ficus spp.) can harbor a highly diversified and complex community of chalcid wasps. Functional groups of fig wasps (e.g. gallers, cleptoparasites and parasitoids) oviposit into the fig at different developmental stages, reflecting different feeding regimes for these insect larvae. There are few direct data available on larval feeding regimes and access to resources. We studied the gall induction and larval feeding strategy of an Idarnes (group flavicollis) species, a non-pollinating fig wasp (NPFW) associated to Ficus citrifolia P. Miller in Brazil. This Idarnes species shares with the pollinator characteristics such as time of oviposition, ovipositor insertion through flower and location of the egg inside plant ovaries. Nevertheless, we show that the gall induction differs considerably from that of the pollinating species. This Idarnes species relies on the induction of nucellus cell proliferation for gall formation and as the main larval resource. This strategy enables it to develop in both pollinated and unpollinated figs. The large differences between this NPFW and other fig wasps in how ovules are galled suggest that there are different ways to be a galler. A functional analysis of NPFW community structure may require descriptions of the histological processes associated with larval development. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.","2-s2.0-84899638916"
"18660","Maize varieties grown in Eastern Central Europe between 1938 and 1983","2004","Several generations of maize breeders contributed to the establishment of genetic resources in Eastern Central Europe by developing open-pollinated varieties, inbred maize hybrids and parental lines successfully grown on large areas and differing from those found in the North American Corn Belt and in other regions of Europe. In some cases they used unusual methods or used known methods in an unorthodox fashion. The Caribbean Flints brought to Hungary from Spain by the Turks in the 16th century played an important role in the development of the Eastern Central Europe genetic resources and dominated Hungarian maize production for nearly four hundred years. In the early 19th century these genetic stocks of Caribbean origin were supplemented by Andean popcorn (Chutucuno Chico, Chutucuno Grande), introduced into Hungary from Italy for human consumption and export purposes and to a lesser extent by Northern Flints (Pennsylvania 8-row). Under the influence of American maize exhibitions in the 19th century, Southern Dents (especially Gourdseed, but also Shoepeg, Hickory King and Tuxpan) and Corn Belt Dents (Queen of the Prairie, Iowa Goldmine, Leaming, and to a lesser extent Funk Yellow Dent) gained ground. In Eastern Central Europe dent varieties were late maturing, so they were crossed, primarily with early-maturing hard flints, and also with early variants of the Caribbean type Old Hungarian Yellow Flint, in order to produce new varieties, which then dominated maize production in the first half of the 20th century. In the early years of hybrid maize breeding, the breeders relied greatly on local, productive, adapted sources. As the result of hybrid maize breeding in Eastern Central Europe, two distinct gene pools developed, which it is thought could contribute to a further increase in maize yield averages through an improvement in genetic variability. These two gene pools are the Ruma and Mindszentpuszta (MYD) heterosis sources. At least 30 lines of Ruma origin and 19 of MYD origin have been successfully used in the development of commercial hybrids. From the point of view of breeding early flint × dent hybrids, the European early multi-rowed hard flints, which developed locally, independently of the American Northern Flints, could also be of interest. Less significant varieties and lines that were grown successfully at one time or another could be used as genetic reserves for the development of new variations. The paper will discuss the varieties popular between 1880 and 1983, providing more detailed data on 13 open-pollinated varieties, 2 variety hybrids, 41 inbred hybrids and 40 successful lines. © 2004 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","2-s2.0-33845790068"
"19003","Genetic variation in the endangered and endemic species Changium smyrnioides (Apiaceae)","2004","Changium smyrnioides H. Wolff (Apiaceae) is an endangered plant endemic to Eastern China. Levels of genetic variation and patterns of population structure in C. smyrnioides were investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Of the 100 primers screened, 18 produced highly reproducible ISSR bands. Using these primers, 196 discernible DNA fragments were generated with 166 (84.7%) being polymorphic, indicating considerable genetic variation at the species level. In contrast, there were relatively low levels of polymorphism at the population level with the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) ranging from 29.6% to 36.2%. Genetic diversity within populations ranged from 0.10 to 0.13, averaging 0.24 at the species level. A high level of genetic differentiation among populations was detected based on Nei's genetic diversity analysis (52.9%), Shannon's index analysis (54.3%) and AMOVA analysis (52.3%). No significant statistical differences (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P=0·6) in ISSR variation was found between regions. However, among populations (52.3% of the variance) and within populations (47.7% of the variance), there were significant differences (P<0.001). Restricted gene flow (Nm=0.446) among populations may result from several factors, such as low seed dispersal, isolation of populations and/or self-pollination. Limited gene flow among populations is a plausible reason for the high genetic differentiation observed for this species. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-1842863541"
"27920","The evolution of plant mating systems: multilocus simulations of pollen dispersal.","1987","Simulated pollination in a plant population and explored how pollen dispersal distance and allocation among recipient individuals evolved in response to direct selection on three loci coding for dispersal phenotype and in response to indirect selection on 2 unlinked 'genetic congruence' loci. Fitnesses at congruence loci were chosen to model 'genetic' and 'ecological' mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the osbervation that an intermediate outcrossing distance maximizes fitness in some plants. Dispersal genotype evolves rapidly in response to direct selection, apparently mediated mainly through competition for access to ovules; selection for intermediate genetic congruence affects final dispersal genotype in largely predictable ways and does not appear to provoke runaway evolution; and evolution of dispersal type influences the genetic structure of the population, which in turn influences the evolution of dispersal. -from Authors","2-s2.0-0023501423"
"22377","Accumulated inbreeding in maize germplasm reproduction","1999","Small sample size causes inbreeding in maize (Zea mays L.) germplasm reproduction. Hand pollination can be clone using full-sib or half-sib pollination. Inbreeding is generated by matings both within and between families. The average coancestry in the initial sample, or reproduction cycle zero (C 0), can be calculated if types, frequencies, and coancestries of matings are known. The average coancestry in C 0 corresponds to the average inbreeding of cycle 1 (C 1). Coancestry of C 0 is a function of F 0, row, and r(0B), the inbreeding, coancestry within families, and coancestry between ramifies of C 0, respectively. The average coancestry is also a function of the numbers of families (n) and of plants per family (m), with N = nm. As the coancestry within families precedes the coancestry between families, by induction, for any advanced (t) cycle of reproduction, F(t-1), F(t-2), and F(t-3) correspond, respectively, to r(0B), r(0W), and F 0. Recurrence equations were obtained for full- and half-sib pollination. In order to obtain a total of two hundred plants several combinations of numbers of families and of numbers of plants per family were used to calculate inbreeding. Inbreeding under full-sib pollination was much higher than under half-sib pollination. By cycle 10 for full-sib pollination, in all combination numbers, inbreeding tended to be 0.35. Under half-sib pollination, a smaller value was obtained in generation 100 except for the five families and 40 plants per family combination. Average inbreeding after five cycles of reproduction with five population sizes (500, 200, 80, 32 and 13). using Falconer's formula (? = 1), full-sib (? = 2), and half-sib pollination (m ? 3) gave the percentual values of 6.04, 3.03 and 0.26, respectively. To keep inbreeding at a minimum, results suggest that germplasm reproduction by half-sib pollination in a balanced composite be made with three seeds per ear.","2-s2.0-0345201755"
"12234","The relevance of gene flow in metapopulation dynamics of an oceanic island endemic, Olea Europaea subsp. Guanchica","2010","Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that geographical isolation and extinction-recolonization dynamics are two factors causing strong genetic structure in metapopulations, but their consequences in species with high dispersal abilities have not been tested at large scales. Here, we investigated the effect of population age structure and isolation by distance in the patterns of genetic diversity in a wind-pollinated, zoochorous tree (Olea europaea subsp. guanchica) sporadically affected by volcanic events across the Canarian archipelago. Genetic variation was assessed at six nuclear microsatellites (nDNA) and six chloroplast fragments (cpDNA) in nine subpopulations sampled on four oceanic islands. Subpopulations occurring on more recent substrates were more differentiated than those on older substrates, but within-subpopulation genetic diversity was not significantly different between age groups for any type of marker. Isolation-by-distance differentiation was observed for nDNA but not for cpDNA, in agreement with other metapopulation studies. Contrary to the general trend for island systems, between-island differentiation was extremely low, and lower than differentiation between subpopulations on the same island. The pollen-to-seed ratio was close to one, two orders of magnitude lower than the average estimated for other wind-pollinated, animal-dispersed plants. Our results showed that population turnover and geographical isolation increased genetic differentiation relative to an island model at equilibrium, but overall genetic structure was unexpectedly weak for a species distributed among islands. This empirical study shows that extensive gene flow, particularly mediated by seeds, can ameliorate population subdivision resulting from extinction-recolonization dynamics and isolation by distance. © 2010 The Author(s).

"1981","Bamboo flowers visited by insects: do insects play a role in the pollination of bamboo flowers?","2017","Relatively little is known about pollination and other aspects of the reproductive biology of bamboos, but wind pollination is assumed to be the rule, at least in woody bamboos. Documenting the reproductive biology of woody bamboos is a complex task due to the long periods of time between flowering cycles, which range from 3 to 120 years. Insects visiting Guadua paniculata and G. inermis flowers were collected in the field. Scanning electron micrographs were taken of the visiting insects. Four species of bees, three from tribe Meliponini (Geotrigona acapulconis, Plebeia frontalis and Trigona fulviventris) and one from tribe Apini (Apis mellifera), along with a syrphid fly (Toxomerus teligera) were found visiting bamboo flowers. Some species of Hemiptera were also found feeding on the flowers, such as Neortholomus jamaicensis (Lygaeidae), or preying on the flower visitors (Apiomerus pictipes (Reduviidae)). Insects visiting bamboo inflorescences may facilitate the release of pollen grains into the air, promoting outcrossing and genetic flow among the individuals of the flowering bamboo populations. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.","2-s2.0-84988442235"
"16189","Implementing isolation perimeters around genetically modified maize fields","2007","Due to the growing cultivation area of genetically modified (GM) maize and the rising number of GM maize varieties commercially available to European farmers, the co-existence between GM and non-GM maize is becoming a burning issue in some European regions. Hence, Member States are imposing or discussing specific co-existence measures to keep the adventitious presence of GM material in non-GM produces below the established labelling threshold. As maize is a cross-pollinated crop that uses wind for the dispersal of its pollen, on-farm co-existence measures may rely on the spatial isolation of GM and non-GM maize fields. In this study, we developed an approach that combines geographic information system (GIS) datasets with Monte Carlo simulations to assess the feasibility of implementing isolation perimeters around GM maize fields, since its practical implementation is rarely addressed in the co-existence debate. More specifically, five scenarios differing in shares and spatial distributions of GM maize were tested for various isolation perimeters in two agricultural areas in Flanders (Belgium). The GIS analyses emphasised the small size of maize fields and their scattered distribution throughout the cropped area. The feasibility of implementing isolation perimeters was largely affected by the (GM) maize share, the spatial distribution of GM maize, and the width of isolation perimeters. The higher the (GM) maize share and the wider the isolation perimeter, the higher the proportions of farmers with non-GM maize fields occurring within the implemented isolation perimeter. Compared with randomly distributed GM maize fields, the clustering of GM maize fields on a larger scale and at the farm level increased the feasibility of implementing isolation perimeters. The approach developed proved to be a valuable tool to quantify the feasibility of implementing isolation perimeters under real agricultural conditions. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.","2-s2.0-34548836303"

Expected heterozygosity for 26 isozyme loci, averaged over 10 populations, was 0.121. More notable than the relatively high level of diversity when compared to other woody endemics was the strong decrease in expected heterozygosity with latitude. Differentiation (FST) was 0.152, higher than values for many north temperate conifers with larger distributions. The number of migrants per generation (Nm) was 1.34 or 2.70, depending on the method of estimation. Inbreeding appeared low; FIS was only 0.003, in agreement with multilocus population outcrossing rates (tm), which were generally well above 0.90. No difference in t m was found between isolated vs. clustered trees. However, the number of seeds per cone was greatest in the densest populations; tm is a measure of effective outcrossing after mortality in the embryonic stage, whereas a reduced number of seeds per cone indicates self pollination. Selfing increased after logging; outcrossing rate before logging was 0.961 and after logging, 0.756. Despite Brewer spruce's narrow, fragmented distribution, the outlook for its conservation was good, with the exception of possible negative effects of logging.","2-s2.0-32044432155"
"19934","Corridor use by diverse taxa","2003","One of the most popular approaches for maintaining populations and conserving biodiversity in fragmented landscapes is to retain or create corridors that connect otherwise isolated habitat patches. Working in large-scale, experimental landscapes in which open-habitat patches and corridors were created by harvesting pine forest, we showed that corridors direct movements of different types of species, including butterflies, small mammals, and bird-dispersed plants, causing higher movement between connected than between unconnected patches. Corridors directed the movement of all 10 species studied, with all corridor effect sizes >68%. However, this corridor effect was significant for five species, not significant for one species, and inconclusive for four species because of small sample sizes. Although we found no evidence that corridors increase emigration from a patch, our results show that movements of disparate taxa with broadly different life histories and functional roles are directed by corridors.","2-s2.0-0038221745"

Also, additional information was obtained on different biological characters of the insect. Resistant and susceptible lines were grouped according to their leaf feeding ratings (antibiosis), per cent borer survival at pollination time or at harvest (tolerance). Each specimen observed was kept on the same plant tissue until pupation. The number of eggs and egg masses/female was significantly higher only when lines are grouped according to their leaf feeding ratings. No significant differences were obtained in most biological characters of borers fed on resistant or susceptible maize lines: spring pupation, pupal parasitism, mortality and weight, moth emergence and sex ratio. © 1977, Entomological Society of Canada.

(Brassicaceae), a rare species endemic to microsites in sagebrush-steppe habitat in southwestern Idaho, were conducted at 2 sites from May to July 2001. Site KB contained over 10,000 plants, whereas site WG contained less than 150 plants. Insect exclusion experiments revealed that seed production in L. papilliferum is dependent on insect-mediated pollination; median percent seed set dropped from 70% to 2% when insects were excluded from flowers. A total of 25 insect families from 5 orders visited L. papilliferum flowers: 24 families at KB and 11 families at WG. Only 9 families contained more than trace amounts of pollen on their bodies: Hymenoptera - Anthophoridae, Apidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Sphecidae, Vespidae; Coleoptera - Cerambycidae, Dermestidae; Diptera - Syrphidae. Insects from these families are likely responsible for pollination of L. papilliferum, although some may be of only minor significance due to their infrequent visits to flowers. Two of the 4 most common and pollen-laden insects found at KB, honey bees (Apis mellifera) and colletid bees, were absent or rare at WG. Three other pollen-carrying families present at KB, Sphecidae, Vespidae, and Halictidae, were not found at WG. We raise several possible explanations for this disparity in pollinator communities between sites and discuss the importance of pollinator diversity to the long term viability of L. papilliferum.","2-s2.0-0042477666"

They are known to migrate seasonally up to 200 km. It has been assumed their migrations occur stepwise, with stops for rest and foraging, but bivouacking bees have rarely been seen by scientists. Here I report discovery of a site in northern Thailand where bivouacs appeared in large congregations during the wet seasons of 2009 and 2010. The bivouac congregation stopover site is a small mango orchard along the Pai River. Bivouacs rested in branches of mango and other tree species in the immediate vicinity. Departures were preceded by dances indicating approximate direction and apparently, distance of flights. Such consistent stopover sites likely occur throughout southern Asia and may support critical, vulnerable stages in the life history of giant honey bees that must be conserved for populations of the species to survive. © 2012 Robinson.","2-s2.0-84866541086"

To increase the efficiency of HB pollination, colony numbers are doubled or introduced sequentially; nevertheless, yields remain relatively low and fruit are small due to the low number of seeds per fruit. In the present research, we studied the effect of adding bumblebees (BB) to the HB colonies. Adding BB hives to pear orchards 10 d before bloom, at a density of ten hives ha-1, improved the percentage fruit-set, fruit size, and also sometimes, fruit yield. These positive results were due to a large increase in seed numbers per fruit, especially in 'Spadona' which had only one-to-three seeds per fruit when pollinated only by HB,compared to four-to-six seeds after pollination with HB + BB. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of BB visits tree-1 min-1 and the number of seeds fruit-1, and a similar correlation between seed number and fruit size.","2-s2.0-84870479902"
"23502","Parental environment aftereffects on germination, growth, and adaptive traits in selected white spruce families","1998","Seed orchards for the production of conifer seed in British Columbia are usually located in areas favorable (warm and dry) for flowering and seed development, often considerably south of the source location of the parent trees. Differences in environmental conditions between seed orchard location and location of origin can affect progeny performance. It is suspected that this is caused by environmental factors that affect reproductive processes of parent trees and lead to altered physiological traits (aftereffects). This study examined if aftereffects are present in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Control pollinations were made at two locations, Red Rock, near Prince George (53°N) in central British Columbia, and Kalamalka, near Vernon (50°N) in southern British Columbia, on five female trees using a four-male polymix. Identical genotypes through grafting were present at the two locations. Pollen maturing at each site was only used in the polymix at that particular location. Progeny were raised and germination traits, number of needle primordia, greenhouse and field heights, and frost hardiness were evaluated in a common environment. The location of seed development significantly affected all traits evaluated. Height growth aftereffects in the second field season were much less than those observed in the first field season. These results suggest that aftereffects are detectable in white spruce progeny performance in British Columbia.","2-s2.0-0032030405"
