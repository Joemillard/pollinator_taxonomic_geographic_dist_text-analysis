3062,2-s2.0-0345832065,2003,Analysis of within-population spatial genetic structure in Antirrhinum microphyllum (Scrophulariaceae),"Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to study the spatial genetic structure in two populations (Bolarque and Entrepeñas) of endangered cliff specialist Antirrhinum microphyllum Rothm. (Scrophulariaceae). Mantel tests found no significant linear correlations between geographic and genetic data. However, redundancy analysis (RDA) models developed using the spatial data as the constraining matrix were highly significant, and spatial data explained 13.6% and 11.1% of total genetic variation in Bolarque and Entrepeñas, respectively. Moran's I correlograms and Mantel correlograms revealed a positive autocorrelation in the first distance class (15 m), which suggests a patchy distribution of genetic diversity. This distribution is consistent with the genetic vicinities that are expected from the territorial behavior of main pollinator Rhodanthidium sticticum (Megachilidae), the predominant short-distance seed dispersal, and the patchy spatial distribution of available safe sites. The gradient pattern obtained in Entrepeñas was consistent with standard isolation-by-distance models. However, a differential sinusoidal pattern was obtained in Bolarque, which would indicate a more frequent gene flow between patches and might be due to lower plant density there. The spatial genetic structure coexists with a strict self- incompatibility system in the species. Simplified RDA models obtained using a stepwise forward selection comprised the easting component in Entrepenas and the easting and northing components in Bolarque. Similar results were obtained with directional correlograms. These differential patterns can be explained by the distinct spatial arrangement of the populations (linear and bidimensional in Entrepenas and Bolarque, respectively).",Spain,Bolarque,"Bolarque, Spain",40.36357,-2.82961

Mango is not only known for its sweet fragrance and flavor, but also due to the increasing domestic demand and export potential of the fruit. Fruit set in mango is dependent on successful pollination which depends on the availability of high quality pollen, the presence of a high number of suitable pollinators, and optimal weather conditions, and must be optimized to limit fruit drop, which is extremely high in mango trees. Typically, mango trees are pollinated via wind, flies, butterflies, and moths. Systematic surveillance was done in the mango orchard at Fruit Research Station, Sangareddy, Andhra pradesh and pollinators were observed and recorded during peak flowering stage in fifty tagged inflorescences of five trees. Foraging behaviour of pollinators were observed on mango flowers for 7 am to 9 am and 4 pm to 6 pm. Most of these insects belonged to the orders diptera and hymenoptera. The important pollinators are honey bees (Apis dorsata, A.florae, A cerana indica), Meliponas sp, Coccinella septumpunctata), housefly (Musca nebulo) and other moths and butterflies.

Large differences, consistent in time and space, were observed between the survival of sub-populations on different hostplants. Foodplants influenced A. cardamines survival and development by allelochemical and mechanical defences, which may also weaken a larva against pathogen attack. Oviposition by females appeared surprisingly maladaptive however with proportionately most eggs being laid on the hostplants yielding poorest larval survival, in opposition to previous expectations of coevolutionary theory.

364,2-s2.0-85019677215,2017,Nectar properties and the role of sunbirds as pollinators of the golden-flowered tea (Camellia petelotii),"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Properties of floral nectar have been used to predict if a plant species is pollinated by birds. To see whether winter-flowering plants evolve nectar properties corresponding to bird pollinators, nectar properties of several Camellia species (including the golden-flowered tea), as well as the role of floral visitors as effective pollinators, were examined. METHODS: Potential pollinators of Camellia petelotii were identified at different times of day and under various weather conditions. A bird exclusion experiment was used to compare the pollination effectiveness of birds and insects. Nectar sugar components (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) from C. Petelotii growing wild and another seven Camellia species and 22 additional cultivars (all in cultivation) were examined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). KEY RESULTS: The sunbird Aethopyga siparaja and honeybees were the most frequent floral visitors to C. Petelotii. Honeybee visits were significantly reduced in cloudy/rainy weather. The fruit and seed set of flowers with birds excluded were reduced by 64%, indicating that bird pollination is significant. For the wild populations of C. Petelotii, a bagged flower could secrete 157 ?L nectar; this nectar has a low sugar concentration (19%) and is sucrose-dominant (87%). The eight Camellia species and 22 cultivars had an average sugar concentration of around 30% and a sucrose concentration of 80%, demonstrating sucrose-dominant nectar in Camellia species. CONCLUSIONS: The nectar sugar composition of Camellia species was characterized by sucrose dominance. In addition, the large reduction in seed set when birds are excluded in the golden-flowered tea also supports the suggestion that these winter-flowering plants may have evolved with birds as significant pollinators. © 2017 Botanical Society of America.",NA,NA,,,
282,2-s2.0-85016244032,2017,Does the morphological fit between flowers and pollinators affect pollen deposition? An experimental test in a buzz-pollinated species with anther dimorphism,"Some pollination systems, such as buzz-pollination, are associated with floral morphologies that require a close physical interaction between floral sexual organs and insect visitors. In these systems, a pollinator's size relative to the flower may be an important feature determining whether the visitor touches both male and female sexual organs and thus transfers pollen between plants efficiently. To date, few studies have addressed whether in fact the “fit” between flower and pollinator influences pollen transfer, particularly among buzz-pollinated species. Here we use Solanum rostratum, a buzz-pollinated plant with dimorphic anthers and mirror-image flowers, to investigate whether the morphological fit between the pollinator's body and floral morphology influences pollen deposition. We hypothesized that when the size of the pollinator matches the separation between the sexual organs in a flower, more pollen should be transferred to the stigma than when the visitor is either too small or too big relative to the flower. To test this hypothesis, we exposed flowers of S. rostratum with varying levels of separation between sexual organs, to bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) of different sizes. We recorded the number of visits received, pollen deposition, and fruit and seed production. We found higher pollen deposition when bees were the same size or bigger than the separation between anther and stigma within a flower. We found a similar, but not statistically significant pattern for fruit set. In contrast, seed set was more likely to occur when the size of the flower exceeded the size of the bee, suggesting that other postpollination processes may be important in translating pollen receipt to seed set. Our results suggest that the fit between flower and pollinator significantly influences pollen deposition in this buzz-pollinated species. We speculate that in buzz-pollinated species where floral morphology and pollinators interact closely, variation in the visitor's size may determine whether it acts mainly as a pollinator or as a pollen thief (i.e., removing pollen rewards but contributing little to pollen deposition and fertilization). © 2017 The Authors.

1472,2-s2.0-84873175087,2013,Invasive species management restores a plant-pollinator mutualism in Hawaii,"The management and removal of invasive species may give rise to unanticipated changes in plant-pollinator mutualisms because they can alter the composition and functioning of plant-pollinator interactions in a variety of ways. To utilize a functional approach for invasive species management, we examined the restoration of plant-pollinator mutualisms following the large-scale removal of an invasive nectar thief and arthropod predator, Vespula pensylvanica. We reduced V. pensylvanica populations in large plots managed over multiple years to examine the response of plant-pollinator mutualisms and the fruit production of a functionally important endemic Hawaiian tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha. To integrate knowledge of the invader's behaviour and the plant's mating system, we determined the efficacy of V. pensylvanica as a pollinator of M. polymorpha and quantified the dependence of M. polymorpha on animal pollination (e.g. level of self-compatibility and pollen limitation). The reduction of V. pensylvanica in managed sites, when compared to unmanaged sites, resulted in a significant increase in the visitation rates of effective bee pollinators (e.g. introduced Apis mellifera and native Hylaeus spp.) and in the fruit production of M. polymorpha. Apis mellifera, following the management of V. pensylvanica, appears to be acting as a substitute pollinator for M. polymorpha, replacing extinct or threatened bird and bee species in our study system. Synthesis and applications. Fruit production of the native M. polymorpha was increased after management of the invasive pollinator predator V. pensylvanica; however, the main pollinators were no longer native but introduced. This research thus demonstrates the diverse impacts of introduced species on ecological function and the ambiguous role they play in restoration. We recommend incorporating ecological function and context into invasive species management as this approach may enable conservation managers to simultaneously minimize the negative and maximize the positive impacts (e.g. taxon substitution) of introduced species. Such novel restoration approaches are needed, especially in highly degraded ecosystems.

We used a comparative approach to test whether rarity is associated with reproductive biology in two closely-related species pairs. This system has been recently altered by changes in fire regimes and the introduction of European honeybees. More than 35% of flowers matured fruits in the common species after natural-pollination compared to <20% of flowers in the rare species. All species were obligate outcrossers in each of the study populations, but only the two rare species were pollen-limited, having significantly lower fruit-set on open-pollinated flowers than those cross-pollinated by hand (mean ± SE; 0.18 ± 0.02 vs. 0.42 ± 0.05; p < 0.001). Native bees (Leioproctus species) and introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera) visited all species. The native bees visited fewer flowers within a plant and moved greater distances between plants while foraging than honeybees, so the native bees are expected to be more effective in promoting outcrossing. While honeybees were the most frequent visitors to flowers of all species, native bees made more visits to common than rare species (0.65 ± 0.20 vs. 0.20 ± 0.09). Our results suggest that the poorer reproductive success in rare Persoonia species is associated with lower pollinator effectiveness, which is exacerbated by frequent fires and introduced honeybees. If this is a causal relationship, this may increase the probability of extinction in populations of these species. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,,,

Chl. lamellata flowers from November to January, forming a lax spike with ca. 13 flowers. The floral life-span is 14 ± 4 days. The species is self-compatible. There was no statistical difference between the amount of seed produced after hand cross-pollination and hand self-pollination treatments. Neither direct autogamy nor agamospermy are involved in seed setting, thus pollinating agents are essential for the species' reproduction. Also, it has a high number of pollen grains (881733) and ovules (599833) per flower. The P/O ratio calculated is low (1.46). Probable pollinators belong to the orders Hymenoptera (Corynura chloris and Ruizantheda proxima) and Diptera (Sarcophagidae); these insects had a low visitation rate (0.00002 visits/spike/ minute). The rate of pollination observed was low (28.6% flowers with pollinia deposited versus 71.3% flowers with pollinia removed).

Biopesticides are considered an alternative to synthetic pesticides with a focus on reducing potential detrimental effects to beneficial organisms such as bees. The production of healthy queen stingless bees is essential for the survival and reproduction of hives, although it remains unknown whether biopesticides influence stingless bee reproduction. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the biopesticide azadirachtin on the survival, behavior, morphology, development, and reproduction of queens of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese, 1900). The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a toxic reference standard. Queens were orally exposed in vitro to a contaminated diet (containing azadirachtin and imidacloprid) during development. Azadirachtin resulted in reduced survival, similarly to imidacloprid, altered development time, caused deformations, and reduced the size of the queens’ reproductive organs. All of these factors could potentially compromise colony survival. Results from the present study showed azadirachtin posed a toxicological hazard to P. helleri queens. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",NA,NA,,,

The dispersion of this pathogen may be influenced by many factors, including various aspects of beekeeping management such as introduction of queens with different origin. Herein we study the relation of the presence and distribution of Nosema spp. and the replacement of queens in honeybee populations settled on the Atlantic Canary Islands. While Nosema apis has not been detected, an increase of the presence and distribution of Nosema ceranae during the last decade has been observed in parallel with a higher frequency of foreign queens. On the other hand, a reduction of the number of N. ceranae positive colonies was observed on those islands with continued replacement of queens. We suggest that such replacement could help maintaining low rates of Nosema infection, but healthy queens native to these islands should be used in order to conserve local honeybee diversity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Spain,Atlantic Canary Islands,"Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain",28.225896,-16.617658
433,2-s2.0-84996843111,2016,Differential gene expression in Varroa jacobsoni mites following a host shift to European honey bees (Apis mellifera),"Background: Varroa mites are widely considered the biggest honey bee health problem worldwide. Until recently, Varroa jacobsoni has been found to live and reproduce only in Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) colonies, while V. destructor successfully reproduces in both A. cerana and A. mellifera colonies. However, we have identified an island population of V. jacobsoni that is highly destructive to A. mellifera, the primary species used for pollination and honey production. The ability of these populations of mites to cross the host species boundary potentially represents an enormous threat to apiculture, and is presumably due to genetic variation that exists among populations of V. jacobsoni that influences gene expression and reproductive status. In this work, we investigate differences in gene expression between populations of V. jacobsoni reproducing on A. cerana and those either reproducing or not capable of reproducing on A. mellifera, in order to gain insight into differences that allow V. jacobsoni to overcome its normal species tropism. Results: We sequenced and assembled a de novo transcriptome of V. jacobsoni. We also performed a differential gene expression analysis contrasting biological replicates of V. jacobsoni populations that differ in their ability to reproduce on A. mellifera. Using the edgeR, EBSeq and DESeq R packages for differential gene expression analysis, we found 287 differentially expressed genes (FDR ? 0.05), of which 91% were up regulated in mites reproducing on A. mellifera. In addition, mites found reproducing on A. mellifera showed substantially more variation in expression among replicates. We searched for orthologous genes in public databases and were able to associate 100 of these 287 differentially expressed genes with a functional description. Conclusions: There is differential gene expression between the two mite groups, with more variation in gene expression among mites that were able to reproduce on A. mellifera. A small set of genes showed reduced expression in mites on the A. mellifera host, including putative transcription factors and digestive tract developmental genes. The vast majority of differentially expressed genes were up-regulated in this host. This gene set showed enrichment for genes associated with mitochondrial respiratory function and apoptosis, suggesting that mites on this host may be experiencing higher stress, and may be less optimally adapted to parasitize it. Some genes involved in reproduction and oogenesis were also overexpressed, which should be further studied in regards to this host shift. © 2016 The Author(s).",NA,NA,,,
1148,2-s2.0-84894062379,2014,Predatory pollinator deception: Does the orchid mantis resemble a model species?,"Cases of imperfect or non-model mimicry are common in plants and animals and challenge intuitive assumptions about the nature of directional selection on mimics. Many non-rewarding flower species do not mimic a particular species, but attract pollinators through 'generalised food deception'. Some predatory animals also attract pollinators by resembling flowers, perhaps the most well known, yet least well understood, is the orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus. This praying mantis has been hypothesised to mimic a flower corolla and we have previously shown that it attracts and captures pollinating insects as prey. Predatory pollinator deception is relatively unstudied and whether this occurs through model mimicry or generalised food deception in the orchid mantis is unknown. To test whether the orchid mantis mimics a specific model flower species we investigated similarities between its morphology and that of flowers in its natural habitat in peninsular Malaysia. Geometric morphometrics were used to compare the shape of mantis femoral lobes to flower petals. Physiological vision models were used to compare the colour of mantises and flowers from the perspective of bees, flies and birds. We did not find strong evidence for a specific model flower species for the orchid mantis. The mantis' colour and shape varied within the range of that exhibited by many flower petals rather than resembling one type in particular. We suggest that the orchid mantis resembles an average, or generalised flower-like stimulus. Thus predatory pollinator deception in the orchid mantis is likely to function as a form of generalised food deception, as opposed to model mimicry. © 2014 Current Zoology.",Malaysia,Peninsular Malaysia,Malaysia,2.521947,113.833569

We identified physiologically and behaviorally active compounds by gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and behavioral tests in the field. Dummies scented with cuticle extracts of virgin females or of O. sphegodes labellum extracts elicited significantly more male reactions than odorless dummies. Therefore, copulation behavior eliciting semio-chemicals are located on the surface of the females' cuticle and the surface of the flowers. Within bee and orchid samples, n-alkanes and n-alkenes, aldehydes, esters, all-trans-farnesol and all-trans-farnesyl hexanoate triggered electroantennographic responses in male antennae. Most of the alkanes and alkenes occurred in similar patterns both in the bees and orchids. O. sphegodes leaf extracts contained mostly the same compounds but in different proportions. In behavioral tests with synthetic compounds, blends of alkenes triggered significantly more approaches and pounces of the males whereas alkanes were not more attractive than odorless dummies. Since alkanes and alkenes together were most attractive, we conclude they constitute the bees' sex pheromone as well as the pseudocopulation-behavior releasing orchid-odor bouquet.",NA,NA,,,
1951,2-s2.0-78751619238,2011,Scaling down from species to individuals: A flower-visitation network between individual honeybees and thistle plants,"Studies of ecological networks usually focus upon interaction patterns among species. However, linkage among species is mediated by their constituting individuals. Thus, every linked species pair in a network encapsulates a new network of interacting individuals. Very few studies outside the sociology of larger animals have investigated networks at the level of the individual. Here, we analyse the structure of a flower-visitation network of individual thistles Cirsium arvense and honeybees Apis mellifera in a small meadow patch in Denmark. We marked and numbered 62 honeybees and 32 thistle stems and monitored all floral visits. The constructed bipartite network of individual plants and bees had a high connectance and low nestedness, but it was not significantly modular. Frequency distributions of number of links per species (i.e. linkage level) had their best fit to a truncated power law, and interactions were asymmetrical. Unipartite networks of either plants or bees had exceedingly short average path length and high clustering. Linkage level of plants increased with their number of flower heads and height of inflorescence (floral display parameters). Overall, the individual network of honeybees and thistles was denser linked than what is known from species pollination networks. Characteristics of both plants (e.g. floral display) and animals (e.g. foraging behaviour) are likely to generate this intra-specific, inter-individual link pattern. Such features of individual-individual networks may scale up and become important drivers of the structure and dynamics of species-species networks. © 2011 The Authors.",Denmark,Denmark,Denmark,55.966966,9.018163

However, most commercial orchards have a limited number of cultivars arranged in monotypic blocks or rows. This can result in insufficient inter-cultivar pollination. We hypothesise that limitations in pollen transfer among cultivars could be explained by both insect behaviour and orchard design. We compared insect activity and pollination efficiency in two European pear cultivars, in orchards with different designs: (i) cultivars alternated in the same row or (ii) cultivars in separate rows. To assess limitations in pollen transfer, we also compared hand pollination with compatible pollen versus open pollination by insects. Insect visitors mainly foraged on neighbouring trees within a row, with few movements across rows (1%). Honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) visited significantly more flowers per tree (8.5 vs. 3) and more trees (2.1 vs. 1.3) than solitary bees (Andrena spp.) and hoverflies. Insect visitors deposited large amounts of pollen (?500 pollen grains) on flower stigmas regardless of the insect type. Cultivar placement affected inter-cultivar pollination; less incompatibility signs were observed when cultivars alternated in the same row (5%) than when cultivars were in separate rows (38%). We observed limitations in pollen transfer as open pollination resulted in significant reduced fruit set, compared with hand pollination, in ‘Conférence’ (21% vs. 30.7%) and ‘Doyenné du Comice’ (7.2% vs. 16.8%). The foraging behaviour of the insects limited thus inter-cultivar pollen transfer in the orchards with cultivars in separate rows. Cultivars used for pollination (pollinizers) should be planted in the same rows as the main cultivar to increase inter-cultivar pollination. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",NA,NA,,,
1745,2-s2.0-84855704065,2012,RFID tracking of sublethal effects of two neonicotinoid insecticides on the foraging behavior of Apis mellifera,"The development of insecticides requires valid risk assessment procedures to avoid causing harm to beneficial insects and especially to pollinators such as the honeybee Apis mellifera. In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ?0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ?1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides. © 2012 Schneider et al.",NA,NA,,,

In this study, the stingless bees, Heterotrigona itama were placed together with the greenhouse cucumbers, Cucumis sativus in order to investigate the effects of H. itama pollination on greenhouse cucumber. This experiment involved three pollination treatments; namely pollination without stingless bee, hand-cross pollination and pollination by stingless bee, H. itama. Two hives of stingless bees were introduced into the greenhouse at least two days before the cucumber flowers started to bloom. Results showed that the cucumbers pollinated by stingless bee and hand-cross pollination produced heavier, longer and larger cucumbers compared to those produced from pollination without stingless bees. However, in terms of dried weight seed, firmness and colour of cucumbers, no significant difference between the treatments were detected.

276,2-s2.0-85016512659,2017,Two ways of acquiring environmental knowledge: by encountering living animals at a beehive and by observing bees via digital tools,"Pollinating animals are profoundly affected by the current loss of biodiversity, a problem that is of concern to science, policy-makers and the public. One possibility to raise awareness for pollinator conservation is education. Unfortunately, insects such as bees are often perceived as frightening creatures; a negative emotion that may hinder successful learning processes. Thus, any educational initiative must conquer this obstacle and promote conservational knowledge. Using a quasi-experimental design, we evaluated the effectiveness of an educational programme using two student-centred learning approaches: One by encountering living honeybees (Apis mellifera) at a beehive (N = 162), the other by using an eLearning tool connected to a remote beehive (N = 192). We monitored secondary school students’ environmentally relevant knowledge of bees, their environmental attitudes and their perception of bees in regard to conservation and dangerousness. The results indicate that both approaches lead to the acquisition of conservational knowledge in the short and medium term. Direct experiences with nature are regarded as crucial, but using an eLearning tool in environmental education constitutes an outstanding alternative to acquire knowledge. Adolescents with low ‘green’ attitudes responded positively to the online beehive, and the perceived danger of bees played no role in the learning process. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",NA,NA,,,

Plants flowered during the hot season (May-October), and flowers opened for one night only. Variations were observed in the flowers’ opening time, with the early-opening plants beginning to open two hours before sunset, and the late-opening plants opening close to sunset. Flowers were visited only by day-active insects: the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the carpenter bee (Xylocopa pubescens). The visitors’ behavior indicated that they were involved in pollination. Early-opening flowers were visited both in the evening and in the morning, whereas late-openers were visited only in the morning. C. peruvianus was found to be self-incompatible, and fruit set did not occur when flowers were hand self-pollinated. Hand cross-pollination resulted in very high fruit set (92%) and heavy fruits with a high seed number. Fruit set, seed number, and fruit weight were lower in open-pollination than in hand cross-pollination. This indicates limited pollination or fertilization in open-pollination and might be related to the briefness of the bee visits, reduced pollen germinability, and stigma receptivity during part of the visit period. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Israel,Beer Sheva,"Beersheba, Israel",31.25181,34.7913

The population genetics of the native bee Partamona bilineata (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) in the cloud forests of Guatemala,"Habitat fragmentation and loss are important drivers of genetic differentiation, often leading to a decrease in genetic diversity. Yet, natural populations of tropical bees often show a lack of differentiation, even in fragmented landscapes, suggesting resilience to deal with unfavourable land use. It is not clear what leads to this lack of differentiation, but large population sizes, high rates of dispersal and stable demography likely play important roles. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure and infer the present and historic demography of the eusocial stingless bee Partamona bilineata from tropical montane cloud forests in Guatemala. We used microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA to test for genetic differentiation, to infer migration rates, and to evaluate the effects of landscape. We also used demographic modelling to trace population sizes over time. We found that six populations of P. bilineata exhibited only subtle differentiation, with the exception of one site at the edge of the cloud forest, which was clearly distinct from all others. Effective population sizes (number of colonies) appeared to be rather small (18 ± 6 colonies) compared to the original sample size (N = 51 ± 9), but stable over time, and inferred rates of gene flow were low; yet, no genetic bottleneck was detected. A statistical model including elevation was the best in explaining the observed pattern of differentiation. We find that P. bilineata does not exhibit strong genetic structure, making it a resilient species for provision of pollination services. But, at the same time, our data point to the potential vulnerability of this and similar species, as effective population sizes appear to be low and hence populations may be easily affected by future environmental change. As such, P. bilineata may be representative of many other tropical stingless bees, for which lack of differentiation has been invoked. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Guatemala,Guatemala,Guatemala,14.989397,-90.522408
2671,2-s2.0-33845574429,2006,Structure of a plant-pollinator network on a pahoehoe lava desert of the Galápagos Islands,"Plant-pollinator interactions are important for the evolution and survival of the species involved. Plant-pollinator networks on oceanic islands are often small in size and as a consequence the connectance is high suggesting a substantial generalisation level. Further, linkage level for insular plants is shown to be lower than on mainland. The present study investigates a plant-pollinator network on the Galápagos Islands that is unique because of its very small size. We recorded pollinator visits to plant species as well as pollen grains on insect bodies. The combination of these data increased the observed number of interactions. The values for connectance and linkage level for plants were found to be consistent with similar values found in other network studies. There were no relation between the abundance of plant species and the number of pollinating species. The dominating pollinator species was the Galápagos carpenter bee Xylocopa darwini. Specimens of the shorthorned grasshopper Halmenus cuspidatus turned out to carry pollen from five plant species out of twelve and are probably functioning as pollinator. Bagging experiments revealed dependency on insect visits for a high seed set for most of the plant species, but only one species Plumbago scandens seemed to possess a pollen limited seed set. The network showed an asymmetric pattern of number of interactions per species with a few species having several interactions and many species a few. This pattern is supposed to result in a rather robust community, but is also fairly sensitive if the dominant species are threatened. The high connectance value found could, however, counteract this vulnerability. © Ecography.",Ecuador,Galápagos Islands,Galápagos Islands,-0.666667,-90.55

Viable larvae were found in only 47.1% of the nest cells collected at the end of the season. Most of the rest of the cells contained pollen balls (typified by a provision but no larva; 16.7%), unknown causes of mortality (15.5%), or larvae killed by chalkbrood (8.0%). Prevalence of pollen balls was correlated positively with bee release rates and negatively with alfalfa stand age. The unknown mortality was correlated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Plant Hardiness Zone, and thus, some of the mortality may be caused by high temperature extremes, although the nesting season degree-days were not correlated with this mortality. Chalk-brood prevalence was correlated with possible nesting-resource or crowding-related factors, such as the number of bees released per hectare and the number of shelters used, but not with nesting board disinfection practices. Vapona is used to control parasitoids when the parent bees are incubated before release, and use of this fumigant was associated with an increase in both chalkbrood and diapausing offspring, although any reason for these correlations are unknown. This survey quantifies the variation in the quality of alfalfa leafcutting bee cocoons produced across much of the U.S. alfalfa seed production area. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.",United States,United States,United States,39.715956,-96.999668

The elephant-shrews were live-trapped near the plants in the Western Cape of South Africa. One animal was released in a terrarium, containing the plants. It licked nectar with its long and slender tongue while being dusted with pollen and touching the stigmas of the flowers with its nose and the fur above the snout. H. atropurpurea pollen was found in swabs of the fur around noses and snouts as well as in the faeces of captured animals. The occurrence of pollen in the faeces of the elephant-shrews is likely a result of grooming their fur as they visited the flowers without eating or damaging them. This is one of the first records of pollinating, nectar-drinking elephant-shrews, contributing to the very scarce knowledge about the behaviour of those primarily insectivorous animals, as well as small mammal pollination. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",South Africa,Western Cape,"Western Cape, South Africa",-33.582933,19.760643

Pesticide exposure is a potential factor in the loss of foragers. During 2009-2010, we assessed changes in the field force populations of 9-10 colonies at one location per crop on each of the eight crops by counting departing foragers leaving colonies at regular intervals during the respective crop blooming periods. The number of frames of adult bees was counted before and after bloom period. For pesticide analysis, we collected dead and dying bees near the hives, returning foragers, crop flowers, trapped pollen, and corn-flowers associated with the cotton crop. The number of departing foragers changed over time in all crops except almonds; general patterns in foraging activity included declines (cotton), noticeable peaks and declines (alfalfa, blueberries, cotton, corn, and pumpkins), and increases (apples and cantaloupes). The number of adult bee frames increased or remained stable in all crops except alfalfa and cotton. A total of 53 different pesticide residues were identified in samples collected across eight crops. Hazard quotients (HQ) were calculated for the combined residues for all crop-associated samples and separately for samples of dead and dying bees. A decrease in the number of departing foragers in cotton was one of the most substantial crop-associated impacts and presented the highest pesticide risk estimated by a summed pesticide residue HQ. © The Authors 2015.

The data revealed that, 13 genera belonging to nine trees (8 families) and four shrubs (4 families) provided the nesting platform to A. florea. The density, abundance, and frequency of nesting plants varied considerably. While Pongamia pinnata was selected frequently among the trees, Bouganvillea sp. was preferred among the shrubs for nesting. There was a significant variation (X2 = 18.25; P&lt;0.05) among the tree and shrub species selected for nesting by A. florea in different habitats. Further, thin to medium (2-4 inch dia.) sized limbs, often interspersed thickly at different elevations in trees and shrubby plants were found suitable for the construction of colonies. The combs were found at the peripheral and middle regions of thickly interspersed canopy in trees and shrubs respectively, possibly to ensure withstanding the comb weight, protecting the comb from wind blow, and avoiding predation and hunting. Thus, it appears that A. florea adopts elite strategy to safeguard its colonies from certain ecological and biological impediments in the wild by choosing plants with thick interspersed limbs covered with thick canopy. In view of its role as an important pollinating agent of many crops, the preservation of the commonly chosen nesting plants becomes all the more important for conservation of A. florea. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",India,Karnataka,"Karnataka, India",14.882195,75.57454

Our studies showed that DWV infection spreads throughout the entire body of B. huntii and that the concentration of DWV is higher in workers than in males both collected in the field and reared in the laboratory, implying a possible association between the virus infection and foraging activities. Further results showed that gut tissue of B. huntii can support the replication of DWV, suggesting that B. huntii is a biological host for DWV, as are honey bees. Bumble bees and honey bees sometimes share nectar and pollen resources in the same field.

(cultivars 'Cubico' and 'Plutona'). Four pollination trials lasting 2-5 weeks were conducted in three greenhouses from mid-March to the end of August 1991. Bees were introduced once a week for 24 h into each greenhouse. At the same time, a pollination cage was placed over a block of plants in each greenhouse to establish a control (no bees). For 'Plutona', the effect of bumble bees as pollinators was significant (P < 0.05) for fruit weight, fruit width, fruit volume, pericarp volume, seed weight and days from fruit set to harvest. Bee pollination also improved fruit grade, resulting in a greater percentage of extra-large and large fruit, and fruit with four locules. For 'Cubico', pollination by bumble bees significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the number of days from fruit set to harvest and increased the percentage of extra-large and large fruit. A simple cost-benefit analysis has shown that the use of B. impatiens as pollinators of greenhouse sweet pepper is likely to increase the profitability for both cultivars. © 1994.",NA,NA,,,
2571,2-s2.0-34250784692,2007,Male-biased nectar production in a protandrous herb matches predictions of sexual selection theory in plants,"Nectar production may disproportionately benefit male relative to female pollination success. In such cases, sexual selection is often suggested as the cause of asymmetric benefits, yet sexual selection in plants - particularly plants with hermaphroditic flowers - is infrequently tested empirically. Here, I used a protandrous herb with male-biased nectar production (Chrysothemis friedrichsthaliana, Gesneriaceae) to test predictions from sexual selection theory. During three flowering seasons, I measured nectar production, pollinator visits, and male and female fecundity following different numbers of cross-pollination events. In accordance with sexual selection predictions, (1) nectar production was greater during the male phase by at least 65%; (2) visits by the main pollinator (hummingbird Phaethornis striigularis) were limiting for part of the season, indicating that plants had to compete for pollinator visits; (3) pollinators spent 53% more time per visit and made 86% more visits to male- vs. female-phase flowers, suggesting that nectar increased male more than female pollination success; and (4) female fecundity was maximized by one visit, whereas male fecundity continued to increase with additional visits. Autonomous self-pollination further reduced visit requirements for maximum female seed set. These findings match specific sexual selection predictions: they link an observable male bias in a secondary sexual trait (nectar) to positive responses of mating participants (pollinators), resulting in more mating opportunities for mate-limited males, relative to apparently resource-limited females. This field-testing of theoretical predictions provides unique evidence that sexual selection helps maintain nectar production patterns in this and, quite likely, other hermaphroditic plant species.",NA,NA,,,

This study of the reproductive biologies and pollinator faunas of C. lutea and C. serrulata is the first for this cosmopolitan family, the sister family to the Brassicaceae. Unlike the S-allele self-incompatibility systems of some Brassicaceae, both species of Cleome were found to be self-fertile and capable of some autogamy. Compared with selfing, outcrossing did not enhance seed set, seed viability or seedling vigor for either species (in fact, selfed progeny were more robust). Large, openly visited plants yielded >20 000 seeds each. Like several species of the sister family Capparaceae, flowers of both species first shed their pollen, secreted nectar and became receptive nocturnally. Although no nocturnal visitors were found, both Cleome species attracted a diverse array of diurnal native bees, wasps and butterflies. Among the many floral generalist bees that work Cleome flowers for pollen and nectar are two managed agricultural pollinators, Apis mellifera and Megachile rotundata. These observations bode well for pollinating C. lutea and C. serrulata in small commercial seed fields.

However, little is known about the impacts of these invasive predators on bats (Chiroptera), one of the most specious mammal groups, and one of the most widespread groups of mammals threatened on oceanic islands (> 200 spp.). Nearly 50% of the world's threatened bats are island endemics and because they are often the only native mammals on islands, they fulfil important ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal. Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are critically endangered because of predation by exotic mammals, particularly ship rats (Rattus rattus), introduced by humans to the island archipelago of New Zealand. We monitored the survival of bats in three colonies in temperate rainforest in Fiordland over 22 years. Since 2009, we controlled predators during irruption phases and compared survival of bats in previously untreated areas with survival in forest blocks treated using rodenticides deployed in bait stations. Survival was estimated using multi-state mark-recapture models in Program Mark 7.0 with > 15,000 bats tagged. Survival was primarily dependent on year and age of bats, although seedfall intensity of the dominant canopy tree and predator management was also influential. Survival in long-tailed bats was as high as, or higher, than figures for bats generally in years with low predator numbers or predator control. Survival was markedly higher in treatment years when predators were managed (0.82 compared to 0.55). Population modelling indicated managed colonies will increase (? > 1.05) whereas unmanaged colonies will decline (? = 0.89 ? 0.98) under scenarios that reflect increased frequency of beech mast and predator irruptions. Thus, effective predator control is essential for recovering long-tailed bat populations. Warming temperatures indicate that predator irruptions are becoming more frequent, which would require more predator control in the future than at present if declines in bat populations are to be reversed. These results are relevant to the conservation of threatened bats on oceanic islands, given the abundance of exotic mammalian predators, particularly ship rats, on them. © 2017",New Zealand,New Zealand,New Zealand,-45.175323,169.232531

POCKET FILLING AND EMPTYING BY CERATOSOLEN ARABICUS MAYR,"Filling of pockets with pollen by the agaonid wasp Ceratosolen arabicus Mayr (Chalcidoidea, Hymenoptera) was studied in Ficus sycomorus L. at Magadi, Kenya. The phenology of the fig during the male phase (D) was observed in detail and various techniques were devised in order to ensure the normal behaviour of the wasps in spite of the bisection of the fig and the strong illumination necessary for carrying out the observations. It was found that in fig?halves tightly enclosed with cellophane paper during the second morning of the male phase, the emerging wasps filled their pockets with pollen from anthers previously detached by the male wasps. It was established that the cutting of anthers is a separate, specific action and not merely a byproduct of the tunnelling of the syconial wall that takes place afterwards. In the filling act itself, the role of the combs–rows of stiff bristles along the inner margin of each foreleg coax was established. Pollen was lifted by the arolia of the forelegs from the open anthers to the underside of the thorax and shovelled from there by the coxal combs into the thoracic pockets which gaped widely due to the bending of the body. An analysis of the responses of the wasps to various environmental conditions leads to the conclusion that the size of the cavity is a critical factor in the behaviour of the wasps in the fig of F. sycomorus. The possible role of light for pocket filling in the subdued illumination of the intact fig cavity is discussed. Copyright © 1974, Wiley Blackwell.

Behaviour at the flower and rate of visitation by these bumble bees had specific effects; exclusion of this flower visitor led to retarded onset, and reduced rate, of colour change. 2. The foraging behaviour of B. terrestris was influenced by floral colour change in L. pilosus. Choice of pre-change flowers was greater than random in relation to the proportion of colour phases available within the plant population. 3. Levels of floral manipulation that mimicked the flower handling characteristics of visiting bumble bees confirmed that triggering of the pollen release mechanism is necessary for the instigation of colour change. 4. Moreover, this study suggests that, in L. pilosus, an aspect of pollination (pollen deposition by bees and/or subsequent pollen tube growth within the style) is linked with colour change and may act as the trigger for such change.",NA,NA,,,

The mites are phoretic on the outside of the wasps and phytophagous, feeding on galled flowers. The nematodes are transported inside the wasps and eventually eat them. Both mites and nematodes were present throughout the year. The prevalence (fig occupancy rates) of mites and nematodes in different crops ranged between zero and 100 %. Crop size did not influence the prevalence of either mites or nematodes. Contrasting dispersion patterns and relationships with fig wasp foundress numbers indicate that the mites, but not the nematodes, disperse between figs after being carried there by the pollinators, and they may also utilize non-pollinating fig wasps as vectors.",South Africa,Grahamstown,"Grahamstown, South Africa",-33.308962,26.534265

Hematology and plasma biochemistries were determined from wild-caught flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus) in northern India (n = 41). Mean lymphocyte differential count was higher for juveniles than adults. Mean platelet count was lower than previously reported. No hemoparasites were observed. No differences were observed between plasma biochemistry values of male and female bats, juveniles and adults, or lactating and nonlactating females. Variation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was seen based on body condition score. Blood urea nitrogen and cholesterol concentrations were lower in P. giganteus than other mammalian groups, but were consistent with those reported from other Pteropus species. Alanine aminotransferase and AST concentrations were higher than those reported for Pteropus vampyrus, a closely related species.

Cynopterus sphinx and Pteropus giganteus visited Ceiba pentandra trees throughout the night, whereas Rousettus leschenaulti visited only during early evening. Peak visits occurred at 2300 h for C. sphinx and 2000-2100 h for P. giganteus, coinciding with maximum nectar production and sugar concentration of floral resources. C. sphinx foraged at 6-10 m, R. leschenaulti at 10-18 m and P. giganteus at 15-20 m heights in the trees. Chemiluminescent-tagged C. sphinx foraged on nectar mostly in single trees until midnight and switched to 2-4 nearby trees later. We observed coats of pollen of C. pentandra on the abdomens, wings, and heads in 40% of C. sphinx captured in mist nets. Pollen loads on the abdomen were greater on males than on females. Our observations on R. leschenaulti and P. giganteus also showed adherence of pollen grains on their bodies.

This plant is involved in a nursery pollination system, because a noctuid moth, Hadena bicruris, is not only pollinator but also seed predator. Lilac aldehyde is the key floral scent compound of S. latifolia for attracting Hadena. This monoterpene has three stereogenic centers, and eight different isomers are possible. Here, we analysed the ratio of lilac aldehyde isomers from plants originating from 18 different populations of S. latifolia using enantioselective multidimensional GC-MS (enantio-MDGC-MS), and compared resulting variability with variability found in total scent emitted by specimen under study. Though variability in total emitted scent was high, ratio of lilac aldehyde isomers was a more conservative trait. There was no correlation between the ratio of lilac aldehyde isomers and the total emitted floral scent pattern. Both, ratio of stereoisomers and total emitted scent were independent from the geographic origin of the plants. In conclusion, the ratio of lilac aldehyde stereoisomers in S. latifolia is a reliable trait, and may used by the nursery pollinator H. bicruris for host-plant detection. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Three 20 week trials were therefore conducted, each using a different hive of Austroplebeia australis Friese and Trigona carbonaria Smith placed in separate glasshouses containing Capsicum annuum L. A third glasshouse contained C. annuum but no bees. In the third week of each trial, the numbers of pollen grains present on stigmatic surfaces and pollen tubes growing along styles were determined. Changes in brood volume were assessed by x-ray computerised tomography at weeks 1, 10 and 20. Additionally, the hives were weighed at these times. At the end of each trial, fruit diameter and length and their fresh and dry weights were measured as were seed fresh and dry weights. Bee behaviour was recorded in the third trial. T. carbonaria foraged less sporadically on C. annuum flowers than did A. australis, and pollination by both bee species showed their potential to increase fruit yield and quality. The effects of pollination by either species were, however, not consistent among the three trials. Hive weights and brood volumes for all colonies increased, so it is considered that both species thrived whilst being able to pollinate the plants. Both species therefore have the potential to improve fruit yield and quality within the greenhouse environment. It was noted that A. australis caused damage to the styles in each trial. This may be attributed to the foraging strategies employed by this species and further work is needed to determine optimum bee to flower stocking rates. © 2011 IBRA.",NA,NA,,,
1084,2-s2.0-84901657410,2014,The roles of colour and shape in pollinator deception in the orchid mantis hymenopus coronatus,"The orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus (Insecta: Mantodea) is a deceptive predator that attracts pollinators as prey. Their resemblance to a flower has given rise to the hypothesis that they are flower mimics. However, floral mimicry as a predatory strategy, and in particular, how predatory floral mimicry functions at a mechanistic level is poorly understood. Two main morphological characteristics are thought to make orchid mantises appear similar to flowers and thus attractive to pollinators: (1) their 'flower-like' white colouration and (2) their 'petal-shaped' expansions of exoskeleton on their mid-femur and hind femur (femoral lobes). I investigated the contribution of these colour and shape characteristics to pollinator attraction using artificial orchid mantis models. Models with the 'flower-like' white colouration of the orchid mantis had higher rates of pollinator inspection than brown models. Manipulating overall body shape by removing or changing the orientation of the 'petal-shaped' femoral lobes did not affect the attractiveness of models. As certain flower-like characteristics (symmetry and petals) did not affect the attractiveness of models, pollinators may not necessarily cognitively misclassify orchid mantises as flowers. Rather, mantises may be exploiting sensory biases of their pollinator prey, and their UV-absorbing white colouration may be sufficient to lure pollinators. The effectiveness of using artificial models established here provides a basis for future research into orchid mantis morphology and the fine-scale interactions between orchid mantises and pollinators. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",NA,NA,,,

27,2-s2.0-85029412203,2018,Supplementing small farms with native mason bees increases strawberry size and growth rate,"Pollination services, especially those of bees, play a vital role in agriculture. Declining honeybee populations require us to find alternative solutions for sustainable agriculture. Native bees are proving to be efficient pollinators. Mason bees (Osmia lignaria) provide valuable pollinator services for some woody orchard species, but their value as pollinators for herbaceous crops is largely untested. We assessed the effectiveness of O. lignaria supplementation on nine strawberry farms over two growing seasons. We specifically selected mason bees for this work because they emerge from cocoons in the springtime, when few other bees are available for pollination. Cocoons are easily deployed on farms and emerged bees have a small flight radius, so they remain localized. We placed cocoons on one side of each berry farm plot (our mason bee addition treatment) but not on the opposite side (our control). We tagged and monitored berries on nine farms throughout the growing season. We performed statistical comparisons of berries from the treatment and control for differences in berry growth rate and size. In addition, we supplemented farms with native bee homes constructed from three materials (bamboo, Phragmites and wood). This allowed us to determine whether adult mason bees would produce a subsequent generation of bees on farms and whether the bees had a preference for nest material type. Our work demonstrates that mason bees can be used successfully to pollinate herbaceous berry crops. We found that berry growth rate was significantly higher and berry volume was significantly larger for berries from the treatment relative to the control. We also found that adult bees successfully utilized the bee homes for laying the next generation of offspring and that bees colonized bamboo homes more than other home types. Synthesis and applications. Our results are the first to show that native mason bees (Osmia lignaria) can be used successfully to provide pollination services on strawberry farms. Their use results in the production of bigger berries and faster berry growth rates than managed honeybees alone. Mason bees overwinter (and can be purchased) in cocoons, offering great potential for efficient and effective pollination services, for a variety of agricultural applications across different geographical regions. The availability of suitable nesting sites and protection of subsequent generations of cocoons from wasp parasitization warrant future consideration. © 2017 The Authors.

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Germany,Leipzig,"Leipzig, Germany",51.341053,12.404024
1060,2-s2.0-84893940848,2014,Three floral volatiles contribute to differential pollinator attraction in monkeyflowers (Mimulus),"Flowering plants employ a wide variety of signals, including scent, to attract the attention of pollinators. In this study we investigated the role of floral scent in mediating differential attraction between two species of monkeyflowers (Mimulus) reproductively isolated by pollinator preference. The emission rate and chemical identity of floral volatiles differ between the bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii and the hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis. Mimulus lewisii flowers produce an array of volatiles dominated by D-limonene, p-myrcene and E-p-ocimene. Of these three monoterpenes, M. cardinalis flowers produce only D-limonene, released at just 0.9% the rate of M. lewisii flowers. Using the Bombus vosnesenskii bumblebee, an important pollinator of M. lewisii, we conducted simultaneous gas chromatography with extracellular recordings in the bumblebee antennal lobe. Results from these experiments revealed that these three monoterpenes evoke significant neural responses, and that a synthetic mixture of the three volatiles evokes the same responses as the natural scent. Furthermore, the neural population shows enhanced responses to the M. lewisii scent over the scent of M. cardinalis. This neural response is reflected in behavior; in two-choice assays, bumblebees investigate artificial flowers scented with M. lewisii more frequently than ones scented with M. cardinalis, and in synthetic mixtures the three monoterpenes are necessary and sufficient to recapitulate responses to the natural scent of M. lewisii. In this system, floral scent alone is sufficient to elicit differential visitation by bumblebees, implying a strong role of scent in the maintenance of reproductive isolation between M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. © 2014.

Accordingly, in the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, a distinctive microbial community, composed of a taxonomically restricted set of species specific to social bees, has been identified. Despite the ecological and economical importance of honey bees and the increasing concern about population declines, the role of their gut symbionts for colony health and nutrition is unknown. Here, we sequenced the metagenome of the gut microbiota of honey bees. Unexpectedly, we found a remarkable degree of genetic diversity within the few bacterial species colonizing the bee gut. Comparative analysis of gene contents suggests that different species harbor distinct functional capabilities linked to host interaction, biofilm formation, and carbohydrate breakdown. Whereas the former two functions could be critical for pathogen defense and immunity, the latter one might assist nutrient utilization. In a ?-proteobacterial species, we identified genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes likely involved in the breakdown of pollen walls. Experimental investigation showed that this activity is restricted to a subset of strains of this species providing evidence for niche specialization. Long-standing association of these gut symbionts with their hosts, favored by the eusocial lifestyle of honey bees, might have promoted the genetic and functional diversification of these bee-specific bacteria. Besides revealing insights intomutualistic functions governed by the microbiota of this important pollinator, our findings indicate that the honey bee can serve as a model for understanding more complex gut-associated microbial communities.",NA,NA,,,

Schum. in the Brazilian Chaco,"Florivory can negatively affect the reproductive success of plants through its effects on fruit set. We report flower consumption of Echinopsis rhodotricha by Mazama americana and Pecari tajacu in the Brazilian Chaco. In order to evaluate the effects of florivory on the reproductive success of E. rhodotricha, we quantified and compared the fruit set between damaged and undamaged flowers in a natural population of this cactus. We recorded 21 damaged flowers in the year 2015 and 43 in 2016. Florivores consumed the whole flowers and therefore no fruits developed. The result of this study indicates that florivory decreases the fruit set in the studied population, both directly by damaging the reproductive organs and indirectly through the reduction of floral attractiveness and rewards for pollinators. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Brazil,Gran Chaco ,"Gran Chaco, Bolivia",-21.503693,-63.19428

The species exploiting F. pertusa feed on nourishing tissue that they induce within fig ovaries that are unexploited by the pollinators, rather than on developing pollinators or seeds. Thus, in this case any costs to the mutualists should be indirect and probably small. F. pertusa's torymid species can only reproduce if females have oviposited within pollinated syconia, since trees abscise nearly all unpollinated ones early in development. Torymid oviposition was delayed relative to pollination, and in the one species investigated, females discriminated among syconia and chose to oviposit in pollinated ones. Offspring depend on the pollinators' male offspring to create an escape passage out of the mature syconium, and maturation times of all wasp species within the syconium are highly synchronized. -from Author",NA,NA,,,

The orchid is clonal and forms small patches of disconnected individual ramets. Ant pollinators visited and revisited a limited proportion of available inflorescences; 40% of all flower visits occurred within plants promoting self-pollination. Self-pollination accounted for 51% of pollen transfers. Distribution of ant movements between plants was leptokurtic with a mean of 12.4±14.9cm and a maximum of 89cm, but a high proportion of movements were within clones accentuating the level of self-pollination. However, some pollen transfers between inflorescences of unlike genotypes contributed to a low incidence (max 8%) of outcrossing.

3394,2-s2.0-0031824818,1998,Variation in pollen limitation among plants and phenotypic selection on floral traits in an early-spring flowering herb,"Female reproductive success in animal pollinated plants may be limited by the amount of suitable pollen that reaches stigmas, but little knowledge exists on how the extent of pollen limitation varies among plants of the same population. Here we ask; (1) if there is pollen limitation at the whole population level in a Norwegian population of an early spring blooming herb, Crocus vernus, (2) if so, if a variation in pollen limitation exists among plants, (3) over which plant traits this variation occurs, and (4) if there is phenotypic selection on plant traits caused by pollen limitation. Pollen limitation on seed number and seed:ovule ratio occurred at the whole population level. By measuring flowering time, plant size, and various aspects of floral display on both supplementary hand-pollinated plants and control plants, we found a significant relationship between reproductive success and petal size in the control plants, but not in plants that received additional pollen. Reproductive success of plants with white stigmas were more pollen limited than that in orange-stigma plants. It is likely that plants with small petals and white stigmas have lower chances of being recognised by pollinators (Apis mellifera), and that this causes the pollen limitation on reproductive success in such plants. Multivariate selection analyses showed significant linear selection on petal size in control plants, but not in extra-pollinated plants, suggesting pollinator mediated selection on petal size.",Norway,Norway,Norway,61.356908,9.680372

Plants experience herbivory on many different tissues that can affect reproduction directly by damaging tissues and decreasing resource availability, or indirectly via interactions with other species such as pollinators. 2. This study investigated the combined effects of leaf herbivory, root herbivory, and pollination on subsequent damage, pollinator preference, and plant performance in a field experiment using butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata). Leaf and root herbivory were manipulated using adult and larval striped cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum F.), a cucurbit specialist. 3. Leaf herbivory reduced subsequent pistillate floral damage and powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) infection. In spite of these induced defences, the overall effect of leaf herbivory on plant reproduction was negative. Leaf herbivory reduced staminate flower production, fruit number, and seed weight. In contrast, root herbivory had a minimal impact on plant reproduction. 4. Neither leaf nor root herbivory altered pollinator visitation or floral traits, suggesting that reductions in plant performance from herbivory were as a result of direct rather than indirect effects. In addition, no measured aspect of reproduction was pollen limited. 5. Our study reveals that although leaf herbivory by the striped cucumber beetle can protect against subsequent damage, this protection was not enough to prevent the negative impacts on plant performance. © 2008 The Authors.",NA,NA,,,
534,2-s2.0-84977622648,2016,Responses of nectar-feeding birds to floral resources at multiple spatial scales,"The responses of animal pollinators to the spatially heterogeneous distribution of floral resources are important for plant reproduction, especially in species-rich plant communities. We explore how responses of pollinators to floral resources varied across multiple spatial scales and studied the responses of two nectarivorous bird species (Cape sugarbird Promerops cafer, orange-breasted sunbird Anthobaphes violacea) to resource distributions provided by communities of co-flowering Protea species (Proteaceae) in South African fynbos. We used highly resolved maps of about 125 000 Protea plants at 27 sites and estimated the seasonal dynamics of standing crop of nectar sugar for each plant to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of floral resources. We recorded avian population sizes and the rates of bird visits to > 1300 focal plants to assess the responses of nectarivorous birds to floral resources at different spatial scales. The population sizes of the two bird species responded positively to the amount of sugar resources at the site scale. Within sites, the effects of floral resources on pollinator visits to plants varied across scales and depended on the resources provided by individual plants. At large scales (radii > 25 m around focal plants), high sugar density decreased per-plant visitation rates, i.e. plants competed for animal pollinators. At small scales (radii < 5 m around focal plants), we observed either competition or facilitation for pollinators between plants, depending on the sugar amount offered by individual focal plants. In plants with copious sugar, per-plant visitation rates increased with increasing local sugar density, but visitation rates decreased in plants with little sugar. Our study underlines the importance of scale-dependent responses of pollinators to floral resources and reveals that pollinators’ responses depend on the interplay between individual floral resources and local resource neighbourhood. © 2015 The Authors",South Africa,South Africa,South Africa,-29.708985,23.666291

The presence of MeSa in emissions of many fruits suitable for D. busckii feeding allows to attribute this attractant to kairomones. In case of P. rudis, MeSa should be attributed to synomones (compounds beneficial for both receiver and sender), because adult flies feeding on flowers act as pollinators.

In orchids, prezygotic reproductive isolation has been considered to be strong, because their associations with highly specific pollinators. In this study, the reproductive ecology and reproductive isolation of two sympatric Habenaria species, H. davidii and H. fordii, was investigated by floral phenology and morphology, hand-pollination experiments and visitor observation in southwest China. The two species were dependent on insects for pollination and completely self-compatible. A number of factors have been identified to limit gene flow between the two species and achieved full reproductive isolation. Ecogeographic isolation was a weak barrier. H. fordii and H. davidii had completely overlapped flowering periods, and floral morphology plays an important role in floral isolation. The two species shared the same hawkmoth pollinator, Cechenena lineosa, but the pollinaria of the two orchids were attached on different body parts of pollinators. Prezygotic isolation was not complete, but the interspecific pollination treatments of each species resulted in no seed sets, indicating that unlike many other orchid species, in which the postzygotic reproductive isolation is very weak or complete absence, the post-zygotic isolation strongly acted in the stage of seed production between two species. The results illustrate the reproductive isolation between two species involves multiple plant life-history stages and a variety of reproductive barriers can contribute to overall isolation. © 2017 Zhang, Gao.

1583,2-s2.0-84866903866,2012,Foraging rules of flower selection applied by colonies of Apis mellifera: Ranking and associations of floral sources,"1. Interactions between bees and flowers are historically a key topic of research in biology. Apis mellifera is known to forage on a wide variety of flowers to collect nectar and/or pollen. Until now, resource collection strategies were investigated focusing on the influence of single factors on foraging decisions, such as hive requirements, surrounding vegetation, resource availability, seasonality and interactions with other bees. Despite the vast amount of literature on A. mellifera, we lack a comprehensive view of its flower selection. 2. Our aim was to go beyond specific circumstances in order to identify general criteria for flower selection at species level. Applying data mining techniques (Market Basket Analysis), we found that bees exert a precise flower selection choice mainly driven by their pollen requirements. The bees foraged all over the study area with no obvious preference for the close surrounding vegetation. They selected a restricted number of all the available sources, for nectar as well as for pollen. Apis mellifera chose some floral sources more regularly than others. The most recurrent sources changed in time according to subsequent flowering peaks and often corresponded to anemophilous species. The compelling need for pollen revealed the constant demand of a few distinct floral sources. Plants providing huge quantities of pollen, such as wind-pollinated species, were preferred. When the pollen source also provided a good quantity of nectar, foragers collected both resources on the same species. 3. This work on A. mellifera helps to clarify some of the complex aspects of its floral selection processes, which emerge from studies on single colonies, areas or environmental factors influencing individual foraging behaviours. It also suggests that some established theories on pollinator-flower interactions, such as the role of wind-pollinated species, need revision. © 2012 The Authors.

We radio-tracked 17 individuals for five to 19 nights over a three month period. The bats were from three cave colonies in agricultural habitats in southern Thailand. They traveled between one and 17.9 km (× ± SD: 4.4 km ± 5.07, median = 2.34) from their roosting cave to food sources. The mean home-range size of the individuals varied with the method used in its calculation from 518.4 ha (100% Minimum Convex Polygon, MCP) to 564.5 ha (100% Local Convex Hull method, LoCoH) and 460.8 ha (95% Kernel density estimation, KDE). The mean size of foraging areas used by the bats also varied according to the method of calculation from 14.26 ha (100% MCP), 13.25 ha (100% LoCoH) and 38.52 ha (95% KDE) and accounted for 21.9%, 20.08% and 40.5% of the respective home-range size. The bats foraged in one to three foraging areas each night. The greatest distance between feeding trees varied between 0.25 and 8 km (mean 1.25 km ± 2.19). Those bats with multiple foraging areas moved from patch to patch of Durio zibethinus and did not return to a previously visited patch, whereas those feeding on Parkia repeated their visits to several patches in a single night.

2236,2-s2.0-67649159249,2009,Flower orientation enhances pollen transfer in bilaterally symmetrical flowers,"Zygomorphic flowers are usually more complex than actinomorphic flowers and are more likely to be visited by specialized pollinators. Complex zygomorphic flowers tend to be oriented horizontally. It is hypothesized that a horizontal flower orientation ensures effective pollen transfer by facilitating pollinator recognition (the recognition-facilitation hypothesis) and/or pollinator landing (the landing-control hypothesis). To examine these two hypotheses, we altered the angle of Commelina communis flowers and examined the efficiency of pollen transfer, as well as the behavior of their visitors. We exposed unmanipulated (horizontal-), upward-, and downward-facing flowers to syrphid flies (mostly Episyrphus balteatus), which are natural visitors to C. communis. The frequency of pollinator approaches and landings, as well as the amount of pollen deposited by E. balteatus, decreased for the downward-facing flowers, supporting both hypotheses. The upward-facing flowers received the same numbers of approaches and landings as the unmanipulated flowers, but experienced more illegitimate landings. In addition, the visitors failed to touch the stigmas or anthers on the upward-facing flowers, leading to reduced pollen export and receipt, and supporting the landing-control hypothesis. Collectively, our data suggested that the horizontal orientation of zygomorphic flowers enhances pollen transfer by both facilitating pollinator recognition and controlling pollinator landing position. These findings suggest that zygomorphic flowers which deviate from a horizontal orientation may have lower fitness because of decreased pollen transfer. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",NA,NA,,,

1512,2-s2.0-84875506553,2013,A comparison of floral resource exploitation by native and invasive Argentine ants,"Ants are often considered antagonists when they visit flowers because they typically steal nectar without providing pollination services. Previous research on ant-flower interactions on two species of South African Proteaceae in the Cape Floral Kingdom revealed that the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), but not native ants, displace other floral arthropod visitors. To determine how common Argentine ant use of inflorescences is, how Argentine and native ant visits differ in the numbers they recruit to inflorescences, and what factors may affect Argentine and native ant foraging in inflorescences, I surveyed 723 inflorescences in 10 species in the genera Protea and Leucospermum across 16 sites and compared ant presence and abundance in inflorescences with abundance at nearby cat food and jam baits. Argentine ants were the most commonly encountered ant of the 22 observed. Argentine ants, as well as six species of native ants were present in all inflorescences for which they were present at nearby baits. Mean Argentine ant abundance per inflorescence was 4. 4 ± 0. 84 (SE) ants and similar to that of Anoplolepis custodiens and Crematogaster peringueyi, but higher than observed for the other most commonly encountered native ants, Camponotus niveosetosus and Lepisiota capensis. Both Argentine ants and A. custodiens were more likely to be found foraging in spring and under humid conditions, and in inflorescences closer to the ground, with lower sucrose concentrations, and with a greater proportion of open flowers. Argentine ants were more likely to be found in Protea inflorescences, whereas A. custodiens and L. capensis more often visited Leucospermum inflorescences. Considering its displacement of floral arthropods and widespread use of Proteaceae inflorescences, the Argentine ant could be posing a serious threat to plant and pollinator conservation in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",South Africa,Cape Floral Kingdom,Cape Floral Kingdom,-34.166667,18.375

For this purpose, the essential oil of an Indian medicinal plant, Terminalia chebula, commonly known as Myrobalan, was isolated for the first time. Hitherto unknown chemical constituents of the essential oil were determined by GC/MS. The repellent activity of formulations of the essential oil, tested towards the Indian honeybee Apis florea, was found to be dose dependent. The repellency (?R) increased with the concentration of essential oil in the formulations, reaching a maximum for the formulation containing 50 mg/ml of oil. A further increase in the oil concentration was found to reduce the ?R. The screening of formulations of the major essential-oil components identified indicated that formulations of furfural, 5-methylfurfural, tetradecanoic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid elicited no response in honeybees. In contrast, the formulations of phenylacetaldehyde were repellent, while those of ethyl cinnamate were attractant. These findings might be an asset for beekeepers to improve the bee management. Attractant formulations are effective to attract bees to the desired areas, thus improving the efficiency of pollination. Repellent formulations are used to repel honeybees, especially when toxic insecticides are sprayed on the fields. © 2010 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG.",NA,NA,,,

2594,2-s2.0-33846012180,2007,Comparing the efficacy of agri-environment schemes to enhance bumble bee abundance and diversity on arable field margins,"1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species assemblage. 2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years using a multisite experiment. 3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate naturally or managed as conservation headlands. 4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees, including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and sexes in their responses to field margin management over time. 5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male bumble bees. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based 'pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed. Establishment of 'floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed landscapes. © 2006 The Authors.",United Kingdom,England,"England, United Kingdom",52.59431,-1.461208
1056,2-s2.0-84894320343,2014,Transcriptional markers of sub-optimal nutrition in developing Apis mellifera nurse workers,"Background: Honey bees (Apis mellifera) contribute substantially to the worldwide economy and ecosystem health as pollinators. Pollen is essential to the bee's diet, providing protein, lipids, and micronutrients. The dramatic shifts in physiology, anatomy, and behavior that accompany normal worker development are highly plastic and recent work demonstrates that development, particularly the transition from nurse to foraging roles, is greatly impacted by diet. However, the role that diet plays in the developmental transition of newly eclosed bees to nurse workers is poorly understood. To further understand honey bee nutrition and the role of diet in nurse development, we used a high-throughput screen of the transcriptome of 3 day and 8 day old worker bees fed either honey and stored pollen (rich diet) or honey alone (poor diet) within the hive. We employed a three factor (age, diet, age x diet) analysis of the transcriptome to determine whether diet affected nurse worker physiology and whether poor diet altered the developmental processes normally associated with aging.Results: Substantial changes in gene expression occurred due to starvation. Diet-induced changes in gene transcription occurring in younger bees were largely a subset of those occurring in older bees, but certain signatures of starvation were only evident 8 day old workers. Of the 18,542 annotated transcripts in the A. mellifera genome, 150 transcripts exhibited differential expression due to poor diet at 3d of age compared with 17,226 transcripts that differed due to poor diet at 8d of age, and poor diet caused more frequent down-regulation of gene expression in younger bees compared to older bees. In addition, the age-related physiological changes that accompanied early adult development differed due to the diet these young adult bees were fed. More frequent down-regulation of gene expression was observed in developing bees fed a poor diet compared to those fed an adequate diet. Functional analyses also suggest that the physiological and developmental processes occurring in well-fed bees are vastly different than those occurring in pollen deprived bees. Our data support the hypothesis that poor diet causes normal age-related development to go awry.Conclusion: Poor nutrition has major consequences for the expression of genes underlying the physiology and age-related development of nurse worker bees. More work is certainly needed to fully understand the consequences of starvation and the complex biology of nutrition and development in this system, but the genes identified in the present study provide a starting point for understanding the consequences of poor diet and for mitigating the economic costs of colony starvation. © 2014 Corby-Harris et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,NA,,,

Erwinia amylovora is a plant pathogenic bacterium that causes fire blight, a devastating disease in apple and pear commercial orchards. Studies on fire blight spread by insects have mainly focused on pollinating agents, such as honeybees. However, the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), one of the most damaging fruit pests worldwide, is also common in pome fruit orchards. The main objective of the study was to investigate whether E. amylovora can survive and be transmitted by the medfly. Our experimental results show: i) E. amylovora can survive for at least 8 days inside the digestive tract of the medfly and until 28 days on its external surface, and ii) medflies are able to transmit the bacteria from inoculated apples to both detached shoots and pear plants, being the pathogen recovered from lesions in both cases. This is the first report on E. amylovora internalization and survival in/on C. capitata, as well as the experimental transmission of the fire blight pathogen by this insect. Our results suggest that medfly can act as a potential vector for E. amylovora, and expand our knowledge on the possible role of these and other insects in its life cycle. © 2015 Ordax et al.",NA,NA,,,

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), a leaf-cutter bee that is a valuable pollinator of alfalfa in southern Alberta, indicated that the pillager (depredator) Nemognatha lutea Lec. (Coleoptera: Meloidae) and the parasite Dasymutilla fulvohirta (Cress.) (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) have other hosts besides M. perihirta (Hobbs, 1956). Adults of both species at the nesting habitat of a population of M. perihirta have been too numerous to have come solely from the cells of M. perihirta; also, the wide range in size of the adults of N. lutea indicated that other insects also served as hosts for this species. Mickel (1928, 1928a) found that D. fulvohirta was a pillager of Anthophora occidentalis Cress. In southern Alberts, the wingless females of D. fulvohirta would be within reach of A. occidentalis while parasitizing M. perihirta, as the vertical clay banks that house A. occidentalis are topped by the prairie into which M. perihirta tunnels. As N. lutea lays its eggs in masses on the phyllaries of the buds of wavy-leaved thistle, Cirsium undulatum (Nutt.)

240,2-s2.0-84997637221,2017,High levels of male diploidy but low levels of genetic structure characterize Bombus vosnesenskii populations across the Western US,"Patterns of genetic structure for some bee species suggest that gene flow may be limited across natural and human-created barriers and that local dispersal or natal site fidelity may be common. Interestingly, this past work has primarily focused on female bees, despite the fact that males may differ substantially in their dispersal processes. By examining genetic structure and diploidy in males, it is possible to gain insight into potential barriers to gene flow and drivers of inbreeding. In this study, we examine diploidy as well as regional and local spatial genetic structure using males of Bombus vosnesenskii, a stable bumble bee species found across western North America. Specifically, we investigate patterns of genetic structure in both island and mainland populations, across spatial scales, and over a range of natural and human-altered habitats. We document high levels of male diploidy, with significantly higher levels in mainland populations compared to island populations and increasing diploidy in areas with poor nesting habitat. Interestingly, we also find evidence of significant spatial genetic structure from 0 to 10 km and 0 to 5 km on island and mainland populations, respectively. Finally, we document low but significant genetic differentiation across the region (?ST = 0.049). Overall, this work reveals the unique potential for biogeographic context and local habitat composition to drive male diploidy patterns in bumble bees. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",NA,NA,,,

This nematode parasitizes and reproduces on caprifig (Ficus carica sylvestris) inflorescences and also in the haemocoel of the fig pollinator wasp Blastophaga punes. Staminate and pistillate florets of caprifig infected by S. caprifici exhibited necrosis and cavities in the cortical parenchyma of floret peduncles and stamen filaments. Schistonchus caprifici attacked pistillate florets of commercial fig (F. carica)-, however, S. caprifici population densities were less (P= 0.05) in commercial fig than in caprifig (550 nematodes vs. 12,000 nematodes/g fresh floret tissues, respectively). Schistonchus caprifici was spread from infected to healthy caprifig inflorescences through oviposition behaviour of the wasp, Blastophaga psenes. Wasp development occurred in inflorescences concomitantly infected with nematodes, which colonized and started reproducing in the haemocoel of wasp larvae. Schistonchus caprifici persisted in the pupae and winged females (hat developed in the pistillate florets. Wingless male wasps were not infected by the nematode. Commercial fig inflorescences were not receptive to wasp development, although these inflorescences were visited by ovipositing wasps which vectored nematodes in their florets. Nematode infection may result in premature inflorescence decay. There was no evidence of any adverse effect on B. psenes due to 5. caprifici infection. The association between caprifici and B. psenes on caprifig can be defined as a parasitic relationship because of nematode reproduction in the wasp’s haemocoel. Nematode populations from wasps and caprifig florets did not differ in their morphology. © 1992, Brill. All rights reserved.",Italy,Italy,Italy,44.732552,11.077303
2773,2-s2.0-23244454230,2005,Pseudocopulatory pollination in Lepanthes (Orchidaceae: Pleurothallidinae) by fungus gnats,"• Background and Aims: Lepanthes is one of the largest angiosperm genera (>800 species). Their non-rewarding, tiny and colourful flowers are structurally complex. Their pollination mechanism has hitherto remained unknown, but has been subject of ample speculation; the function of the minuscule labellum appendix is especially puzzling. Here, the pollination of L. glicensteinii by sexually deceived male fungus gnats is described and illustrated. • Methods: Visitors to flowers of L. glicensteinii were photographed and their behaviour documented; some were captured for identification. Occasional visits to flowers of L. helleri, L. stenorhyncha and L. turialvae were also observed. Structural features of flowers and pollinators were studied with SEM. • Key Results: Sexually aroused males of the fungus gnat Bradysia floribunda (Diptera: Sciaridae) were the only visitors and pollinators of L. glicensteinii. The initial long-distance attractant seems to be olfactory. Upon finding a flower, the fly curls his abdomen under the labellum and grabs the appendix with his genitalic claspers, then dismounts the flower and turns around to face away from it. The pollinarium attaches to his abdomen during this pivoting manoeuvre. Pollinia are deposited on the stigma during a subsequent flower visit. The flies appear to ejaculate during pseudocopulation. The visitors of L. helleri, L. stenorhyncha and L. turialvae are different species of fungus gnats that display a similar behaviour. • Conclusions: Lepanthes glicensteinii has genitalic pseudocopulatory pollination, the first case reported outside of the Australian orchid genus Cryptostylis. Since most species of Lepanthes have the same unusual flower structure, it is predicted that pollination by sexual deception is prevalent in the genus. Several morphological and phenological traits in Lepanthes seem well suited for exploiting male fungus gnats as pollinators. Correspondingly, some demographic trends common in Lepanthes are consistent with patterns of male sciarid behaviour. © The Author 2005.

Here we exposed honey bee colonies during three brood generations to sub-lethal doses of a widely used pesticide, imidacloprid, and then subsequently challenged newly emerged bees with the gut parasite, Nosema spp. The pesticide dosages used were below levels demonstrated to cause effects on longevity or foraging in adult honey bees. Nosema infections increased significantly in the bees from pesticide-treated hives when compared to bees from control hives demonstrating an indirect effect of pesticides on pathogen growth in honey bees. We clearly demonstrate an increase in pathogen growth within individual bees reared in colonies exposed to one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide, imidacloprid, at below levels considered harmful to bees. The finding that individual bees with undetectable levels of the target pesticide, after being reared in a sub-lethal pesticide environment within the colony, had higher Nosema is significant. Interactions between pesticides and pathogens could be a major contributor to increased mortality of honey bee colonies, including colony collapse disorder, and other pollinator declines worldwide. © 2012 The Author(s).",NA,NA,,,
1388,2-s2.0-84880837395,2013,Pollination Services Provided by Bees in Pumpkin Fields Supplemented with Either Apis mellifera or Bombus impatiens or Not Supplemented,"Pollinators provide an important service in many crops. Managed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are used to supplement pollination services provided by wild bees with the assumption that they will enhance pollination, fruit set and crop yield beyond the levels provided by the wild bees. Recent declines in managed honey bee populations have stimulated interest in finding alternative managed pollinators to service crops. In the eastern U.S., managed hives of the native common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) may be an excellent choice. To examine this issue, a comprehensive 2-yr study was conducted to compare fruit yield and bee visits to flowers in pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) fields that were either supplemented with A. mellifera hives, B. impatiens hives or were not supplemented. We compared pumpkin yield, A. mellifera flower visitation frequency and B. impatiens flower visitation frequency between treatments. Results indicated that supplementing pumpkin fields with either A. mellifera or B. impatiens hives did not increase their visitation to pumpkin flowers or fruit yield compared with those that were not supplemented. Next, the relationship between frequency of pumpkin flower visitation by the most prominent bee species (Peponapis pruinosa (Say), B. impatiens and A. mellifera) and fruit yield was determined across all pumpkin fields sampled. Fruit yield increased as the frequency of flower visits by A. mellifera and B. impatiens increased in 2011 and 2012, respectively. These results suggest that supplementation with managed bees may not improve pumpkin production and that A. mellifera and B. impatiens are important pollinators of pumpkin in our system. © 2013 Petersen et al.",United States,United States,United States,39.715956,-96.999668

However, the question whether it also affects learning and memory remained unanswered. To address this question, we studied the effect of circadian timing on olfactory learning and memory in honey bees Apis mellifera using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. Bees were differentially conditioned to odours and tested for their odour learning at four different ""Zeitgeber"" time points. We show that learning behaviour is influenced by circadian timing. Honey bees perform best in the morning compared to the other times of day. Additionally, we found influences of the light condition bees were trained at on the olfactory learning. This circadian-mediated learning is independent from feeding times bees were entrained to, indicating an inherited and not acquired mechanism. We hypothesise that a co-evolutionary mechanism between the honey bee as a pollinator and plants might be the driving force for the evolution of the time-dependent learning abilities of bees. © 2010 The Author(s).",NA,NA,,,
575,2-s2.0-84978829395,2016,Nutritional complexity and the structure of bee foraging bouts,"How foragers cope with complexity in both needs and resources is a major question in behavioral ecology. When faced with nutritionally diverse resources, or when foraging for offspring with divergent nutritional needs, animals must meet the challenge of how to structure their foraging bouts, including what resources to forage for and in what order (how) to collect them. We investigated how nutritional variation in resources and requirements shapes the structure of bumble bee foraging bouts. Bumble bee workers collect 2 nutritionally distinct resources for consumers with different nutritional needs, floral nectar (largely carbohydrates) for their own needs and that of larvae, and pollen (largely protein) that is used primarily by larvae. We maintained colonies of the Eastern Bumble Bee (Bombus impatiens) in the laboratory on either protein-rich or protein-limited diets and assessed bees' foraging bout structure on artificial flowers that offered low, medium, or high ratios of pollen to nectar. We analyzed bout structure using both traditional floral constancy metrics as well as hierarchical Bayesian analyses. Bees from pollen-satiated colonies responded to variation in floral pollen:nectar ratios, tending to collect pollen consecutively when nectar volumes were high. In contrast, foragers from pollen-limited colonies were relatively insensitive to floral reward ratio, tending to collect pollen in long runs regardless of nectar volume. We discuss the implications of these findings for the pollination services that bees provide plants. © 2015 The Author.",NA,NA,,,
200,2-s2.0-85026312620,2017,A diverse range of novel RNA viruses in geographically distinct honey bee populations,"Understanding the diversity and consequences of viruses present in honey bees is critical for maintaining pollinator health and managing the spread of disease. The viral landscape of honey bees (Apis mellifera) has changed dramatically since the emergence of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor, which increased the spread of virulent variants of viruses such as deformed wing virus. Previous genomic studies have focused on colonies suffering from infections by Varroa and virulent viruses, which could mask other viral species present in honey bees, resulting in a distorted view of viral diversity. To capture the viral diversity within colonies that are exposed to mites but do not suffer the ultimate consequences of the infestation, we examined populations of honey bees that have evolved naturally or have been selected for resistance to Varroa. This analysis revealed seven novel viruses isolated from honey bees sampled globally, including the first identification of negative-sense RNA viruses in honey bees. Notably, two rhabdoviruses were present in three geographically diverse locations and were also present in Varroa mites parasitizing the bees. To characterize the antiviral response, we performed deep sequencing of small RNA populations in honey bees and mites. This provided evidence of a Dicer-mediated immune response in honey bees, while the viral small RNA profile in Varroa mites was novel and distinct from the response observed in bees. Overall, we show that viral diversity in honey bee colonies is greater than previously thought, which encourages additional studies of the bee virome on a global scale and which may ultimately improve disease management. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.",NA,NA,,,

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), is an important pollinator for the commercial production of alfalfa seed. Poor nest establishment is, however, an ongoing problem for bee managers. Megachile rotundata are solitary yet gregarious bees that nest in pre-existing cavities and are attracted to previously used nests. Nest cells contain several components that may serve as cues for nesting females. In the current study, we sought to: 1. determine if there is a preference for cells that previously held male or female conspecific bees; 2. verify attraction to conspecific whole nest cells; and 3. determine which individual nest components of a cell are attractive to nesting females. In a series of cage and open field experiments, M. rotundata females were allowed to initiate nests in blocks containing whole cells or individual cell components from old nests. Statistical analyses of results verified the attraction to conspecific nest cells, with no preference for male or female cells. Females were equally attracted to whole cells from conspecifics and from another megachilid bee, Osmia lignaria. In field cages, females were equally attracted to all cell components, but preferred some cell components over others in open field experiments.

Their emission is presumed to be costly, but this cost has seldom been quantified. Figs of Ficus carica (a dioecious species) release volatile compounds when receptive, thus attracting the agaonid wasp Blastophaga psenes. In dioecious fig species, wasps lay eggs inside male figs and pollinate female ones. For a male tree, we estimated carbon allocation to reproduction using the annual growth module (AGM) as the unit of measurement. Over the growing season, leaf and fig carbon exchange and construction costs were measured, as well as carbon investment in stamens, provisioning pollinators, and biosynthesis and release of volatile compounds. Representativity of the tree studied was evaluated by measuring some of these parameters on seven other male fig trees. The results show that 7.6-16.4% of the carbon assimilated by leaves and figs was invested in reproduction. Of the carbon invested in reproduction, pollinator attraction and feeding represented only 0.08-0.12% and 1.84-2.33%, respectively, while pollinator sheltering (fig construction and respiration) represented 97.6-98.0%.

3386,2-s2.0-0032423239,1998,The effect of petal size manipulation on pollinator/seed-predator mediated female reproductive success of Hibiscus moscheutos,"The effects of petal-size manipulations on the behavior of pollinators and pollen/seed predators, and on pollen removal and deposition, were studied in Hibiscus moscheutos (Malvaceae) populations. The ultimate effects on the female reproductive success of flowers, such as fruit set, seed predation rate, and final seed set were also measured. We applied three levels of petal removal (100%, 50%, and 0% size reduction in radius) to flowers in natural populations. Two pollinators (Bombus pennsylvanicus and Ptilothrix bombiformis) ignored flowers without petals, suggesting that pollinators use petals as a visual cue to locate flowers. Consequently, 100% petal removal reduced female reproductive success considerably, mainly through a higher rate of fruit abortion due to failure of pollen deposition on stigmas. No significant differences between the 50% petal removal treatment and uncut control were detected in any components of female success examined. The results, therefore, suggest that differences in petal size have little influence on female reproductive success of Hibiscus flowers at our study site. Final seed set varied considerably depending on the larval densities of two coleopteran seed predators (Althaeus hibisci and Conotrachelus fissunguis). A. hibisci responded to petal size, and a higher density of adults was found in flowers in which petal size had not been reduced. Because Althaeus feed on pollen as adults and no effect of petal size on seed predation was detected, the preference of Althaeus for larger flowers may represent a foraging strategy for adult beetles and may exert counteracting selection pressure on petal size through male reproductive success of flowers.",NA,NA,,,
3296,2-s2.0-0034372486,2000,Behaviour of individual bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) on blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) flowers: The effects of pollen and nectar deprivation,"The effect of resource deprivation (pollen and nectar) on individual foraging behaviour by bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) from two colonies was examined. For the first colony, the same three workers were observed on blueberry flowers (Vaccinium angustifolium) in the laboratory in three conditions: (1) deprived of nectar; (2) deprived of pollen; (3) deprived of both. We distinguished between flower visits in which vibrating the anthers (buzzing) for pollen either was or was not observed. The proportion of buzzes was greater when the colony was deprived of pollen than when it was deprived of nectar. When deprived of both resources, pollen collection behaviour was yet more frequent, suggesting that pollen can serve, at least in part, as a substitute for nectar. For the second colony, a group of 15 bees was used. Four to eight bees were observed for each of the three conditions. Group proportions of buzzing were significantly higher in the pollen deprivation than in the nectar deprivation condition. This group effect was reflected in individuals observed in both conditions. When the colony was deprived of both resources, however, an intermediate level of buzzing was observed. This study demonstrates not only sensitivity to food reserves, but also adjustment of individual behaviour in response to shortages. © 2000 International Bee Research Association.",NA,NA,,,

Temperature alone contributed significantly to the foraging patterns of both managed honeybees and wild bee species within the acaciacommiphora community. Honeybees, vulnerable to heat stress, foraged earlier in the day than wild bee species. Foraging patterns of the latter ranged from oligolectic to broadly non-specialized. Floral biology and adaptations were also considered in the analysis of divergent foraging trends. Observations suggest that honeybees potentially out-compete highly specialized wild bee species for scarce seasonal floral resources. No evidence was found of direct interaction on abundant seasonal floral resources such as the mass synchronous flowering of Acacia spp. at current managed honeybee densities. Investigation of visitors revealed a high diversity of potential insect pollinators, particularly high in wild bee species (Apoidea) diversity. Suggestions for the improved management of honeybees in arid African environments include shading of hives, providing access to water with protection from predators, and cultivation of indigenous, nectariferous plants close to hive colonies. © ICIPE 2004.",Kenya,Tsavo National Park,"Tsavo East National Park, Kenya",-2.842647,38.814887

135,2-s2.0-85031810764,2017,"Juvenile hormone, but not nutrition or social cues, affects reproductive maturation in solitary alkali bees (Nomia melanderi)","Eusocial insect colonies are defined by extreme variation in reproductive activity among castes, but the ancestral conditions from which this variation arose are unknown. Investigating the factors that contribute to variation in reproductive physiology among solitary insects that are closely related to social species can help to fill this gap. We experimentally tested the role of nutrition, juvenile hormone (JH) and social cues on reproductive maturation in solitary alkali bees (Halictidae: Nomia melanderi). We found that alkali bee females emerge from overwintering with small Dufour’s glands and small ovaries, containing oocytes in the early stages of development. Oocyte maturation occurs rapidly, and is staggered between the two ovaries. Lab-reared females reached reproductive maturity without access to mates or nesting opportunities, and many had resorbed oocytes. Initial activation of these reproductive structures does not depend on pollen consumption, though dietary protein or lipids may be necessary for long-term reproductive activity. JH is likely to be a limiting factor in alkali bee reproductive activation, as females treated with JH were more likely to develop mature oocytes and Dufour’s glands. Unlike for related social bees, the effects of JH were not suppressed by the presence of older, reproductive females. These results provide valuable insight into the factors that influence reproductive activity in an important native pollinator, and those that may have been particularly influential in the evolution of reproductive castes. © 2017, Company of Biologists Ltd.
