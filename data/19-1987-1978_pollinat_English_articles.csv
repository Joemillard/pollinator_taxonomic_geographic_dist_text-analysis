Various experimental projects are suggested to examine the validity of these assumptions in specific cases, thus giving an evolutionary slant to the ecological work. Preliminary guidance is offered on methods, and some results are presented which demonstrate the ability of bumblebees to forage efficiently, and illustrate the application of some of the methods discussed.

Although nectar production is not different in the three floral morphs, differences in the production and size of pollen grains produced by the three anther levels results in the morphs offering variable amounts of resources to pollen-collecting insects. Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and the solitary bee Melissodes apicata used P. cordata primarily as a nectar source and therefore did not seem to exhibit any morph preference. In contrast, honeybees visited flowers mainly for pollen and preferred to forage on long-level anthers of the short-and mid-styled morphs. An analysis of the composition of corbicular pollen loads indicated that, relative to the frequency of production in the population: 1) honeybees collected an excess of pollen from long-level anthers; 2) bumblebees collected the three types of pollen without any apparent preference; and 3) M. apicata preferentially collected pollen from the short-level anthers - presumably because their proboscides are modified by the presence of tiny hairs. The results suggest that P. cordata in Ontario is serviced by a diverse, unspecialized pollinator fauna which is not co-adapted to the tristylous floral polymorphism. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Behavior; Bombus; Pollination; Pontederia cordata; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023527227

(Sterculiaceae) in Costa Rica were examined with GC-MS to determine whether or not major differences existed among these cultivars for volatile constituents comprising 50% or more of the samples. The cultivars selected for floral oil analyses were chosen to represent diverse cultivars having supposedly different genetic backgrounds and histories of artificial selection for agronomic purposes. Cluster analysis revealed two major groupings of cultivars: those with higher molecular weight dominant compounds, and those having lower molecular weight compounds. Additionally, one cultivar, Rim-100, selected from criollo or ancestral-type cacao in Mexico and resembling criollo in the appearance of flowers and fruits, formed an extreme group having the highest molecular weight profile for major volatile compounds. Based upon these analyses, bioassays using McPhail traps were performed in an abandoned cacao plantation in northeastern Costa Rica during rainy and dry seasons to determine the relative attraction of these oils to flying insects. Bioassays revealed that the Rim-100 cultivar attracted by far the greatest numbers of cacao-associated midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae and Cecidomyiidae), as well as stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae), suggesting that a floral fragrance having high-molecular-weight volatiles is more potent as an attractant to flying insects than floral oils having lower-molecular-weight compounds. It is suggested that Rim-100 more closely resembles an ancestral or wild-type cacao than the other cultivars examined, and therefore it is more effective in attracting opportunistic dipteran floral visitors and pollinators than other cultivars in plantation settings. Several of the major volatile compounds found in the floral oils of T. cacao and other species of Theobroma occur in mandibular and other exocrine glands in various bees, including stingless bees and halictids, known visitors of Theobroma flowers. These compounds are particularly present in noncultivated species of Theobroma and have much more noticeable fragrances than the seemingly scentless flowers of cultivated T. cacao selected for agriculture. It is hypothesized that the floral attraction system of ancestral or wild (noncultivated)T. cacao and other species of Theobroma may have evolved to attract certain bees as their principal pollinators in natural habitats in the Neotropics, with a floral reward hypothesized as being sociochemicals needed by bees for mating, foraging, territorial defense, etc. Because of the many generations of extensive selection by cloning for desired cultivars, T. cacao might have lost much of its original floral attraction system for bees, instead being pollinated opportunistically by dipterans in plantation habitats. This may help to explain why natural pollination in cultivated T. cacao is generally very poor relative to observed levels of fruit-set in wild or noncultivated species of Theobroma. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",1-pentadecene; Apidae; attraction; cacao; Cecidomyiidae; Ceratopogonidae; Diptera; Floral oils; Hymenoptera; n-pentadecene; pollination; Sterculiaceae; Theobroma cacao,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028252087

At anthesis, the cells of the obturator are active and rich in starch reserves. Twelve days after anthesis these cells produce a secretion that stains for carbohydrates and for proteins. As the secretion is produced, starch vanishes from these cells and they degenerate and collapse as callose is accumulated. Secretion is independent of pollination as it takes place in a similar fashion both in pollinated and in unpollinated flowers.Pollen tube growth along the obturator surface depends on this secretion for, although pollen tubes reach the base of the style seven days after pollination, they cannot grow on the obturator until five days later, when the secretion is produced. This discontinuous secretion taking place at the obturator may provide a mechanism that controls the entrance of pollen tubes into the ovary in the peach. © 1987 Annals of Botany Company.",Obturator; Peach; Pollen tube; Prunus persica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001212671

The plasmids are composed of DNA, and are consistent in number within a cultivar but vary in number among cultivars. Plasmid patterns and homology suggest that the faster migrating series of plasmids are the supercoiled form of the slower running plasmids. Plasmid 1 was present in all cultivars except New Hampshire Butternut. Plasmid 2 was only observed in the original crookneck cultivar, Canada Crookneck. Plasmids 3 and 4 were present in all accessions tested. The presence of plasmid 1 in a cultivar does not follow a maternal pattern of inheritance; this may be due to the ability of the plasmid to insert into and excise from the main mitochondrial DNA, or the recombination of some of the smaller plasmids to create the larger plasmid 1. There is some homology between plasmid 1 and plasmids 3 and 4, and between plasmid 1 and main band mitochondrial DNA. The equal presence of plasmid 1 in mitochondria of F1 seedlings from the pollination of New Hampshire Butternut by Ponca Butternut to that in F1 seedlings of the reciprocal cross indicates that there is probably a dominant nuclear effect on the ability to produce plasmid 1 either by release from the mitochondrial genome or by recombination of the smaller plasmids. There is no obvious relationship between the presence or number of the mitochondrial plasmids and the butternut fruit shape or stability of the butternut trait of the cultivars. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Cucurbitamoschata; DNA; Fruit shape; Morphogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250107713

Furthermore, the difference in sex ratio between broods with one and broods with two foundresses is greatest in those species of wasp in which broods of both type commonly occur.

A. Rich (Cucurbitaceae) were compared. The female flowers of E. elaterium resemble male flowers visually but are nectarless, and their number is relatively smaller. Apis mellifera was found to discriminate between the two genders and to pay relatively fewer visits to female flowers (mean of 30% relative to male flowers) from the beginning of their activity in the morning. The time spent by honeybees in female flowers is very short compared to that spent in male flowers. It is surmised that the bees remember the differences between the flowers where they foraged on the previous days. In contrast, the two species of solitary bees Lasioglossum politum (Morawitz) (Halictidae) and Ceratina mandibularis Fiese (Anthophoridae) visit the female flowers with nearly equal frequencies at the beginning of each foraging day and stay longer in these flowers. Over the day there is a decline in the relative frequency of visits to female flowers and also in the mean time spent in them. The study shows that bees can collect rewards at high efficiency from the flowers of Ecballium elaterium because of their partial discrimination ability and the scarcity of the mimic flowers. It is suggested that the memory pattern of some solitary bees may be different from that of Apis mellifera. It seems that the limited memory and discrimination ability of bees can lead to a high frequency of visits to the mimic flowers during a long flowering season. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Ecballium elaterium; Foraging behavior; Mimicrysolitary bees; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023527565

In this paper we ask whether two aspects of the pollination effectiveness of bumble bees, visitation rate and pollination efficiency, vary significantly with flower size in sweet-flowered P. viscosum. (i) Bumble bees visited plants with large flowers on 80-90% of encounters, but visited those with smaller flowers on only 49% of encounters. (ii) However, the gain in pollination that large-flowered plants obtained via increased visitation was countered in part because bumble bees deposited fewer outcross pollen grains per visit on stigmas of large flowers than on those of small ones. When both visitation rate and pollination efficiency are taken into account, the predicted value of a single bumble bee encounter declines from 1.06 seeds for flowers larger than 18 mm in diameter to 0.55 seeds for flowers smaller than 12 mm in diameter. Our results suggest that bumble bee pollinators of P. viscosum prefer flower morphologies that are poorly suited for precise pollination. Such behavioral complexities are likely to place constraints on the evolution of ""optimal"" floral design. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Bumble bee; Floral scent; Flower size; Pollination efficiency; Preference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023482644

A comparison was also made of the effects of self- and cross-pollination on fecundily. Defoliation reduced the number of flower buds formed but its greatest effect was to increase the abortion of flower buds. Defoliation also caused earlier abortions which were generally lower on the racemes of the treated than on the control plants. The abortion of flowers and capsules was much less significant. The number of ovules formed per capsule decreased with height on the raceme and the abortion rate of ovules was increased by defoliation. The pattern of ovule abortion within the capsules differed between cross- and self-pollinated plants but the number of seeds ripened was not affected.

The stigma is receptive from the very early stage of development and it also stains positively for esterase activity. The stigma has three distinct zones: an epidermis with papillae; a subepidermal secretory zone; and a parenchymatous ground tissue. The behaviour of the cells of these three zones has been followed from 6 d before anthesis to one day after anthesis and pollination. The cells of the epidermis and the secretory zone stain intensively for lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in the initial stages. The secretory zone develops large intercellular spaces containing heterogenous secretory products which also stain positively for the aforesaid three compounds. At maturity the secretory products are released to the surface through gaps formed in the epidermis by cell separation. The main secretion of the stigma is produced by the cells of the secretory zone. Less secretion is derived from the stigmatic papillae. Some amount of secretion is also released from the stylar transmitting tissue adjoining the stigma. The glandular cells of the stigma contain numerous plastids, mitochondria, ribosomes, ER, cytoplasmic lipid droplets and some dictyosomes. The plastids and the vacuoles in the secretory cells of the stigma have a lot of electron dense (osmiophilic) inclusions respectively in the initial and later stages of development. The former are probably involved in the production of these materials. It is suggested that the proteins are directly secreted by rough ER compartments whereas smooth ER is involved in the synthesis of lipidic materials. The carbohydrate moiety of the exudate is released by the eccrine mode (sugar mono- and dimers) with some addition of polymers by disintegration of the middle lamellae. The means by which the lipidic and osmiophilic material is extruded remains unclear. © 1987 Annals of Botany Company.",Nicotiana sylvestris; Organization; Stigma receptivity; Stigmatic exudate; Stigmatic secretory system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45949118757

We assessed intermorph pollinations by counting pollen tubes in recipients' styles. Without Cephaelis intervening, thrum donors transferred many fewer total grains to pins than did pin donors to thrums. However, thrum grains were dispersed more evenly among recipient pin flowers than were pin grains among thrum recipients. As a result, the potential for paternal reproductive success was at least as great for thrum flowers as for pins.

While pollination and GA3 treatments do not alter embryo sac development, they prolong embryo sac viability. In untreated unpollinated flowers, ovules degenerate between 12 and 21 d after anthesis, while in cross pollinated and GA3 treated flowers this degeneration is postponed by about 10 d. Thus, in a cross pollinated flower this extends the period over which a successful fertilization can take place. This increased period of viability is accompanied by an elongation of the embryo sac itself. Elongation takes place two weeks prior to fertilization in cross pollinated flowers.The extension of life span of embryo sacs following pollination and treatment with gibberellic acid indicates that a stimulus induced by 'pollination' could be mediated by GA3 Whatever its mechanism of operation, the prolongation of embryo sac viability by pollination represents a selective advantage, in that the period at which the ovules are receptive to fertilization must be significantly extended. © 1987 Annals of Botany Company.",Embryo sac; Gibberellic acid; Pear; Pollination; Pyrus communis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249035783

Diploid Solanum tuberosum L. and S. tuberosumx S. phureja Juz et Buk hybrids were used as maternal parents and selected S. phureja clones as prickle pollinators with embryo-spot and nodal band as dominant seed and plant marker. About 2 million seeds were screened for absence of embryo-spot. After raising plants from phenotypically spotless seeds, further screening for absence of nodal bands and for ploidy level was carried out. Finally more than 500 monohaploid plants from three genetically different groups of maternal parents were obtained. Frequency and vigour of the monohaploids were clearly dependent on their maternal genotypes. The data also indicated an effect of the pollinator genotype, the physiological stage of the maternal plant and the environment on monohaploid frequency. On the basis of these results the possibility of breeding for a higher monohaploid production rate and for more stable and vigorous monohaploids is discussed. Furthermore, gynogenesis and androgenesis are compared. It is suggested that both should be used in order to obtain monohaploids from sufficiently various diploid breeding material. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Gynogenesis; Monohaploids; Potato; Prickle pollination; Solanum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006363286

'Ky 17' X N. amplexicaulis, 'Ky 17' X N. benthamiana, and 'Ky 17' X N. repanda). By measuring the pollen tube growth over time, prefertilization barriers were determined to be the cause of the incongruity. Seedling necrosis was a problem in the development of the N. amplexicaulis hybrid and it prevented maturation of the N. repanda hybrid. Callus produced from cotyledons of the N. amplexicaulis hybrid eventually resulted in plants that survived to maturity. This procedure was not successful for the N. repanda materials. The N. amplexicaulis and N. benthamiana hybrids were sterile but following chromosome doubling by midrib culture, male and female fertile plants were produced. Conventional hybridization, fertilized ovule culture, and in vitro pollination were unsuccessful in obtaining hybrids of 'Ky 17' crossed with N. arentsii or N. bonariensis. Apparently, strong postfertilization barriers prevent the production of viable seed of these hybrids. Each of the N. repanda - N. tabacum reciprocal hybrids could not be rescued using callus culture; this adds support to the existence of strong sexual postfertilization barriers. A recent report, however, showed that it was possible to obtain this hybrid using the technique of somatic hybridization. Thus, it appears that it may also be possible to obtain asexual hybrids of N. arentsii and N. bonariensis with N. tabacum. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Ovary culture; Tissue culture; Tobacco; Wide hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000206701

Data on breeding systems suggests that the protoangiosperms may have developed gametophytic self-incompatibility. Protogyny is probably ancestral to protandry and herkogamy. Although the proto-flowers were bisexual wide variation in the number of sexual organs within proto-flowers probably led to labile sexuality and early trends towards dicliny. Beetle-pollination in extant relicts appears too specialized to represent an ancestral condition. Rather, the proto-flowers may have been generalist entomophiles incorporating some beetles, Plecoptera, thrips, micropterigid moths and proto-dipterans into their fluctuating spectra of opportunistic pollinators. Bee-pollination is probably polyphyletic in origin evolving repeatedly from angiosperms showing these generalist syndromes. There is still no correlation between primitive bees (especially Colletidae) and the relictual angiosperms. Pollen that is usually retained within the anthers following dehiscence and the presence of staminal filaments and styles characterizes most of the flowers of those relictual angiosperms pollinated by specialized, modern Apoidea. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperm evolution; Arecales; bees; beetles; Cyclanthales; dichogamy; dicliny; Dilleniaceae; insects; Magnoliidae; protandry; protogyny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000586472

Five categories of phenotypes are recognized based on the number and kinds of floral breeding systems found in a given individual. The frequencies of different categories of phenotypes not only show intra- and interpopulation variation, but also fluctuate from generation to generation suggesting differences in the genetic structure of populations. This polymorphism in the breeding system of a single species is unique and may be adaptive. Obligate subterranean true cleistogamy and amphicarpy appear to be adaptations to jungle fires and soil erosion.-The flowers are of the flag-blossom type and insect visitors act as tripping agents. The tripping mechanism together with the polymorphic floral breeding system result in a balanced mixture of selfing and outcrossing.

The effect that these fluctuations in flower production have on pollen flow was investigated by using fluorescent dye as a pollen analog. Dye applied to open flowers was dispersed over long distances more often during low flower production than during high flower production. Whether enhanced pollen dispersal during flowering lows is of benefit to individual plants is not clear. The proportion of flowers that set fruit is positively correlated with flower abundance, negating the possibility that increased pollen dispersal results in a higher rate of fruit production due to outbreeding effects. It is also difficult to attribute the pattern of fruit production to changes in pollinator visitation rates, which are negatively correlated with flower abundance in the case of hummingbirds and not correlated at all with flower abundance in the case of insects. An opportunistic, large-bodied hummingbird (Colibri coruscans) visits B. resinosa during high flowering and may be a particularly effective pollinator, accounting for some of the increase in the proportion of flowers setting fruit. Rainfall is positively correlated with flower production and may be an important factor in shaping flowering phenology, but it is not significantly correlated with the proportion of flowers setting fruits. The possibility that low-level flowering may counteract inbreeding that results from peak flowering is discussed. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Befaria resinosa; Colombia; Flowering phenology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023477688

Male bees were counted at 3 chemical attractants presented in the same manner each month. Sites were separated by 75 km but included wet Atlantic forest at 500 m elevation, moist forest at 180 m near Barro Colorado Island, and cloud forest at 900 m near the Pacific ocean. 1. From 15 to 30 euglossine species of 4 genera were active in each month and site; monthly species number and general bee abundance were positively correlated. Many species had 3 annual abundance peaks (range 1-4) and were active throughout the year, but peak annual abundances rarely occurred during late wet or early dry seasons. In contrast, Eufriesea generally were present as adults only 1-2 months in a year. 2. Euglossine populations were exceptionally stable. Species at each site were more stable than any known insect population, and stability and abundance were positively associated. However, year-to-year population stability and the degree of seasonality were not correlated. Among the three sites, the more diverse (species rich) bee assemblages displayed lower stability; these were the wetter and upland sites. 3. The most abundant bees visited more orchid species. Eg. and El. each visited and average of 4 orchid species (range 0-13); Ex. and Ef. visited 0-3. Stable populations did not visit more or fewer orchid species than did unstable populations. 4. Less than 68% of species at each site visited orchid flowers; less than a few dozen of the 100-800 bees counted in a day carried orchid pollinaria. Over 20% of the euglossine species never were seen with pollinaria at any site and probably seldom visit orchids in central Panama. 5. Most bee species visited 1 or no fragrance orchids in a given habitat. Orchids tended to utilize common pollinators that seldom included more than 1 species, and they utilized stable or unstable, seasonal or aseasonal bees. However, the most stable and abundant bee, Eg. imperialis, rarely pollinated orchids; fewer than 10 of ca. 20000 bees carried pollinaria. 6. Orchids may interact primarily with discrete seasonal bee population peaks-probably the emerging adults. Although specialized orchid preferences are implicated for species that visit few or no local orchids but pollinate other species and carry pollinaria in other areas, euglossine bees do not need orchids to survive or reproduce. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Bee population dynamics; Orchids; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023501803

The method uses Wright's F-coefficients and introduces a new F-function which describes the genetic similarity as a function of the spatial distance. The method has been elaborated for wind pollinated plant species but can be modified for insect pollination and for animal species. In practice allozymes will provide for the necessary neutral genetic variation. The more loci used and the more intermediate the gene frequencies, the more reliable the results. For the estimation of ?p and t together (when the outcrossing rate is not known) at least two chromosomally unlinked loci are required. The method for estimating ?s depends on whether the plant species is annual or perennial. The mechanism of selfing has been analysed by the explanation of the value of t by three components: population density (d), pollen flow (?p) and relative fertilization potential of own pollen (Z). The concepts of neighbourhood size and isolation by distance, developed by Wright, who used a single gene flow parameter ?, have been extended to the situation which is realistic for seed plants, using all three parameters ?p, ?s and t. When ?p is large with respect to ?s, ?s largely determines the value of the neighbourhood size, whereas ?p is the most dominating factor in isolation by distance. The use of ""local effective population size"" and ""mean gene transport per generation"" instead of ""neighbourhood size"" and ""neighbourhood area"", respectively, is proposed to avoid confusion. Computer simulations have been carried out to check the validity and the reliability of the method. Populations of 200 plants, using two or three loci with intermediate allele frequencies, gave good results in the calculation of ?p with known value of t and of ?s and Ne. With unknown t, especially with lower values of t, larger populations of at least 1,000 plants are necessary to obtain reasonably accurate results for ?p and mean gene transport per generation M. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Computer simulation; Gene flow; Genetic neighbourhood; Mathematical model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342970502

Sexual dimorphism is very common among the various tribes of the chalcidoid families constituting the fig wasps. This is in response to the different types of functions that the female and the male sexes are called upon to perform in their specialized habitat. The unisexual variations commonly met with in the male sex and rarely in the female sex, in the cleptoparasitic tribes belonging to the Torymidae and the Pteromalidae may be attributed to competitive feeding on a limited provision of food-a trophic factor. In the homeomorphic sexes of the subfamily Epichrysomallinae (Pteromalidae) copulation takes place outside on the top of the syconia. The importance of making observations on the biology including mating behaviour of the dimorphic (apterous and alate) males in the subfamily Sycophaginae (Torymidae) for the proper study of the systematics of this group is stressed. The true fig wasps which are the fig pollinators (Agaonidae) are generally highly host specific, i.e. only one species of these pollinators is associated with a given species of Ficus. The Ficus species and its wasp pollinator are in intimate symbiotic relationship. There has been co-evolution of the Ficus species with its specific wasp pollinator. The females of these pollinator wasps often possess pollen storing structures as well as the behavioural attributes for the active collection of pollen from the stamens of the ripe fig and for the active dispersal of pollen on to the stigmas of the ovaries of flowers of tender figs into which these females penetrate for oviposition. The ecological niche of the Ficus syconia is virtually identical to that of many plant galls and as such attract many species of gall-inhabiting Eurytominae (Family Eurytomidae). Such Eurytominae include a variety of genera, with numerous species both of phytophagous and entomophagous habits. The modern systematics of the fig wasps is based on the above aspects of their functional morphology, biology, convergent evolution, sex-limited variations, sex-limited dimorphism, host specificity, behavioural attributes, etc. A conspectus of the modern classification of the fig Chalcidoidea is presented. © 1987 Indian Academy of Sciences.",biosystematics; chalcidoidea; Fig wasps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956558038

Pilosella sect. PilosellinaFries. Four are diploid (2x, 2n = 18), one (H. pilosella L.) is highly variable morphologically and cytologically (from 2x to 10x), in its mode of reproduction (self-incompatibility, agamospermy, amphimixis, apo-amphimixis) and in its hybridization pattern. A part of this huge agamic complex was analysed by comparing sexual 4x and apomictic 5x plants (crossing and germination experiments, measurements of vegetative reproduction by stolons etc.). In the experimental garden apomictic 5x produced more stolons than the sexual 4x plants and the total length of the stolons per rosette was greater. However, in nature, the competitive potential of the sexual plants seems to be higher, presumably as a result of the higher mortality of ramets in 5x. Sexual 4x plants often grow in dense and grazed grass vegetation, whereas 5x apomicts often occur in dunes with patchy vegetation. Apomicts produce more capitula per rosette, and sexual rosettes form only about 60% of the number of viable achenes as compared to apomictic ones. Therefore, apomicts appear to be characterized by a greater colonizing ability than sexual plants. Apomictic plants produce equal numbers of viable achenes under conditions of both open pollination and isolation. Sexual plants do not form any viable achenes after isolation and produce a somewhat lower percentage of achenes after open pollination than do apomictics. 5xreproduce exclusively apomictically. Apo-amphimixis was never observed in pentaploids and only very rarely in tetraploids. Addition hybrids are very rare. The cross sexual 4x × apomictic 5x failed in 70% of the attempts, but the recombination of genomes carrying genes for apomixis is possible and results in apomictic 4x and sexual 5x, both with a reduced number of viable achenes. In nature sexual and apomictic plants may occur in close proximity. In such cases the germination rate of the achenes of 4x and 5x is lower; this may indicate that apomictic plants fertilize sexual plants in nature (unidirectional gene-flow). 5x plants form euploid gametes carrying two or three genomes. The results of the crossing experiments can be explained in terms of Nogler's theory of monogenic inheritance of apospory. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Compositae; crossing and germination experiments; cytology; Hieracium sect; Mode of reproduction; Pilosellina,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001109929

It was composed of 62% female, 30% hermaphrodite and 8% intermediate plants. The analysis of half-sib progeny (F1 generation) obtained from in situ open pollination demonstrates the cytoplasmic determination of male sterility in Beta maritima and the restoration of fertility by nuclear genes. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the chloroplast DNA (ctDNA) of sixteen F1 plants, extracted from offspring of the three sexual phenotypes, were analysed using the restriction enzymes Sal I and Bam HI, respectively. Two cytoplasmic lines with their own peculiar genetic characteristics were distinguished using the restriction enzyme patterns of mtDNA: (i) the S cytoplasmic line was found in segregating progeny of two F0 plants; all three phenotypes were produced (that is, progeny including hermaphrodite, female and intermediate plants); (ii) the N cytoplasmic line was found in the progeny of one F0 hermaphrodite plant; this produced only hermaphrodites. Thus, segregating and non-segregating hermaphrodite F0 plants can be distinguished. The nuclear genes maintaining sterility or restoring fertility are expressed in line S. At the same time the analysis of Beta vulgaris material has been carried out at the molecular level: N cytoplasmic lines of B. vulgaris and B. maritima differed only by 3 fragments of mtDNA; but the S cytoplasmic line of B. maritima was very different from Owen's cytoplasmic male sterile line of B. vulgaris. No variation in the ctDNA pattern was detected within and between the two taxa. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Cytoplasmic male sterility, nuclear restorer genes; Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNAs; Restriction endonuclease fragment analysis; Wild and cultivated sugar beet (Beta maritima, Beta vulgaris)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000529898

A total of seven alkaline phosphatase isozymes were observed occurring at variable frequencies in the different cultivars analyzed. We propose that at least five loci control the alkaline phosphatases of rye endosperm - Alph-1, Alph-2, Alph-3, Alph-4 and Alph-5 - all of which have monomeric behaviour. The leaf acid phosphatases are controlled by one locus and have a dimeric quaternary structure. All loci coding for alkaline phosphatase isozymes showed one active, dominant allele and one null, recessive allele, except for the locus Alph-3 which showed two active, dominant alleles and one null, recessive one. The linkage analyses suggest the existence of two linkage groups for alkaline phosphatases: one of them would contain Alph-2, Alph-4, Alph-5 and the locus/loci coding isozymes 6 and 7. This linkage group is located in the 7RS chromosome arm. The other group would include Alph-1 and Alph-3 loci, being located in the 1RL chromosome arm.

Pollen was harvested from an F1 interspecific hybrid between a high altitude Lycopersicon hirsutum accession and the cultivated tomato L. esculentum. The pollen was applied to stigmas of malesterile L. esculentum plants maintained in growth chambers set at either 12°C/7°C or 24°C/18°C. BC1 seeds from the low and normal temperature crosses were germinated and root elongation rate was measured at either 9°C or 24°C. At 9°C, the rate of root elongation for progeny of the low temperature crosses was higher than for progeny of crosses at normal temperatures; at 24°C the rate of root elongation was similar for the two crossing treatments. To compare the temperature responses of the two backcross populations we also calculated the relative inhibitory effect of low temperature on the rate of root elongation: the ratio between the rate of root elongation at 9°C to that at 24°C. Root elongation of seedlings from the low temperature crosses was less inhibited by the cold than root elongation for progeny of the normal temperature crosses.

The canopy-flowering tree species had shallow, dish-shaped flowers and utilized various types of opportunistic pollinators. Most of the climber and epiphyte species had deep, tube-shaped flowers and specialized pollinators, although some climber species which bloomed in the canopy especially in winter, had opportunistic pollinators. The understory-flowering tree species had large dish- or funnel-shaped flowers and endothermic pollinators able to tolerate the dark and cold conditions under the canopy.

The onset of wilting is brought forward substantially by the application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) either to the vial solution or to the stigmatic surface. Both pollination and stigma removal also shorten the time to the onset of wilting, colour change and to abscission. In the case of stigma removal, the life span of the corolla is shortest when the treatment is made at the time of flower detachment (day 0), whereas pollination has the greatest effect if it occurs on day 1. Stigma damage still has an effect on corolla senescence even when stigma and style are removed, as long as they have been left in place for a few hours after treatment. Evidence from several experiments shows that a 17 h period is sufficient for the full effect to be shown, and that probably there are some effects on the corolla even if the damaged stigma is only left in position for 3-6 h. Treatments which advance corolla death (to day 3) also advance the peak of ethylene production by the pistil (to day 1) and the corolla (to day 2). The use of silver thiosulphate (STS) overcomes all manipulative and chemical treatments used, and greatly extends vase life. The extension occurs even when STS application is delayed for 24 h, i.e. after the peak of ethylene production by the pistil and after any senescence signal has arrived at the corolla. In this case, however, the time to first morphological change is largely unaffected, but the STS greatly extends the time period between first morphological change and corolla death. The evidence suggests that early symptoms of senescence e.g. colour change and slight loss of turgor, do not automatically lead to corolla abscission. © 1987 Annals of Botany Company.",Abscission; ACC; Ethylene; Flower senescence; Petunia hybrida; Pollination; STS,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343328790

Results were consistent between years. Individual plants did not function differentially with respect to female (i.e., pollen receipt) and male (i.e., pollen donation) function. Both female and male components of outbreeding, as estimated by all three measures, were positively correlated with the number of flowers per plant. Significantly more outbreeding could occur during the final phase of flowering when most individuals had relatively few blossoms. Although the potential for outbreeding was the same at any time through an individual's blooming regime, individuals for which the peak of blooming occurred after the peak for the population as a whole have significantly more outbreeding potential via both female and male function. These factors may combine such that any pressure to increase outbreeding in this self-incompatible species manifests itself in directional selection for delayed flowering time. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Bumblebee; Outbreeding; Polemonium foliosissimum; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023497221

Embryos and endosperm of wild-type kernels began to dehydrate at approx. 35 d after pollination (DAP); viviparous embryos did not desiccate but accumulated fresh weight via coleoptile growth in the caryopses. Concentrations of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) in the embryo were relatively high early in development, being approx. 150 ng·g-1 fresh weight at 20 DAP. The ABA content declined thereafter, falling to approx. 50 ng·g-1 at 30 DAP. Endosperm ABA content was always low, being less than 20 ng·g-1. There were no differences between wild-type and vp-1 tissues. Immature kernels did not germinate when removed from the ear until late in development. The ability to germinate was correlated with decreasing moisture content in the endosperm at the time of removal; premature drying of immature kernels resulted in greatly increased germination following imbibition. Excised embryos germinated precociously when removed from the endosperm as early as 25 DAP. Such germination could be prevented by treatment with 10-5 M ABA or by lowering the solute potential (?s) of the medium with 0.3 M mannitol. Treatment of excised embryos with ABA led to internal ABA concentrations comparable to those in embryos in which germination was inhibited in situ. Mannitol treatment did not have this effect, although water-deficit stress of excised embryos resulted in substantial ABA production. Germinated vp-1 embryos were less sensitive to growth inhibition by ABA or mannitol than germinating wild-type embryos. The vp-1 seedlings were not wilty and their transpiration rates were reduced in response to ABA or water shortage. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Abscisic acid; Development; Seeds; Vivipary; Zea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000027139

Since a considerable number of crop plants can be regenerated only from root culture, the introduction of foreign genes into Agrobacterium rhizogenes-induced hairy roots may expand the list of crop plants that could be genetically engineered. Here we report genetic transformation of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a valuable forage legume, using a virulent strain of Agrobacterium rhizogenes containing, in addition to its Ri-plasmid, a binary vector containing a nopaline synthase gene. Plant cells transformed by this vector can be easily identified by their ability to produce nopaline. Transformed alfalfa plants were recovered from A. rhizogenes-induced hairy roots. These transgenic plants were characterized by normal leaf morphology and stem growth but a root system that was shallow and more extensive than normal. These plants were also fertile, set seeds upon self-pollination and outcrossing. Nopaline was detected in R1 progeny.

Both the species were found to have a proboscis longer than 24 mm corresponding to the length of the corolla tube of C. trichotomum. Visits to the flowers by these butterflies were observed more frequently than visits by sphingid moths which had previously been believed to be the major pollinators of C. trichotomum. The male butterflies visited trees of C. trichotomum frequently, while visits by the females were less frequent. However, once females had visited the tree of C. trichotomum, they remained there longer than the males. Since the flower of C. trichotomum has long protruding sexual organs, its pollen grains were found to adhere efficiently to the bodies of butterflies, mainly the thorax, during nectar feeding. Most of the butterflies became loaded with C. trichotomum pollen, and the mean number of pollen grains per butterfly was 1,776 for P. helenus and 2,817 for P. protenor. The flowers opened at any time of day but more frequently in the morning. The nectar was secreted throughout the day. In the maturation of the protandrous flower of C. trichotomum, the duration of the pistillate phase was about twice as long as the staminate phase. The long flowering period and the short duration of the staminate phase resulted in asynchrony of the flowering stages even within a single cyme on a tree. Such asynchrony and the abundance of attractive flowers on a tree facilitates efficient pollination by the butterflies. © 1987 Ecological Society of Japan.",Glory bower; Nectar feeding; Papilionid butterfly; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023501532

They collect considerable amounts of pollen, mostly on their throats, from species such as Metrosideros excelsa and Phormium tenax. This pollen can be carried for many metres and for up to at least 12 hours, and there is thus the opportunity for lizards to transfer it to a conspecific plant to effect cross-pollination. Geckos in the genus Hoplodactylus and skinks in the genera Leiolopisma and Cyclodina all include considerable quantities of fleshy fruit in their diet during summer. Fruits most commonly consumed are in the genera Coprosma, Gaultheria, Hymenanthera, Macropiper, and Muehlenbeckia. Seeds pass through the gut undamaged and germination trials showed that at least some are viable. Because of the size, colour, and positioning of the fruit it appears that some divaricating shrubs (e.g., Coprosma, Hymenanthera) or vines (e.g., Muehlenbeckia) may be specifically adapted to seed dispersal by lizards. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Frugivory; Gecko; Lizard; Nectarivory; Pollination; Seed dispersal; Skink,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023528716

No reduction in viability of washed pollen was observed in situ, although loss of viability occurred in vitro. Physical wounding of the stylar tissue induced a relatively small increase in ethylene production when compared to that induced by pollination.

(1985) hypothesized that the plastome mutator (pm) system in Oenothera originated through contaiminating cross-pollination and that the variegation was an example of hybrid plastome-genome incompatibility. Their evidence was based on restriction pattern analyses of white sectors which showed wild-type plastome III patterns rather than the wild-type plastome I patterns of the green portions of their plants. Their hypothesis does not adequately account for the results which our laboratories have obtained independently; the pm-system of Oenothera continues to generate many new and different plastome mutations following the genetic parameters as published originally (Epp 1973). Our studies support mutator gene function. The restriction pattern of the chloroplast DNA of five newly isolated pm-induced variegation sectors are reported here to show a restriction pattern identical to the green wild-type plastids. The restriction pattern reported by Lindenhahn et al. (1985) for their white sector plastids is different than we would expect from a pm-induced plastome mutation. Their overall analysis did not utilize many of the salient features of the genetics of Oenothera and of the pm-system. The white sectors they observed are probably due to an accidental contamination by plastome III plastids. Suggestions are made for delineating experimentally plastome mutations and hybrid incompatibility. For future analyses, a comparative study of numerous pm-induced sectors is recommended, since the pm-system readily generates many different plastome mutations with independent origins. This comparison would greatly assist in the interpretation of restriction patterns. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Hybrid variegation; Oenothera; Plastome mutations; Plastome mutator; Restriction patterns,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-12644317869

A correlation was shown between flowering time and latitude. All species are self-compatible but the N. American member of the genus (D. californicum) is strongly protandrous and probably experiences high levels of outcrossing in nature. In the European taxa the stamens and the stigmas mature simultaneously but the levels of inbreeding appear to be greater in the southern species (D. bourgeai, D. polyspermum) than in the northern (tetraploid) species D. alisma. The Australian member D. minus resembles the southern European species in being strongly autogamous and bud-pollination was shown to occur. Floral morphology, stigma exertion, pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio and seed weight each show a strong correlation with the degree of autogamy. Vegetative reproduction occurs only in D. californicum and D. alisma through the production of corm-buds. This study suggests that autogamy in Damasonium is accompanied by a shift in resource allocation from male (pollen) toward female (seed) function. However, further studies are required to assess the quality of seeds and their survivorship in nature. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Alismataceae; Angiosperms; autogamy; Breeding system; Damasonium; pollen; protandry; seeds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004657268

We studied preemergent reproductive success (PERS) in flowering plants by measuring the fruit/flower (Fr/Fl) ratio and the seed/ovule (S/O) ratio in a number of species of outcrossing and inbreeding plants, where PERS=the product of (Fr/Fl) and (S/O). In order to determine the influence of the ambient environment (including resource availability) we studied pairs of outcrossing and inbreeding species occurring in the same habitat. Among outcrossing species PERS averaged about 22%, whereas in inbreeding species the average was approximately 90%. The progeny/zygote (P/Z) ratio was studied in hand-pollinated populations in Epilobium angustifolium (a strongly outcrossing species) from populations in Oregon and Utah, by direct observation of embryogenesis at twoday intervals throughout the course of seed development. The P/Z ratio in both populations averaged near 30%, and the developing embryos showed a surprising array of abnormalities that resulted in embryo death. During early development >95% of the ovules had normally developing globular embryos, but beginning with differentiation (cotyledon formation) about 70% of the original globular embryos aborted during the course of embryogenesis and seed development. The clustering of developmental lethals during peroids of major differentiation events parallels the animal model of development. We found little evidence that PERS was limited by the ambient environment (including resource availability), pollination, or factors associated with the inbreeding habit. Instead, PERS was found to be inextricably linked to outcrossing plants, whose breeding systems promote genetic variability. The high incidence of developmental lethals in E. angustifolium and the resulting low P/Z ratio (ca. 30%) is attributed to genetic load (any lethal mutation or allelic combination) possibly working in combination with developmental selection (interovarian competition among genetically diverse embryos). Examples of maternally controlled, fixed patterns of ovule abortion with respect to position or number are discussed. However, we found no need to employ ""female choice"" as a hypothesis to explain our results for the extensive, seemingly random patterns of embryo abortion in E. angustifolium and other outcrossing species. A more parsimonious, mechanistic explanation based on genetic load-developmental selection is sufficient to account for the differential survivorship of embryos. Likewise, the traditional concept of a positive growth regulator feedback system based on the number of surviving ovules in an ovary can account for subsequent fruit survivorship. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Epilobium; Fruit/flower ratio; Progeny/Zygote ratio; Seed/ovule ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023470939

When these measures based on progeny means are expressed as deviations from a defined greater population of crosses, they are often termed the general combining ability (GCA). In this study the GCA estimates or a facsimile were theoretically investigated for the one locus, digene, autotetraploid model to verify the genetic basis and its value for selection and prediction in the presence of a naturally occurring phenomena of autopolyploids called gametic disequilibrium with three types of non-additive inheritance. Two breeding objectives were envisioned, the selection of best parents with recurrent selection based on GCA in the continued development of elite populations and the prediction of advanced generation synthetic variety performance. The first generation means of progenies with a potential bias due to gametic disequilibrium were compared to GCA estimation of same progenies in the absence of gametic disequilibrium. The results indicated that testcrossing plants to a population without gametic disequilibrium could be used for selection of best parents. The gametic disequilibrium in the cross may increase or depress selection response dependent on the array of genotypes which happen to be evaluated, on the type of genic action at the locus, and on the frequency of the desirable allele in the testor population. The GCA estimates for prediction of synthetic performance were potentially biased by gametic disequilibrium. An assumption of pollination by the same array of gametes was made for all plants, but obviously was unrealistic for GCA estimation with partial diallels, or with no selfing, and in other situations. The GCA estimate was shown to be an unreliable predictor of synthetic variety performance. When it was assumed that different plants were pollinated by different arrays of gametes, a more realistic situation, no genetic interpretation of GCA values was possible even with purely additive gene action at the locus. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",Alfalfa; Half-sib progeny; Medicago sativa L.; Progeny test; Selection; Synthetic Variety,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250106817

In both floral morphs a proteinaceous-lipoidal coating is present on the papilla surface. In thrum stigmas the cuticle is highly irregular and pitted at the papilla tip. The cuticle is dislodged and torn at anthesis and an osmiophilic secretion product is released within a pectinaceous matrix. The secretion product stains for proteins and lipids and contributes to adhesion of pollen. In the larger pin papillae the cuticle is wavy, continuous, thicker than in thrum papillae and adjoins the cell wall. In both species the surface of the two types of pollen grains is coated with lipids and protein.A similar behaviour of the male gametophyte is observed in incompatible pollinations of L. pubescens, L. mucronatum and L. grandiflorum. In intramorph thrum pollinations pollen tubes are arrested within the stigma. In intramorph pin pollinations the majority of pollen grains fail to adhere to the stigma. Low permeability to water in pin papillae, as determined by the neutral red test, may be a factor preventing imbibition of the few adhering grains. Tubes of the few germinated grains are inhibited inside the stigma.On the part of the stigma, the difference in the major site of inhibition in the two intramorph incompatible combinations may be accounted for by the dissimilar properties of the papillae, i.e. the occurrence of wet thrum stigmas and dry pin stigmas. Functionally, the unusual association of sporophytic incompatibility with wet thrum stigmas is attributed to retention of the secretory material on individual papillae. © 1987 Annals of Botany Company.",Cuticle; Distyly; Incompatibility; L. mucronatum; L. pubescens; Linum grandiflorum; Pollen coat; Stigmatic papillae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000143930

Most genera have some species in flower at all times of the year, although generally there is a preponderance of species that flower between late winter and early summer. The one genus that is an exception to this generalization is Banksia, which either has approximately the same percentage of species in flower at various times of the year (southwestern Australia) or peaks in autumn (southeastern Australia). Within particular communities, opportunities for hybridization among congeneric species are minimized by staggered flowering times, different pollen vectors and/or various incompatibility mechanisms. Birds, mammals and arthropods have been identified as visitors to the inflorescences of many Proteaceae. The most common avian visitors to the majority of genera in Australia are honeyeaters, although lorikeets, silvereyes and approximately 40 other species sometimes may be important. Sugarbirds and sunbirds are seen most frequently at inflorescences of Protea, Leucospermum and Mimetes in southern Africa, although they rarely visit other genera. In most cases, avian visitors forage in a manner that permits the acquisition and transfer of pollen. Limited evidence supports the hypothesis that birds are selective in their choice of inflorescences, responding to morphological and/or colour changes and usually visiting those inflorescences that offer the greatest nectar rewards. Arthropods may be equally selective, although it is possible that only the larger moths, bees and beetles are important pollinators, even for those plant species that rely entirely on arthropods for pollen transfer. Mammals are pollen vectors for some Proteaceae, especially those that have geoflorous and/or cryptic inflorescences. In Australia, small marsupials may be the most important mammalian pollinators, although rodents fill this niche in at least some southern African habitats. All but two genera of Proteaceae are hermaphroditic and protandrous, the exceptions being the dioecious southern African genera Aulax and Leucadendron. For hermaphroditic species, the timing of visits by animals to inflorescences is such that they not only acquire pollen from freshly opened flowers but also brush against pollen presenters and stigmas of others that have lost self?pollen and become receptive. Birds and insects (and probably mammals) generally forage in such a way as to facilitate both outcrossing and selfing. Some species are self?compatible, although many require outcrossing if viable seed is to be formed. Regardless of which animals are the major pollen vectors, fruit set is low relative to the number of flowers available, especially in Australian habitats. Functional andromonoecy of the majority of flowers is advanced as the major cause of poor fruit set. The pollination biology and breeding systems of Australian and southern African Proteaceae resemble one another in many ways, partly because of their common ancestry, but also due to convergence. Divergence is less obvious, apart from the dichotomy between dioecious and hermaphroditic genera, and differences in the levels of seed set for Australian and African species. Future studies should concentrate on identifying the most important pollinators for various Proteaceae, the manner in which their visits are integrated with floral development and factors responsible for limiting fruit set.

In Helianthus, bimodal pollen presentation, but near constant nectar production, results in different activity patterns of the specialist and generalist bees visiting the flowers.

Only bumblebees having a long proboscis are able to extract nectar, and the range (proboscis length) of male Bombus hortorum, which were frequent visitors, correspond to the amount of nectar left in unbagged flowers. The visits of male bumblebees may be an exploitation of available nectar resources in honeysuckle flowers in marginal habitats, where adapted pollinators are scarce. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023582332

A given increase in diversity adds twice the number of interactions to dispersal systems as to pollination systems, suggesting a higher global specificity of the latter. For seed-dispersal systems involving frugivorous birds, mutual dependence values are strongly skewed toward the low end and illustrate generally strong asymmetries in mutualistic interactions. Coadaptation may originate from a process of species sorting without the necessity of genetic (coevolved) changes. Asymmetrical interactions and the prevalence of weak relations can provide pathways for rare species to persist and alternative routes for system responses to perturbations. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023467129

Accessions of P. intermediumMunro. ex Morong, P. jurgensiiHackel and P. dilatatumPoir were self-pollinated and crossed with one anther. Paspalum intermedium is essentially self-sterile but P. jurgensii and P. dilatatum are highly self-fertile. Following pollination, pollen germination and tube growth were studied by observing the pollinated pistils with fluorescent microscopy. Examination of self-pollinated pistils revealed that the pollen germinated shortly after contacting the stigmas. Germination was over 80% for the P. intermedium and P. dilatatum accessions but only 57% for P. jurgensii. Pollen tubes grew to the micropyle within 45 minutes after pollination in P. dilatatum and 1 hour and 15 minutes in P. jurgensii. However, in the P. intermedium accessions most tubes did not grow beyond the stigma and very few penetrated the style and ovary. Apparently stylar-incompatibility is the reason for the low selfed seed set. In the cross-pollinations, pollen germinated shortly after pollination and germination ranged from 57 to 88% for the different crosses. In all crosses the pollen tubes grew to the micropyle within 30 minutes to 2 hours after pollination indicating that a cross-incompatibility system is not the cause for low crossability among these species. By examining embryo sacs from P. intermedium × P. dilatatum, its reciprocal and P. intermedium × P. urvillei crosses, it was determined that gametes failed to unite in some crosses and this is a major reason for low crossability. © 1987 Veenman B.V.",dallisgrass; fluorescence; gametes; hybridization; Paspalum sp.; pistil; self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001081970

Wind-pollinated flowers show reduced petals, are usually small and inconspicuous, and produce neither nectar nor scent. Both anthers and stigmas are freely exposed to air currents. In the wind-pollinated trees the male flowers are much more numerous than the solitary female flowers, and tend to be borne in pendulous racemes. Female flowers are usually well protected by bracts or cone/strobilus scales, but the stigma(s) protrude from the protective parts when the stigmatic surfaces are ready to accept pollen. Wind-pollinated trees such as Corylus, Alnus, Betulu, Ulmus, Fraxinus, Platanus, and Fagus all flower before leaves are produced on the same individual. There is a more-or-less consistent order of flowering between the species in each area, but the dates on which individuals of each species flower are not identical from year to year. The recognizable pollen grains of many species are found at great distances from the nearest possible source. The fertilization potential falls off much more rapidly than either deposition or concentration in the air. This could be due to rapid loss of viability or to loss in competitive ability at the stigma. The loss in competitive ability is in part a function of relative numbers and in part a function of the aging of the pollen grain by time and by exposure to UV light and to leaching during wetting. © 1987, Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946466383

Syrphid flies, bee flies and halictid and andrenid bees were also commonly observed. Six species are completely dependent on insects for pollination, 4 species are weakly autogamous, one is strongly autogamous, and one appears to be apomictic. Four species are strongly self-compatible, one is dioecious, and the remainder display varying degrees of self-incompatibility.

Individuals of all species carried pollen on their fur. Pollen loads were greater on mammals which had been in traps for short periods, which suggests that mammals will groom pollen from their fur if left longer in traps. Therefore, pollen loads on foraging mammals have probably been dramatically underestimated by previous authors, and their potential to effect pollination may have been greatly underestimated.

Most wasps are forced to emerge from the syconia of 'male' trees at a time when they will not be able to reproduce, whether they avoid female trees or not.

Second pollinations were substantially less effective than first pollinations, even when applied immediately afterwards. When delayed 30 and 60 minutes, effectiveness was reduced further to about 14 and 7 per cent of fertilisations, respectively. After 120 minutes, effectiveness decreased to less than 2 per cent. Among a set of mixed pollinations, pollen from some individuals suffered a strong disadvantage in competitive ability. This disadvantage is partially genetic. The primacy of first pollinations, and the presence of strong pollen competition, have implications for studies of pollination biology and genetic transmission in natural populations of Ipomoea purpurea and other plant species. Specifically, sequential pollination ineffectiveness, and strong competition within pollen loads, should reduce the numbers of paternal parents and thus increase the numbers of full sibs among outcross seed within capsules. This represents a substantial violation of one of the critical assumptions in the mixed mating model and could influence the genetic structure of Ipomoea populations. In addition, these data indicate that gametophytic selection may be an important component of natural selection in Ipomoea. The mechanisms underlying the sequential and competitive effects probably include pollen-stigma interactions, differential pollen production, viability differences, or pollen tube growth rate differences, and possibly embryo abortion. These experiments also establish that outcrossing rates vary among individuals in natural populations, due to genetic variation in the distance between anthers and the stigmatic surface. © 1987 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966162032

Large, identifiable liposomes could be found at a low frequency in living, germinated pollen grains and pollen tubes. Protoplasmic streaming inside the germinated pollen apparatus, where it appears as moving strands, exerts violent, formative effects on the liposomes. Uptake of cytoplasmic bodies by liposomes may be a sign of internalization. Pea pollen tube studied by autoradiography took up radioactivity from liposomes with labelled DNA and transferred radioactivity into the pollinated style of pistil. Application of DNA associated liposomes at the pollination of pea (Pisum sativum) induced putative transfec?tants in addition to immediate disturbances like sterility and parthenocarpy. The putative transfectant, 361A. behaves as a stable Mendelian recessive.

These insects require explicit conservation attention. They are more than just decorations on the plants; rather, they are the building blocks and glue for much of the habitat. They are the food for much of the carnivore community, and the insect species are not merely interchangeable bits of nutrients. They are major killers of seeds, and thereby influence both the plant species composition of a habitat and prevent the better competitors from taking it over. They are the primary pollinators and are specific enough to be neither interchangeable nor replaceable with other animals; the seeds resulting from their pollination activities are major animal foods in the habitat. They are a diverse, puzzling, complex, intrinsically attractive, and major part of the intellectual display offered by tropical wildlands, the display that will be the eventual foundation for most of the reason why tropical wildlands will be retained as such in the future. The retention and maintenance of insect species richness in a tropical wildland is strongly rooted in the preservation of plant species richness, in maintaining habitat mosaics (different members of which are used by a given insect in different seasons), in preserving a large diversity of habitats, and in recognizing the threat posed by insect crop associates in nearby agricultural lands.

Inflorescences open early in the morning (05.00 hours). Stigmas remain receptive for 15 h, while anther dehiscence occurs 20 h after inflorescence opening. Maximum pollen viability occurs the next day at 05.00 hours. This combination of features largely precludes self?pollination. Controlled pollinations show that apomixis and auto?pollination are absent, and indicate strong incompatibility. In contrast, cross?pollinations do not differ in fruit set from open?pollinated controls. The fruit set in inflorescences exposed to pollinators for different periods after opening (and later stopping pollinator activity by fumigation), indicates that pollination occurs soon after inflorescence opening. The visitors comprise a numerous and diverse fauna (15 families; 34 species). Features such as pollen loads, abundance, behaviour, and diet patterns, segregate them into: herbivores and predators (Aves, Orthoplera), pollen thieves (Apidae), and true pollinators (most Coleoptera and Diptera). The elevation in inflorescence temperature during opening, and 24 h later, is discussed in relation to cantharophily. Astrocaryum mexicanum is an example of a highly diverse pollination system in which many animals can coexist. It represents an important resource during the dry season, and provides food and space for refuge and mating. The genetic consequences of having a host of pollinators with different dispersal capabilities are explored. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Kike many species in the Oxalidaceae it is heterostylous (here distylous). The small red flowers, which last less than one day, are produced in loose inflorescences which bloom over a long flowering season (several months). There are two whorls of stamens in each plant, which overlap in length, perhaps indicating a tristylous origin. Longstyled and shortstyled plants differed in the measurements of stamens, styles and pollen grains. Only a small amount of pollen was produced by longstyled plants. Effective insect pollinators were mainly large Hymenoptcra, especially Xylocopa species, which visited many flowers and different trees in rapid succession. A wide diversity of insects visited flowers of both morphs, and numbers visiting each morph were approximately equal. The only successful experimental pollinations were from pollen of shortstyled plants onto stigmas of longstyled plants. Automatic selfpollination did not occur. In nature not all flowers produced fruit, some fruits were set with no seeds and a low number of seeds was set in all fruits. The differences in seed set per fruit between shortstyled, longstyled and experimental crosses indicate that pollinator visits were insufficient for maximum seed set in some fruits, but selective abortion of seeds must also be occurring. We suggest that S. celebica may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of dioecy from distyly, with the shortstyled flowers making their major genetic contribution through pollen and longstyled flowers through ovules.

These populations are polymorphic for flower colour and in 4 enzyme systems detected by electrophoresis. Insects, mainly bumblebees, visited P. vulgaris for nectar in small numbers but many flowers must remain unvisited, and fluorescent dust applied to the anthers of 13 inflorescences was only dispersed from 2. The species is self-compatible and largely self-pollinating. Seeds of P. vulgaris have an elaiosome attached to one end and were taken readily by the ant, Lasius niger, which carried the seeds into their nests, often ejecting them again after mutilating the elaiosome. The ants carried the seeds up to 2m. No other adaptations for seed disperal are apparent, but occasional long distance dispersal, eg by wind or on the feet of grazing animals, may have an important effect on the genetic structure of the populations. The large monomorphic groups seem to have established at Oxwich as a result of substantial recolonization from disturbance after 1945. At Whiteford many small recolonizations must follow frequent covering with blown sand leading to a mosaic of small monomorphic patches. In both populations, genetic drift appears to have had a large effect in determining the present-day genetic structure.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023487944

The responses of the variety TVu4552 to differing temperatures after flowering and to irradiance were examined in controlled environment glasshouses. Seasonal variation in irradiance was positively correlated with pod number, while seed number per pod and mean seed weight remained constant. Carbon dioxide assimilation rate (ifA) of recently expanded leaves of plants grown at 21 16 °C day/night temperature regime was half that of plants grown at 27 22°C and 33 28°C, although leaves of plants grown at these warmer regimes had instantaneous A's that were unchanged in the range 20-28°C. Grain yield was influenced by the temperature after flowering in two ways: with high temperature there was a decrease in pod number; with temperatures below 21°C there was a decrease in seed number and size. Associated with decrease in pod number at high temperatures there was earlier leaf senescence. Although early senescence would limit assimilate supply and pod development at high temperatures, at a constant intermediate temperature ( 27 22°C) there was no seasonal variation in the timing of senescence despite a doubling of radiation from winter to summer. The failure to set seed at low temperatures was a response localized within the flower and the developing pod. Histochemical staining of isolated pollen and of the stigma indicated that at low temperature (18°C) pollen was viable and that pollination occurred. Early embryo development was apparently restricted at low temperature and this response was evident over a period of up to 5 days after pollination. © 1987.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249036449

The different compounds were separated by high?pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed before pollination, during ripening, at ripeness and after 2 weeks of after?ripening of the seeds. The extracts were examined particularly for the presence of an alkaline compound (X), which is a phenolic derivative of tryptophanamide and appears to be a biochemical marker for the dormancy of ripe dry seeds of Petunia. During capsule growth and seed ripening, compound X was not a marker for dormancy, although it occurred in the reproductive organs of seed?parent plants. After pollination and fertilization, accumulation of compound X started mainly in the fruit wall, but in ripe dry capsules it was present entirely in the seeds. In contrast to compound X, neutral phenolamides were not detected in extracts from the fruit wall: and from the early stages of the capsule growth substantial accumulation took place only in the seeds. Absence of compound X from ripe dry seeds appears as a necessary but not a sufficient condition for non?dormancy. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

However, a closely related annual Medicago, Medicago scutellata, possesses dense glandular stem and leaf hairs which provides a mechanism for resistance. Several attempts have been made at transfering the glandular haired traint from M. scutellata to perennial alfalfa with limited success. Earlier studies have shown that one reason for the lack of success is embryo abortion. Therefore, this study was initiated to observe zygotic embryo-genesis and to develop an embryo rescue technique for M. scutellata and M. sativa. Observations of zygotic embryogenesis showed that the two species are similar in morphology and can be described from youngest to oldest as globular, heart, torpedo, and hook shaped embryos. M. sativa embryos are smaller than M. scutellata embryos and develop three to four days later. Self pollinated M. scutellata (PI 307446) and sib mated M. sativa (Saranac AR) embryos were cultivated on Murashige and (2,4-D), indolacetic acid (IAA), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and kinetic (KIN). Embryos from both species were also cultured on Schenk and Hildebrandt's (SH) basal medium with the addition of L-glutamine and L-proline. The experimental design was a completely randomized factorial for each experiment. Heart and torpedo shaped embryos from M. scutellata grew best (27.5% plantlet recovery) when cultured on MS medium with 0.05 mgl-1 of both IAA and BAP. After 15 to 30 days on this medium, the embryos had only developed shoots. Therefore, it was necessary to transfer the shoots to MS basal medium without phytohormones for rooting. Rooting occurred in 15 to 30 days and the plantlets could be acclimatized to soil within 2 to 4 weeks. M. sativa embryos grew best (31% plantlet recovery) on SH medium with 50 mM L-glutamine. M. sativa embryos developed both shoots and roots on this medium. This information may now be applied to the development of an embryo culture method for recovering insect resistant hybrids between M. scutellata and M. sativa. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",alfalfa; annual Medicago; embryo rescue; embryogenesis; insect resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142209534

A laboratory technique for measuring the number of pollen grains consumed by thrips is described. 2. Thrips imaginis Bagnall and Thrips obscuratus (Crawford) (Thripidae) were studied particularly on pollen of the kiwifruit Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chevalier) Liang & Ferguson in New Zealand, and Echium plantagineum L. in Australia. 3. Mean daily feeding rates (in grains per thrips per day) ranged from 29 to 843, with an individual rate as high as 1626 for T.imaginis larvae II on E. plantagineum. 4. The time taken to feed on a single grain was proportional to grain volume, and decreased with temperature. 5. Daily feeding rates were significantly different between pollens, and were higher for smaller grains. The total volume of pollen contents consumed and the total time spent ingesting this volume per thrips per day may be constant with respect to pollen species. 6. Daily feeding rates were equivalent to 0.20.7% of the average total pollen production of a flower per thrips per day. 7.

Total fruit set was high in these populations, ranging from 60-80%, and did not vary significantly among common petal colors in any site. Number of seeds per fruit did vary among color morphs, but the pattern was different in 1983 and 1984 and did not correspond to concurrent patterns of pollinator visitation. Hand pollination studies showed that pollen limitation is not a major factor influencing seed production. All petal color morphs were mostly self-incompatible. Resource limitation appeared to be a major force regulating seed production. Despite consistently high pollinator visitation rates, flower production rate, fruit set and seeds per fruit all declined markedly through the 5 wk flowering season. Pollinator discrimination among colors is likely to have its greatest impact on paternity success rather than maternal fecundity. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023480786

Twenty families were given acute exposures (2 fumigations for 4 h each) to SO2 (0·4-1·0 ppm), O3 (0·25 ppm), SO2 (0·4-1·0 ppm) + O3 (0·25 ppm) and control. Analyses of variance were performed to evaluate the treatment effects of these air pollutants on percent foliar injury, and to determine whether the families responded differentially to the air pollution treatments. Treatment effects were significant, with the combination treatment of SO2 + O3 producing a higher percentage of foliar injury than the controls; however, injury levels were very low and may not be of biological significance. Subsequently, twelve families were grown in two soil types for exposure to chronic levels of SO2 (0·06 ppm), O3 (0·07 ppm), SO2 (0·06 ppm) + O3 (0·07 ppm) and control. The families were then ranked for decreased primary shoot growth, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, total plant dry weight and root/shoot ratio after exposure to air pollution treatments. Air pollution treatments as a main effect were significant for only one of five growth parameters measured, that of primary shoot growth. The main effect of family, and the interaction of family and air pollution treatments, were significant for most growth parameters measured. In general, O3 alone and in combination with SO2 reduced growth more than SO2 alone. Fumigation with O3 reduced growth of two families in comparison with control groups, whereas SO2 alone produced decreased growth in one family and stimulated growth in three families. Treatment with O3 alone produced higher root/shoot ratios than fumigation with charcoal-filtered air in two families. Overall, families which were fast growers under control conditions maintained their ranking after exposure to air pollution. Families producing less growth in charcoal-filtered air also produced less growth under various air pollution regimes. Results indicated that these families exhibited a high degree of resistance to air pollution injury. Growth responses of seedlings may not reflect family differences in long-term productivity.

Flowering competes with vegetative growth and vegetative reproduction for resources, and involves heavy resource costs which are often much greater than those required for seed production alone. Interactions between plants dependent upon flowering may be competitive or mutualistic. Theoretical models suggest that these interactions may often be of primary importance in determining whether different species or genotypes coexist, or displace or mutually exclude one another, and may thus be responsible for the heavy investment in flowering, but very few cases have been analyzed satisfactorily. The existence of simultaneously or sequentially flowering guilds of species with similar floral characteristics may be a consequence of mutualistic interactions.

Seed survival, a term used here to represent the relationship between seed set and fertilization, was shown to vary between the wheat genotypes tested, but was unrelated to the crossability genes present within the wheat genotype. A high seed survival was obtained in crosses involving the variety TH3929 and the single chromosome substitution line, Chinese Spring (Hope 5B). Chinese Spring showed a poor seed survival. Some influence of the H. bulbosum genotype on seed survival was detected. The two environmental factors studied, namely the post-pollination application of gibberellic acid and the ambient temperature, were both shown to affect seed survival. The application of gibberellic acid immediately after pollination or 1 and 2 days after pollination improved seed survival, although the extent of the response was dependent upon the number and timing of the application(s). A genotype-dependent response to the ambient temperature was observed, TH3929 showing a slight but insignificant reduction and Chinese Spring a significant improvement in seed survival with an increase in temperature from 20°C to 26°C.

The segregation of allozymes in megagametophytes of heterozygous trees indicated distinct, simple, Mendelian inheritance. The stand heterozygosity parameters (proportion of polymorphic loci (0·64), average number of alleles per locus (1·79), and average expected heterozygosity (0·18)) were identical to those reported from a broadly-based survey of the species (Steinholf et al., 1983). Comparison of progeny (viable embryo) and parental genotypic distributions indicated a major genetic shift between the two life-cycles phases. Among the progeny, heterozygotes occurred less frequently than expected under panmixia, while the reverse was observed for the parental population. Single-locus estimates of outcrossing rate varied between 0.751 and 1.043 and were significantly heterogeneous. Comparison between the single-locus estimates and the multilocus estimate (0·977) of outcrossing rates indicated that most of the inbreeding detected was due to consanguineous matings, rather than selling. This form of inbreeding was consistent with the clustering of genotypes in the stand. Single-tree estimates of outcrossing rate varied considerably among trees and ranged between 0.682 and 1.207, indicating that some trees might possess high self compatibility and tolerate high selling, or that violation of mixed-mating assumptions occurred.

Within each cyme, there is a correlation between the proximity of a flower to the main axis and its order of flowering; and (lie probability of it maturing seeds.

As expected, variation at the known crossability loci had no effect on pollen grain germination. The frequency of pollen tube penetration of the ovary wall was, however, severely reduced when the dominant alleles were present. Pollen tube penetration was nevertheless observed in 3 of the 110 ovaries examined of the non-crossable cultivar Highbury. The H. bulbosum genotype had a much smaller effect on these characters, but significant differences between the clones were observed in the numbers of pollen tubes initially penetrating the ovary wall. Although two H. bulbosum genotypes showed no significant differences in the number of ovaries with pollen tubes at the base of the ovule, significant differences in the frequency of fertilization were observed. The possible cause of this discrepancy is discussed. The frequency of fertilization in crossable wheat × H. bulbosum hybridizations was improved by the application of gibberellic acid within 10 minutes of pollination, and reduced by an increase in the ambient temperature from 20°C to 26°C.

Moneymaker). Flowers of the ga?1 mutant were abnormal and sterile, but parthenocarpic fruit development was observed occasionally on the dwarf plants. A single application of GA4+7 restored the fertility of the mutant flowers and resulted in seed set. Development of GA?producing and GA?deficient seeds in GA?deficient fruits was compared by pollination of ga?1/ga?1 flowers with wild?type or ga?1 pollen, respectively. In ga?1/ga?1 seed dehydration started about 1 week earlier than in Ga?1/ga?1 seeds. Ultimate fresh and dry weights of mature Ga?1/ga?1 seeds were higher than those of ga?1/ga?1 seeds and showed negative correlations with the total number of seeds per fruit. Total content and composition of seed proteins were not influenced by the GA?deficiency. Germination of the mature seeds depended on embryonal GA synthesis and was not influenced by maternal GA production. Final fresh weight of the ga?1/ga?1 fruits was positively correlated with the number of seeds per fruit. In these fruits, the minimum number of seeds for growth above the parthenocarpic level was about 10 or 35 in the presence of Ga?1/ga?1 or ga?1/ga?1 seeds, respectively. Fruits containing GA?producing seeds reached a higher fresh weight than those containing GA?deficient seeds, and their ripening was delayed by one week. It is concluded that gibberellin is indispensable for the development of fertile flowers and for seed germination, but only promoting in later stages of fruit and seed development.

Their role as primary decomposers is limited because of relatively low rates of metabolic and enzymatic activity compared with microorganisms. However, they greatly facilitate decomposition by fragmenting and incorporating litter into the soil and by stimulating microbial activity. Earthworms are the main litter consumers in productive temperate grasslands and termites in the tropics, while the activities of dung beetles, dipterous larvae and earthworms are essential for efficient dung decomposition. Earthworms and microbial?feeding invertebrates facilitate mineralization and release into the soil solution of plant nutrients. Earthworms have a major influence on soil structure through burrowing, soil ingestion and mixing and they significantly increase plant growth. Herbivorous invertebrates at non?outbreak densities normally consume less than 10% of net primary production in grassland, but consumption bears little relationship to overall effects on productivity. These depend on factors such as the nature of the damage caused and regrowth potential, tolerance for damage and effects on animal production at the time of attack. Sap feeding insects may cause wilting and reduced growth and selective feeding on preferred species can alter botanical composition, while aphid?transmitted virus disease can depress yield. On the positive side, low levels of herbivory can stimulate growth, weed feeding insects may limit the distribution of pasture weeds, while the role of flower?visiting insects can be important in the pollination of legume seed crops. Pest management approaches incorporating biological control, alteration of botanical composition, adjustment of stocking densities and accurately timed insecticidal applications offer prospects for the control of recurring pests such as grass grub and porina in New Zealand.

Nagar Lucknow-226016, India","Mentha arvensis L. is an aromatic plant from family Lamiaceae (Labiatae) and its oil is the richest source of menthol in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. The single compound menthol is used widely in medicinal, food and cosmetic preparations. Menthol is also used in the preparation of after-shave lotions, mouth washes and other toilet preparations and flavouring cigarettes. In India, it is taken with betels providing a cooling sensation when chewed. This species of the genus Mentha (mint) is polymorphic and further complicated by gynodi-oecy, polyploidy and vegetative propagation. The plants are self-compatible and seed set occurs readily on self-pollination. However, a fairly high level of cross-pollination is assured due to gynodioecy. Although, the evolutionary aspect of M. arvensis has not yet been unraveled completely, its genesis has been considered through an ancient hybrid (Ikeda and Ono 1967). Japanese mint (M. arvensis L. forma piperascens Holmes), the commercial source of natural menthol, has been cultivated in Japan for its essential oil since antiquity (Guenther 1949). Japan and China had been the suppliers of major quantities of world requirements of menthol before World War II. Subsequently, its cultivation was taken up in different parts of the world. China and Brazil have emerged as major suppliers of mint oil and menthol in the world market. Japanese mint was introduced in India in 1954 from Japan (Handa et al. 1954, Kapoor et al. 1955, Dutta 1971). Currently it is cultivated on more than 8,000 hectares of land in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana States, and the country is producing above 600 tons of this valuable essential oil annually, on the basis of which import of this item has been stopped. Inspite of the fact that the crop is vegetatively propagated, but over the years of multiplication of the same original material consisting of a few suckers of only one clone, there has been considerable qualitative deterioration in the oil, in terms of low percentage of menthol throughout the country (Mehra 1982, Husain 1982). During the last few years this deterioration has been so rapid that some of the small menthol producers have to close down their operation due to the non-availability of quality oil for processing. In view of this, we took up a programme for developing improved clone of Japanese mint capable of giving high oil yield with high menthol content through genetic manipulations. To overcome the problem of narrow genetic base of the existing material and to develop broad-based germplasm pool, a number of clones were introduced from various mint producing countries of the world. During the course of their multiplication, a few morphological variants (bud-sports) were identified. The results of an intensive study dealing with the variation in chromosome number, yield potential and oil quality of six distinct genotypes of M. arvensis are reported in this communication. © 1987, Japan Mendel Society, International Society of Cytology.

Preferential outcrossing was demonstrated, with an average of 81% of seeds being outcrosses. S and 0 seeds were also found within the same openpollinated capsules, confirming the experimental observation that receipt of outcross pollen does not per se preclude self-fertilisation. The independent probabilities of survival of S and 0 embryos, as determined from seed yield per 100 flowers after separate S and 0 pollination, accounted for much of the preferential outcrossing effect. However, some trees produced more outcrosses than expected and competitive interaction of embryo genotypes within a capsule cannot be discounted. Following open pollination, samples from 15 trees averaged 16.7 ovules and 1.48 full seeds per capsule, giving a mean seed: ovule ratio of 9.0%. The modal number of seeds per capsule was 1 and the maximum 9, while 21% of capsules yielded no full seeds. These observations and experiments suggest post-fertilisation control of the breeding system, dependent upon both embryo genotype and maternal resource allocation. © 1987, CSIRO.

The genus Leucadendron is useful for a phylogenetic study because it contains many species (79), is morphologically very diverse and appears to have diverged early on in the history of the family in Africa. Polarity of many characters was determined by outgroup analysis and the ontogenetic method. Exceptionally high levels of convergence made the determination of the phylogeny of the subsections problematic. An index, which is the sum of weight of all derived characters present in a species, was determined. The genus should be removed from subfamily Aulacinae and placed closer to the Leucospermumalliance. I suggest an arid temperate, shrub?like origin for the African Proteaceae, which is in contrast to some published viewS. Modifications to accepted concepts of fruit homology and evolutionary trends such as pollination and dispersal are presented for the family. The divergence index, if used as a morphological clock, appears to be useful for further biogeographic and ecological analyses. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

Cytological screening of the interspecific hybrids and hybrid derivatives of Coix produced by growing together two allopatric species, C. gigantea (2n = 20) and C. aquatica (2n = 10), revealed that one or two chromosomes from gigantea species (G) showed B chromosome-like behavior when incorporated in the aquatica genome (A) through spontaneous hybridization. Among the hybrid derivatives of C. gigantea × aquatica, plants with 2n = 11 chromosomes comprising 10A + 1G and 9A + 2G showed B-like behavior of the G chromosome(s) through meiosis. Had it not been for the fact that 2n = 11 chromosome plants are known to be of hybrid origin they could have been easily mistaken for C. aquatica (2n = 10) plants with B chromosome(s); the latter in reality having come from another species (C. gigantea) through open pollination. Repeated cytological screening of populations comprising interspecific hybrids and hybrid derivatives of Coix have demonstrated how homologous, homoeologous and/or nonhomologous chromosome(s) could flow between the related species and subsequently establish themselves as B chromosomes.

Using dry weight measures, the male/female ratio is linearly related to the selfing rate. This linear relationship may have a fairly radical interpretation in terms of current sex allocation theory. It suggests that the intermediate selfing rates are themselves maintained by a form of frequency dependence. In particular, the linearity suggests: (i) the relative fitness of a selfed versus outcrossed offspring decreases with increased selfing; (ii) in equilibrium, a selfed offspring is approximately half as fit as an outcrossed offspring; (iii) the frequency dependence, being the opposite of that proposed in most selfing models, may result from the same forces thought to be involved in the maintenance of sex itself, and (iv) the position of the fitted line contains information about the plant's use of wind pollination for male reproduction. It suggests that wind shows much less mixing of pollen than previously assumed, and/or that there are severe morphological constraints on pollen presentation.

The rhythms of seed production display great diversity. Some individuals yield frequently, whilst others, rather seldom. Flowering of clones is asynchronous, and has an adverse influence on cross-pollination. Flowering can be asynchronized by applying genetically similar rootstock. Since pollen distributes unequally, the seeds are more genetically valuable in the higher parts of crowns.

A model that measures the magnitude of disassortative mating was developed using the progeny test data. Since the model does not distinguish between selling and assortative mating, outcrossing estimates are likely to be underestimated. Using the model it was shown that the mating patterns of the two populations were strikingly different. In the tristylous population a high level of disassortative mating was estimated (t = 0·903) with no significant differences among the floral morphs. In the dimorphic population (L, M) the rate of disassortative mating of the long-styled morph was t = 0·657, whereas all matings in the mid-styled morph were either selfed or assortative.

All means of achieving a higher genetic level in future seed orchards must be used. Progeny testing is under way in many countries and subsequent recurrent selection will be done for advanced-generation seed orchards. Since the new seed orchards will be more genetically differentiated than the old ones, the effect of pollen contamination will be more harmful; therefore serious efforts should be made to eliminate undesirable pollen contamination. Location of the orchards to the south of the utilization area of the seed and continuous pine forests would almost completely eliminate pollen contamination. Difference in flowering times would be considerable, and above all, background pollination would be negligible. In addition, the time lag between selection and seed production would be essentially shorter. Optimal locations can be suggested with models of climatic adaptation and then checked with experimental plantations. Hazards caused by pests and diseases must be investigated and possible physiological after-effects of the new environment on the annual rhythm of the seedlings clarified. Despite these reservations, long-distance transfers of seed orchards are probably the only feasible way of avoiding pollen contamination in large-scale seed production projects. © 1987.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45949123196

Anther squashes from male-sterile plants revealed that a low frequency of natural coenocytic microspore germination occurred in male-sterile anthers of four independent lines; [ms1-North carolina (T260H), ms1-Urbana (T266H), ms1-Tonica (T267H), and ms1-Ames (T268H)]. Abnormalities such as giant tubes, branched tubes, tubes with swollen areas, and multiple tubes were observed from coenocytic microspores from all four lines. The Urbana line, however, demonstrated a higher percentage of coenocytic microspore germination than did the other three lines. Flowers of the Urbana line from both malefertile and male-sterile plants, as well as gynoecia pollinated with coenocytic microspores from sterile plants, were used for in vivo studies. Pollen-tube growth appeared normal in male-fertile plants. In contrast, coenocytic microspore tubes rarely were observed in gynoecia from male-sterile plants or in gynoecia from malefertile plants that had been artificially cross-pollinated with ms1 ms1 plants. Few tubes from coenocytic microspores were observed in the vicinity of the micropylar region. A low frequency of seed set was achieved in the greenhouse on Urbana male-sterile plants grown in the absence of male-fertile plants. Thus, we believe either that some gametes from coenocytic microspores are able to participate in fertilization at low frequency or that apomixis occurs in ms1 ms1 plants. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",apomixis; fluorescence microscopy; Glycine max; male-sterile; pollen germination; soybean,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242479179

Those data were used to select meaningful measures of yield by comparing the yields of almond trees of different ages and sizes, and by examining the inter-relationships between several measured variables. Tree size, measured as butt cross-sectional area, was found to be linearly related to tree age, and deviated less from a linear function than did butt circumference. Number of nuts per tree was significantly correlated with butt cross-sectional area in some cultivar-year combinations, and so the measure ""number of nuts per square centimetre of butt cross-sectional area"" may allow a direct comparison between trees of different sizes with respect to their yielding ability. Significant negative correlations were found between mean weight-per-kernel per tree versus yield per tree. For almond, we suggest that yield comparisons between individual trees should take into account differences in tree size as well as variation in nut set and number of flowers. When nut set and number of flowers are constant, we suggest that a meaningful measure of yield per tree is nuts per square centimetre of butt cross-sectional area. This is in contrast to the situation with fruit crops like peach and apple where fruit size is important in yield comparisons. We also suggest that terms such as weight of nuts per hectare are comparable between orchards only if the tree densities and other measurements are known. © 1987.",almond; alternate bearing; nut set; pollination; South Australia; tree size; yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249034555

Alaska). These gibberellins were also identified in 4-d-old non-developing, parthenocarpic and pollinated ovaries. The level of gibberellin A1 within these ovary types was correlated with pod size. Gibberellin A1, applied to emasculated ovaries cultured in vitro, was three to five times more active than gibberellin A20. Using pollinated ovary explants cultured in vitro, the effects of inhibitors of gibberellin biosynthesis on pod growth and seed development were examined. The inhibitors retarded pod growth during the first 7 d after anthesis, and this inhibition was reversed by simultaneous application of gibberellin A3. In contrast, the inhibitors, when supplied to 4-d-old pollinated ovaries for 16 d, had little effect on seed fresh weight although they reduced the levels of endogenous gibberellins A20 and A29 in the enlarging seeds to almost zero. Paclobutrazol, which was one of the inhibitors used, is xylem-mobile and it efficiently reduced the level of seed gibberellins without being taken up into the seed. In intact fruits the pod may therefore be a source of precursors for gibberellin biosynthesis in the seed. Overall, the results indicate that gibberellin A1, present in parthenocarpic and pollinated fruits early in development, regulates pod growth. In contrast the high levels of gibberellins A20 and A29, which accumulate during seed enlargement, appear to be unnecessary for normal seed development or for subsequent germination. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.","Fruit-set and growth; Gibberellin and fruit and seed development; Inhibitor (of gibberellin biosynthesis); Pisum (fruit, seed development); Seed development",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009070637

Among crops dependent upon entomophilous cross-pollination, the sunflower has recently undergone extensive expansion due to hybrid variety selection. Sunflower hybrid seed production is strictly dependent upon pollinating insects, mainly the honeybees, but foragers may have preferences among the parental lines, leading to a lack of pollen carriage and consequently to a decrease of hybrid seed yield. In order to define the role of plant chemicals (aromas, nectars) involved in the pollination process, we set up a study combining behavioural and chemical assays. It appears that even though volatile chemical blends are much more complex compared to glucidic blends, for both kinds of cues only a 'limited chemical pattern' is responsible for foragers' choices.

In interspecific pollinations, Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora S. and Z.) and Japanese black pine (P. thunbergii PArl.), distributed in Japan and Korea were used as seed parents, and 19 exotic pine species were used as pollen parents. These seed parents belong to the subsection Sylvestres in the taxonomic classification of the genus Pinus. Sound seeds were obtained from the interspecific crosses among Asiatic species in the same subsection Sylvestres of the seed parent, but European species, although of the same subsection did not produce any sound seeds. In the crosses among the different subsections attempted in this experiment, all combinations had a reproductive gap. Regarding the affinity of pines belong to the same group in the taxonomic classification of the genus Pinus, it is clear that some species; namely, P. densiflora, P. thunbergii, P. massoniana LAMB., P. taiwanensis HAyata,P. tabulae-formis CArr.,P.khasya ROyle,P.luchuensis MAyr., and P. yunnanensis FRANCH. of the subsection Sylvestres distributed in the eastern Asian region have a close affinity. © 1987, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

To explore this possibility, allele frequencies at 5 polymorphic loci were characterised along transects through a meadow. F-statistics indicated substantial heterozygote excess within transect samples (overall FIS = 0·096). Possible contributors are sex-biased gene flow, and events occurring between pollination and ovule fertilisation that favor pollen from an optimal outcrossing distance of 310 m. Higher mating success over this optimal distance should cause longer realised gene dispersal than expected from pollen and seed movement, which are 1 m on average. It also may bring about a leapfrog dispersal pattern instead of a monotonic decline with distance from a source plant. F-statistics also indicated moderate genetic differentiation among samples (overall FST = 0·069). However, this did not correspond to organised spatial pattern. Spatial autocorrelations showed that alleles were randomly distributed along transects. Although mean genetic distance increased with physical distance, the pattern was not statistically significant. Apparent random spatial heterogeneity is expected if gene flow is extensive enough to prevent a rapid decline in genetic correlation with distance; it also might be promoted by a leapfrog pattern of gene flow. © 1987 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966156280

Within the B. procumbens and B. webbiana addition lines three groups could be classified according to their isozymes pattern, growth habit, transmission rate, and resistance level. It is assumed that B. procumbens and B. webbiana each possess three different chromosomes which carry genes for nematode resistance. In the offspring of the addition lines diploid translocation types appear at very low frequencies, Isozyme pattern or growth type of the resistant plants were used for selecting diploid types in the offspring of monosomic addition lines. Effective selection could be made in progenies of susceptible sugar beets pollinated by addition lines because the pollen transmission of the alien chromosome is very low. Using these methods 7 nematode?resistant sugar beet lines could be selected. The transmission rates of the resistance gene ranged from 70.6% to 100%.

For the wind-pollinated woodland annuals with size-structured populations, an environment characterized by low wind velocity, the importance of rapid site preemption early in the growing season for reproductive success, and the time constraints of an annual life cycle may all interact to favor female-biased sex ratios for all individuals, regardless of plant size or resource availability. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023557928

Biological features which influence the choice of technique for the various species include: incidence of grafting incompatibility, time taken for grafts to commence flowering, coincidence of flowering times, levels of seed set and viability, and the vegetative multiplication rates obtainable. For the Pinus taxa, the preferred approach to the production of tested superior full-sib families is by a combination of fully controlled pollination in clone banks, followed by vegetative multiplication at a moderately high rate. For A. cunninghamii, the most flexible strategy is considered to be mass pollination in young orthotropic orchards, perhaps combined with vegetative multiplication at a low rate. For the Pinus taxa, the feasibility of mass propagation of outstanding individual trees will be dependent on the success of research aimed at the genuine rejuvenation of aged shoots.

The rate of water import into the fruit, and the proportion of this conducted by the xylem stream were calculated from the daily rates of transpiration and the net accumulation of water and calcium. The rate of water import decreased as the conductivity of the nutrient solution rose, the maximum daily import rates in the third week after pollination being 3.2, 3.0 and 1.8 g fruit?1 d?1 for fruit grown at 2, 12 and 17 mS cm?1, respectively. During fruit development, the proportion of water imported via the xylem fell from 815% to 12% at maturity. The principal source of water for tomato fruit growth was phloem sap. Based on the daily rates of net dry matter accumulation, respiration and phloem water import, the calculated dry matter concentration of the phloem sap declined from 7 to 3%, or from 12.5 to 7.8% during fruit development in low or high salinity, respectively.

Microgametophytes are used to transfer exogenous DNA, either as total DNA or within a plasmid or phage vector. The transformation experiments described are based on direct gene transfers. Efficiency of coculturing Agrobacteria with regenerating protoplasts, however, is much higher than in direct transfers. Another method to take advantage of natural fertilization processes in transformation experiments is the introduction of donor DNA into ovaries at approximately the time of fertilization. Three possibilities that need to be considered for transferring the exogenous DNA into the new generation are(1) the pollen tube, just arrived near the ovules, could take up the DNA and transfer it into the egg cell; (2) the egg cell could take up the DNA; and (3) the DNA could be taken up immediately after fertilization either into the zygote or the developing embryo. © 1987, Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989703085

In addition to the several potentials outlined, the most important aspect is the storage of recalcitrant pollen of important fruit and forest trees and agricultural crops for overcoming geographic, seasonal, and physiological barriers in hybridization. Moreover, in some plant species the flowering period is very short and the pollen grains are very short-lived; thus the plant breeder is not able to handle it. In many fruit crops where yield is erratic, controlled pollination with stored pollen would help to stabilize production. It also avoids the interference of foreign or illegitimate pollen. The establishment of pollen banks, in addition to fulfilling various other needs, considerably reduces maintenance of orchards and nurseries for the regular supply of pollen. © 1987 Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012118714

On the third farm a change of stock mid-way through the period of the survey was associated with a highly significant increase in proportion of cross-breds. In general a rise in outcrossing was not followed by a significant fall as would be expected if cross-breds have a greater tendency than inbreds to self pollinate, but the possible role of a regulatory mechanism is discussed as are implications of the range in outcrossing within stocks for variety trials and commercial production of winter beans. Estimates of outcrossing frequency made in two crops in 1983 were slightly lower than some obtained in 19746 but no lower than those reported in 1951 thus providing no evidence of any long-term change in levels of natural cross-breeding in field beans in England. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

The study was conducted by sampling abundance and position of the eggs of these predators in corn monocultures in two locations of southern Quebec. The results indicated that the chrysopid Chrysopa occulata Say laid its eggs on corn leaves usually without aphid colonies, and late in the season. All other predators reacted to aphid concentrations. The syrphid Sphaerophoria philanthus (Mg.) oviposited close to the ground, early in the season, and among colonies of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.). The two coccinellids laid their eggs during July and August with a maximum during tasseling for Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberiake) and after pollination for Hippodamia tredecimpunctata tibialis Say. Of these two species, the latter one selected sites at higher levels on the plant, and was more abundant at the edges of the field.

Received August 1, 1986 Seven parental tansy (Tanacerum vulgare L.) plants were crossed by artificial pollination in the experiments in order to develop a schematic model for the genetic control of the thujone skeleton monoterpenes: thujone, sabinene and umbellulone. The progeny, comprising 232 plant individuals, were analyzed by gas chromatography. The essential oil was isolated from the leaves by means of a micro?extraction technique. The sabinene (SI) x sabinene (SII) crosses mainly produced progeny of the sabinene type (63%). The sabinene (SI) x umbellulone (UI) crosses were mainly of the sabinene type (50%), although the urnbellulone type (27.5%) also occurred. The back crosses and control crosses indicated that the thujone type TI, i.e., the parental plant of the sabinene type SI, differs genetically from the other thujone type (T3). The thujone type T1, which is also able to synthesize sabinene, seemed to transfer unwanted characteristics to the sabinene type S1 (F1 generation). This was also characteristic of the F2 generation. This partially explains the small number of sabinene types appearing in nature. A schematic model for the genetic control of thujoneline biosynthesis earlier developed for tansy by LOKKI et al(1973) was improved by incorporating the results of the study on thujone and sabinene. In addition, the pathway of umhellulone biosynthesis was added to the genetic model. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986409261

The disease was incubated for 13 or 14 weeks in pods inoculated when 2 and 4 weeks old, and for 12 weeks in pods inoculated 6?12 weeks old. Pods were uniformly susceptible to natural infection during the 12 weeks after pollination. Over 75% of rain showers started between 12.00 and 02.00 h, providing sufficient water to rehydrate basidiocarps as well as to wet pods. Pods remained wet after rainfall for decreasing periods when rain occurred after 13.00 h. Incidence of pod disease was shown to be related to the number of wetness periods longer than 4 h, and to the number of open turgid basidiocarps occurring 12 weeks earlier. Wetness periods had a greater influence on disease. Pod infection was modelled by assuming that infection was limited by either wetness periods or turgid basidiocarp numbers; critical numbers of wetness periods when both factors were of equal weight were defined by an exponential equation. The model was used to predict reductions in pod disease associated with different amounts of broom removal in each year. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell.

A high frequency of somatic instability, seen as a fine purple spotting pattern on the aleurone tissue, is characteristic of Mu-induced mutable alleles of genes of the anthocyanin pathway. Loss of such somatic instability has been correlated with the de novo, specific modification of Mu element DNA. In this report the presence or loss of somatic instability at the bz2-mu1 allele has been monitored to investigate the inheritance of the Mutator phenomenon. The active state is labile and may become weakly active (low fraction of spotted kernel progeny) or totally inactive (no spotted kernel progeny) during either outcrossing to non-Mutator lines or on self-pollination. In contrast, the inactive state is relatively permanent with rare reactivation in subsequent crosses to non-Mutator lines. Cryptic bz2-mu1 alleles in weakly active lines can be efficiently reactivated to somatic instability when crossed with an active line. However, in reciprocal crosses of active and totally inactive individuals, strong maternal effects were observed on the inactivation of a somatically unstable bz2-mu1 allele and on the reactivation of cryptic bz2-mu1 alleles. In general, the activity state of the female parent determines the mutability of the progeny.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023004237

Hale (castor bean) during the desiccation-tolerant phase of development causes them to germinate upon subsequent rehydration. This desiccation-induced switch from development to germination is also mirrored by a change in the pattern of soluble and insoluble protein synthesis within the cotyledons of the castor bean. Following rehydration of seeds prematurely dried at 40 d after pollination (DAP), cotyledonary proteins characteristic of development (e.g. storage proteins) are no longer synthesized; hydrolytic processes resulting in their degradation commence (after 12 h) in a manner similar to that observed following imbibition of the mature seed. A pattern of protein synthesis recognizable as germination/growth-associated occurs; premature drying has elicited a redirection in metabolism from a developmental to a germinative mode. Desiccation is also required for the induction (within cotyledons of 35 DAP seeds) of enzymes involved in protein reserve breakdown (leucyl ?-naphthylamidase; LeuNAase) and lipid utilization (isocitrate lyase; ICL), an event intimately associated with the post-germinative (growth) phase of seedling development. Thus, at a desiccation-tolerant stage of development, premature drying results in the suppression of the developmental metabolic programme and a permanent switching-on of the germination/growth metabolic programme. © 1986 Oxford University Press.",Castor bean; Cotyledons; Desiccation; Metabolism; Seed development; Seed germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006127522

Alternative methods of increasing the reward variability presented to pollinators are evaluated for P. foliosissimum and the relationship between that variability and risk-aversive foraging by pollinators is discussed. Significant spatial and temporal variability in rate of nectar production was found. Populations separated by approximately 200 m exhibited different rates. Nectar production declined significantly as a function of time of the flowering season in two populations but not in a third. In spite of such variability, individual plants showed consistency in production both within a single blooming season and across successive seasons.

However, supplies of improved seed will not be available in significant quantities until after 2000. Research into vegetative propagation was begun to speed the introduction of improved material into commerce. Early work on the propagation of superior clones failed because of problems of maturation. Subsequent investigation has concentrated upon propagation of young individuals of improved genotypes grown from seed produced by artificial pollination of tested clones. Techniques for larne-scale production of rooted cuttings of these improved genotypes have now been successfully developed. Following favourable hancial appraisals. commercial trials of the svstem are under way.Based on experience with Sitka spruce, three preconditions are proposed ;or largescale propagation programmes. These are use of cutting from young parents, propagation of proven superior genotypes, and use of the technique with material in short supply.

Below the laminated sequence, two layers of moss detritus (110-87 cm, 81-51 cm) alternate with greyish brown fine detritus. Pollen analysis reveals that the start of the deposition of varved sediment coincides with the beginning of intensive fiber plant retting with large quantities of Cannabis/Humulus -type pollen and even regular occurrence of the insect-pollinated Linum usitatissimum. The cf. Drepanocladus spores are almost absent during the retting period (c. 1590-1900 by the varves), but very common before and after it. Drepanocladus fluitans is capable of assimilating dissolved CO2 in water, so it thrives at low pH and is typical for oligotrophic clear-water lakes.

We found that the most important allergenic pollen is Gramineae with a principal period of pollination occurring from April to July. After Gramineae, Parietaria plays an allergenic role frequently in association with the pollen of Olea, which is the most important allergenic pollen of all the trees in this area.

However, seed set was not reduced when pollen of both species was applied simultaneously to I. aggregata stigmas. Hence a competitive effect may require arrival of foreign pollen before conspecific pollen. To explore this possibility we subjected I. aggregata flowers to a ""competition"" treatment in which they received D. nelsonii pollen 6 h before I. aggregata pollen, or to a ""control"" in which they received only the conspecific pollen. Foreign pollen precedence decreased mean seed set by almost 50%, which is consistent with effects observed in previous experiments. Reduced seed set can be explained by the fact that foreign pollen often caused stigma lobes to close together within 1.5-6 h, reducing subsequent receptivity. Stigma closure was also elicited by conspecific pollen, but not by mechanical stimulation, and was influenced by size of the pollen load and identity of the plant being pollinated. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Competition; Delphinium; Ipomopsis; Pollination; Stigma closure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001569085

In the second year, irrigation was included as an experimental treatment and the development of seeds was monitored. Large differences between years were found in the measures of pollination and fertilization, and irrigation was associated with a small but significant increase in the proportion of ovules which were fertilized within fertilized flowers, particularly in the ovules furthest from the stigma. This increase was clearly reflected in the corresponding indices of seed maturation in the irrigated plants. Irrigation was not associated with any change in the proportion of ovules which aborted. Small but statistically significant differences in all of the measures of pollination and fertilization were found among the stocks. It is suggested that the variation in the incidences of pollination and fertilization was largely associated with variation in the synchrony of anthesis within racemes. The proportion of ovules within pods which matured as seeds and the proportion which aborted both varied significantly among the five stocks.

I measured the costs and net benefits per fruit arising for eight species of yuccas from their interaction with the yucca moth Tegeticula yuccasella. Yucca moths decrease the production of viable seeds as a result of oviposition by adults and feeding by larvae. Oviposition through the ovary wall caused 2.3-28.6% of ovules per locule to fail to develop, leaving fruit with constrictions, and overall, 0.6-6.6% of ovules per fruit were lost to oviposition by yucca moths. Individual yucca moth larvae ate 18.0-43.6% of the ovules in a locule. However, because of the number of larvae per fruit and the proportion of viable seeds, yucca moth larvae consumed only 0.0-13.6% of potentially viable ovules per fruit. Given both oviposition and feeding effects, yucca moths decreased viable seed production by 0.6-19.5%. The ratio of costs to (gross) benefits varied from 0% to 30%, indicating that up to 30% of the benefits available to yuccas are subsequently lost to yucca moths. The costs are both lower and more variable than in a similar pollinator-seed predator mutualism involving figs and fig wasps. There were differences between species of yuccas in the costs of associating with yucca moths. Yuccas with baccate fruit experienced lower costs than species with capsular fruit. There were also differences in costs between populations within species and high variation in costs between fruit within populations. High variability was the result of no yucca moth larvae being present in over 50% of the fruit in some populations, while other fruit produced up to 24 larvae. I present hypotheses explaining both the absence and high numbers of larvae per fruit. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Gestbenefit analysis; Mutualism; Seed predation; Yucca; Yucca Moths,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000180254

They are pollinated primarily by small halictids and syrphids. The plants are self-compatible. Hemisynchronous, multi-cycle, incomplete proto-gyny allows both autogamous and geitonogamous selfing. Autogamy is infrequent due to movements of stamens and styles, and to allogamous pollination during the female stage. Minimum and maximum estimates of the frequency of geitonogamous pollinations are 2.4 and 31.2%. Avoidance of self-pollination is probably the most important selective force that has favoured floral protogyny. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Autogamy; Floral despecialisation; Geitonogamy; New Zealand; Ourisia macrocarpa; Pollination; Protogyny; Scrophulariaceae; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343671350

However, female flowers are somewhat smaller, do not produce any pollen, and contain very small amounts of nectar. Syrphids and bumblebees, which are important pollinators of R. chamaemorus, showed a strong preference for male flowers. Male flowers were also less often rejected by flower visitors than were female flowers, and two different groups of syrphid species stayed longer in male than in female flowers. These observations suggest that female flowers of R. chamaemorus attract pollinators by deceit. Hand-pollination experiments indicated that pollen availability limited seed production of R. chamaemorus in female dominated habitats but not in areas with an equal floral sex ratio. We suggest that the relative importance of factors limiting female reproductive success is not constant, but is influenced by the floral sex ratio of the population. This should apply also to other dioecious species that show variable sex ratios on either a local or regional scale. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Dioecy; Pollination; Rubus chamdemorus; Seed set; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022823382

Soliva is now widely naturalised in New Zealand and the plants are known here as Onehunga weed. The four species usually accepted for subgenus Soliva, three of which are recorded for New Zealand, are distinguished by characters of the achenes, but are identical in vegetative and floral characters. Examination of herbarium and field material of naturalised New Zealand plants has shown that these achene characters are continuously variable. Many forms previously referred to separate species, as well as intermediates between them, co-occur within populations. Individuals are self-pollinating and produce seedlings with the same achene form. Experimental crosses between plants with the most distinctive achene forms produced fully fertile progeny with achenes intermediate between those of the pollen and seed parents. It is concluded that subgenus Soliva consists of a series of inbreeding forms best regarded as a single species, S. sessilis, which is very variable in achene morphology. It is also suggested that there may be fewer good species in subgenus Gymnostyles than are usually accepted, and that the elevation of subgenus Gymnostyles to generic rank, as proposed by some authors, may not be warranted. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Achene morphology; Anthemideae; Asteraceae; Gymnostyles; Inbreeding; Naturalised plants; New Zealand; Onehunga weed; Polymorphism; Soliva,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34347374697

Mapping and statistical analyses of the juxtaposition of weed and cultivated diploid potatoes indicated situations where insectmediated hybridization between cultivated and noncultivated taxa was likely. Folk belief that a valley in the Department of La Paz, Bolivia, was the source of the important cultivar, ajawiri, is supported by the variety of weeds of S x ajanhuiri from this site that show cultivated characteristics. Farming practices of Aymara subsistence cultivators should facilitate the introduction of genetic recombinants into cultivated gene pools.

This 16 kb vector, pCT1T3, contains an intact nopaline synthase gene and a chimaeric gene consisting of the promoter and terminator regions from cauliflower mosaic virus gene VI and a structural gene, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH(3?)II), from the bacterial transposon Tn5. After transformation of tobacco mesophyll protoplasts with this plasmid, several kanamycin-resistant transformants were obtained. Intensive studies on the drug tolerance of growth and differentiation of the transformants showed that the chimaeric gene was stably expressed. Of 17 independent transformants, 3 (about 18%) expressed the two marker genes, regardless of the state of differentiation, as did individual plants regenerated from the same callus. Multiple copies of the inserted DNA were found in some transformants. Viable seeds were produced by 12 out of 15 independent transformants. Seeds obtained by self-pollination were germinated on medium containing kanamycin sulphate. With the exception of one clone, resistant seedlings with green leaves and sensitive seedlings with white leaves were found to segregate in a 3:1 ratio. This suggests that the inheritance of the inserted gene is Mendelian. A reciprocal cross between the transformants and wild-type tobacco also showed nuclear transmission of the APH(3?)II gene. This was consistently maintained in a subclone of the same transformant derived from the same callus line. Stable inheritance of the single dominant character was also seen among seeds formed in several different flower pods of the same individual plants. Two clones were also found to synthesize nopaline in addition to expressing APH(3?)II. Analysis of the progeny obtained by self-crosses of such transformants revealed the simultaneous expression of these two enzymes, indicating that the two marker genes are linked on the same chromosome. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",APH(3?)II; DNA transformation; Inheritance; Nicotiana tabacum; Nopaline synthase; Protoplasts,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002458580

They were first recorded in New Zealand about 100 years ago. Soliva taxonomy relies heavily on cypsela shape, although leaf shape has also been used. The shapes of cypselas of S. valdiviana and S. pterosperma are very distinctive and quite different from each other. Collections of cypselas from Old Government House grounds, Auckland showed that, in addition to S. valdiviana and S. pterosperma, a continuum of intermediate-shaped cypselas between the two species was present. Sometimes a wide range of cypsela shapes could be collected from an area as small as 100 cm2. The variation was not due to differences in cypsela maturity, nor to packaging effects within a capitulum. There were only very minor differences in cypsela shape between capitula on the same plant and plants bred true for cypsela shape. Observations on flower and capitulum structures suggest that pollen from the central, tubular flowers which are hermaphrodite but functionally male, is transferred to the receptive stigmas of the peripheral flowers. Although the pollen tube germinates the tube does not penetrate the stigmatic surface. However, in the absence of pollen the cypsela does not develop. It appears that pollination is needed as a trigger for embryo development and that reproduction is primarily agamospermous. Outcrossing may be uncommon because the bracts enclose the peripheral flowers when they are receptive. The origin of the range of variation of cypsela shape is uncertain. Possibly it arises as a result of occasional outcrossing with predominant agamospermy. © 1986 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",Agamospermy; Anthemideae; Asteraceae; Capitulum; Flower; Taxonomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-62249179764

The likely evolution of this syndrome by additive steps, effecting a change from ""head up"" to ""head down"" position of the pollinator, can be traced from the floral structure of the remaining four species of the genus. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Australia; Bignoniaceae; Deplanchea; evolution; Flora of Malesia; flower; inflorescence; Morphology; nectar; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009854477

Br. ex D. C. bear only a single whorl of stamens and these stamens are arranged separately (not in typical ""bundles""). The short filaments are appressed to the three carpels so that the inflated, porose and introrsive anthers form a centralized cluster obscuring the three ovaries. The three slender styles emerge at right angles from between the filaments. These styles curve upward and the stigmas form the three points of a triangle; each stigma is approximately one millimeter outside the centralized cluster of anthers. The flowers are nectarless and bear a bright yellow corolla. A pungent and unpleasant fragrance appears to be concentrated within the pollenkitt. When native bees attempt to forage for the pollen, within the cluster of anthers, the ventrally deposited loads of pollen, on the bees' abdomens, contact the outer triangle of stigmas. The major pollinators of H. fasciculata are female bees in the polylectic genera, Lasioglossum (subgenus Chilalictus, Halictidae) and Leioproctus (Colletidae). These bees carry an average of more than two pollen taxa when they are caught foraging on H. fasciculata. 78% of the 47 bees, captured on H. fasciculata carried the pollen from at least one sympatric taxon bearing nectariferous flowers (e.g., genera in the Myrtaceae, Compositae, and Epacridaceae).

The results indicate that: a)Hordeum spontaneum in Iran is extremely rich genetically but, because of predominant self-pollination, the variation is carried primarily by different homozygotes in the population. Thus, genetic indices of polymorphism P-1% = 0.375, range = 0.267-0.500, and of genetic diversity, He = 0.134, range = 0.069-0.198, are very high. b) Genetic differentiation of populations includes clinal, regional and local patterns, sometimes displaying sharp geographic differentiation over short distances. The average relative differentiation among populations is Gst = 0.28, range = 0.02-0.61. c) A substantial portion of the patterns of allozyme variation in the wild gene pool is significanctly correlated with the environment and is predictable ecologically, chiefly by combinations of temperature and humidity variables. d) The natural populations studied, on the average, are more variable than two composite crosses, and more variable than indigenous land races of cultivated barely, Hordeum vulgare, in Iran. - The spatial patterns and environmental correlates and predictors of genetic variation of H. spontaneum in Iran indicate that genetic variation in wild barley populations is not only rich but also at least partly adaptive.

In singledonor pollinations the identity of the donor did have a strong effect on the above parameters. Furthermore, the best single donor sired fruits with more seeds and heavier seeds than any mixture containing this donor. This pattern indicates interference of pollens or preemption of some ovules by the inferior pollen. In Campsis, therefore, the number of pollen donors contributing to a pollen load is less important than the identity of these donors in determining fruit production and fruit quality.

The methods compared were intrapopulation recurrent selection using full-sib or S1 families, full-sib and two half-sib reciprocal recurrent selection procedures, and convergent improvement applied to populations. Comparisons were made by calculating expected allelic frequency changes for each method. The optimal selection method for a given set of allelic frequencies and degree of dominance depended little on the environmental variance. Partly because of its short cycle, full-sib intrapopulation selection was the most effective method for the majority of allelic frequency combinations when the degree of dominance was small and an off-season nursery could be used to make recombinations. With larger values for the degree of dominance, S1 and reciprocal full-sib methods became optimal, the former method especially when favorable alleles had a high frequency and the latter when populations were highly divergent. When off-season nursery use was restricted to making self-pollinations or was absent, S1 selection was optimal for the majority of allelic frequency combinations. Convergent improvement was superior only for extremely divergent allelic frequencies and then only when the degree of dominance was less than 0.10. Half-sib reciprocal methods were never optimal, although the gain for the standard half-sib reciprocal procedure differed little from that of full-sib reciprocal selection when the degree of dominance was 0.75. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Convergent improvement; Plant breeding; Predicted genetic gain; Recurrent selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-12644297221

At 7600 pollen grains/mg pollen, the yearly output per saguaro plant is 6.4×108 grains. Based on the measured saguaro density of 6.56 plants/ha, 553 g/ha of pollen is produced yearly. The enormous variation among individual plants in terms of flower numbers and floral bloom patterns is documented. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), the main collectors of saguaro pollen, collect an average of 12.2 mg pollen per foraging trip and can thus harvest 23.5 pollen loads from one flower. An average honey bee colony collects 290 g of saguaro pollen over the season, which is 24.4% of their total intake. Individual colonies exhibit wide variation in pollen collecting activities with some closely tracking the pollen resource and others almost totally ignoring it. The average for seven colonies indicates that even though variation is great the overall trend is toward closely tracking and exploiting the saguaro pollen resource. Based on the pollen productivity of saguaro and a hypothetical 90% pollen harvesting efficiency of bees, the pollen harvest potential of the saguaro environment is 1.72 colony equivalents of pollen/ha and 0.5/ha for saguaro alone.

We induced bees to visit sequences of flowers in a flight cage, and compared dispersal of distinctively-colored pollen and fluorescent pigment (""dye"") that the bee had picked up at a single donor flower. Nonparametric and parametric analyses showed that dispersal properties of pollen and dye differed; consistently less pollen was deposited and it was carried consistently shorter distances than dye. Dye thus does not provide an accurate means of assessing exacty where or how far pollen travels in this plant-pollinator system. On the other hand, both pollen and dye responded similarly to several experimental manipulations of donor and recipient flowers.

Long-time inbred lines, however, have been shown to be genetically unstable, and with selection pressure acting on the resulting genetic variation, these lines have evolved into different strains. The objective of this study was to compare maintenance of line integrity under reproduction by sib-mating and self-pollination in ear-to-row progenies. Ten lines, varying from 5 to 35 generations of previous ear-to-row selfing, were maintained for 11 successive generations under each method of reproduction. Alternate generations were compared by using a randomized complete-block design with each family of lines as a separate experiment. Data were collected for 10 plant and yield traits: pollen shed and silk emergence dates, plant and ear heights, tassel branch number, kernel row number, ear length and diameter, grain yield, and 300-kernel weight. Summarizing for F-tests over all traits and experiments, 30% were significant among sib-mated generations and 56% among selfed generations. Also, overall generation means of the two methods were different for 51% of the comparisons, and the selfed lines were less vigorous for 79% of the significant comparisons. It was concluded that sib-mating lessens the effect of genetic instability and that a reproduction system of sib-mating with intermittent generations of selfing may be more beneficial than continuous ear-to-row selfing for certain lines. © 1986 Veenman B.V.",genetic variation; inbred line; maize; mutation; relic heterozygosity; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008898863

Greenhouse experiments showed that fruits do not abscise and they mature if they contain at least one fertilized (outcrossed) ovule. Field studies showed that flowering increased to a peak and then fell off rapidly, while seed production/fruit decreased through the season. Pollen addition did not increase the number of fruit or seeds per fruit, suggesting that fruit and seed production are not pollinator limited. Addition of water increased fruit and seed production by extending the life of the plant, by increasing the number of stalks which flowered, and by increasing the number of seeds per fruit. This indicates that fruit and seed production are resource limited. Fruits are relatively inexpensive as compared to seeds as over 93% of the water in fruits is contained in the seeds. Fifty-three percent of the plants were lost to herbivory as were 64.6% of the fruits on the remaining plants, indicating that herbivory also limited fruit and seed production. It is hypothesized that high fruit set coupled with variable seed set in L. gordonii is an adaptive response to unpredictable, variable resource levels, and high herbivory risk. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022854775

Many seeds of certain crosses observed seven days after pollinations were found to contain abnormal embryos and degenerating endosperms. In some cases seeds contained an embryo with no endosperm, or an endosperm with no embryo. Other interspecific crosses which were predicted to fail actually produced seeds with normally developed embryos and endosperms. To further characterize the intra- and interspecific embryos and endosperms the nuclear DNA was measured. There are several ways to explain the ploidy levels of embryos and endosperms among the crosses, the occurrence of unreduced gametes in some cases and genomic instability in other cases.

In all cases examined, the highly lobed vegetative nucleus was found in close proximity and positioned laterally to the elongated, oval shaped generative cell. Numerous projections of the vegetative nucleus come to within 53 nm of the inner vegetative cell plasma membrane which surrounds the generative cell. These areas of close association may continue transversely around the generative cell for a distance of up to 4 ?m. Although an association exists between the generative cell and vegetative nucleus of the mature pollen grain, it is apparent that several changes must take place after pollination in order to achieve the high amount of close contact that occurs between the vegetative nucleus and the numerous terminal cell extensions of the leading sperm in the pollen tube of amaryllis (Mogensen 1986). Thus, this study demonstrates that the spatial organization among components of the male germ unit in the mature pollen grain does not necessarily reflect relationships that ultimately exist among these components within the pollen tube. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Male germ unit; Pollen tube; Sperm cells; Three-dimensional reconstruction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037758273

In accordance with current hypotheses on the mechanism involved in pollen incompatibility process, it is suggested: that wall peroxidases present in the cells of the outer portion of the transmitting tissue are involved in the gametophytic self-incompatibility of Petunia; that self-pollination causes an increase in the number of cells involved in the rejection process; that non-pollinated styles, which are characterized by the presence of cell wall peroxidases in the outer portion of the transmitting tissue, are 'prepared' to a certain extent for the rejection of incompatible pollen tubes.

Reproductive behaviour was determined from observations of embryo sacs in mature ovules. Gametophytic apomixis in this species in characterized by aposporous embryo sacs which differ from normal sacs by their number, orientation inside the ovule, their dimensions and shape, and the absence of antipodal cells. The potential for apomictic reproduction increased in relation to the ploidy level, suggesting a gene dosage effect in the incidence of apomixis. In the three ploidy levels, the highest incidence of apomixis was observed when the plants reached the maximum number of flowering heads. These findings suggest that the same environmental conditions that favour flowering should also be responsible for increasing the incidence of apomixis. An additional experiment under controlled conditions indicated that the light regime should be one of the factors that govern the amount of apomictic reproduction. Thus, polyploidy and apomixis should be of special significance in the dispersion and evolution of this grass species. The 4x facultative apomictic cytotype is far more frequent in nature than the highly sexual 2x. Moreover, most of the seeds produced in a flowering season should arise asexually. So, apomixis rapidly increases the number of plants bearing the successful maternal genotype, and sexual reproduction becomes important in adverse environmental conditions. © 1986 Veenman B.V.",apomictic grass breeding implicances; gametophytic apomixis; gene dosage; light regime; Paspalum cromyorrhizon; pasture grass; seasonal reproductive changes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001514560

A modelling procedure is given that (1) calculates the number of pollen grains captured by an ovule's pollination-droplet and (2) gives a correlation between pollination efficiency and the physical properties (= mass, size) of different types of pollen. Based on this procedure, the number of Ephedra pollen grains captured by micropyles can be less than the number captured from other species. However, the mass and size of Ephedra pollen grains appear to coincide with those predicted to yield a local maximum of pollination efficiency, i.e. slightly larger or smaller values of either mass or size would decrease the probability of capture. In addition, the properties of Ephedra pollen grains operate synergistically in the aerodynamic environment around ovules and are focused to collide with pollination-droplets. By analogy, the properties of Ephedra pollen coincide with those predicted for a localized ""adaptive peak"". The physical properties of pollen grain types other than E. trifurca that can maximize pollen capture are not generally represented in the aerobiology of Ephedra during the pollination season. Therefore, the phenology of pollen release, community taxonomic-composition, and the physics of particle capture play collectively important roles in the reproductive success of Ephedra trifurca. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Aerodynamics; Computer simulations; Ephedra; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022549538

Kisokoma-ga-take, central Honshu, Japan. There were two main groups of pollinators, syrphid flies and bumble bees. Although some shrubs were visited by both types of insects, other shrubs and the herbs were visited by either syrphid flies or bumble bees. Two types of herbs categorized by the difference of flower-visiting insects, the Syrphid-type and the Bombus-type, exhibited some clearly contrasting ecological characteristics such as the flowering behavior of individual plants, spatial distribution of the plant populations and segregation of flowering phenology at the community level. The Syrphid-type herbs were densely distributed throughout wide areas in the tall herb stand, and all the flowers borne by an individual plant bloomed simultaneously. Each species did not markedly segregate its flowering time from that of other species of the same type. The Bombus-type herbs were distributed locally and/or at low density, and the individual flowers borne by an individual plant showed staggered flowering times. Each species had a more strictly segregated flowering time. These ecological characteristics of these two flower types seemed to be related to the behavioral characteristics of their pollinators. © 1986 Ecological Society of Japan.",Alpine plants; Bumble bees; Insect pollination; Pollination syndromes; Syrphid flies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022838722

Low capsule set in the native habitats resulted from low activity of pollinating moths. From different patterns of capsule formation on spikes, pollinated spikes could be classified into sphingid-pollinated and noctuid-pollinated types. The contributions of sphingids to capsule set were nearly constant at the three study sites. High percentage capsule set at one site was linked with high noctuid activity. Different preferences of sphingids and noctuids as to spike features were detected: sphingids selected spikes with large numbers of flowers in early stages of flowering. Flowers with different spur length were equally pollinated by sphingids. On the other hand, noctuids selected spikes with short and medium-sized spurs in the late stage of flowering. The size and density of spikes scarcely affected the pollination activity of noctuids. Selection pressure upon spike size and spur length in relation to sphingid pollination was suggested. The possibility of local differentiation in spur length due to activity of noctuids was discussed. © 1986 Ecological Society of Japan.",Fecundity; Noctuids; Platanthera; Pollination; Sphingids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022846039

Leeke, a polyhaploid plant (2n=21) was discovered in the uniform open-pollinated progeny of an apomictic interspecific hybrid (2n = 41) between pearl millet and P. squamulatum. The polyhaploid was shorter, less vigorous and was smaller morphologically than its maternal parent. It probably originated by parthenogenetic development of a reduced gametophyte in the apomictic interspecific hybrid. The most common metaphase I chromosome association in the polyhaploid was 4 bivalents plus 13 univalents. Irregular chromosome distribution, tripolar spindles, bridges and fragments were observed at anaphase I and telophase I. The polyhaploid was male-sterile and partially female- fertile having multiple aposporous embryo sacs in 95% of the ovules. Seed set was 3% when open-pollinated and 33% when pollinated with pearl millet pollen. Low seed set was due to competition among multiple embryos developing in the same ovule. Seventeen progeny from seed produced under open-pollination on the polyhaploid each had 2n=21 chromosomes and were morphologically uniform and identical to the female parent. The expression of obligate apomixis in the polyhaploid conditioned by the P. squamulatum genome between the simplex and duplex condition indicates that apomictic reproduction is possible in nonpolyploid plants. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Chromosome; Haploid; Interspecific hybrid; Pennisetum americanum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002000452

SI systems that operate in the ovary have been assumed to be extremely rare. Evidence from many plant species is presented to show that the SI barriers in the ovary, described here as late-acting SI systems, are quite common. The late-acting SI systems are divided into four categories: (1) ovarian inhibition of incompatible pollen tubes before the ovule is reached; (2) prefertilization inhibition in the ovule; (3) post-zygotic rejection of the embryo, and (4) ovular inhibition for which the cytological details have not been established. Whether or not post-zygotic incompatibility systems can be distinguished from inbreeding depression depends upon the assumptions underlying the genetic models of self-incompatibility. However, four approaches are outlined that could distinguish between active uniform rejections that are presumably evolved responses to inbreeding depression and the passive, variable failures that are commonly understood to be expressions of typical inbreeding depression. Possible advantages of late-acting SI include an extended period of time over which pollen genotypes may be evaluated by the maternal parent and greater flexibility in the choice of male parents. Due to a paucity of data regarding the genetics and physiology of lateacting SI systems, little can be said at this time about the possible diversity of such systems of their evolutionary relationships with classical gametophytic and sporophytic SI. An hypothesis for the operation of post-zygotic SI is described whereby maternal resources to developing embryos are terminated if the embryo (and/or endosperm) fall below a threshold level of heterosis. This hypothesis is a modification of one first proposed by Westoby and Rice in 1982 to explain variable maternal resource allocation to developing embryos. © 1986 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51849184035

Plants, raised from seeds collected at three sites, were grown in a greenhouse at three nutrient levels. In addition, a reciprocal transplant experiment was carried out. In both experiments variances in variables of growth and reproduction were largely due to environmental factors. Besides this overall result, population and population x environment interaction effects existed for most of the variables. Differences in plasticity between populations were further analysed. In the greenhouse experiment plants from a river-side population showed a high degree of plasticity in reproductive effort, whereas plants from two other populations, one series from a beach plain and the other from a salt meadow, showed a high degree of plasticity in shoot-root ratio.

The geography of species has a role in the processes of speciation which have a reciprocal role in species geography. The homosporous ferns provide an especially favorable group for biogeographic studies because nearly all species have an equivalent capacity for dispersal and migration. Species ranges are based on the ecology of the environment, rather than on animal vectors of dispersal or pollination. However, with allowance for these differences, the processes of geographic speciation are basically the same in ferns and other vascular plants, although often on a broader geographic scale in the ferns. Speciation most frequently produces a new species with a small range, which can rapidly expand to occupy the geography of the environment to which the species is adapted. The members of a closely related speciesgroup retain their morphological and geographic relations for a relatively short time. With speciation, changes in distribution, and extinction, the original relations of the species and the biogeographical history of the group will be lost. High regional species diversity occurs in the wet mountainous regions of the tropics, where there is greatest ecological diversity and maximal opportunities for speciation and persistence. © 1986 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001322110

Healey St., Champaign, 61820, Illinois, United States","A number of theoretical and methodological problems plague studies of sex allocation in hermaphroditic plants. Most models assume that consumable resources limit reproduction, yet one or both sexes may be mate-limited. Most models also assume that resource limitation causes trade-offs between the allocations to male and female functions, but the sexes may be limited by different critical resources, or their resource needs may not overlap in time. Problems arise in deciding which plant parts are reproductive, when to harvest them, how to apportion them to male and female roles, and what are the appropriate measures of their cost. When energy directly limits reproduction, or other needs can be translated into energetic costs, the great variation in composition of reproductive parts makes construction costs or respiration a more potentially accurate measure of investment than energy content or especially biomass. Some simple predictions from theoretical models include a 1:1 allocation ratio to male and female function in outcrossing hermaphrodites, a female-biassed ratio in proportion to the level of selfing, and lower average allocations to male function in animal-pollinated than in windpollinated plants. These predictions have not received much support from existing studies, thus emphasizing the need for better measures of allocation as well as better accounting of the many other possible factors that may determine individual (and population) allocation ratios. © 1986 The New York Botanical Garden.",biomass; construction costs; cosexual; critique of biomass; energy content; estimates of construction and maintenance costs; gender allocation; hermaphroditism or hermaphroditic plants; or measurement of photosynthesis and respiration as measures of male/female resource allocation; reproductive cost or cost of reproduction; reproductive effort; resource allocation; respiration; sex allocation; sex ratio; testing sex allocation models: problems with assumptions and data measuring sex allocation in hermaphroditic plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000941610

Central American forest Bignoniaceae apparently diminish competition between sympatric species with identical pollination strategies by alternating flowering. On the other hand, in the Bignoniaceae of Brazilian cerrado savannas coincident flowering is more common, suggesting different pollination strategies. Bees specialized in nectar robbery are associated with Bignoniaceae, particularly mass-flowering species. These nectar robbers stimulate pollinator movements between flowers and thus increase pollen-flow. The flowering phenology of the Malpighiaceae from forests and savannas apparently follows the phenology of the Anthophorinae (mainly Centridini)-bees, on which this plant group almost exclusively depends for pollination in the Neotropics. As the flowers of different genera and species are very uniform, the bees quite indiscriminately pollinate coexisting Malpighiaceae taxa. In the Malvaceae, the more primitive tree or shrub habit and an allogamous reproduction system is quite significantly associated with an ornithophilous pollination mode. Hummingbirds in the Neotropics have probably influenced the origin of the primitive bird-pollinated Malvaceae flower. In conjunction with the diversification of the Malvaceae and their migration into more open regions, pollination by bees has apparently become more prominent. Chiropterophilous Malvaceae seem to have developed more recently from ornithophilous ancestors within the neotropical forest regions. As a result of this ecological radiation, parallel modifications of the basic ornithophilous flower principle can be traced in different groups of the Malvaceae. Dynastinae-beetles are pollinators of South and Central American species of Annona, Cymbopetalum, Caladium, Talauma, Philodendron, Victoria, Nymphaea, Cyclanthus, Bactris and others. In many cases the relationship between flowers and their Dynastinae visitors is not very specific, principally reflecting differences in the faunistic spectrum of diverse regions and vegetation types. The attraction of these beetles as flower visitors in several unrelated groups of Angiosperms must have occurred repeatedly. It is suggested that the flower visiting species of this beetle group may have acquired their preference for certain pungent or aromatic flower odours by their feeding habits during the larval stage. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.","""oil-flowers"" and ""oil-bees""; Angiosperms; Annonaceae; Araceae; Arecaceae; Bignoniaceae; cantharophily:Dynastinae beetles; chiropterophily; Cyclanthaceae; flower ecological radiation: neotropical savannas and forests; flower evolution; Flowering phenology; Magnoliaceae; Malpighiaceae; Malvaceae; melittophily; nectar robbery; Nymphaeaceae; ornithophily; pollination strategies",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002592966

The morphology of the column and pollinarium is indicative of taxa placed within the subfam. Spiranthoideae. The orientation of the pollinaria to the stigma appears to prevent mechanical self-pollination. Both cross- and self-pollination appear to be effected by insects that forage within the brightly-colored, scented, non-resupinate flowers. Ants and drosophilid flies remove nectar, but do not appear to transport pollinaria between flowers. The primary pollinators are polytrophic flies in the fam. Syrphidae and opportunistic male bees in the genus Leioproctus (Colletidae). Approximately 52% of the flowers on a raceme set seed. The comparatively short floral tube of P. odoratum reflects the dependence of this species on short-tongued insects to effect successful dispersal of pollinaria. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Orchidaceae; Pollination ecology; Prasophyllum odoratum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004586872

Four different tissue culture procedures involving different media and the use of different explants to initiate the cultures were used. Petiole explants from young leaves were used as explants for initiation of callus cultures. These were evaluated for callus growth rate, friability, and callus color and texture, before transferring to each of three different regeneration media for evaluation of morphogenetic potential. Small shoot tips also were used to initiate callus cultures, which were evaluated for the same growth characteristics and transferred to growth-regulator free regeneration media. Regeneration occurred through root or shoot regeneration or through embryogenesis. Tissue culture treatment effects, as well as genotypic effects, were highly significant in determining: the types of callus produced, callus growth rates, color and texture on the two types of media used for the second and third subcultures. The family x treatment interaction was generally not statistically significant, affecting only callus color. Estimates of narrow sense heritability for callus growth rate in both the second and third subcultures were high enough (0.35 and 0.63, respectively) for the evaluation of parental lines for selection procedures. These characteristics were also the only early culture callus traits that were consistently correlated with later morphogenesis of the cultures. They were negatively correlated with root or shoot regeneration. The occurence of somatic embryogenesis was not correlated with early callus growth characteristics. Genetic and treatment effects were highly significant in the evaluation of morphogenetic potential, through root or shoot regeneration, or through embryogenesis. Regeneration of all types was of low frequency for all procedures, expressed in ? 11% of the cultures of the total population. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Embryogenesis; Ipomoea batatas L; Morphogenesis; Sweet potato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342810288

Seeds produced from these self-pollinated plants were planted in the field. Of the 5586 R1 plants, 32 differed for one or more agronomic traits from plants not passed through tissue culture process. Gliadin electrophoregrams were prepared from bulk samples of R2 seed from these 32 plants. Four of the 32 produced gliadin patterns different from controls, so 12 seeds of each of these four lines were examined individually. Three of the four mutant lines were fixed for the presence of a mutant protein of 50 relative mobility units (RMU) and the corresponding loss of a parental protein of 26 RMU. The remaining line segregated for the presence/absence of band 50 and the corresponding loss/retention of band 26. The mutant protein of 50 RMU was never seen in control plants. This indicated that either band 50 was coded for by a mutant gene allelic to the gene that coded for band 26 or that bands 26 and 50 were coded for by two different structural alleles under the control of a common regulatory locus. Each of the 12 seeds from the four mutant lines contained a prominent protein band at 30 (RMU), which was only observed as a faint band in one control seed.

The methodology, designated ovule-embryo culture, involved preculturing the fertilized ovule (10 to 20 days post-pollination) for a period of six to 12 days followed by excision and direct culture of the embryo. Placement of the hybrid embryo directly onto culture medium without the interim ovule culture was unsuccessful. Ovule culture to germination without removing the embryo also was unsuccessful. Ovule-embryo culture was essential for recovering interspecific hybrids between diploid alfalfa (2n=2x=16) and the following diploid (2n=2x=16) species: M. hybrida Traut., M. marina L., M. papillosa Boiss., M. rhodopea Velen. and M. rupestris M.B. In addition, trispecies hybrids between M. sativa x M. dzhawakhetica Bordz. F1 hybrids (2n=3x=24) and either M. cancellata M.B. (2n=6x=48) or M. saxatilis M.B. (2n=6x=48) were obtained from ovuleembryo culture. Media manipulations using M. sativa x M. rupestris F1 and first backcross generation embryos demonstrated the optimum concentration of 12.5 mM NH4+ for successful embryo rescue; ammonium salt formulation (whether chloride, nitrate or sulfate) was not critical. From a few thousand crosses, hybrids between M. sativa and either M. rhodopea or M. rupestris were recovered relatively efficiently with 157 and 66 hybrids, respectively. However, only 13 hybrids between M. sativa and M. papillosa were obtained from more than 2,000 crosses, and just two hybrids each have been recovered from the combinations M. sativa x M. hybrida and M. sativa x M. marina from 2,000 to 3,000 crosses. The predominant chromosome number between diploid alfalfa and the other diploid perennial species was 2n=2x=16. Morphology of the hybrids was generally intermediate. Electrophoretic analysis of the F1 hybrids and parental clones on uniform or gradient polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that peroxidase phenotypes could be used to confirm hybridity. For all interspecific combinations there was at least one peroxidase isozyme unique to the wild species that was present in the F1 interspecific hybrid. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); Embryo culture; Embryorescue; Isozymes; Lucerne; Ovule culture; Peroxidase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3242839441

We reaffirm that the findings provide statistically significant data linking differences in the concentration with pollinator type. Flowers that are pollinated by animals that have alternative sources of protein-building a. a.'s show lower a. a. concentration than those that are not. There is a tendency for woody plant nectar a. a.'s to be less concentrated than those of herbaceous plants, but there can be ""phylogenetic constraints"" which may reduce the correlations of a. a. concentration with pollinator type and with life form. The individual a. a.'s form complements which are qualitatively extremely constant within species. Proline is a normal constituent of many nectars and does not necessarily indicate contamination of the nectar by pollen. Criticism of our findings by Gottsberger & al.

All previous postulates are borne out by these new data with the exception of positive correlations of a. a. concentration with ""primitive"" and ""advanced"" floral characteristics taken one at a time, which appear to be inconsistent and are affected strongly by the nature of the family in which they occur.

Thirty enzyme loci were assayed in 437 individuals representing 11 populations of H. spontaneum in Turkey. The results indicated that: (a)H. spontaneum in Turkey is genetically rich in allozyme variation, but because of predominant self-pollination the variation is maintained as different homozygotes in the population; (b) genetic differentiation of populations includes clinal, regional, and local patterns, sometimes displaying sharp geographic differentiation over short distances; (c) overall indices of allozymic diversity and some allele frequencies of wild barley are significantly correlated with the environment and are predictable ecologically, chiefly by combinations of temperature and humidity variables; (d) a high percentage of alleles (66%) occur in local areas or are distributed sporadically rather than widespread; (e) Wright Fixation index was very high, F=0.995; (f) genetic distance was high (D=0.11, ranging from 0.031 to 0.288) between populations, and (g) average relative genetic differentiation was high among populations (Gst=0.47, ranging from 0.02 to 0.66).

Br. on sunny days when the ambient temperature exceeded 20 °C. The flower buds on a raceme opened subsynchronously displaying the brightly-colored, actinomorphic perianth and exposed the contrastingly-colored, scented and ornamented column. In T. nuda the staminodes and the filament of the fertile stamen are fused to one another producing an inflated hood over the anther. This staminodal hood is terminated in two non-ornamental, but brightly-colored, central lobes and two terete lateral lobes bearing approximately 400 white trichomes. Each trichome bears a double chain of 30-40 spherical, rugulose cells. Female bees, in the genus Lasioglossum (Halictidae), were observed to land directly on the hood and curled their bodies around the four lobed tip of the staminodal complex. The bees attempted to forage on the lobes as if they were collecting pollen from fertile, poricidal stamens. These bees applied thoracic vibration to the yellowish central lobes and actively scraped the trichome clusters (Pseudopollen) with their forelegs. Bees carried the pollinaria of T. nuda dorsally on their abdomens. Abdominal contact with the rostellum appeared to occur when the female bee disengaged herself from the staminodal hood. Observations made of bees on co-blooming flowers, and analyses of pollen loads collected by bees suggested that the orchid flower mimics the guild of blue-purple flowers that lack floral nectar but offer pollen in poricidal anthers. The models of T. nuda are co-blooming Liliaceae in the genera Dichopogon and Thysanotus. However, nectarless, buzz-pollinated flowers are also extensively distributed over the orchid's range. More than 30% of the flowers in the T. nuda population had their pollinaria removed, suggesting a high capacity for cross-pollination in an orchid genus usually considered to be self-pollinated via mechanical autogamy. This study confirmed previous predictions that column modifications represented a trend towards pseudanthery. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Dichopogon; Halictidae; Lasioglossum; Liliaceae; Orchidaceae; pollinaria; staminodal hood; Syrphidae. - Mimesis; Thelymitra nuda; thoracic vibration; Thysanotus; trichome cluster. - Flora of Australia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000435254

Charnov et al. (1976) suggested that hermaphroditism would be favored over dioecy when reproduction through pollen and seed occurred at different times during a season or required different resources, because an hermaphrodite could make use of resources not available to an individual of a single sex. Here we use resource allocation models and the tools of mathematical game theory to explore these ideas explicitly. Model 1 considers a plant in which pollen and ovule production and pollination take place early in the reproductive season, followed by a period of seed and fruit maturation. We show that when differential timing of sex function translates into differences in the resource pools available to pollen and seed, hermaphroditism is indeed the optimal breeding system in that it is evolutionarily stable to invasion by individuals of a single sex. We determine the optimal allocation of resources to the two sex functions, and show that when seeds are costly relative to ovules the ratio of investment to male vs female functions will be female biased. This is often the case in plants. We discuss the importance of differential timing of sex functions in annuals and perennials. In Model 2, we show that if the constituents of pollen and seed differ in two (or more) limiting resources, hermaphroditism is again favored. To date, there is little evidence that pollen and seeds differ in their biochemical composition but few studies have addressed this point. © 1986 Academic Press Inc.

This observation has led evolutionary biologists to hypothesize that a plant's ability to attract pollinators may have its primary impact on male fitness achieved through the fertilization of ovules. This interpretation of angiosperm reproductive ecology is supported by field experiments. Pollinating insects strongly discriminated between two Mendelian petal-color morphs in Raphanus raphanistrum, a widespread, selfincompatible crucifer. In experimental populations composed of petal-color homozygotes, color discrimination by naturally occurring pollinators had no statistically significant effect on relative maternal function (fruit and seed production) in the two morphs. In contrast, yellow-flowered individuals were far more successful as fathers (pollen donors) than were the less visited whites.

The predominant pollinators of campanulas are: 1) Bombus diversus in Honshu, 2) Bombus ardens and halictid bees on Oshima Island, and 3) halictid bees on the islands of Niijima, Kodzushma, and Hachijo. The absence of bumble bees except B. ardens on Oshima Island, and the abundance of halictid bees represent a kind of island effect. Flowers of the campanula in the Islands were found to be smaller than those of the mainland. This might have resulted from adaptation to the small pollinators. Pollination experiments with plants grown from seeds revealed the following differences in breeding system: 1) most of the campanulas from Honshu were highly self?incompatible (SI) and a few partially self?compatible (SC), 2) one half of the plants from Oshima Island were more or less SC and the remaining highly SI, 3) those from Hachijo Island were SC and potentially autogamous. The breakdown of dichogamy co?operated with self?compatibility in the development of self?fertilizing ability in Hachijo plants.

Experiments comprised two kinds of treatments: spur shortening and bagging to restrict pollinator activity. Plants with a natural spur lengths range show nearly equal RS, whereas plants with shortened spurs had decreased RS proportional to spur length reduction. Pollinaria attachment (a measure of male RS) to the pollinators seems to demand stricter morphological correspondence than pollen receipt (female RS). Decrease of male and female RSs in spur?treatments was smaller in the case of high pollinator activity than low pollinator activity. Results of the bagging experiments indicated that female RS was greater than male RS in cases of high pollen carryover. These facts suggest that (1) fecundity selection operates more intensely on both male and female functions in the case of low pollinator activity and more intensely on the male function in the case of high pollen carryover, and (2) individuals with different spur lengths in natural populations have nearly equal probabilities of RS after excluding the extreme variants through the reduction of male RS.

Mass pollination was done on one single occasion before the general pollen dispersal. The results of isozyme analyses of seed after mass pollination demonstrate that it is possible to introduce desirable genes into the seed orchard crop. Mass pollination without isolation of female strobili gave an average contribution of 4% to the total fertilizations and after isolation of female strobili 26.5%. The main conclusion is that supplemental mass pollination offers very interesting possibilities for breeding, particularly if some kind of isolation of the female flowers is made. It can increase the seed quality as well as improve the breeding value of the seed orchard. More attention should be paid to increasing the efficiency of the controlled pollination. It is suggested that in the future, more effort is invested in improving the technique of mass pollination. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Isozymes; Pinus sylvestris; Pollination; Seed orchard,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-29144475896

One of these habitats, a well-maintained plantation, had irregular and broken shade cover (Erythrina trees in particular) while in the other habitat, a cocoa forest, cocoa trees were heavily shaded by Huara crepitans (Euphorbiaceae). Matina variety cocoa trees of about the same age (5060 years) were censused in both habitats. Cocoa-pollinating midge (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae and Cecidomyiidae) availability was estimated by sampling immature stages in experimentally-distributed ground-cover breeding substrates, comparing overall abundances and species numbers between the two habitats over three census dates (dry, mid-rainy, and late-rainy seasons), along with examination of fungal-rotted (diseased) cocoa pods both on trees and the ground. Although total flower production was much greater in the plantation habitat, total production of new pods was similar between habitats. Flowering followed a cyclic temporal pattern in the forest but not in the plantation. Sudden leaf drop of forest shade trees in the dry season probably triggered a cyclic response in which flowering peaked in the first half of the rainy season. There was an inverse relation for frequencies of mature cocoa pods killed by squirrels and pathogenic fungi (Monilia roreri and Phytophthora) between the two habitats: squirrel-killed pods were far more abundant in the plantation than in the forest, and the opposite for fungus-killed pods. Fungus-killed but otherwise intact pods, and not squirrel-killed pods rotting on trees, were a major breeding site for midges, particularly during the late rainy season. Ceratopogonidae were most abundant in the dry season and frequently encountered in cocoa pod husks and banana tree trunk sections in both habitats, and much more so in the forest habitat. The abandoned cocoa plantation (cocoa forest) supported a more diverse assemblage of pollinating midges than the plantation. In the plantation but not in the forest, a negative correlation was discovered between distance from shade trees and the numbers of pods on trees, suggesting greater pollinating activity by midges in cocoa trees beneath shade trees than away from them. The uniform dense shade cover in the adjacent forest probably obliterated such a pattern. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

Rolfe (Orchidaceae) and flower?visiting insects were observed in a marsh on the east coast of Madagascar. The plant acted by deceit. Two large sphecid wasp species, females of Sceliphron fuscum Klug and males of Sphex torridus Sm. (Hymenoptera, Sphecidae), made frequent visits to the showy, ca. 5 cm wide, nectarless and fragrant flowers. During a visit the wasps alighted on the large, hinged labellum which they depressed while forcing their heads towards the basal cavity below the column. When the wasps withdrew they pressed powerfully down on the labellum and brushed their heads backwards against the floral sexual organs removing the pollinarium with the frons or vertex  from which position pollination took place. The wasps on average visited only two flowers consecutively and about 55% of the flowers in the orchid population received visits. About six times more pollinaria were dispersed by pollen vectors than reached stigmas and a high proportion of the flowers were aborted due to lack of pollination. Data suggest that S. fuscum, a spider hunting and mud?daubing species, is a principal pollinator. C. flabellata is interpreted as playing the role of a generalized food?flower mimic which is specialized to moist habitats where females of S. fuscum collect mud for their nests.

These factors are frequently assumed rather than tested. In bagging experiments with Banksia paludosa in heath and B. spinulosa var. spinulosa in woodland, the present study demonstrated that seed?set does not occur by autogamy and that pollinators are indeed necessary. Experimental addition of outcrossed pollen to inflorescences failed to produce any increase in the mean number of seeds per inflorescence, measured for non?barren inflorescences, for either species. However, in B. paludosa, the addition of pollen increased the numbers of inflorescences that set seed from 20% (controls) to 45% (pollen?added treatment). This suggests either unusual patterns of pollen movement among and within plants or control of the pattern of seed?set within a plant. Pollen additions failed to alter seed?set in B. spinulosa.

In sunny lowland habitats, flowers of a second morph produce a two-component fragrance which facilitates pollination by fritillaries. In experiments, the two components separately had limited effect on alighting rate, while application of both together elevated the attractiveness of non-fragrant flowers to the same as for naturally fragrant flowers. In heavily shaded lowland habitats, a third morph with nonfragrant flowers does not blom until after I. textori, and is pollinated by occasional bumblebees.

Both species are pollinated by bumblebee workers, which run over the flowers pressing their bodies against them. Large syrphids act as copollinators. Extremely high pollen/ovule ratios are explained as optimal sex allocation in response to pollen?tolling by the pollen?collecting pollinators. Facultative geitonogamy in the self?compatible C. elata seems to be evolved in response to very low pollinator density in the habitat. Because of the pollinator behavior, geitonogamy virtyally always precedes xenogamy. C. rubifolia encounters higher pollinator visit frequency than C. elata, and self?incompatibility prevents selfing. Since it is nectarless, C. rubifolia is inferior in competion for bumblebees with most other entomogamous plants. It appears to have a commensalistic relationship with its constant associates, Impatiens pallida (Balsaminaceae) and/or Polymnia canadensis (Asteraceae), which attract large numbers of bumblebees. C. rubifolia is pollinated by bumblebees encountering them when scouting around the nectar?flower stand. This conclusion is based on: 1) Negative correlation for distance between nectar?flowers and Cimicifuga and the fruit set of the latter, 2) non?skewed flowering period, 3) extremely extended flowering on both the ramet and population levels, only limited by flowering period of nectar?flower associates and by pollinator abundance, and 4) fruit set rates independent of visual display size, and also of flower density in the habitat (i.e., the pollination rate was directly proportional to the density).

It is a common but neglected feature of outcrossing angiosperms. Dichogamy has been almost universally interpreted as an outcrossing mechanism, but many dichogamous species are also self-incompatible (and sometimes also herkogamous and/or with unisexual flowers). In outcrossing species, there is almost invariably a clash between selection to place pollen and stigmas in similar positions for effective pollination and selection to keep the androecia and gynoecia apart to avoid interference between them. We suggest that the separation of pollen and stigmas acts in general to reduce this self-interference and it often also reduces self-fertilisation. Mechanisms preventing self-fertilisation primarily increase maternal fitness, whereas mechanisms avoiding self-interference primarily promote paternal fitness. Five independent ways of subdividing dichogamy are recognised: protandry or protogyny; intrafloral or interfloral dichogamy; complete or incomplete dichogamy; various intervals between the successive presentations of pollen and stigmas; asynchronous, hemisynchronous, or synchronous dichogamy (the latter of several subtypes). In a sample of British species, protandry is almost twice as common as protogyny in biotically pollinated species but protogyny is six times as common as protandry in abiotically pollinated species. To obtain testable hypotheses of the selective forces responsible for dichogamy, four selective forces that influence whether pollen or stigmas are presented first are examined. (1) Effectiveness in avoiding self-fertilisation; (2) Selection for prolonged pollen presentation; (3) Optimal positions for dispatching and receiving pollen; (4) Interference between stamens and carpels, involved in seven different contexts: (a) The relative ease of moving androecia and gynoecia; (b) Vertical wind-pollinated inflorescences; (c) Vertical animal-pollinated inflorescences; (d) Refuge, trap, and brood blossoms; (e) One type of sporophyll facilitates the presentation of the other; (f) Stamen signals or rewards; (g) Post-presentation changes in flowers. The most important factor overall may be the relative ease of moving stamens and carpels after they have functioned. For many species there may be a combination of selective causes of the direction of dichogamy. Besides pollen-stigma interference, other types of interference (in which two activities obstruct each other because they have the same optima) and conflicts (in which two activities have divergent optima) occur in plants. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",British plants; Conflict; Dichogamy; Interference; New Zealand plants; Outcrossing; Pollination; Protandry; Protogyny; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950628492

Several classes of herkogamy are recognised; these are defined by whether all blossoms are identical (homomorphic herkogamy), all blossoms dispatch and receive pollen but reciprocal forms occur (reciprocal herkogamy), or some or all blossoms perform only one function (interfloral herkogamy). Within homomorphic herkogamy, unordered herkogamy, in which pollinator contacts with stigmas and pollen within a blossom are many and occur in no particular sequence, is distinguished from ordered herkogamy in which contacts are few and ordered. For ordered herkogamy further divisions are based on the operation of the pollination mechanism. Herkogamy is usually interpreted as a mechanism which reduces self-fertilisation and promotes outcrossing. However, as many herkogamous plants are also self-incompatible, it is suggested that the various classes of herkogamy also function in part or solely as mechanisms which avoid interference between pollen receipt by stigmas and pollen dispatch from anthers. Although for herkogamous blossoms these two functions are separated in space, many such flowers control pollinator behaviour so that both pollination surfaces are contacted during a single visit. In dichogamous blossoms separation of pollen dispatch and receipt is temporal rather than spatial and this difference has several important consequences for the pollination biology of dichogamous and herkogamous blossoms. © 1986 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Dichogamy; Enantiomorphy; Herkogamy; Heterostyly; Monoecism; Outcrossing; Pollenstigma interference; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950659596

Synchronous development among flowers on a single individual results in sequential phenotypic unisexuality: the entire plant alternates gender from day to day. Pistillate flowers produce more nectar than staminate flowers at comparable hours, but this difference does not result in different paterns of visitation to male and female flowers by hummingbird pollinators. Rare periods of bisexuality occur due to asynchronous floral development within or between inflorescences and are always followed by return to a synchronized pattern of alternation of gender. Reestablishment of synchrony usually involves a timeframe shift in the pattern of flowering (i.e., a plant produces staminate flowers on days when it previously would have been pistillate). It is suggested that timeframe shifts occur in response to inadequate pollination and serve to either desynchronize the plant from neighboring conspecifics or to temporarily allow self-pollination. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022825894

Each floret is protandrous, with pollen dispersal occurring during the first 4-8 h following initial presentation and significant esterase secretion by the stigma commencing after this phase has ended. Foraging by honeyeaters results in considerable pollen movement between florets on individual trees, although B. prionotes appears to be highly self-incompatible. Movement of honeyeaters and pollen between inflorescences on different trees occurs less frequently than between those on the same trees. Nevertheless, outcrossing leads to penetration of styles by tubes formed by pollen grains deposited in stigmatic grooves in some instances. Despite the small size and isolation of the population studied, the resultant level of follicle formation per infructescence, and percentage seed set, are greater than for most other Banksia species for which data are available. © 1986, CSIRO.

Four (0.05%) autotriploids were obtained only by pollinating the autotetraploid with the pollens of the diploid. As compared with the diploid, the autotriploid increased in stomata length, pollen diameter and length of unhulled and hulled seeds; decreased in number of panicles, pollen stainability, seed fertility and width, thickness and weight of hulled seed. The differences between them were conspicuous in stomata length, pollen diameter, seed fertility and seed weight.

They are: first, the need to absorb incident radiation; second, the combination of reflection properties and visual characteristics; and third, incidental colouration caused because a biochemical, which has been optimised by an organism, happens to be coloured. Pigments and structures have evolved in both plants and animals to optimise colouration. Many flowering plants have evolved in conjunction with different flying creatures to enable pollination to occur. There are only two principles in animal colouration: Either the animal does not want to be seen or he does want to be seen (or does not mind being seen). The mechanisms by which these aims can be achieved are varied. There are three dimensions to the visual impact, or total appearance, which one animal has upon another: They are colour, pattern, and behavioural display.

Each population was isolated and allowed to fertilise by open pollination. Seeds were collected individually from each OB or 2B plant. The number of B chromosomes in the offspring was analysed. The results showed that there was not a direct relationship between the frequencies at which each type of pollen was formed and the offspring obtained. On the contrary, the effectiveness in fertilisation by pollen with or without B chromosomes was mainly dependent on the frequencies of plants with and without B chromosomes in the population; that is, pollen carrying B chromosomes became relatively more advantageous when its frequency declined.

Using allozyme polymorphisms the frequency and pattern of outcrossing was determined. The genotypes of seeds from each of several fruit (legumes) per plant were analysed by starch gel electrophoresis, and the maternal genotype inferred. The maximum likelihood estimates of outcrossing rate for the chasmogamous flowers averaged 0.38. The observed level of heterozygosity in the adult population (h = 0.25) compared with the level expected under random mating (h = 0.32) indicated that partial outcrossing was typical of this population. To analyse the mating pattern further, the pollen genotypes of several seeds per legume for pairs of legumes from the same plant were determined. About 35% of fruit from chasmogamous flowers had no genetically detectable outcross progeny, presumably because they were not cross?pollinated effectively. The majority of the remaining fruit had seed which were of mixed origin (both self?fertilized and outcrossed), suggesting that insect pollination does not preclude self?fertilization. As might be expected from this entomophilous pollination system, the pollen of outcrossed seed within one fruit usually (85% of cross?pollinated legumes) came from one male source. Evidence of pollen carry?over was found in the other legumes. The joint distribution of male sources among the pairs of legumes (paired fruit analysis) showed that non?self sources were shared in 30% of pairs. The probability that two outcrossed seeds from the same fruit would be half?sibs was estimated as 0.15, and for two seeds from different fruit on the same plant as 0.42. There is a hierarchy of genetic identity within and among legumes on the same plant, and on different plants, providing scope for the operation of selection at different levels.

Plants of this strain contain 10-50 copies of the Mu element, whereas most maize strains and other plants have none. When Mutator plants are crossed to plants of the inbred line 1S2P, which does not have copies of Mu, the progeny plants have approximately the same number of Mu sequences as did their Mutator parent. Approximately one-half of these copies have segregated from their parent and one-half have arisen by transposition and are integrated into new positions in the genome. This maintenance of copy number can be accounted for by an extremely high rate of transposition of the Mu elements (10-15 transpositions per gamete per generation). When Mutator plants are self-pollinated, the progeny double their Mu copy number in the first generation, but maintain a constant number of Mu sequences with subsequent self-pollinations. Transposition of Mu and the events that lead to copy number maintenance occur very late in the development of the germ cells but before fertilization. A larger version of the Mu element transposes but is not necessary for transposition of the Mu sequences. The progeny of crosses with a Mutator plant occasionally lack Mutator activity; these strains retain copies of the Mu element, but these elements no longer transpose.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022568521

Thus, chloroplasts and mitochondria are transmitted together, maternally, irrespective of if the plants are self- or cross-pollinated. Transfer of heritable traits by conventional genetic manipulation, as practiced for nuclear genes, is therefore not applicable to organelle genes. To facilitate the construction of a plant having in its cells a given nuclear genome but chloroplast and/or mitochondria from another plant, a donor-recipient fusion should be performed. The cybrid plants, derived from such a fusion, should result from a Recipient protoplast where the original functional nucleus is retained, but either one or both of the cytoplasmic organellesthat is, chloroplasts and mitochondriais exchanged by organelles from a Donor plant. © 1986, Elsevier Inc.

This was done because of our dissatisfaction with a histamine placebo used in a previous pilot study. Symptom medication scores (SMS) and immunologic parameters were followed. For the 4-year period, grass-pollen count (GPC) correlated strongly with asthma emergency room visits (r = 0.90; p < 0.001) and for rhinitis (r = 0.92; p < 0.001). Asthma admissions also correlated strongly with GPC (r = 0.72; p < 0.001). Other aeroallergens either did not correlate significantly or occurred in such small numbers that they could not be seriously considered. Rotorod counts supported these conclusions with the exceptions of some Basidiomycetes. Climatologic factors demonstrated no relationship to the incidence of asthma. Asthma SMS were lower in the grass-treated group, p < 0.05. Rhinitis SMS were also lower but did not reach significance, p = 0.11. RGGI sIgE did not rise significantly in the grass-treated group but did in the placebo-treated group. RGGI sIgG rose in both groups, although to significantly higher levels in the grass-treated group, p < 0.001. The asthma SMS were inversely related to increasing RGGI cumulative dose, p < 0.10. Linear regression analysis of the dose-response scattergram suggests that a cumulative dose of approximately 90 ?g of RGGI may be desirable. At the end of the study, eight of nine of the grass-treated and seven of nine of the placebo-treated subjects believed they were treated with grass extract. In summary, we have presented evidence that grass pollen causes a significant yearly outbreak of allergic asthma in northern California. We have also presented evidence that this asthma can be effectively treated with immunotherapy with a standardized, potent grass-pollen extract in carefully selected patients. © 1986.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022972674

Morphogenesis of the maize embryo includes formation of the shoot apical merlstem and several leaf primordia. This study presents developmental profiles of two embryo-lethal maize mutants that are blocked prior to the formation of leaf primordia: dek22 on chromosome 1L and dek23 on chromosome 2L. Mutant embryos were examined at intervals from 4 days after pollination (dap) to kernel maturity. Embryos of dek22 were retarded in development from 8 dap onward, and reached the transition stage by 16 dap, when normal embryos had reached stage 2 to 3. Subsequently, mutant embryos appeared healthy and morphologically normal, but remained blocked at the transition stage and underwent no further development or growth. Mutant embryo phenotype was markedly uniform with regard to both size and stage of development. Development of dek23 embryos was normal through the transition stage (8 dap). By 12 dap, when normal embryos were at stage 1, mutant embryos were at a morphologically abnormal coleoptilar stage. Mutant embryos continued to enlarge and formed a root apical meristem but never developed a shoot apex. They varied in size but were otherwise uniform in phenotype. During early kernel development localized necrosis appeared at the site where a shoot apex would normally occur and subsequently spread throughout the embryo. A slow growing scutellar callus was produced by 9 of 12 embryos cultured at 16 dap; older embryos failed to respond in culture. The differences in their developmental profiles and arrest phenotypes suggest that these two mutants represent genes controlling very different developmental processes that are essential for normal embryogenesis. © 1986, American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006071731

An attempt was made here to assess the importance of this factor in the evolution of the self-fertile homostyle morph in Somerset populations of P. vulgaris by a comparison of the relative fertilities of homostyle and outcrossing (pin and thrum) morphs. Several indices of fertility indicated that at some populations in some seasons homostyles were significantly more seed fertile than the pins and thrums. This trend in relative fertility made it clear that reproductive assurance could have had a profound effect on the evolution of self-fertilisation in this species. The proximate cause of variation in relative fertility was shown to be variation in pollinator service due to differences in rainfall between seasons. Factors such as sexual resource reallocation, reproductive economy, and inbreeding depression were not shown to have a significant effect on the relative fertility of the self-fertilising and outcrossing morphs. © 1986 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966169267

In mixed-species stands, foragers on species with short corollas have shorter proboscides than conspecific foragers on species with long corollas. However, proboscis lengths of foragers on species with a long corolla in single-species stands did not differ from those on species with a short corolla in single-species stands. Thus, where a choice exists, bumble bee foragers select the species having a corolla most compatible to their proboscis length. Conspecific foragers on a single flower species were compared in one-species versus mixed-species stands. For foragers on flowering species with a short corolla, proboscis length was significantly shorter in the mixed-species than in the single-species stand, but this difference was not found for the species with a long corolla. Thus, presence of other flowering species can influence the pollinator population of a species, relative to a single-species stand. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022857084

After pollination kernel capacity for soluble protein synthesis is located mainly in the endosperm. This progressively decreases and about 40 days after pollination soluble protein synthesis is taken over by the embryo. Comparative data on the activity of the investigated enzymes in the embryo and endosperm indicate that the capacity for synthesis of glutamine and glutamate predominates in the embryo tissue, whereas transamination processes at the initial stages of the embryo development are less intensive than their counterparts in the endosperm.

Although there is considerable variability in the size and distribution of somatic sectors induced at a given time in embryogenesis, the fate of meristematic initials is not entirely random. During embryogenesis the number of cells in the presumptive shoot meristem increases and their fate becomes progressively more restricted. Cells toward the periphery of the presumptive meristem give rise to the lower nodes of the plant, while central cells form more distal nodes. Cell lineages become restricted to single nodes starting at the base of the plant, indicating that restriction of cell fate progresses from the periphery towards the center of the meristem. The number of twin shoots produced by X irradiation declines dramatically between 8 and 10 days after pollination, and is preceded by an acropetal progression in the level at which twinning occurs. This phenomenon suggests that the shoot meristem becomes determined gradually and that this process is completed between 8 and 10 days after pollination; i.e., just prior to or during the transition stage of development. At this stage the shoot primordium consists of 100-200 cells encompassing two or more cell layers of the embryo. The orientation of sectors that saddle the shoot (extend from one side of the shoot to the other) demonstrates that the shoot meristem arises from a region of the embryo containing longitudinally oriented cell files and that this cell pattern is at least partially preserved during shoot initation. © 1986.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000923946

Shortly after anthesis, lipids, mainly phospho? and glyco?lipids, were a small proportion of the mesocarp.

Approximately 97% of the lipid at maturity was neutral lipid, essentially triacylglycerol. Maximum oil quantity was obtained at 22 weeks after anthesis. The active lipid accumulation period was from weeks 18 to 22 after pollination. Contrary to previously published data, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids were characteristically present at all stages of oil accumulation.

From their earliest Cretaceous appearance, and well into the Late Cretaceous, angiosperms were most abundant and diverse in coastal and fluvial depositional environments, conifers remaining dominant in well drained and inland soils. Extensive dispersal of pioneering, coastal angiosperms occurred at a time of extensive sea-level fluctuation and went hand in hand with their mid-Cretaceous diversification. The early successes of invading angiosperms can most easily be attributed to their ability to colonise disturbed sedimentary surfaces.

Between 25 and 50% of the florets in capitula are female, and flowering gender varies little among plants in each population. Fruiting gender of individuals, G (femaleness), varies from 0 to 0.85, because of variation in fruit set and fruit abortion. Variation in fruiting gender was correlated with plant size parameters in two populations, but not in the third. The data suggest that post?anthesis regulation of maternal investment may be operating. Florets of A. vulgaris are either totally specialized for pollen receipt (female florets) or largely specialized for pollen donation (hermaphrodite florets), and show adaptations for avoiding interference with each other in these functions.

Plants were artificially inoculated and the incidence of disease (DI) was assessed on the plant as a whole and at particular loci (ears, axillary buds above and below the ears, tassels and leaves). A disease severity rating (DSR) was developed based on the mass of galls at various loci relative to plant mass. Of the 86 hybrids and inbreds tested, inbred 25, with a high DI overall and severe disease at all infection loci, was the only variety found highly susceptible to disease. Nevertheless, significant (P < 0.05) differences in susceptibility were detected among other hybrids and inbreds. Thirty-six of the major hybrid varieties were classified by cluster analysis into those with low overall DI (20 hybrids averaging 1.4%), moderate DI (12 hybrids, 5.0%) or high DI (4 hybrids, 9.8%). Hybrids with high DI included GH128, GH390, QK694 and Hycorn 1. Two DSR classes were apparent, high (11.0) and low (6.1). No hybrid had both high DI and high DSR. The hybrids General and PX75 had moderate DI and high DSR, while 9 hybrids had high DSR with low DI. Insufficient data were available for a similar classification of the remaining 26 hybrids. Hybrid E368 had a high DI. Among 13 inbred lines, 12 occurred in a low DI class (average 2.3%) and one in a high DI class (A691N, 14.6%). Only one low DSR class was apparent. Insufficient data were available for a similar classification of the remaining I I inbreds, but GN7, HBc and 25 had high DI, while Y 1 had virtually no disease.

No positive correlation could be found between husk cover of mature ears and boil smut incidence in the ears.

These two characters were negatively correlated and a trade?off relationship occurred under the constant total seed yield (=O×F×I×SR×SW). Ovule number per ovary was highly correlated with spur length of the flower. During the course of the hybrid speciation of E. trifoliatobinatum, selection pressure by pollinators on intermediate spur length seems to have favored plants with an intermediate ovule number. On the other hand, this selection pressure counteracted the increase of the inflorescence number under the trade?off. The resultant seed yield of E. trifoliatobinatum did not differ from that of the parental species, but the pattern of ovule allocation to ovaries (capsules) was altered.

The plant samples were collected in two different habitats on the Karst plateau North of Trieste (North Eastern Italy). The analysis was performed by capillary GC. Differences between samples from the two habitats have been found in the quantitative composition of the oils. The plants coming from the optimal, xeric habitat produce oils in which aromatic terpenes (mostly carvacrol) are more abundant, whereas the oils of plants growing in shady and moist sites are mostly composed by acyclic compounds (chiefly geraniol). It seems therefore possible to distinguish two chemical variants of Euphorbia fragifera. The number and kind of pollinating insects have been recorded. Terpenoids from the two kinds of essential oil could be responsible of two different pheromones that attract different kinds of pollinators. © 1986, Academia.

Russia (Compositae) grown under varying densities and soil nitrogen levels. The role and behaviour of pollinators in seed production was also examined. Exceedingly marked plastic responses were detected in individual biomass, the patterns of resource allocation to total reproductive structures (RA) and also to propagules, fecundity, reproductive outputs, and propagule size and weight under changing densities and soil nitrogen levels. Plants cultivated at higher densities exhibited proportionately lower individual biomass, lower RA, lower fecundity, lower seed output, and smaller seed size in response to increasing density and decreasing soil nitrogen levels. However, differences due to different N?levels were not as great as those to changing density. One of the most significant findings was that seed production under limited resource availability, i.e., lack of ample solar radiation and soil nutrients, due to strong interference at higher density plots, is exceedingly costlty, This was most clearly demonstrated by a very sharp increase in relative energy partitioning to a single propagule in response to the increased density and decreasing nitrogen levels, the relative energy cost to a single achcne (RA) increasing from one to twenty?fourfold. Reproduction was also affected by pollinator?limitations, and seed size showed a marked position effect. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

Male flowers forcibly attach a large pollinarium onto euglossine bees. Euglossa bees leave the male flower in response to pollinarium emplacement by Catasetum ochraceum and subsequently avoid male but not female flowers. This evidence suggests that sexual dimorphism promotes pollination. The aversion of the bee to pollinarium attachment and its avoidance of male flowers thereafter apparently reflect competition among male flowers that probably evolved concurrently with sexual dimorphism. Among Catasetum species, the extent of dimorphism is correlated with the degree of apparent aversion caused by the male flower (weight of the pollinarium).

Plants were collected, one per 400 square metres, over a seven hectare area and crossed as males to MSI plants of known genotypes. Progeny analysis of these crosses and the raising of seed samples, collected from open-pollinated male steriles and hermaphrodites, allowed estimation of the frequencies of nuclear and cytoplasmic male sterility genes. Averaged over the area examined, the recessive and dominant MSI nuclear genes occurred in frequencies of 0.98 and 0.92 respectively, while the frequency of sterile cytoplasm R was only 0.06. Locally, in and near the MSI spots, cytoplasm R frequency was higher than average, up to 0.39, and the frequency of the nuclear sterility alleles significantly lower. The MSI spots probably originated because of both the migration of cytoplasm R individuals into the population and a very low seed dispersal rate. The average as well as the local frequencies of nuclear and cytoplasmic genes can be explained by fitness differences between genotypes, that are associated with the evolutionary conflict between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966166288

Numbers of pollen grains deposited by bumble bees on the stigmata of E. americanum vary greatly from flower to flower. Time spent by a bee on a flower is positively related to nectar concentration and volume. Flowers with large volumes of nectar receive more pollen grains per visit, presumably because visits are longer. Most deposition of grains from a particular donor flower occurs on the first several recipient flowers subsequently visited by the bee, but a few grains travel much farther. Pollen carryover in E. grandiflorum is reduced by bee grooming. The negative effect of grooming on carryover is increased when the recipient flowers have undehisced anthers.

Fluorescent dyes were used to track flowers visited by individual pollinators. Mean distance of pollen dispersal was significantly higher by males than by female Heliconius. Butterflies dispersed pollen greater distances than did hummingbirds. There were no significant differences in dispersal distance among species of Heliconius. The number of flowers or plants to which dye was dispersed was greater for Heliconius than for hummingbirds. The home range behavior and site specificity exhibited by Heliconius, together with the preference by most Heliconius species in the study site for Psiguria led us to examine the relationship between the butterflies' home range and its daily foraging among Psiguria. A Heliconius mark-recapture program was conducted simultaneously with the dye program. This study showed that individual butterflies, for which extensive recaptures were made, visited an area of Psiguria plants on any one day that corresponded to the area in which those butterflies were caught or observed. The area over which a butterfly moved was termed its home range; within home ranges relative movement by butterflies was estimated as the mean distance between sequential captures.

Of 24 hybrids tested under uniform fertile, irrigated conditions, only two achieved high yields without honey bees. Three were self fertile in terms of seed numbers. Seven achieved self fertility in terms of seed yield due to artifact effects (e.g. compensatory seed growth), and of these only three were high-yielding and satisfactory agronomically. A good seed set of 80% or more in terms of seed number needs to be supported by an artifact ratio (AR) for self fertility (% by weight divided by % by number) of between 1.25 and 1.30 to ensure 100% self fertility in terms of seed yield. For Sunfola 68.2, the open-pollinated cultivar, and for most of the 23 hybrid cultivars examined, a significant positive response in seed set was obtained due to the presence of honey bees. For exclusion of insects tulle net bags were greatly superior to paper bags, and for trials on farmers' properties bags were much easier to use than cages. Pollination due to wind and insects smaller than honey bees did not exceed 9%, confirming that wind was of neglegible importance, and that the honey bee was the principal insect pollinator.

Relative quality of stalks, as measured by nectar per flower, was not correlated with either plant height or number of flowers, so birds could not use this information in choosing which plants to visit. Nectar volumes were not autocorrelated among flowers within a stalk so foraging birds could not predict volumes in nearby flowers on the same plant. Birds visiting stalks of different quality visited different numbers of flowers before they left. Foraging birds left most stalks before visiting all flowers, some after visiting only = or <5 flowers on stalks that had = or >10 flowers. Volumes in flowers remaining on stalks the birds left after probing only a few flowers had similar averages, but lower medians than stalks on which more flowers were visited. The primary cue for early departures from a stalk seems to be probing an empty flower(s). Stalks with higher average volumes had fewer empty flowers; empty flowers were not clustered vertically on a stalk. Interactions among inflorescence architecture, patterns of nectar production, and pollinator behavior influence the information available to make decisions about when to leave an inflorescence.

This change from development to germination elicited by premature desiccation is also mirrored by a change, upon subsequent rehydration, in the pattern of soluble protein synthesis within the endosperm storage tissue. Following rehydration of prematurely dried 30 or 40 DAP seeds, soluble proteins characteristic of development cease to be synthesized after 5 h of imbibition, and those uniquely associated with germination and growth are then produced. A pattern of soluble storage protein breakdown comparable to that found in endosperms from mature seeds following imbibition is also observed. In contrast, hydration of 40 DAP seeds immediately following detachment from the mother plant results in a continuation of the developmental pattern of protein synthesis. Premature desiccation at 40 DAP elicits the production within the endosperm of enzymes involved in protein reserve breakdown (leucyl ?-naphthylamidase; LeuNAase) and lipid utilization (isocitrate lyase; ICL) to levels comparable to those observed in mature-hydrated endosperms. It is proposed that drying plays a role in redirecting metabolism from a developmental to a germinative mode; it also appears to be a prerequisite for the induction of hydrolytic enzymes essential to the post-germinative (growth) phase of seedling development. © 1985 Oxford University Press.",Castor bean; Desiccation-tolerance; Germinability; Seed development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956982669

Hale (castor bean) removed from the capsule at 30 or 40 days after pollination (DAP) can be induced to germinate by being subjected to drying. This desiccation-induced switch from development to germination is mirrored by a change, upon subsequent rehydration, in the pattern of insoluble protein synthesis within the endosperm storage tissue. During normal development from 25-40 DAP there is rapid synthesis of the insoluble (11S) crystalloid storage protein. At later stages of development (45 and 50 DAP), crystalloid protein synthesis declines markedly and synthesis of new insoluble proteins commences. Following premature drying at 30 or 40 DAP, the pattern of insoluble protein synthesis upon rehydration is virtually identical to that following imbibition of the mature seed. Proteins synthesized during normal late development (at 45 and 50 DAP) are produced up to 48 h after imbibition; a subsequent change in the pattern of insoluble protein synthesis occurs between 48 and 72 h. Thus, in contrast to the rapid switch in the pattern of soluble protein synthesis induced by drying, insoluble protein syntheses within the endosperm are redirected towards those uniquely associated with a germination/growth programme only after a considerable delay following mature seed imbibition, or following rehydration of the prematurely dried seed. Nevertheless, these results support our contention that drying plays a role in the suppression of the developmental metabolic programme and in the permanent induction of a germination/growth programme. © 1985 Oxford University Press.",Castor bean; Crystalloid storage proteins; Desiccation; Seed development; Seed germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345624219

The orchard is family structured, consisting several grafts (clones) and/or open-pollinated (o-p) progeny from each of several 'plus-trees'. Population-wide selfing rates were found to be 7% for the o-p trees and 2% for the cloned trees. Estimates of mating system parameters for individual trees showed this difference for average outcrossing rate t (1) still largely remained when outcrossingpollen gene frequency p was not allowed to vary among trees and (2) disappeared when p was allowed to vary among trees. Under this joint t and p estimation, o-p trees showed both significant variation of t (based upon a one-way ANOVA grouped by common plus-tree) and significant regressions of p on ovule genotype (indicative of consanguineous matings); cloned trees showed neither. This higher rate of consanguineous mating for o-p trees might be explained by the larger and more variable size of o-p families in the orchard. Estimates of outcrossing rate t and outcrossingpollen gene frequency p were based upon a multilocus model which makes full use of the information in the data. The increased information it gives over 'observed outcross' models is equivalent to adding 30-50% more loci, and it gives enough degrees of freedom to jointly estimate t and p for individual trees (individual progeny arrays) under certain conditions. In addition, inclusion of megagametophyte data nearly doubles the information about the mating system of individual trees. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",Douglas fir; Inbreeding; Outcrossing; Seed orchard,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000044767

Female remets have fewer flowers per inflorescence, initiate flowering earlier, and reach peak flowering before male ramets. The consequences of the asynchrony in flowering between the sexes on pollination and seed set were examined during a two-year study. In both years there was significant variation in seed set associated with the flowering times of individual female ramets. In 1983, seed production was highest in the middle of the flowering season. In 1984, seed production was greatest in the later stages of flowering. Variation in seed set was not attributed to lack of pollination in 1983. In 1984, pollination limited seed set per flower during peak flowering. However, seed production never reached the potential five seeds per flower, suggesting that resource limitation was the most important factor affecting fecundity in both years.

The morphological characteristics and chemical (the dry matter, lipid and carbohydrate) contents of the exocarp and seeds were determined. The results showed that the seed length, circumference and volume were optimal at 24 months after pollination which indicates that Raphia seeds attained maximum size at that period. The seed endosperm was liquid or semi-liquid between 6-18 months after pollination but became solid with a prominent embryo at 24 months. The seed dry matter was low at the early stages of development but there was a rapid increase in seed dry weight at 18-33 months after pollination. The seeds were physiologically matured at 30-33 months after pollination, while the exocarp matured at 24-30 months after pollination.The Raphia seeds were low in lipid (about 2%) compared to the exocarp which had 30-40% lipid at full maturity. Maximum amount of lipid was accumulated within the exocarp at 36-42 months after pollination and this period indicates the time for harvesting Raphia fruits for maximum oil which is probably the most economic part of the fruit.The total sugar concentration increased in the exocarp with increase in maturity. Conversely the concentration of sugars decreased within the seeds as the fruit matured.

Red, tubular flowers are common among bird-pollinated plants, and the tubular flowers of F. excorticata change colour from green to red. The purpose of the present study was to describe the timing of the colour change, dropping of the floral tube, and nectar production of F. excorticata and to determine how bellbirds (Anthornis melanura) and two introduced species of nectar robbers (Zosterops lateralis and Bombus sp.) respond to the different colour phases.Floral tubes fell off about 11 days after anthesis in both sexes, with colour change occurring on about Day-4 for female trees and on about Day-5 for hermaphrodite trees. Green-phase hermaphrodite flowers produced significantly more nec- tar/day than did green-phase female flowers, while red-phase flowers did not produce nectar in either sex. All three floral visitors studied preferentially visited green-phase flowers and virtually ignored the nectarless flowers in the red phase. These results contrast with the general association between red, bird-pollinated flowers and the presence of a nectar reward. We suggest that the non-migratory habit of the New Zealand honeyeaters and the lack of native insect visitors to this species may account for this anomalous green-to-red colour change. © 1985 Crown copyright.",Bellbirds; Bumblebees; Coevolution; Colour change; Colour phase; Foraging; Fuchsia excorticata; Nectar; Pollination; Silvereyes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022165032

Ingleside Ave., Chicago, 60637, IL, United States","The purpose of this study was to simultaneously measure pollen dispersal distance and actual pollen-mediated gene-flow distance in a wind-pollinated herb, Plantago lanceolata. The pollen dispersal distribution, measured as pollen deposition in a wind tunnel, is leptokurtic, as expected from previous studies of wind-pollinated plants. Gene-flow, measured as seeds produced on rows of male-sterile inflorescences in the wind tunnel, is non-leptokurtic, peaking at an intermediate distance. The difference between the two distributions results from the tendency of the pollen grains to cluster. These pollen clusters are the units of gene dispersal, with clusters of intermediate and large size contributing disproportionately to gene-flow. Since many wind-pollinated species show pollen clustering (see text), the common assumption for wind-pollinated plants that gene-flow is leptokurtic requires re-examination. Gene-flow was also measured in an artifical outdoor population of male-steriles, containing a single pollen source plant in the center of the array. The gene flow distribution is significantly platykurtic, and has the same general properties outdoors, where wind speed and turbulence are uncontrolled, as it does in the wind tunnel. I estimated genetic neighborhood size based on my measure of gene-flow in the outdoor population. The estimate shows that populations of Plantago lanceolata will vary in effective number from a few tens of plants to more than five hundred plants, depending on the density of the population in question. Thus, the measured pollen-mediated gene-flow distribution and population density will interact to produce effective population sizes ranging from those in which there is no random genetic drift to those in which random genetic drift plays an important role in determining gene frequencies within and among populations. Despite the platykurtosis in the distribution, pollen-mediated gene dispersal distances are still quite limited, and considerable within and among-population genetic differentiation is to be expected in this species. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022192960

The application of water to the stigmas after pollination also resulted in a marked reduction in pollen germination and tube penetration. An increase in the time intervals between the application of pollen onto the stigma and the water treatment progressively reduced this inhibition. Pollen germination was also completely inhibited when stigmas from freshly-opened flowers of SI B. campestris and B. oleracea genotypes were washed in water, dried and pollinated with pollen grains of either compatibility. The ability of stigmas to induce pollen germination and tube growth was restored over a period, the length of which was dependent on the incompatibility (S) genotype. Stigmas of B. napus (SC) and SC mutants of SI B. campestris were found to be affected by washing, but stigmas of a SC variety of B. campestris and the immature stigmas from buds of B. oleracea were found to be considerably less affected. Microscopic examination of pollen placed on washed stigmas reveals that grains, irrespective of their compatibility, fail to hydrate normally. When induced to hydrate by raising atmospheric humidity, pollen grains on washed stigmas did germinate, but most of the tubes failed to penetrate the papillar wall and very few entered the style. It is proposed that the water treatment mobilises components of the pellicle which reorganize to block the activity of molecules, present in both SC and SI individuals, responsible for establishing full contact between the pellicle and pollen grain coating. © 1985 Annals of Botany Company.",Brassica; Pellicle; Pollen; Recognition; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342784998

The classification of Salomonsen (1967) allows 38 genera and 170 species in the former region, and one genus with two species in the latter. Australia and New Guinea jointly have 23 genera and 108 species, and constitute the centre of diversity of the group. Endemic genera are concentrated in Australia and New Guinea, and around the periphery of the Pacific part of the range (Sulawesi, Bonins, Marianas, Hawaii, New Zealand). The meliphagids are diversified in body size and bill form. They are basically nectarivores and insectivores, with most species combining the two roles to varying degrees. There is a good general correlation between bill form and way of life. A few species feed on trunks and aerial flycatching is well developed in many. Morphological modification is only minor in these instances and the meliphagids as a group remain rather generalised in bodily proportions. A long period of coevolution with Australian plant elements is shown by meliphagids being the major pollinators of several tree and shrub generaThe group combines monotypic genera with restricted ranges and wide-ranging genera with many species. Of the latter; Myzomela, Lichema, and Philemon are centred in the tropics, and Meli- phaga and Phylidonyris in Australia. Most of these co-occur over a wide area, this being favoured by differences in body size and bill morphology.Comparison of three kinds of meliphagid communities, two typical continental ones, two of isolated forest outlyers in Australia, and six insular Pacific ones, shows the first to be rich (10 and 11 genera, 21 and 17 species), and the second impoverished (6 and 7 genera, 9 and 12 species).

Significant altitudinal decreases in the mean no. visits/flower/minute and per day were recorded, with Level III flowers, on the average, being pollinated only about 1/2 as frequently and to as low as 1/4 as frequently in certain months, as Level I flowers. Visitation rates are generally highest in early and mid-summer at all altitudes. - The lower visitation rates at the higher elevations are due to lower insect abundance relative to plant resources and lower levels of activity for the insects present, stemming from the generally lower ambient temperatures. Seasonal differences in visitation rates may also be related to differences in insect abundance levels. The total probability of ovule pollination cannot be estimated directly from the pollination rates, because stigmas are probably receptive for longer periods at the higher elevations. When differences in the duration of stigma receptivity are estimated from differences in flower lifelength, the probability of pollination in Level III is not very different from that expected in Level I. However, for some months, the deficit in Level III may still be substantial. - These results underline the inherent dangers of predicting pollination possibilities directly from pollination rates.

However, reported associations of dioecy with pollination, dispersal and growth form traits have not distinguished the effects of each trait separately, controlling for the others. Because these traits are associated among themselves, existing analyses may involve spurious or indirect correlations. This paper reports the incidence of dioecy in a subarctic and an arctic flora, and analyzes the occurrence of dioecy among vascular plants classified jointly by growth form, floral (pollination) syndrome, and fruit (dispersal) syndrome. Dioecism is no more frequent in the arctic flora as a whole, but its incidence increases northward among woody plants. This increase is associated with an increase in the proportion of woody species having small, inconspicuous flowers, and not with the syndrome of fleshy or animal dispersed fruits. Within the floras of Alaska, California, and the Northeastern US, dioecy is markedly more frequent among woody plants and among plants having small, inconspicuous flowers, and that is the only strong statistical association of dioecy for the species of these floras. When genera and families are analyzed similarly, dioecy is also associated significantly with dispersal syndrome. Thus, among angiosperms, evidence currently does not support either an uniquely strong or exclusive association of dioecy with dispersal traits, as it does for gymnosperms (Givnish 1980). It is extremely desirable to analyze the occurrence of dioecy among taxa classified jointly by all relevant ecological traits, rather than analyzing marginal distributions. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022174204

Mean seed-set is increased. Individuals of the self-compatible race produce less vegetative growth and require a shorter time to reach reproductive maturity under cultivation. Increased fecundity appears to provide the selective advantage promoting the breakdown of self-incompatibility in this species.

This weak self-compatibility and a positive relation between the percentage of seeds set by outcrossed plants and the distance between pollen donor and recipient plants indicate that this population could be susceptible to inbreeding depression. Limited resources for seed development apparently constrained maximal seed production, based on low seed set (40.6%) by hand-pollinated plants and positive correlations for these plants between plant size and the number and size of seeds set. In contrast, naturally-pollinated plants set a smaller proportion of their ovules, suggesting that limited pollinator service reduced the quantity of seeds produced in this population. Free-foraging bees usually removed more than half of the available pollen in a single visit, so that individual plants probably have few opportunities to disseminate their pollen. Even though sexually reproductive ramets produce only a single flower per year, less than a third of variation in floral morphology is associated with variation in plant size. Within the flower, the sizes of some closely associated structures, such as the style and ovary, and the anthers and filaments, vary essentially independently of one another. Production of nectar and pollen, the ultimate attractors of pollinating insects, was positively correlated with flower size. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022208581

Previous studies showed that bumblebees and hummingbirds discriminate against albinos when presented with mixtures of the 2 morphs, and that it takes these pollinators longer to fly between successive flowers on albino than on blue-flowered inflorescences. To explore the link between these observations, we measured pollinator preferences and flower-to-flower flight times (""handling times"") before and after painting flowers in 2 alternative ways that enhanced albino nectar guides. In all of 16 experimental replicates discrimination against albinos was reduced or eliminated after painting, and albino handling times declined toward values for blue-flowered inflorescences. This consistent result indicates that an inferior nectar guide increases the energetic cost of foraging at albinos. Increased cost in turn explains discrimination, under the reasonable assumption that hummingbirds and bumblebees are sensitive to foraging economics. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022235861

This trend contrasts with natural plant populations in which most allozyme variation resides within, rather than among, populations. The difference may be an artifact of the extreme inbreeding techniques used to develop and propagate these crops, rather than a consequence of domestication per se. To test this hypothesis, we compared the population genetic structure of 24 lines of radish cultivars - a domesticated species developed and maintained as open-pollinated, outcrossed populations - with four wild radish populations in California. Although the wild populations displayed more overall allozyme variation than the cultivars, most of the allozyme variation in the cultivars remains partitioned within, rather than among, lines. Apparently, how a crop is developed and maintained can have a profound influence on the organization of genetic variation of that species. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding methods; Isozymes; Polymorphism; Radish; Raphanus sativus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001498134

(Pontederiaceae), a perennial diploid, possesses the rare genetic polymorphism tristyly. A controlled pollination programme was conducted over a three year period, under glasshouse conditions, on 36 clones of P. cordata var. cordata to examine the nature of the self-incompatibility system. The three major findings of the pollination study were: (1) the three floral morphs display different levels of self-incompatibility, (2) pollen from the two anther levels within a flower exhibits different compatibility behaviour in self-pollinations, (3) considerable individual genetic variation in the expression of self-incompatibility is evident among clones within floral morphs. Similar results were also obtained from a smaller study on 15 clones of P. cordata var. lancifolia conducted over a 6 month period. In common with other Pontederia species the mid-styled morph (M) of P. cordata produces large amounts of seed when self-pollinated with pollen from long-level anthers. A developmental model is proposed to explain the high level of self-compatibility of the M morph in Pontederia species. Self-pollination of segregating progenies from M and S morphs of known incompatibility status demonstrated that the expression of incompatibility is closely associated with style length. It is suggested that overall differences in incompatibility behaviour among the floral morphs may be due to the pleiotropic effects of major genes controlling sub-characters of the tristylous syndrome, rather than linked modifier genes. However, the variable expression of trimorphic incompatibility within floral morphs suggests that this variation may be polygenic in origin. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",Pontederia cordata L.; Trimorphic incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008913728

A simple and rapid procedure is described for overcoming this difficulty by pollinating the basal parts of the stigmas without removing the ensheathing bracts (""husks""). The method maintains high humidity in the vicinity of the ovaries, and by conserving photosynthetic tissues probably also ensures a more normal O2 /CO2 balance in the neighbourhood of the stigmas than do bagging procedures. It is shown that Sorghum pollen tubes readily reach the ovary after pollination by the method. Their presence induces some of the characteristic post-pollination effects caused by Zea pollen tubes, but they frequently also stimulate premature enlargement of the nucellus and lysis of nucellar cells. Although Sorghum tubes have been traced across the inner ovary wall, they have not been seen to enter the micropyle, and hybrid embryos have not yet been obtained. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",Pollination technique; Post-pollination effects; Sorghum bicolor; Wide crossing; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008917689

The population dynamics of two Salicornia species from the Bergen op Zoom salt marsh (south-west Netherlands) was examined. Based on the results of several field studies three preliminary life tables were constructed, two for S. procumbens agg. populations growing respectively on the mud flats and in the salt marsh, and one for S. europaea agg. living in the upper marsh. 2. The life cycles are described and quantified in terms of eight phases and the transition probabilities between them, starting from a notional individual representative of each population. 3. The models depicting the life cycle of S. procumbens show a mean offspring number of 4.26 individuals per parent for the mud-flat population and 0.18 for the salt-marsh population. The S. europaea model gives an output of 0.44 individuals per parent. These results reflect the fluctuations in population size observed in sample plots over the years 1976-78. 4. Comparison of the transition probabilities reveals that on the mud flats most S. procumbens individuals die during pollination and seed germination, while the population in the salt marsh proper is thinned especially during the seed phase in winter time and during the growth from established seedlings to maturation. S. europaea behaves in a similar but less pronounced way to S. procumbens in the salt marsh. 5. Probabilities for one flower or one seed to produce a mature flowering plant were calculated, and were compared with those found in the literature. They are roughly of the same order of magnitude as the probabilities for other annual species, but much higher than those reported for biennial species. © 1985 Dr W.

Some insects do incur additional energy cost on transporting and storing food. Energy cost of foraging ranges from 2 to 5 % of the energy gained in bees and wasps. Initiation of flight, in large and insulated insects obligatorily requires 'warming-up' of muscle temperature and maintenance of endothermy by over 20°C above the ambient. Over-heating is avoided by pumping the cooler abdominal blood into the hot thorax. Pollinating insects include (i) hovering high-energy foragers, which expend more energy and visit more flowers per unit time and (ii) walking low-energy foragers, which expend less energy and visit few flowers per unit time. Decreasing of ""wing loading"" is another strategy adopted by saturniids, which do not feed as adults. Most bees forage, when flowers are just blooming, and when they have maximum nectar reward to offer. From the model study on energy cost of oviposition, it has been shown that Sceliphron violaceum makes greater and greater effort to complete the process of food provisioning and sealing the larval nest, when it has invested more and more energy on foraging and provisioning spiders to the larviposited young ones. © 1985 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Behavioural energetics; foraging behaviour; high-energy foragers; Sceliphron violaceum; walking low-energy foragers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-5444247465

All the flower parts of both xenogamous and facultatively xenogamous species were heavier, i.e., larger, than those of facultatively autogamous species. Likewise, the dry weights of all the flower parts of xenogamous species exceeded those of facultatively xenogamous species. On a relative basis, xenogamous species invested less in calyces and more in corollas compared to species with the other mating systems. Facultatively autogamous species invested relatively more in pistils. Xenogamous species invested relatively more in stamens than do facultatively autogamous species. The ratios of dry weight stamens to dry weight pistils were equivalent in xenogamous and facultatively xenogamous species. The available data from xenogamous species suggest a pattern of resource allocation that is independent of sexual system (perfect-flowered, monoecious, or dioecious) and pollen vector. The cost of mating (prezygotic cost) was male biased and frequently exceeded by parental investment (postzygotic cost). These results are not consistent with models that predict equal allocation of resources to male and female sexual function but are consistent with those that predict unequal allocation of resources to those functions in outbreeding hermaphroditic angiosperms. Two additional lines of evidence are inconsistent with the expectations of sex allocation theory. First, resource allocation to sexual function was not equal in wind-pollinated species. Second, relative amounts of the resources allocated to male vis-à-vis female function did not decrease between xenogamy and facultative xenogamy i.e., with an increase in the selfing rate. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022223579

The negrito Onge tribals of Little Andaman use the sap of Orophea katschallica to repel the bees while extracting honey from the hives. Dutta and associates (1983) reported that the sap of Amomum aculeatum, an herb growing in dense tropical forests of South Andaman, acts as a tranquiliser for these bees; with the aid of this sap, honey can be harvested from their hives by natives without protective apparel while the bees remain docile. Further, the hives can be bagged in nylon nettings and transported to desired sites to establish apiaries.

The mean corolla length for each of pink, purple and white flowers is significantly shorter than that for each of red, orange, yellow and green flowers, suggesting that these two sets of colours correspond with entomophily and ornithophily, respectively.

Three potential explanations for self incompatibility are proposed: (1) an S-gene controlled system in which pollen tubes are arrested in the nucellus of the ovule; (2) sperm: egg interactions at fertilization and (3) action of post-zygotic lethal genes. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.",Acacia; Nitrogen-fixation; Pollen tube growth; Self-incompatibility; Wattle/S-gene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001171423

The response measured in the first generation offspring after selection (immediate gain) can differ from that retained when the population has regained equilibrium (permanent gain). The population mean behaves in a predictable manner during the return to equilibrium, and its value at any time can be predicted from earlier generations. The permanent gain from selection after reproduction is always (1 + s)/2 times as large as that from selection before reproduction, but the relationship of the immediate gains depends on the genetic model assumed. Numerical analysis applied to a model with two alleles per locus and varying allele frequencies, dominance ratios and numbers of loci showed that the proportion of the immediate gain retained at equilibrium was reduced with the large inbreeding depression associated with increasing dominance levels and numbers of loci and was generally lower for selection after reproduction than before.

There was found to be close correlation between viability of the grains and their tolerance to desiccation. Most of the pollen grains in the hybrid examined survived a reduction by almost 50 per cent of the original water content without loss of normal function. With water loss greater than this, less vigorous pollen grains died or lost their ability to form pollen tubes. Consequently, when pollination was carried out using pollen with a water content reduced by more than 50 per cent, only the most tolerant pollen grains survived to take part in the competition which precedes fertilization. Dry pollen grains required a longer period to establish adhesion to the stigma surface and to initiate pollen tubes than pollen grains with higher water content, but otherwise their behaviour was normal. If more than 80 per cent of the original water content was lost, disturbances occurred in the physiology of the grains surviving the treatment. This was exhibited as death or a reduction in rate of pollen tube growth.Drying of pollen by an amount which does not irreversibly damage the more tolerant grains could possibly be used as a means of pollen selection. © 1985 Annals of Botany Company.",Dehydration; Maize; Pollen treatment; Pollen tube; Pollen viability; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003330922

It is widely distributed in SE Asia. It produces numerous white flowers and small blue?black fruits. Individual shrubs were of two types in 1:1 ratio, one bearing staminate flowers, the other bearing flowers with both stamens and carpels. The hermaphrodite flowers were shown to have sterile pollen so the species is functionally dioecious. The flowers and floral sprays of the two sexes differed in several measurements: the male flowers had more anthers and were larger and more numerous, making the corporate visual image of male sprays more than twice as large as that for sprays of female flowers. Flowers, individuals of which last only one day, opened only every second day, when all bushes flower synchronously. When the anthers burst in the morning, pollen and sterile pollen was collected vigorously by a variety of bees, mostly Apis dorsata and Nomia spp. Most of the pollen was collected within 1 h of anthesis. Anthesis in males takes place about 20 min earlier than in females; insect visitation follows this pattern. The minute quantity of nectar was collected by only few insects and mostly after the pollen had gone, if at all. Fruits were eaten by birds. The species displays many features typical of dioecious tropical plants with the unusual feature of pollen being the main food reward for pollinators. It was pollinated effectively in Sulawesi.

The flowers mimic brood sites to lure gravid female Dideopsis to the staminode on which as many as 76 eggs may be found. After alighting on the staminode the insect falls or flies into the labellum, or more commonly launches into flight. Once inside, a pair of in-turned lateral lobes in the labellum prevents escape via the entrance, and the insect requires c1 min to escape by 1 of 2 basal exits. As with other slipper orchids, the pollinator deposits a pollen load on the stigmatic surface and is smeared with pollen as it struggles to escape. No reward is present inside the labellum, and aged staminodes carrying hatched eggs conspicuously lack larvae. Because the larvae feed only on several species of aphids, the staminode with numerous clavate trichomes may mimic an aphid colony on which D. aegrota normally deposits its eggs. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022246179

In a primary forest on the Central Plateau of Madagascar Angraecum arachnites Schltr. was found to be pollinated by and adapted to a single species of hawk?moth, Panogena lingens (Butler), despite abundance of many concurrent Sphingidae of which several were also long?tongued. Furthermore, P. lingens was dimorphic in the length and breadth of its proboscis and only the morph with the longest and most slender proboscis was recorded to pollinate A. arachnites. Exclusive and precise adaptation to the latter morph of P. lingens existed in floral morphology and probably in other characteristics such as flowering phenology and chemical signalling. Several concurrently flowering orchid species were sharing P. lingens as a pollinator resource. The monophily in A. arachnites is interpreted as a result of a refined long?term specialization developed within an archaic evolutionary relationship in a relatively stable environment. The extraordinary number and diversity of long?spurred Orchidaceae in Madagascar appears to be a direct coevolutionary consequence of an Old?World?unique diversity of long?tongued archaic Sphingidae that has persisted in this isolated land.

This increases the likelihood that observed patterns are genetically based. Early in a season, plants were more selective about which donor they accepted pollen from, as measured by the parentage of mature fruits. This increase in selectivity was related to the number of prior pollinations and developing fruits in an inflorescence, and therefore presumably to availability of resources. These differences in fruiting indicate a non-male component to selectivity (since pollen source was controlled). That the acceptability of pollen from particular donors depends on the resource status of the inflorescence means that the distinction between pollen limitation and resource limitation of fruit production is not a sharp one. A model is proposed to account for patterns of fruit production with respect to paternity. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022175456

The flowering peak coincides with maximal colony size of the bees. The bees preferentially alight on the upper half of the row of flowers, run over the flowers, and collect pollen by pressing their undersides against the stamens. Bombus occidentalis regularly used buzzing to make almost dehiscent anthers burst, thus gaining access to large amounts of pollen. Pyrobombus huntii buzzed at one locality only. While Separatobombus morrisoni usually specializes and collects pollen exclusively, B. occidentalis seems to depend on Aquilegia chrysantha as a nectar source.

However, in experiments with bumble bees confined to nylon mesh cages, the carry-over of pollen between flowers by bees is extensive. Individual bees visit only a few more flowers per visit to large than to small plants, and large plants attract more bees per minute than small plants. A mathematical model was constructed to estimate the amount of foreign pollen a flower should receive as a function of plant size. The model predicts that flowers on all plants should receive approximately equal amounts of foreign pollen, and that self-pollination and hence inbreeding will not vary with plant size.

Box 1, Mtunthama, Kasungu, Malawi","In many ornithophilous Loranthaceae pollination is accompanied by an explosive opening of the flowers, and diverse mechanisms have evolved in different genera to bring this about. These are described for the African genera Erianthemum, Englerina, Tapinanthus, Globimetula, Vanwykia and Plicosepalus. In many genera tensions within the stamens cause the tubular corolla to split along the petal junctions to form window?like fenestrae. The flowers are pollinated mainly by sunbirds which insert their beaks through the fenestrae in search of the abundant nectar. This action causes the tube to split and the stamens to coil inwards explosively. In Globimetula and many species of Tapinanthus pigment is secreted along the edges of the specialized petal segments of the head, the spathulae. Probing along these secretory junctions causes the spathulae to reflex; further probing splits the corolla tube, and allows the stamens to coil inwards explosively. In Globimetula reflexure of the petals exposes the central column of stamens, between which secondary fenestrae are developed. In Plicosepalus curvature of the corolla tube is connected with a more specialized fenestral structure; flower opening is not explosive, and the open flowers continue to be visited regularly by sunbirds. In Vanwykia an early stage in the development of explosive flower?opening is found. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell.

Shifts to lighter color coincide with emigration of hummingbirds from the system. In the absence of hummingbirds, lighter colors attract the remaining pollinator, a hawkmoth. Comparison ofplants that shift to lighter colors with those that fail to shift shows that shifting is adaptive in that it enhances reproductive success because of the preference of hawkmoths for lighter colored flowers.

This distribution pattern results from the tendency of these prostrate perennials to spread by production of trailing stems with adventitious roots. Both morphs, in both populations, exhibited natural fruit set >86%. Although the number of ovules per pair of ovaries was fixed at 8 in each morph, numbers of seeds per fruit in naturally pollinated flowers differed significantly between pins (4.3) and thrums (6.4) in the North Carolina population. In the New York population, no significant differences were found (pins 5.0 seeds per fruit; thrums, 4.4). Flowers of M. repens were visited by native species of Bombus, which visited many flowers in each patch of plants. Bees moved frequently from patch to patch, effecting intermorph cross-pollination and maintaining high levels of seed set. Movement among patches may be promoted by the dispersion of nectar rewards, with flowers about to open or just opened providing maximum amounts of nectar. In the North Carolina population, thrums contributed more than 75% of the genes transmitted by ovule production. This contrasts strongly with previous studies of unequal sexual contributions in distylous taxa, which have demonstrated greater female contributions by pins. In the New York population, nearly equal contributions by pins and thrums through pollen and ovule production occurred, a situation similar to that found in most distylous species. This appears to be the first demonstration of variation in functional gender between populations of a single species. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022206850

New Zealand plants, in general, have flowers that lack bright colours, are of small size, and have simple unspecialised structures. Dish and (especially at higher altitudes) tube blossoms abound, whereas bell, brush, gullet, and flag blossoms are relatively uncommon. There is an unusually high frequency (c. 18 per cent) of genera with separate sexes. New Zealand has few specialised pollinators. The unspecialised flowers are interpreted as adaptations to fluctuating combinations of promiscuous pollinators. The high frequency of separate sexes is associated with unspecialised pollinators and fleshy bird-dispersed fruits. A number of larger genera show considerable evolution of flower structure accompanying respecialisation to different pollinators. The occurrence of conspicuous floral displays on certain outlying islands is a puzzling anomaly in view of the depauperate insect faunas on these islands.A simple methodology is presented for deciding whether the evolution of distinctive characters on isolated islands such as New Zealand has occurred on the islands or on the source areas before longdistance dispersal to the islands. The evolution of simple despecialised flowers in Melicytus and 18 out of 20 cases of divaricating habits are proposed as examples of the autochthonous evolution of New Zealand peculiarities. In contrast, c. 68 out of 80 cases of the aquisition of separate sexes in New Zealand plants are derived from immigration of dimorphic ancestors.Non-random dispersal to islands of plants with different characters is a form of species selection, described here as immigration selection, which is exemplified by the more frequent migration of bird-dispersed plants to New Zealand. The differential success of various groups on islands also constitutes species selection, caused by differential rales of persistence (versus extinction) and speciation. Plants with flowers that lack strong zygomorphy appear to have speciated more extensively in New Zealand than plants with zygomorphic flowers. It is possible to estimate the relative importance of individual selection and species selection in determining the distinctive features of island biotas.Species selection offers an explanation of the outstanding feature of the geography of extant New Zealand plants, the absence or low frequency of dominant Australian plant groups, such as Eucalyptus (formerly present) and the Proteaceae despite the occurrence of many species and genera in common between Australia and New Zealand. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Dioecism; Divaricating habit; Flower colour; Flower structure; Immigration selection; Island biogeography; New Zealand biogeography; Pollination mechanisms; Species selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022165808

The flowers were shown to be protandrous at one locality, homogamous at another, and protogynous at a third locality. The length of the male stage of protandrous flowers may differ not only from plant to plant but also between flowers on the same plant. These differences in the timing of the female and male stages are maintained in cultivation. Pollination experiments revealed flowers to be automatically selfing with a seed set as high as that following cross-pollination. In all experiments and in the field, 2570% of the flowers did not set seeds. Of flowers that produced seeds, around 50% had five seeds. A rate of cross-pollination of 16% was estimated from emasculated flowers in the field. The most frequent visitors were ants and mites. The breeding system is considered to be facultatively autogamous. The number of open flowers per day per plant from plants of different size was noted. The chance of a plant on a particular day having open flowers increases with its size. In all features studied, no difference between the three leaf colour morphs was found, but there were significant differences between the localities in flower biology and seed set. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Geranium sessiliflorum; Phenology; Pollination; Reproductive biology; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000978850

All bee, wasp, beetle, fly, butterfly and moth visitors select flowers in the white/yellow phase rather than the red or intermediate phase. Nectar is produced by five species, harvestable pollen by four species and detectable perfume by three species, all of which features are usually absent from the red phase. The timing of the colour change in all species also corresponds to loss of stigma receptivity, completion of pollination and onset of ovule seed) swelling. Six species also undergo minor morphometric changes which discourage visitation. In all species, colour change is non?inducible by pollinators, taking 230 days to complete. In three protandrous species, all available pollen may be removed in the first visit, requiring transport of non?self pollen to rewardless flowers during the 10 h period of the yellow phase. These species are highly floriferous and occur in dense patches. Since only a small proportion of flowers may be receptive at any one time, it is concluded that retention of flower parts essentially serves to enhance long?distance attraction, while colour change maximizes pollination and foraging efficiency.

Because IgE synthesis is under T-lymphocyte control, we tested for seasonal variation in T cell-proliferative response to SRW antigen E (AgE) in vitro. Nine untreated SRW-sensitive and five nonallergic individuals were studied on 15 occasions from June 1981 through May 1982. In vitro proliferative index (SI) to AgE, serum total and specific IgE and SRW-pollen counts were measured; all patients studied kept daily symptom diaries. The mean SI was higher for the atopic group on all 15 sampling dates. The cumulative SI and the daily SI were statistically different between groups before, during, and after pollination. The peak SI for the atopic patients occurred almost 1 2/5 wk after the pollination peak, and the peak IgE antibody levels to SRW occurred at 5 2/5 wk after the pollination peak.

The populations flowered in late winter and spring. The numerous white flag blossoms contained nectar and were visited by a variety of insects, but only bumble-bees were effective in operating the flowers: both bumble-bees and honey bees rob the flowers of nectar through the calyx but this does not usually directly damage the ovary. Self-pollination was recorded at the late bud stage and pollen germinated on the stigmas and penetrated the styles of these unvisited, untripped flowers. The species is self-compatible. Under open pollination, fruit production varied from 4 to 55% for individual trees. Although many ovules began to develop into seeds, abortion reduced seed production per pod to about 50% for both populations. Within pods, ovules at distal positions more often developed into seeds. Of the ovules available to be fertilized at flowering only 5% for the naturalised population and 16% for the cultivated population, developed into seeds. The difference between the two populations was largely a result of a difference in the proportion of flowers setting fruit rather than in seed production per pod. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Chamaecytisus palmensis; Fruit abortion; Fruit production; Leguminosae; Pollination; Reproductive biology; Seed abortion; Seed production; Tagasaste; Tree crops; Tree lucerne,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000626220

During a general flowering a very large number of tree families, including the well-known Dipterocarpaceae, flower and fruit exceptionally heavily. The huge pulse of flowering is echoed by an apparent explosion in the number of pollinators, and this is further augmented by migration of pollinators from the forest fringes. The huge demand for pollinators seems to be solved among several dipterocarps through utilization of tiny, fast breeding, floral-feeding insects such as thrips and hoppers. Competition for pollinators is further reduced through development of sequential flowering among several groups of trees that share similar pollinators. The resulting massive general fruiting seems to contribute to a heightened level of faunal activity and numbers. This long-intervalled flowering and fruiting phenology which dominates these lowland dipterocarp forests may have partly contributed to the lowered animal biomass frequently alluded to when these forests are compared with neotropical forests. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Botany, Duke Univ., Durham, North Carolina 27706, USA.","All 9 species studied have floral morphological traits that prevent autogamy. Plants of 5 species experience low levels of geitonogamous pollen transfer; they produce few flowers daily and are pollinated by traplining hummingbirds. Excepting A. storkii, these plants are fully self-compatible, and seeds from selfing are as viable as crossed seeds. Aphelandra storkii is partially self-incompatible (SI) and produces seeds from selfing that tend to germinate less successfully than crossed seeds. Plants from the remaining populations are profusely flowering shrubs, and even those pollinated by traplining hummingbirds should experience higher levels of geitonogamy. Aphelandra deppeana is pollinated by territorial hummingbirds which should further increase the incidence of geitonogamy. All shrub species are partially SI, and A. leonardii and A. sinclairiana show significant reduced germination of selfed vs. crossed seeds. The breeding system of these species is thus modified by postpollination factors that favor the formation and maturation of outcrossed seeds. Aphelandra species, like other herbs and shrubs of tropical forest understory, possess a combination of breeding system traits that promote outcrossing but do not exclude geitonogamy. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022173565

These habitat differences are associated with differences in seed and seedling biology and seasonal changes in the foraging behavior of the chiropteran seed dispersers of these plants. Relatively low phenological overlap allows the species to share animal visitors. Responses to different rainfall cues and/or different inflorescence growth rates produce temporally separated phenological cycles, though observed phenological overlap was neither significantly lower nor significantly higher than expected by chance, for most pairs of species. Insect visitation is necessary for high seed-set; species differ in their attractiveness to pollinators. Pairwise insect overlap was greater than expected by chance. The plants also utilize the same 6 species of frugivorous bats as seed dispersers, and pairwise bat overlap was extremely high. Because they are important fruit sources for 3 common bat species, Piper species are keystone mutualists in dry tropical forests. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022217511

The wasps reproduce by ovipositing through the styles of female flowers within the closed fig receptacles (syconia). About half of the female flowers within the syconia of monoecious figs have styles which are longer than the ovipositors of the wasp, and they will therefore produce seeds rather than wasp larvae. Since a longer ovipositor would enable a wasp to reach more ovules and deposit more eggs, the question arises at to why longer ovipositors have not evolved. In an attempt to answer this question, four seemingly plausible hypotheses are examined but each is shown to be problematical in some way. Consideration is then given to a fifth hypothesis which proposes that ovipositor length is constrained by abortion of syconia with relatively few seed embryos and many agaonid larvae. It is argued first that this pattern of abortion will be selected during a sustained period of heavy wasp infestation because seeds will then become scarce relative to pollen?carrying wasps. Increased expenditure by the fig on seed production would therefore be favoured by natural selection. A greater expenditure on seeds would occur if young syconia with exceptionally heavy wasp infestations were dropped and the saved nutrients invested in syconia of a subsequent crop containing average levels of wasp larvae and seeds. Provided that the energy and nutrient cost of dropping young syconia is small, the selective advantage to the wasp of longer ovipositors is eliminated in this way. A stable coexistence of figs and wasps is therefore possible. The paper concludes by discussing two general predictions of the abortion hypothesis, and how these may be tested.

Most flowering occurs in November, with maturation of fertile (seed?bearing) infructescences taking about 12 to 14 months. Number of inflorescences produced by a tree is not closely related to its diameter at breast height (DBH). Trees become reproductive at mean DBH of 45 cm and fruit successfully at mean DBH of 6.7 cm. Trees of DBH < 10 cm produce fewer fertile infructescences than trees of larger DBH. Moderate?intensity fire markedly reduces production of inflorescences for at least three flowering seasons. Less than 2% of flowers on an average inflorescence set fruit, and only 1 to 5% of inflorescences develop into fertile infructescences. The cause of the latter was investigated experimentally. Although insect larvae (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera) damage infructescences, inflorescences sprayed with insecticide do not develop differently from those not so treated. Insect damage is least in inflorescences produced in late November and early December but there is no corresponding increase in development of fertile infructescences. Ants do not protect inflorescences from insect damage and insects are of little significance as predators of seed within the follicle. Whether fruit development is limited by pollination could not be adequately assessed. Low fruit set in B. grandis may result from shortage of resources, with many flowers and inflorescences allowing B. grandis the option of setting large numbers of fruits should favourable conditions prevail.

About 1/2 of the flowers in one population had their standing crops of nectar removed in a manner simulating nectar-robbing by bumblebees. Bombus vagans employed area-restricted searching behavior in both populations. The increased frequency of long-distance bee flights associated with the abundant low-quality reward blossoms in the nectar-robbed patch served to increase neighborhood size relative to the control area. Pollen was transported greater distances because of nectar thievery, thus making it more likely that the main purpose (genetic variability via outbreeding) of the chasmogamous flowers was achieved.

Large-scale, reliable techniques for screening in the field for downy mildew, ergot and smut have been developed and are routinely being used. Since downy mildew is economically important, all breeding material passes through the downy mildew-screening nursery and resistant varieties and hybrids have been bred. Synthetic varieties have been produced which are also resistant to smut and are agronomically good. Variability from African germplasm material, particularly for disease resistance, head volume, and seed size, has been exploited in crosses with Indian material. African parent-age occurs in nearly all of the advanced breeding products of the ICRISAT program. Recurrent selection has been used to produce open-pollinated varieties, one of which (WC-C75) is the first to be released in India where it already occupies a considerable hectarage. Conventional pedigree breeding has been used to produce synthetic parents, pollinators and seed parents. Several new seed parents have been released, and this broadens the genetic base of the hybrid crop which previously relied heavily on a single malesterile line. © 1985.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000680262

The shape of pollen grains of mulberry and B. kazinoki which were dipped in iron aceto-carmine solution was almost globular, and the pollen grains of mulberry were considerably larger than those of B. kazinoki with a diameter about 1.5 times greater than that of the latter. More than half of the mulberry pollen grains which stuck tightly to the long hairs of the split stigma of mulberry germinated and some of the pollen tubes penetrated into the stigma two hours after pollination. On the other hand, pollen grains of B. kazinoki were easily detached from the hairs of mulberry stigma and did not germinate at all until five days after pollination. In the mulberry crosses double fertilization was observed 10 hours after pollination and the first division of the zygote occurred 48 hours after pollination. Six to nine days after pollination, a considerably large embryo ball was formed through repeated division of the zygote and was surrounded with endosperm which was first formed in the peripheral layer of the embryosac and which grew toward the central part of the embryo-sac. The embryo grew up to the heart shape stage at 10 to 12 days after pollination and to the stage in which cotyledon and hypocotyl could be easily identified 15 days after pollination. In contrast, in the crosses between mulberry and B. kazinoki the division of egg cells and the formation of endosperm were not observed until 16 days after pollination, but the development of the ovule did not differ appreciably from that of the mulberry crosses until four days after pollination.

Evidence that resources limited fruit maturation in the hand-cross-pollinated inflorescences was equivocal.

These studies are unrealistic since they assume regular spatial distribution of morphs within a population and fail to consider intra?flower pollination in assessing distyly's effects. Pollen flow in two populations of Linum tenuifolium L. was investigated using a fluorescent?dye marker technique. One population was dimorphic and self?incompatible; the other was monomorphic and self?compatible. In both populations pollen dispersal was leptokurtic with over 75% of grains detected within 5 m from the source. Intra?flower pollinations comprised a large proportion of individual stigma loads (42% for the dimorphic form; 49% for the monomorphic form). Total stigmatic loads for the dimorphic population showed equal proportions of pin and thrum pollen on both long?style and short?style stigmas, though variation in individual loads was marked. Values ranging from 34.2 to 61.5% legitimate pollen were recorded. The irregular distribution of morphs observed at the dimorphic site will reduce the efficiency of heterostyly as a device promoting intermorph pollination. The reduction in intra?flower pollination suggests adaptive significance of this floral dimorphism in increasing the efficiency of pollen dispersal to the individual.

Anthesis is diurnal with flowers opening and closing for two consecutive days. Flowers on the first day of anthesis are functionally female with the stigmatic papillae secreting a small quantity of fluid. Total dissolved solids of the stigmatic fluid range from 3 to 4%; glucose and fructose are in equal concentrations and a large number of free amino acids are present. Flowers are primarily visited by Dialictus bees, flies and beetles. These insects typically land on the wet stigmatic surface where the secretion loosens pollen from the insects' body. On the second day of anthesis, the anthers dehisce and the stigmatic fluid disappears. This latter phenomenon is associated with a loss of stigmatic receptivity. Since protogyny is complete, flowers are obligatorily entomophilous. After anthesis, the flower closes and submerges. The perianth and androecium abscise and decompose as the fruit matures. The fruit yields large trichomic seeds. The phylogenetic position of N. mexicana within the genus is discussed. © 1985.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022173159

Biology, Yale Univ., PO Box 6666, New Haven, Co 06511, USA.","As clonal plants get larger, individual flowers become more surrounded by other flowers borne on the same clone. With very restricted movement of pollen reported for both animal- and wind-pollinated species, the breeding system may change as a consequence of a clonal plant covering greater amounts of space. In Carex platyphylla, a wind-pollinated, self-compatible sedge, the absolute and relative amount of endogenous pollen per flowering culm increases sharply as a plant grows from 1 to c10 culms, then increases at a slower rate, given a constant rain of exogenous pollen. In Trifolium repens, a bee-pollinated, self-incompatible, stoloniferous clover, a model based on known patterns of flower placement and stolon growth patterns, coupled with estimates of pollen-deposition and floret-visitation patterns by bees, suggests that the number and length of stolon internodes affect successful pollination. Also, the distribution of seeds along inflorescences is affected by clonal growth patterns and bee behavior at each floret. The dynamics of internode initiation and growth also change the rate of interdigitation of clones, which will subsequently affect the pollination ecology. An additional, field test with the viny herb Cucumis sativus demonstrated that as plants increase in size and in number of flowers, the pollinator pool, the success of flowers in setting seed, and gene flow distance all change. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022226947

In localized areas (e.g. Risdon, Tasmania), patches of high phenotypic diversity are encountered, with individuals encompassing the complete phenotypic range between these two species. Progeny trials indicate a large heritable component to this variation. Open-pollinated progenies from intermediate mothers exhibit greater variability than those from either pure species, which strongly suggests that these intermediate phenotypes are a result of hybridization. Progenies from pure species mothers near a hybrid swarm are more variable than those from pure stands. There is a greater proportion of seedlings which match the artificially produced F1 in open-pollinated progenies from E. amygdalina than from E. risdonii mothers. In addition, progenies from intermediate mothers show a bias toward E. risdonii types, which implies that they are predominantly outcrossing to E. risdonii. This evidence suggests an asymmetrical flow of genes by pollen migration from E. risdonii into the hybrid swarm and surrounding E. amygdalina. Little difference in seedling vigour or mortality occurred between seedlings from the various parental phenotypes, although differences in seed output per capsule and germination were apparent. The specific identity of E. risdonii and E. amygdalina is usually maintained in parapatry by a range of mechanisms including their specific ecological preference, reduced hybrid fitness and differences in flowering phenology.

Different chromosome types revealed by the patterns of H-segments of cold-treated chromosomes were successfully classified into two series of homologous chromosomes, K2* and T*, in each of five chromosomes, A to E. The series were polymorphic with respect to constituent chromosome types. Thus, both the genomes K2 and T are polymorphic, suggesting the extinct progenitors, K2K2 and TT, to be chromosomally polymorphic. Karyotypes were homozygous for all ten pairs of homologous chromosomes in all individuals, but different homokaryotypes could be distinguished among 184 homokaryotypes observed. No karyotypes were common between the populations of Kyushu and Hokkaido, though the number of plants examined in Hokkaido was much less (9 plants) than that in Kyushu (5661 plants). However, the progenitor diploids may possibly differ between Kyushu and Hokkaido.

A mating event is defined here as the fertilisation of an egg. With a diallelic locus and homozygous seed parent, mating events may be classified as detected outcrosses or as ambiguous mating events (those due to either self-fertilisation or outcrossing). When mating events are classified and when seed are sampled at two or more hierarchical levels within populations (e.g., seeds within fruits, fruits within plants) one may estimate the degree of correlation between classes of mating events at a given hierarchical level relative to that at others. Such an analysis applied to progeny from an experimental population of the common morning glory shows that there is correlation between classes of mating events within fruits, but not between fruits. In an experimental population of white spruce, the analysis reveals a low degree of correlation between classes of mating events both within and between cones.

Two different types of stamen arrangement were noted in senescing flowers of 18 Swedish species and 2 common cultivars. The stamens of cross?pollinating species seldom touch the stigmas while those of self?pollinating species instead arch over the pistils and dry up in this position. All species set seed well after artificial self?pollination and are thus self?compatible. Isolation experiments were carried out during 3 years. When inflorescences were bagged, seed set was drastically lowered in cross?pollinators but remained almost unaltered in self?pollinators. The different responses to isolation are probably due to the inherent stamen behaviour. Copyright © 1985, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981611696

In each year, 3 sizes of population were studied by using hives with single, double or triple brood chambers. Nearly 3000 metal tags were recovered each year from foragers returning to the test colonies after having been tagged at stations within each of the onion fields. The number of tags recovered per colony was proportional to colony population in one year and almost proportional in the other.

Seedling emergence was more rapid in a May-sown experiment than in a March-sown experiment. The monogerm seed lot had a lower standard deviation of emergence time in the May-sown experiment and in all experiments had a more uniform within-row spacing than the other seed lots, but there was no consistent relationship between these two attributes and uniformity of root weight. The mean weight of shoots and roots increased rapidly until 600 day °C above 6 had accumulated. The yield of shoots then remained constant at about 30 t/ha at 47 plants/ m2and at about 40 t/ha at 188 plants/m2. The weight of roots increased throughout the experiments and yields of over 100 t/ha were achieved. The monogerm seed lot gave a ceiling shoot yield about 20 % less than that of the other seed lots, whereas there were no large or consistent differences in root yield between the different seed lots. Shoot yield increased with plant density, especially at very early harvests, whereas root yield showed a variable response to density. At early harvests in all experiments, root yield increased with increasing density; at late harvests in one experiment, yield decreased with density, but in another there was no marked response to density. Coefficient of variation (c.v.) of root weight was only about 30 % in young unthickened roots, but in older thickened roots was between 70 and 117 % at 47 plants/m2and increased to over 180% at 188 plants/m2. The c.v. of root weight of the monogerm seed lot was approximately 20% less than that of the other seed lots. In a fourth experiment, plots were thinned to leave within each row either a uniform or a clumped distribution of seedlings of either uniform or variable size.

One clone (the Mahan cultivar) produced only protogynous progeny, while crosses among protandrous clones produced only protandrous progeny. Progeny phenotypes of other crosses involving heterozygotes generally support the hypothesis that a single Mendelian factor determines dichogamy type, with protogyny being dominant (PP or Pp) and protandry being recessive (pp). That this qualitative inheritance pattern, the first determined in Carya, is common throughout the Juglandaceae family (pecan, other hickories, and walnuts) is strengthened by data from other sources.

In the overview two approaches will be discussed; the gametic and the somatic system. In the gametic system hybrids are produced from fusion of ordinary gametes. Fertilization can be performed naturally but to obtain further growth and development of the hybrid, the fertilized ovule or ovary has to be isolated and cultured in vitro shortly after pollination (ovule rescue). If development of the hybrid can reach the embryo stage, but no further development is possible on the plant, the embryo has to be rescued and cultured in vitro (embryo rescue). It is also possible to obtain hybrids after pollination and fertilization in vitro using the whole female reproduction apparatus or isolated ovules (in vitro pollination). The somatic system involves fusion of isolated somatic cells that have been isolated as protoplasts before fusion. Thus, ordinary vegetative, somatic cells can be forced to fuse with each other to produce somatic hybrids. The two different techniques enable the production of hybrids that cannot be produced in nature. In this overview an attempt will be made to describe, compare and discuss the potentials and the limitations of gametic and somatic hybridizations performed in vitro.

Solms. (Pontederiaceae) is a short?lived perennial or annual of marshes, seasonal pools and ditches of lowland tropical South America, primarily NE Brazil, and the Caribbean islands of Cuba and Jamaica. Comparisons, made under uniform glasshouse conditions, of populations originating from seed collected in the two regions revealed striking differences in their floral biology and breeding systems. The majority of populations sampled in NE Brazil are tristylous. Floral trimorphism is associated with pollen trimorphism and minor differences in anther size and pollen production among the three stamen levels. Unlike the majority of heterostylous plants the floral morphs of E. paniculata are highly self?fertile. Populations sampled on the island of Jamaica are composed exclusively of self?pollinating, semi?homostylous, mid?styled forms. Flowers from these populations are smaller and less showy, with reduced pollen heteromorphism and significantly fewer pollen grains and ovules per flower, in comparison with trimorphic populations from Brazil. Individual genotypes from Jamaican populations display considerable developmental instability in floral expression, particularly with respect to filament elongation of the lower stamen level. It is proposed that self?pollinating populations of E. paniculata are evolutionarily derived from tristylous ancestors and that the shift in breeding system is favoured at low density, following population bottlenecks, where pollinator service is unreliable.

Caloric intake per floral visit (CALGAIN) was manipulated by varying sucrose concentration. Both flight and handling costs per floral visit (CALCOST) were manipulated. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationship between the dependent variable, RATE, and the two energy variables. There was significant variation among bees in dance behaviour. However, the absolute magnitude of the CLACOST coefficients tended to be larger than CALGAIN coefficients; bees may weight perceptions of costs in relation to intakes. Honey bees were presented with a series of binary choices between yellow or blue tubular artificial flowers in order to assess how cost-intake information is used to make choices among flowers. In eight experiments the 2 flowers had different combinations of volume of sucrose (intake) and tube depth (handling cost). Results are consistent with an assessment of rate of net caloric intake, although they are likely consistent with other possible assessments. © 1985.",choice; communication; cost; foraging; Honey bee; intake; perception; pollination; profitability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000117095

There are 3 flower types. Morphological males (M) are found near the tip of the inflorescence and have short styles; these flowers did not set fruit when pollinated. All other flowers have long styles and are morphological hermaphrodites (H); among these, those near the base of an inflorescence set fruit when pollinated (fruiting hermaphrodites, FH) while those in intermediate positions did not (functional males, FM). No morphological differences were apparent between FH and FM flowers. Male function of M and H flowers was indistinguishable in terms of pollen germination and quantity and quality of seed produced. The proportion of M flowers decreased with later inflorescences, but the proportion of FM flowers increased correspondingly. Thus, the morphological sex ratio, M/(M + H), decreased with plant size, while the functional sex ratio, (M + FM)/M + FM + FH) did not vary. Data do not support evolutionary theories that predict increased allocation to female versus male function with increasing plant size. Morphological sex ratio changed in response to various plant hormones, which suggests hormone involvement. Sex ratio increased in response to increased shade and water stress, which supports those evolutionary theories that predict a shift to maleness in response to stress. Regulation of fruit-set after pollination occurred via changes in the proportion of H flowers that did (FH) or did not (FM) set fruit.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022193350

This distrbution is argued to result from selection for the maintenance of outcrossing in historically large, outcrossing populations with substantial inbreeding depression, and from selection for selfing when increased inbreeding, due to pollinator failure or population bottlenecks, reduces the level of inbreeding depression. Few species or populations are fixed at complete selfing or complete outcrossing. A low level of selfing in primarily outcrossing species is unlikely to be selectively advantageous, but will not reduce inbreeding depression to the level where selfing is selectively favored particularly if accompanied by reproductive compensation. Similarly, occasional outcrossing in primarily selfing species is unlikely to regularly provide sufficient heterosis to maintain selection for outcrossing through individual selection.

Gametocidal chromosomes, 4Ssh of Ae. sharonesis and 4S1 of Ae. longissima, cause high rates of mutation and chromosome aberration in addition to sterility, although they do not induce seed shriveling. Chromosome 3C of Ae. triuncialis induces only sterility in the F1, though chromosome breakage and mutation are induced in the B1 generation in the presence of its suppressor, Igc1 (from a common wheat cultivar Norin 26). The syndromes caused in wheat by these gametocidal agents are compared to hybrid dysgenesis observed in Drosophila melanogaster. © 1985, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Selective differences in pollen and ovule production affect the maintenance of polymorphisms in different ways; a mixture of homozygote excesses and deficiencies can exist for different alleles at a multi-allelic locus. A system of sedentary pollen with migrating seed is contrasted with a system of migrating pollen with sedentary seed distribution. This latter system is strongly protective of polymorphisms and always creates a deficiency of homozygotes below Hardy-Weinberg expectations even in the absence of selective differences. The effect of the sexes on evolutionary dynamics is not just a matter of reversing sex roles since gamete versus zygote dispersal requires different supporting effects from the migrating and sedentary sexes. These 2 systems are compared with systems of pollen and seed migration and with pollen and seed localization with respect to the protection afforded polymorphisms and departures of homozygote frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022180272

This behavior was not observed in other years. Despite the fact that Ipomopsis lacks floral features associated with bee visitation, bumblebees foraged on Ipomopsis at a rate only somewhat slower than that for a typical bee flower. Because of the deep corolla, bumblebees are able to probe only a limited distance but in 1981 nectar was more accessible due to a higher standing crop than in other years. While foraging on Ipomopsis, bees were able to obtain a net energetic profit similar to that obtained from their primary forage species. Floral choice is thus governed primarily by profitability (which can overcome innate preferences for bee flowers). The features of hummingbird flowers pose no absolute barrier to bee visitation.

These species, predominantly coastal in distribution, have dense inflorescences of yellow flowers and appear to be pollinated primarily by bees and long-tongued flies. Increased seed set and seedling vigor with cross-pollination select for outcrossing in these species.

Environmental unpredictability and pollinator unreliability may explain the apparent trend toward autogamy in the 3rd group and the high auto-fertility of the hummingbird-pollinated species.

Conventional water-based fixation techniques were shown to present a very artefactual image. Using the anhydrous method, specific stages of de- and rehydration were recognized in the pollen cytoplasm, and the most dehydrated grains were found not to possess an organized plasma membrane, but rather a superficial mosaic composed of vesicles, membranes and granules. The surface of the stigmatic papillae and of the pollen grain coating appear to be structurally adapted for the passage of metered quantities of water into the pollen grain. Evidence is presented that the self-incompatibility mechanism operating in these plants consists of a recognition stage occurring at the interface between the stigmatic pellicle and a membrane-like investment of the pollen coating, and a response phase involving the translocation of an inhibitor into the pollen grain cytoplasm. Since this system may be overridden by changes either in the plant or in its environment, the mechanism would seem to be uniquely adapted to changes in breeding strategy. © 1985.",Anhydrous fixation; Brassica oleracea; hydration; pollen; pollen tube; self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000399237

Conspicuous pollen trimorphism in tristylous Pontederia cordata enables a test of the hypothesis. Comparison of the composition of pollen loads in naturally pollinated stigmas of flowers were made at Paugh Lake, Ontario, which was visited primarily by bumblebees. In intact flowers, significant legitimate pollination was detected in the long-styled morph only. Following emasculation legitimate pollination was evident in the long- and short-styled morphs, with the mid-styled morph just short of displaying significant legitimate pollination. Heterostyly may reduce mutual interference between maternal and paternal reproductive function. The potential importance of stigmatic or stylar clogging by incompatible pollen was examined by controlled field pollinations and measurements of seed set. Prior application of large amounts of imcompatible pollen has no significant effect on the seed set of open-pollinated inflorescences. Comparison of legitimate pollen capture in intact and emasculated flowers provided no evidence that the presence of stamens within flowers of the floral morphs interfers with the receipt of legitimate pollen.

In the lower montane forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica, study of 23 tree species (Lauraceae) that share avian seed dispersers and insect pollinators found little evidence for such phenological character displacement. The distribution of flowering phenologies appeared random but were indistinguishable from a uniform sequence; fruiting seasons were more aggregated and were significantly non-uniform. Nonetheless, ecological competition for seed dispersers apparently does occur because fruit removal rates decline when many species fruit concurrently. Neither intraspecific variance in phenologies nor duration of flowering or fruiting within species was correlated with interspecific competition for dispersers. Final fruit weight at maturity explained only 1/4 of the variance in developmental times between species. The absence of overdispersed phenologies cannot exclude the possibility that competition exists or that phenological character displacement has occurred. Uniformly distributed phenologies have been reported more frequently for flowering than for fruiting. Because flowering plants face reproductive as well as ecological competition, selection may be stronger for the divergence of flowering times than for fruiting times, especially within guilds of related species. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022242465

This was greater than the heterosis over the male parent and mid-parent means shown by the shoot, leaf, stem and petiole dry matter and N content but less than that of the vegetative characters over the female parent. Heterosis in vegetative characters changed between anthesis and maturity, which suggests different rates of development in the hybrids and their parents. © 1985.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141549668

Local population differentiation in plant-pathogen compatibility may be related to A. bracteata's high degree of self-pollination. Limited long-distance recombination in A. bracteata due to self-pollination and spatially restricted pollen flow may be a major factor preventing the evolution of increased plant resistance to fungal attack.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022173693

The colour-constancy of individual bees was not altered when the scent of all rewards was changed to peppermint. However, when the scent of only one colour morph was changed, some bees remained constant to colour, whereas others switched colour attachment and remained constant to odour.

A change in the colour of all flowers did not reduce the level of odour-constant foraging.

Scop. has been thought to be completely or almost completely dioecious, with clear morphological and functional differences between males that set an average number of less than 0.1 viable seeds per capitulum and females that produce no pollen. An investigation of three populations in southern Britain showed that 15 % of the clones with polleniferous male flowers were in fact hermaphrodite, with high or fairly high seed yields (10 to 65 seeds per capitulum) and a further 11 % were subhermaphrodites with seed yields of 2 to 10 seeds per capitulum. The flowers and capitula of the hermaphrodites and subhermaphrodites closely resembled those of typical male clones at the flowering stage, but their fruiting capitula ranged from typically male to typically female in appearance. The mean size and weight of the seeds set on hermaphrodites and subhermaphrodites were similar to those of seeds set on females, and seed viability was high in most hermaphrodites and subhermaphrodites. Some hermaphrodites had higher seed yields per capitulum than the overall mean for females. Pollen output per flower was lower in hermaphrodites than in typical males, but pollen from hermaphrodites was fertile and gave high seed?set when used to pollinate female flowers. Hermaphrodites were self?fertile, although seed?sets on selfing were relatively low. In the hermaphrodites, the pollen contribution relative to that of typical males ranged from 0.24 to 0.85, and the ovule contribution relative to that of pure females ranged from 0.13 to 1.29.

In both cases, annuals do not accrue any advantage by virtue of their shorter generation time, and the selective advantage between the 2 life histories is dependent upon the number of seeds produced by annual and biennial forms, and upon the survival of vegetative plants and seeds. In particular, one must study the survival of newly germinated plants in their 1st year relative to the survival of 1-yr-old vegetative plants, and the population dynamics of seeds in the seed bank (mortality and control of emergence). Any attempt to explain why there are as many biennial species as there are must focus on the population dynamics (including the seed stage) and habitat requirements of the species, rather than simply the generation time. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0022180650

Seedlings were produced when the Petunia species and N. tabacum were used as the maternal parents; however, most of these had the identical somatic chromosome complement of the maternal parent. With crosses involving P. axillaris as the maternal parent, a low frequency of haploids was also produced. Due to the potential of haploids in basic and applied genetic research, additional experiments were carried out to determine whether in vitro pollination was necessary to stimulate haploid production and to more closely define the optimal time for ovule excision and culture. Four treatments were applied to accomplish these objectives. They were: placentas cultured prior to the time of anthesis, with and without pollination, and placentas cultured after the time of anthesis, with and without pollination. In vitro pollination had no effect on the frequency of haploids produced. Placenta attached ovules cultured prior to the time of anthesis produced significantly more haploids than those cultured after anthesis. The preanthesis treatment produced a frequency of 6.5 haploids per 100 ovaries cultured. The culture of placenta attached ovules provides an alternative to anther culture as a means for haploid production. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",Haploid production; In vitro pollination; Ovary culture; Petunia; Placenta culture; Tissue culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038955893

Pollination of the triple recessive line W127 (an2an2rtrtan1) with irradiated pollen of the triple dominant line M1 (An2An2RtRtAn1An1) led to the recovery of at least 3.3% induced an2 recessives.

It is concluded that An2 is located distally in the short arm, Rt and An1 in the long arm of chromosome VI. Deleted chromosomes are not transmitted to the next generation, neither through the male nor through the female; transmission of the dominant markers in the long arm of chromosome VI is possible after completion of the chromosome by crossing-over.

The contributions of four clones were found to be sexually asymmetric. One clone, for instance, made exclusively female contributions in one flowering period.

Such studies have shown that a gene causing an increased rate of self-fertilization has an advantage because the mother transmits genes via both pollen and egg to selfed progeny5, and thereby evades the 'cost of meiosis'6-8. Selfing also may be advantageous if the amount of pollen available to fertilize ovules by outcrossing is limited1,2,4,6. However, these advantages are offset, at least partially, if the fitness of selfed progeny is lower than that of outcrossed progeny, due to inbreeding depression1,2,6,7,9,10. Biogeographical evidence suggests that reduced pollinator activity may be sufficient to counteract this disadvantage and permit the evolution of selfing in populations in ecologically marginal areas1-4, but direct evidence is usually lacking. Here we show that the self-fertile homostyle variant of the primrose Primula vulgaris, which reaches high frequencies in certain populations11, experiences a fertility advantage, in terms of seeds per plant, as a result of its high rate of self-fertilization. © 1984 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021628648

The flower pigments were chemically analysed and identified as delphinidin monoglucoside and ?-carotene.Thrips are regular pollinators of Lantana under Delhi conditions. Pollination was identified as the trigger for rapid anthocyanin synthesis. Even the presence of one pollen grain on the stigma of a yellow flower was sufficient to cause colour change. Injection of a suspension of pollen into flowers opened in vitro caused pigment changes. An extract of Lantana pollen was also able to simulate the effect of pollination, suggesting the involvement of a pollen factor. The post-pollination shift in petal colouration is caused by the masking of carotenoids by differential amounts of anthocyanin. As thrips are attracted to only yellow flowers, chromatic changes play a role in conserving pollinator energy. © 1984 Oxford University Press.",Anthecology; Floral pigments; Lantana camara; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042607332

Treatments consisted of mixtures of compatible and self-incompatible pollen at ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:9 applied once or twice or followed by self-pollination. Selfing only, whether once or twice, produced virtually no fruits or seeds, while mixed pollinations did. Generally, fruit set tended to decrease and the self-seed to increase with increasing amounts of self pollen in the pollinations. The pioncer-pollen method (compatible in advance of self pollen) appeared more effective than the mentor pollen method (compatible and self pollen mixed). The use of viable instead of dead mentor/pioneer pollen causes competition for the ovules with the self pollen, but has the advantage that, in addition to some self-seed, other seeds are formed which, e.g. in apple, are necessary to keep the fruits on the tree until harvest. Fruit set was moderately reduced at ratios of compatible pollen to self pollen not exceeding 1:9 with pear and 1:5 with apple which constitute maximal ratios in practice as regards pollinator trees: trees of the main cultivar. In fruit orchards and probably in nature with other species, the interaction between compatible and self pollen may result in more self-seed, and so suggests that inbreeding played a greater part in the evolution of self-incompatible species, than the meager results of articial self-pollination imply. © 1984 Dr. H.

The male phase lasts four times as long as the female phase, and male flowers contain about 50% more nectar than female flowers. This suggests that the bulk of allocation to the flower is designed to ensure the dispersal of pollen rather than the fertilization of ovules. Honeybees, wasps and bumble bees all land on male flowers more often than would be expected by chance, and, having landed, wasps and bumble bees are more likely to enter a male flower than a female flower. The frequency of male flowers in the diet therefore exceeds their frequency in the population. This preference, although strong and consistent, is only partial, since some female flowers are included in the diet. We propose two hypotheses to account for the observed partial preference, the first based on competition between bees for flowers, and the second asserting that the bees detect nectar levels directly without using floral gender as a cue. The results of an experiment in which the most obvious gender cue, the androecium, was removed are consistent with the second hypothesis. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021538341

These two interspecific hybrids were highly cross-compatible and more than two thousand trispecific progenies were produced from 17 double crosses. All doublecross hybrids were perennial and showed a wide range of morphological variations intermediate to both parents in vegetative and inflorescence characteristics. Some crosses resulted in sublethal progenies. Chromosomes paired mainly as bivalents (-x15.88) or remained as univalents. At metaphase I, trivalents, quadrivalents, an occasional hexavalent and a high frequency of bivalents indicated some homeology among the genomes of the three species. Delayed separation of bivalents, unequal segregation of multivalents, lagging chromosomes, and chromatin bridges were observed at anaphase I. Although approximately 93% of the double-cross hybrids were male-sterile, pollen stainability in male-fertile plants ranged up to 94%. Seed set ranged from 0 to 37 seed per inflorescence in 71 plants under open-pollinated conditions. Apomictic embryo sac development was observed in double-cross progenies when crosses involved a pearl millet x P. squamulatum apomictic hybrid as pollen parent.

The system appears to have some degree of specificity for the O2 locus, because the majority of spontaneous O2 mutations are responsive to Bg. The component at the controlled locus undergoes frequent changes in state, while the Bg element appears more stable. Bg activity was revealed in 11 out of 108 open-pollinated varieties of maize. Most of the newly isolated Bg elements are linked with the O2 locus. The timing of induction of reversion events (which are restricted to mitotic division leading to egg or pollen maturation and to the developing endosperm) appears to correlate with the degree of linkage between Bg and the O2 locus.

Three subpopulations of IL677a, the source of se, and six su Se inbreds were included for comparison. Mature dry kernels of between two and four successive generations of these populations were analyzed. Immature kernels at two developmental stages (21 and 35 days after pollination) were also analyzed for one generation. Eleven of the breeding populations closely resemble IL677a, with high sucrose at the edible stage (21 days after pollination) and maltose accumulating as the seeds matured. In most instances, the distinctive sugar profiles were observed consistently in dry seeds of various generations. Hence, it appears that the se trait can be transferred successfully into su cultivars having various genetic backgrounds. The remaining seven breeding populations possessed elevated sucrose and glucose compared to most of the standard su Se inbreds, but maltose did not accumulate during seed maturation. It is not clear whether se was transferred to these populations and its expression modified or whether another trait was responsible.

Floral morphology, nectar flow pattern, and observations of visitor behaviour, all indicate that flowers are specialised for hummingbird pollination. The principal pollinator in Guanacaste Province during the dry season was the cinnamon hummingbird (Amazilia rutila); numerous other flower visitors removed nectar and pollen but only hummingbirds effected pollination. Anthers have dehisced and stigmas are receptive by dawn, and flowers function for a single day, although the corolla may persist for two days before abscission. Peak nectar production occurs in the early morning coinciding with highest visitation rates of pollinators. Pollen grains are large and linked by viscin threads which probably aid in pollen transport. About 50% of flowers set fruit; the fleshy fruit usually contain three or four seeds and are probably dispersed by birds. Dispersal of pollen and fruit by birds gives a large neighbourhood size consistent with the early successional habitat of M. arboreus. © 1984 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Costa Rica; Fruit production; Hummingbird pollination' viscin threads; M alvaviscus arboreus; Nectar flow; Nectar theft; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021539479

Principal flower visitors are trapling hermit hummingbirds; inflorescences are inhabited by nectarivorous hummingbird flower mites that move between inflorescences by riding in the hummingbirds' nares. Heliconia inflorescences flower for 40-200 days, providing long-term sources of copious nectar (30-60 ?l per flower), but each Heliconia flower lasts only a single day. As an inflorescence ages the interval increases between open flowers within a bract; wet-season inflorescences produce open flowers more slowly than dry-season conspecifics. Estimated daily energy expenditures for hermit hummingbirds demonstrate that slow production of short-lived open flowers plus low inflorescence density preclude territorial defense of Heliconia by the hermits. Heliconia flowering patterns are viewed as a means of (i) regulating reproductive investment by the plants through staggered flower production over long periods of time, and (ii) maintaining outcrossing by necessitating a traplining visitation pattern by its hummingbird pollinators. I suggest that Heliconia exhibit a two-tiered pollination system by using hermit hummingbirds primarily for outcrossing and using hummingbird flower mites primarily for self-pollination. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021538342

One of the two types, which consists of small bees (mainly Andrena spp. and Lasioglossum spp.), is characterized by nondiscriminating behavior for collecting pollen and is commonly found in Epimedium. The other type, which comprises medium sized Tetralonia nipponensis and larger Bombus diversus queens as main components, showed flower-dependent foraging fidelity associated with nectar-sucking behavior. T. nipponensis with a shorter proboscis pollinated flowers with a shorter spur of E. trifoliatobinatum and of a part of E. s sempervirens, while the queen of B. diversus with a longer proboscis pollinated longer spurred flowers of E. grandiflorum and E. sempervirens. In the populations of putative hybrid-derivatives which show gradational variations of spur length, bees of the pollencollecting type pollinated any flower non-discriminately while bees of the nectar-foraging type tended to visit the flowers with spur lengths corresponding to their proboscis length. These observations suggest that the pollen-collecting bees play an important role for gene flow among the Epimedium species, and the nectar-foraging bees reinforce the isolation between the species by their selective pollination. Reproductive isolation between species of Epimedium is discussed in relation with some practical behavior, such as flying power, of the pollinators. © 1984 The Botanical Society of Japan.",Berberidaceae; Epimedium; Hybridization; Isolation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249182508

The flowers open continuously from 0800-2000 h providing a temporally predictable rich source of nectar and pollen. Recently opened flowers may reduce the ability of bees to discriminate between resource rich and poor patches and encourage systematic foraging within patches. The continuous opening of flowers coupled with protandry also results in some flowers of most capitula being in the staminate and others in the pistillate phase. Autogamy is highly unlikely due to strong protandry and the spatial separation of anthers and stigmas. Geitonogamy, at least that mediated by Bombus is unlikely because the pollen is spread over a relatively large area of the wings, which reduces the likelihood of a stigma contacting just deposited pollen. Because pollen is transferred from the much smaller coxal area of Anthophora and other bees that mistake the stigmas of early pistillate phase flowers for stamens some geitonogamy seems inevitable. However, the delayed receptivity of young stigmas to self-pollen decreases the likelihood of self-pollen germinating on such stigmas. Older stigmas are equally receptive to self- and cross-pollen and the number of pollen grains germinating and pollen tubes reaching the base of the style increases with flower age. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021537939

This system involves the existence of two flower morphs which are characterized by reciprocal phases of receptivity of the stigmas and pollen release. In some genera (Persea, Cinnamomum), nectar is produced as a reward for the flower visitors, while in other genera (Aniba, Clinostemon, Licaria), nectar is absent and pollen seems to be the only reward. This implies that in this case the flowers in the female stage must be deceptive flowers. In dioecious species of the genera Ocotea and Nectandra, both the male and female flowers attract the visitors with nectar. The pollen-ovule ratio of the Lauraceae is comparatively low. - The type of reproductive system that characterizes the Lauraceae, comprising functional dioecy, small, inconspicuously coloured flowers, pollination by small bees, and large, one-seeded fruits dispersed by birds, is quite prominent among trees of various families in the tropical lowland forest. The relationship between the different modes of flowering within the Lauraceae and the causes for the correlation of their reproductive traits are discussed. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; dichogamy; dioecy; dispersal; Lauraceae; Meliponinae; Neotropics; Pollination; reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000376480

The mean number of seeds maturing within individual fruits is defined as brood size, and is correlated with different modes of dispersal and strategies of ovule packging. Annuals also have significantly higher brood sizes (21.7) than perennials (<9.9). Among perennials, woody plants have both lower S/O ratios (32.7%) and brood sizes (3.3) than herbaceous perennials (57.2%, 13.5). S/O ratios appear to be largely determined genetically, whereas resource limitations are perhaps more critical in terms of regulating flower production. Among perennials, increased exposure to predators and pathogens is suggested as the best explanation for theevolution of breeding systems favoring genetic recombination. The maintenance of genetic polymorphisms, however, inevitably increases the frequency of lethal and sub-lethal allelic combinations (and perhaps mutations?), that appear to be responsible for the lower S/O ratios in perennials. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021545822

This result has implications for field studies of pollination: observational measures of pollinator attentiveness do not necessarily provide an, accurate basis for inferring reproductive success. Further, these results indicate that, although pollination is essential for seed set in this species, reproduction is not limited by pollination. Many flowers that were visited numerous times by hummingbirds and that received pollen in excess of the number of ovules per flower failed to produce fruits. If pollen is limiting, it is pollen quality rather than quantity that is inadequate. Patterns of reproduction in this species were as predicted if resource availability limits seed set (Stephenson 1981): (1) among mature fruits there was an excess of fruits with full seed set (4 or 5 seeds) and (2) probability of fruit, set decreased over the reproductive season. However, resource availability was not the only determinant of seed set in this species: there was also variation among individuals that seems unrelated to either pollen or resource availability. Reproductive success thus appears to be determined by several factors and cannot be described as simply pollen or resource limited. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021562772

They concluded that the birds were not foraging optimally. We show here that their birds probably maximized a different utility function, the net energy per unit volume consumed (NEVC), which appears to be an optimal choice on a time scale longer than that of a foraging bout. Our own experiments with Archilochus colubris support the conclusion that hummingbirds make foraging decisions that maximize NEVC. A simulation model shows that, in nature, NEVC maximization would require fewer foraging trips and visits to fewer flowers per day to balance daily energy budgets. For territorial birds this can lead to smaller territory sizes and reduced costs of territorial defense. Plants that evolutionarily increase corolla length to enhance pollinator specificity need only increase nectar concentration slightly to maintain the same net energy per unit volume consumed (NEVC) by a given hummingbird pollinator. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021537267

The basic scheme for forest tree improvement involves selection of superior parent trees, assembling them as clones in seed orchards in special designs to promote maximum cross pollination among the different clones and reduce inbreeding. Interprovenance and interspecific hybridisation are also resorted to in special situations. Forest tree improvement work through selection and breeding has been in progress in India for the last nearly two decades.

Moench and S. halepense (L.) Pers. (2n = 4x = 40) and to detect possible cytoplasmic effects. Crossabilities ranged from 71 to 83 percent when S. halepense was used as female parent to 0 to 33 percent when S. bicolor was used as female parent in crosses between sorghum and johnson grass. Interspecific hybrids were vigorous, leafy and more closely resembled S. halepense than S. bicolor in perennial growth habit, open panicle, seed color and shape, and seed shattering. Stem thickness, rhizome expression, and seed size were intermediate to the parents. Some F2 progenies segregated for plant height and panicle compactness. The interspecific hybrids were less senescent than the sorghum parents. Metaphase I chromosomes associated mainly as bivalents and quadrivalents. No cytoplasmic differences were observed for morphological characteristics and chromosome behavior between reciprocal crosses. Open-pollinated seed set for all interspecific hybrids ranged from 74 to 85 percent. Selfed seed set ranged from 18 to 95 percent. Interspecific hybrids with sorghum cytoplasm produced less selfed seed and less stainable pollen indicating a possible cytoplasmic-genic interaction. It should be possible to manipulate the germplasm of the two species at the tetraploid level and then backcross selected genotypes to diploid sorghum to produce improved diploid sorghum with characteristics transferred from S. halepense. © 1984 American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008805554

Recent studies on the pollination ethology of the agaonids have shown that besides the passive mode of pollen transfer (topocentric pollination) an active and deliberate type of pollen transfer (ethodynamic pollination) exists, which is associated with the development of specialised structures like the mesothoracic pollen pockets and the fore coxal corbiculae.

The extent of interdependence is regulated by phenology, floral characters as well as by form, structure and behaviour of the pollinators. During evolution flowers have developed various strategies for attracting insects. p ]We have studied the biology of pollination in Lantana camara, a pernicious weed. The colour variant used in this study bears yellow flowers at anthesis which subsequently change to orange, scarlet and magenta. Lantana is self-compatible but needs insects for pollination. Thrips have been found to be consistent and regular pollinators. They visit only yellow flowers and avoid flowers of other colours. Colour change is triggered by pollination and functions in the partitioning of the pollinator and consequently helps in conserving pollinator energy. Whereas butterflies visit lantana in two seasons, thrips are associated with it all through the year and play an important role in seed production. By adapting to thrips pollination Lantana has become highly widespread. © 1984 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Anthecology; entomophily; floral pigments; Lantana camara; thrips; weed biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-5544244119

To elucidate the genetic origins of New Zealand maize, 5 open-pollinated varieties for which viable seed was still available were grown and described. These varieties were Marigold, Motiti, a Maori selection, a Maori sweetcorn, and Horsetooth. Marigold was similar to the Cateto flints from eastern South America or the Mediterranean region; the Maori sweetcorn was similar to the Black Mexican sweetcorns of New York State, USA; and Horsetooth was similar to the Hickory King complex from southern USA.

Distance from the nearest upwind natural shelterbelt explained 57%of the variation in exportable yield per vine. Major losses resulted from frictional marks caused by fruit rubbing against each other and against plant canes. Mean proportions of exportable sized fruit rejected for this reason varied from 310%(for rows adjacent and to the lee of natural windbreaks) to 3044%(34 rows downwind of artificial shelter). Trends in foliar damage and vegetative growth were similar to those observed in wind-rub damage.

In comparison, a property using a Tatura trellis system with minimal internal shelter lost only 1%of its fruit from wind-rub damage.

The hypothesis could be rejected if one or the other selfer was more similar genetically to an allopatric population than to the sympatric one. Both selfers were monomorphic at all loci whereas the outcrossing populations were polymorphic at nearly half of them. The two selfers had the same genes at 32 loci but had different ones at eight loci. The pink selfer was not more similar to the allopatric populations than to the sympatric one, consistent with the Moore & Lewis model. The evidence also supported their proposal that the white selfer originated from the pink one and not independently. The electrophoretic evidence was valuable because it permitted qualitative comparisons (presence versus absence of particular alleles) between the selfer and the several outcrossing populations; such analysis was not previously possible because the latter populations are morphologically and cytologically similar. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Clarkia xantiana; Electrophoresis; isozymes; Onagraceae; phylogenetic models,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002128255

Effects differed between the cultivars. In 'H-Mino', BA (100 mg/l) and glutamic acid, folic acid and nicotinic acid (500 mg/l) resulted in higher fruit set and higher number of seeds per pollinated flower. In 'Mino', BA and NAA (100 mg/l) and glutamic acid and glycine (500 mg/l) induced a high number of seeds per pollinated flower. These chemicals, however, induced parthenocarpic fruit set, especially GA3. From the observation of pollen on stigmas washed with glutamic acid, it appeared that the pollen-tube penetrated into a papilla cell after 1 hour and openings of papillae and detached pollen grains and tubes were found after 2 hours as the result of successful pollentube penetration of papillae. Pollen was heated at 50°C for 30, 45 or 60 minutes, at 60°C for 15, 30 or 45 minutes and at 70°C for 10, 20 or 30 minutes prior to self-pollination. In 'H-Mino', 60 and 70°C were effective, and expecially 60°C for 15 or 30 minutes resulted a higher percentage fruit set and more seeds per fruit.

Hairy col-letid bees (Leioproctus spp.) were observed on the flowers of 4 of 7 orchards in 197879, 6 of 9 in 197980, but none of 9 in 198081. However, their numbers were generally so low that, except in 1 orchard in 197879, and 2 in 197980, their effect on pollination was probably insignificant. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and other insects were too few to be of importance in the sites observed. Honey bee visitation to kiwifruit flowers in 197879 was reduced by competition from other pollen sources, which might explain the poor fruit size that season. Competition was minimal, and there was good bee visitation in 197980 (when fruit size was generally good) and in 198081 (when it was unsatisfactory). In 198081 there were more flowers and consequently more fruit, in all orchards compared with the 197980 season, and this physiological load probably caused some of the reduction in weight. In 198081, 32.7% of fruit weighed less than 72 g, even though fruit less than 93 g contained significantly more seed than in the previous 2 seasons. This suggested that pollination was satisfactory, but that adverse weather conditions may have retarded fruit growth. Even in poor seasons some orchards achieve excellent results, and in good seasons some orchards have very poor results, which suggests that factors such as position of male vines relative to females, cultural methods, and orchard microclimates may be important. © 1984 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The unit of pollination is a ball-like capitulum composed of many small flowers. Specialized flower types are arranged in different ways in the 3 taxonomic sections of the genus. Nine species in 2 sections are bat-pollinated. Individual capitula open for one night, secrete copious nectar, have distinctive smells, are bright red, or yellow, or both, and are held beyond the foliage or rarely within the crown. Andromonoecy occurs in most species; several have a proportion of their capitula with all the fertile flowers functionally male, probably indicating a mechanical constraint on fruit production. Some species appear to be protandrous. Eight species of bats from 4 subfamilies of the Phyllostomidae were caught at flowering trees. The most important pollinator is Phyllostomus discolor. Sympatric chiropterophilous species reduce competition for pollinators primarily by phenological separation. Non-flying mammals, hummingbirds, bees, wasps, moths, and other insects take nectar or pollen or both but none is likely to be important in the pollination of the chiropterophilous species.

Soon after pollination wounding of the stigma of detached flowers there was a burst of ethylene production by the gynoecium, which reached a maximum after 3 h. A subsequnt more gradual rise in ethylene production by the flowers was accompanied by blueing, wilting, and senescence of the corolla. Treatment with 1 ?l ethylene 1?1 accelerated the onset of senescence as measured first by color change and then by wilting of the corolla. These changes were further accelerated by using older flowers or higher concentrations of ethylene. Senescence was also hastened by supplying 1?aminocyclopropane?1?carboxylic acid (ACC) through the flower pedicel. Petunia pollen contained high concentrations of ACC (300 nmol g?1); treatment of stigmas with ACC (1 mM) caused a 4?fold increase in their ethylene production.

White corollas remain on the plant at least one full day before withering. This variety of C. humilis is visited by a diversity of insects but most commonly by a species in the family Empididae and several species of beeflies. Insects visit flowers with yellow coronas significantly more often than flowers with totally white corollas. Presumably this is because only flowers with yellow coronas produce nectar. The 2 flower types also produce different odors, and their corollas may differ in patterns of UV reflectance. The changes in corolla color and/or the changes in other floral characteristics apparently serve as signals to discourage pollinators. Hand pollination experiments revealed that the flowers are self-incompatible and that the viability of the pollen and the receptivity of the stigma are substantially less in flowers with totally white corollas.

Higher abundance and diversity of native bees were found on natural vegetation than on berry crops. Native bee populations on berry crops increased from 1981 to 1982, although diversity was similar. Native bees were not abundant enough to ensure adequate pollination of berry crops, and therefore, the use of managed honey bees is advisable.

Rubus idaeus is locally important in the US Northeast in areas subject to windthrow, fire, and man-made disturbances, while R. pubescens often forms a significant portion of the ground cover of shaded, damp, woodland areas. The life history pattern of R. idaeus is based upon the short term build up and slow decay of a large seed bank. Vegetative reproduction is more important in the eventual spread of R. pubescens. Rubus pubescens produces relatively small quantities of nectar and flowers during a brief 1-2-wk period late in May. Synchronous flowering probably minimizes the incidence of flora predation and makes the low nectar flowers more attractive by reducing the pollinators' flight time. Rubus idaeus is an abundant species, which offers almost unlimited supplies of nectar during at least part of its extended 3-4 month flowering season.

(Ranunculaceae) was studied at localities ranging from deciduous to spruce forest. The species is selfincompatible and possibly facultatively apomictic. No anemogamy seems to occur. In deciduous forest, the plant is primarily pollinated by pollenforaging and matesearching Byturus ochraceus (Scriba) (Coleoptera). It flowers during a period between emergence of the beetle and onset of anthesis of the prime pollen source and only larval host plant, Geum urbanum L. (Rosaceae). The beetles sit on the suitably long anther filaments or on top of the stigma. Floral morphology promotes pollinationperforming movements by the beetle. The complex floral fragrance seems to induce closerange behaviour, i.e. alighting and/or foraging. Flies become abundant visitors only shortly before anthesis is over, and their contribution is small. Large syrphids are relatively effective as pollinators, since they grasp the stamens near the base and often touch the stigma with pollendusted parts of their bodies. Due to lack of its foodplant, B. ochraceus is absent at spruce forest localities and northwards. At these localities flowering is delayed until the main fly appearance, and the flowers are heavily pollinated by several syrphids and muscids. At three deciduousforest localities a second flowering took place with new, juxtaposed inflorescences on separate stalks. The distribution of such inflorescences within the population along with the distribution and abundance of pollinators among the two generations of flowers suggest that these inflorescences occur as a response to low rate of pollination in the first anthesis.

The flowers are usually borne in fascicles of 2 or 3, and within each fascicle, 4-9 day separate the sequential opening of individual 1-day flowers. Phyllotaxy is distichous on more or less horizontal branches and the tree architecture conforms to Troll's model. The continuous and regular growth patterns, with frequent branching, facilitates continuous initiation of supra-axillary flowering fascicles, flowers are pollinated above the branches by bees, and fruit is dispersed from below the branches by bats. By elongation and erection of the pedicel, buds are raised into a flowering position, and following pollination, young fruit are lowered to a position for dispersal. As these movements of reproductive structures allow for pollination and dispersal simultaneously from different positions, it is suggested that for a continuously flowering species this may be a mechanism whereby pollinator-disperser interference is avoided.-Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021532535

More limited observations were made for A. hunsteinii and A. angustifolia. The investigation revealed considerable variation among species of Araucaria with respect to pollination features. The bract scale of the receptive cone of both A. cunninghamii and A. heterophylla has a stoma-free furrow which directs pollen grains onto a thin flange on the tip of the ovuliferous scale. The bract scale of A. bidwillii bears stomata over most of its surface, and is broadly scalloped so that pollen grains are deposited in a band across both bract and ovuliferous scales. On germination, the pollen tubes of these three species penetrate the epidermis of the scale and for a short distance grow beneath the surface before emerging and travelling, without branching or major deviation, towards the proximal end of the ovuliferous scale. On reaching the micropyle, the pollen tubes enter the nucellus. In known features, pollination in A. hunsteinii resembles that in A. bidwillii. The pollen tubes of A.

In M. lanceolatus, as in most species of the Violaceae, the pollen is concealed by apical appendages of the anther connectives and fusion along the edges of adjacent anthers. Nectar is concealed within purple petals. In the flowers of M. ramiflorus and M. micranthus, the anthers are free and the apical appendages are much reduced, so the pollen is exposed. The petals are white or yellow and are recurved, exposing the nectaries. M. lanceolatus represents the more primitive condition, and the other two species show a loss of specialisation of flower structure, the reverse of the usual trend in floral evolution in the angiosperms.

Strong pollen trimorphism in Pontederia cordata enables an evaluation of this hypothesis. In an investigation of pollen flow patterns in different parts of the North American range of the species, legitimate pollination of some morphs was observed in all but one population investigated. However at only one site (Ft. McCoy, Florida) was Darwin's hypothesis confirmed for the three floral morphs. The long?styled morph most frequently exhibited legitimate pollination, the mid?styled morph was intermediate, and the short?styled morph rarely experienced legitimate pollination. Temporal variation in pollen flow was observed during the flowering season of P. cordata. Total stigmatic pollen loads decreased as the density of inflorescences and activity of pollinators declined. In spite of variable total loads the legitimate component was relatively constant in the long? and mid?styled forms, while in the short?styled form this measure increased as the season progressed. Little variation was detected between stigmatic samples collected at different times during a single day. Legitimate pollination may be inhibited by local foraging of pollinators and the spatial segregation of floral morphs. At Paugh Lake (Ontario) over 75% of all bumble bee flights are among the five nearest neighbours of a particular inflorescence. In the same population, there is a probability of over 70% that the nearest three neighbours of an inflorescence are of the same floral morph. Despite these influences, legitimate pollination occurs in P. cordata, suggesting substantial pollen carryover. Copyright © 1984, Wiley Blackwell.

Although this species possesses characteristics typical of moth-pollinated plants, only diurnal pollinators were documented, primarily Hesperiidae, Pieridae, and Apidae. Pollinators were scarce throughout the study, yet vectors were necessary for successful capsule set. Average capsule set per plant was lowest (32.2%) in 1979 when 362 plants bloomed and highest in 1980 (80.2%) when 202 plants flowered. Capsule set was limited by pollinator activity. Adaptations of P. blephariglottis, including sequential flowering, length of receptivity, nectar production and inflorescence size, enable consistently successful reproduction regardless of microhabitat. This orchid is well-adapted to reproduce in environments experiencing periods of unfavorable weather and low pollinator abundance.-from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021535049

Clairv. was studied in several wild populations near Swansea and in an experimental population to determine the extent of differences between the sexes in floral morphology, nectar production, and insect visits to flowers, and the effects of these differences on seed set. Male flowers are larger than female flowers and are borne more densely over a longer period. Male flowers have longer and more frequently white corona scales which may mimic the projecting white styles of female flowers. Male and female flowers were observed to secrete similar quantities of nectar sugar on the first morning of opening, but female flowers secreted more than males subsequently, and the total volumes of nectar secreted by female flowers were considerably greater. Male plants varied more than females in the total quantity of nectar sugar secreted per flower. Nectar concentration was nearly always greater in male flowers than in female flowers. Bumblebees, particularly Bombus hortorum (L.), B. pascuorum (Scop.) and B. terrestris (L.), were the most important visitors to the. flowers of S. dioica in the study sites, with some honeybees [Apis mellifera (L.)], butterflies (mainly Pieridae) and hoverflies (Syrphidae). Some visitors, including those that were most numerous at some sites, made most or all of their visits illegitimately. In the field in 1980 many visitors were observed to discriminate in favour of male flowers, which were much more numerous than female flowers. In the experimental population in 1981, many visitors discriminated in favour of female flowers, which were more numerous than in the field populations but were still substantially outnumbered by male flowers. Some individual bumblebees showed a change in preferences during the day, disciminating in favour of female flowers only during the afternoon, when the nectar resources available from female flowers were proportionately greater. The total numbers of visits that were observed to female and male flowers in the experimental population corresponded closely with the total quantities of nectar sugar available from each sex. The importance of the different insect visitors and of their discrimination between sexes in pollination is discussed. Seed set did not appear to be reduced by discrimination or insufficiency of pollinator visits in closely spaced plants, but was reduced in plants isolated by distances of 15 m or greater.

Despite some overnight depletion by moths and other invertebrates, more nectar was present in flowers at dawn than at the preceding dusk. Significant nectar depletion occurred within a few hours after dawn, mainly due to foraging by two honeyeater species. Lichmera indistincta and Phylidonyris nigra. Thereafter, nectar availability was maintained at relatively low levels, principally because of foraging by honeyeaters and honey bees. Apis mellifera, that became active during the warmer part of the day. Although individual honeyeaters consumed more nectar than A. mellifera, honey bees were so abundant that their total impact was greater than that of either honeyeater species for much of the day.

Models were based on the Lotka-Volterra competition model, to which were added terms representing the positive frequency-dependent effect (minority disadvantage) as a result of lowered fertility caused by the receipt of inappropriate pollen from the other cytotype. A new polyploid may persist by replacing its diploid parent as a result of the combination of a very small diploid population, the existence of an unstable equilibrium between the 2 cytotypes, and chance events (probably the most common route); by coexisting with it as the result of niche separation; or by outcompeting and replacing it (probably very rare). However, the conditions for all of these possibilities are quite restrictive. The model and results are applicable in some degree to the establishment of other novel cytotypes, and also to pairs of species that compete for resources and also experience minority disadvantage (perhaps because of competition for pollinators) with respect to each other.-Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021537757

Estimates of the likely reproductive effort that would be borne by nonexistent small females suggest, however, that there is a size threshold below which female reproduction is prohibitively costly. This threshold creates selection for sex-changing, but because of temporal fluctuations in seed production and sex ratio, the magnitude and even the direction of this selection are not constant. Such fluctuations make it unlikely that jack-in-the-pulpits ever attain the simple sort of optimum sex-changing strategy described by theory predicated on assumptions of population stability. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021617650

In S2 to S7 progenies grown from plump seed, most plants had 21 pairs of normal wheat chromosomes during meiosis, apparently normal anthers and abundant pollen at anthesis, but reduced seed-set, and both plump and shriveied seed in their selfed and crossed spikes. In the reciprocal cross, spikes of control wheat plants pollinated with S2, S3, or S4 pollen had complete seed-set and plump seed, but the size and viability of some of the seed were reduced. The viable plump seed produced plants resembling S2, S3, or S4 male parents. It was concluded that plump and viable seed produced plants heterozygous for the alien genetic factor(s) controlling these traits and that the gametes and zygotes without the alien genetic factors had functional disadvantage and resulted in shriveled and reduced seed-set in the selfed and crossed spikes. The homozygosity for the alien genes was detrimental, and sporophytic effects controlled the inviability of some of the plump seed, especially those having embryos without the alien gene(s) from S3 or S4 plants used as male. An alternative explanation was that genetically instable plasmid-like factors may have been introduced from rye to wheat and abortion of gametes and zygotes without a certain number of these factors resulted in reduced seed-set, and inviable and shriveled seed. © 1984 American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957218471

Two types of flower patches were used; those simulating a population of flowers, dimorphic for colour, and grids simulating a single colour?dimorphic inflorescence. 3. In the simulated population of flowers bees were individually constant to colour over a range of reward volumes and flower patch sizes. 4. Each bee remained individually constant to a flower morph when visiting a population?type grid but changed to random visitation on the simulated inflorescence. 5. On the simulated inflorescence, with morphs providing unequal qualities of reward, most bees foraged on the higher molarity morph. 6. Most, but not all bees, failed to minimize uncertainty on the simulated inflorescence. 7. On the simulated inflorescence, bees failed to optimize when one morph provided a greater reward volume than did the other. 8.

The genetics of this facuitative parthenocarpy in Severianin was verified as being controlled by a single recessive gene, pat-2. Expressivity of pat-2 is strong in environments unfavorable for normal pollination and fertilization of flowers in tomato; for example, high night and day temperatures in midsummer in Urbana, Illinois. Plant breeders should find this trait useful as an adjunct system to promote fruit setting in tomato, particularly in stress environments where it has the ability to form normal but seedless fruits. Selection for parthenocarpy without the labor-intensive procedure of emasculation is efficient when segregating populations are grown in temperature stress environments.

These results were obtained by pollinating tetraploids with pollen from diploids and vice versa. In the experiment described in the present paper, the classification and conclusions of these earlier experiments are put to the test by crossing the tetraploid plants inter se. The results completely confirm those of the earlier experiments. In addition, they show that there is no dominance between the alleles at either locus in the pollen and that incompatibility only occurs when both an S and a Z allele are matched in the stigma. Two implications of these results are considered. First, that only one S-Z pair in the pollen needs to be matched in the stigma strongly suggests that the growth of incompatible pollen is positively inhibited, rather than that of compatible pollen being positively stimulated. Second, it is shown theoretically that a consequence of this mechanism is that the level of cross-compatibility is appreciably lower in populations of tetraploids relative to those of diploids in which few, but equally frequent alleles are segregating at each locus. If the number of alleles that are segregating in the population exceeds twelve, however, this difference in level of cross-compatibility becomes negligible. The implications of this outcome for plant breeding are briefly considered. © 1984 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966169369

Firstly it is examined the monthly distribution of the blooming periods: out of the 666 considered Angiosperm species, most of which remain in bloom over several months, 518 bloom during May and 495 during April, whilst less than 100 species bloom from September through February. It is then considered the reproductive cyclefrom blooming to seed dispersalwhich is very short in most of the plants. However the authors examine in detail also the cycles of species commonly considered representative for the Mediterranean area (Pinus halepensis Mill., P. pinea L., P. pinaster Aiton, Quercus macrolepis Kotschy, Q. suber L., Q. coccifera L. and Arbutus unedo L.), but in which the reproductive cycles last one year or more. It is also described a short cycle, the cycle of Cytinus hypocistis L. with its peculiar environmental devices. Finally the effects are predicted of drought and rainfalls (the main metereological parameters for the Mediterranean area) on plant reproduction, in particular on both pollination and seed dispersal, namely the two steps which may be more easily affected. Both heavy rainfalls and drought hinder these processes, by damaging the plant themselves and the reproductive apparatuses, or by depressing the vectors of pollen and seed dispersal. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Blooming; Environment; Mediterranean; Phanerogams; Reproductive cicle,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021569217

There was an initial lag before the onset of rapid (linear) seed development, during which the capsule expanded, and this lag varied from 106 days at 15/10µC to 7 days at 36/31µC. The wax concentration in the seed was low during the initial stages of development, but reached a maximum when the seeds were 70-75% of their final dry weight. The maximum rate of dry matter accumulation in the seed increased with temperature up to 33/28µC but, because of the longer growth period at low temperature, seed size at maturity was greatest at 18/13µC. The current work suggests that prolonged periods with temperatures above 36/31µC, or below 15/10µC would be harmful to the development of jojoba seed. The high optimum temperature for growth rate of the seed (33/28µC) and sensitivity to a temperature of 15/10±C, puts jojoba into the same group as many subtropical species. However, the lower optimum temperature for seed weight at maturity (18/13µC) is close to that observed for the temperate cereals. © 1984, CSIRO.

Inbreeding depression occurred in both pollinator and male?sterile inbreds in terms of reduced flower numbers per umbel and a greater proportion of defective pistils. Male?sterile and male?fertile lines differed in their stigma and style characteristics and pattern of development. At flower opening, the styles of male?sterile lines were longer and the stigmatic knob became receptive relatively sooner. The inbred male?sterile line II/3 ms appeared to have a reduced receptive area on its stigmatic knob and remained receptive for a relatively shorter period. Individual lines differed for time of flowering, nectar content and its sugar concentration, and in their effectiveness as male and female parents as judged from pollen tube growth down the style in specific pairings.

Similarly, ELISA detected CLRV in mixtures of one infected bud with four virus?free buds. Intensive bioassays and ELISA showed that in some trees CLRV was restricted to only a few branches whereas in others it occurred throughout the tree. The prevalence of CLRV in unmanaged birch populations in Britain was less (3%) than in Midlands street trees (17%). In CLRV?free birch trees that received pollen from infected ones, ELISA indicated that antigen was introduced into, and multiplied within, the embryos but not the seed coat or the pericarp/wings. In one instance, antigen was detected in a branch of an experimentally pollinated tree but not in those parts of the crown that had been exposed to open pollination. The proportion of seed germinating after crosses in which both parents were CLRV?free was greater than when either or both parents were infected but the largest difference occurred with infection in the female parent. Few embryos seemed to escape invasion with CLRV when the maternal tissue was naturally infected. Overall, seed transmission ranged between 0 and 38% (mean 17%) when only females in a cross were infected, and between 11 and 75% (mean 30%) when only the males were infected. Assuming no selective advantage that would help infected plants to achieve reproductive age, we found that CLRV would be lost from a birch population within two generations if transmitted only through seed. Embryos in seeds from CLRV?infected birch that received CLRV?free pollen differed from their healthy counterparts in being shrunken and suspended in a loosely fibrillar matrix that contained numerous virus?like particles in tubular inclusions. In two trees, CLRV?free pollen tended to fertilise a greater percentage of ovules than did CLRV?infected pollen. Seedlings derived from infected seed and cuttings from naturally?infected trees grew less rapidly than their healthy counterparts. In still air, most birch pollen liberated from a height of 3·5 m fell within 3 m of the drop zone and none was detected 10 m from the source. Field observations on the patterns of virus spread as measured by seedling infection were consistent; about 3% of seedlings from a tree 6·9 m away from the nearest source of inoculum were infected but no infected seedlings were detected in more distant trees, even though each was experimentally infectible with CLRV and pollen from the infected tree germinated on their stigmas.

The average numbers of seed per pod between treatments with time intervals (hours) of 0(self) + 0(red Chinese cabbage), 0+24, 0+48, 0+72 and 0+96 did not show significant differences, but the percentages of hybrid seedlings in progeny lines decreased significantly with the increase of time-intervals between 2 pollinations. The result of treatments with the styles cut off 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 or 48 h after pollination revealed that pollen tubes of own pollen grains grew much more slowly than those of red Chinese cabbage. While the pollen tubes required for normal seed set had nearly all penetrated the style base 6 h after cross-pollination, some pollen tubes lagged behind the style base even 12 h after self-pollination. The selectivity of fertilization was not only expressed in the different growth rates of pollen tubes, but was possibly also related to the time required for pollen tubes to penetrate the embryo sac and for the fusion of male and female nuclei. It is impracticable to use self-compatible lines as parental lines for hybrid seed production, because the average percentage of hybrid seedlings in the progeny under natural field conditions or artificial 0+0 mixed pollination seldom exceeded 90%. However, the result of 9 lines out of 45 self-compatible lines with over 70% hybrid seedlings in their progenies under 0+48 repeated pollination indicated the possibility of using selected slow self-fertilizing lines, i.e. self-compatible lines possessing the property of producing a high percentage of hybrid seeds when pollinated with own pollen grains mixed with foreign grains. © 1984.",Brassica campestris pekinensis; Chinese cabbage; selective fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48749140444

Close to the forest-limit the rate of altitudinal decrease of germinability accelerated, probably due to imperfect pollination when the stand got a more sparse structure. Amount of seed produced is apparently preconditioned by the thermal conditions during the preceding growth period. Germinability was correlated to the mean temperature during late summer and early autumn of the current year. The germination percentage of birch seeds reached a maximum in early winter. In this season effective dispersal agents (drifting on the snow surface) were present.

The concentration of wax in the seed was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and the wax composition and the composition of the ethanolysis products of the wax were determined by gas chromatography. At 21/16µC the wax concentration increased with seed growth until the seed reached 75% of its mature weight and then stabilized at about 45%. The wax concentration in mature seeds was only slightly affected by temperature, except for the extreme treatments of 15/10 and 36/31µC where the concentration was reduced. The main effect of temperature on wax composition was the depression of the percentage of waxes with carbon chain lengths greater than 40 at temperatures over 30/25µC. This depression was associated with a reduction in the percentage of C22 and C24 fatty acids and alcohols. The effects of temperature will have to be taken into account by plant breeders selecting for high wax content or for a particular wax composition. © 1984, CSIRO.

The extent and distribution of larval seed predation was examined in 9 Yucca species in SW USA. The proportion of seeds destroyed by the yucca moth ranged from 3% in Y. schidigera from coastal southern California to 45% in one population of Y. angustissima from southern Utah. This sampling was done in 1979 at which time the Y. schidigera population averaged 0.6 larvae per fruit and the population of Y. angustissima averaged 9.3 larvae per fruit. A 2nd sampling of these populations in 1982 averaged 0.5 for Y. schidigera and 5.6 for Y. angustissima. Several species showed significant differences between populations in the number of larvae per fruit. A large number of fruits were found without larvae.

The late Holocene and interglacial assemblages were dominated by Alnus (alder), whereas the early Holocene and Wisconsinan ones were dominated by Betula (birch) and Artemisia (sage). During the Holocene and probably the last interglaciation, most of the pollen and spores were blown a minimum of 1000 km from low arctic shrub tundra and adjacent subarctic Picea (spruce) forest; these areas were dominated by the arctic air mass during the summer pollinating season. During the Wisconsinan-early Holocene, glacier ice and arctic air were more widespread and pollen sources were more distant; thus, at this time relatively little pollen was incorporated into the ice.

The estimates were 0.29 and 0.28 for neighbor and open pollinations, respectively. The effects of natural inbreeding on juvenile traits, eg germination and early growth, were slight while the effect on height growth increased with age at least to age 7 yr. Neighboring white spruce trees growing in natural stands appear to be related at about the half-sib level (r=0.25). Based on percent full seed, open-pollination approximates a level of inbreeding expected from trees related at level well above that of half-sibs. Differential selection at the pre-embryo to early seedling stages results in progenies again related at the half-sib level. An inbreeding equilibrium probably exists in natural stands of white spruce and this approximates that expected from half-sib matings.

Both sexes of flowers, once open, last a single day, with individual male flowers opening sequentially from a given inflorescence but not necessarily on successive days. First openings in the corollas of flowers were visible by 0730 and maximum expansion was usually reached by late morning. Anthers dehisce and stigmas become receptive by 0930 with both reaching maxima by midday. The flowers produce a sweet nectar and scent which attract, and are easily accessible to, a wide variety of insects visiting the open bowl-shaped flowers. The most abundant insect visitors to the flowers were Homoptera (Aphididae) and Hydrellia and Notiphila spp. (Diptera: Ephydridae). Both groups carry small pollen loads and because of their erratic anthophilous behaviour were not considered important in pollination. Although fewer in number, the more specialized hover flies, Toxomerus marginatus (Diptera: Syrphidae), and solitary bees, Dialictus sp. (Hymenoptera: Halictidae), were more likely to be the primary pollinators. After pollination and the day after anthesis, female flowers are drawn underwater by pedical recurvation and 4-6 wk later mature into globose berrylike fruits. Fruit-sets were 38.3% in naturally pollinated flowers, 96.5% in bagging experiments with hand-pollinations, and absent in bagging experiments for agamospermy with unopened flowers. Poor fruit-set in some populations was thus caused by a lack of effective pollinators.-from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021557838

Asymmetrical coevolution leaves one member of an interacting pair with more potential for response to selection from organisms outside of the mutualism than the other. In a world of ecological flux, this hinders the evolution of finely tuned mutualism. What specificity exists is likely to be at taxonomic levels higher than the species, and will reflect mutually compatible biological groundplans rather than pairwise reciprocal evolution of species pairs. Pairwise coevolution should be largely restricted to depauperate communities, and will almost certainly be rare in highly diverse biotas.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021577744

Consequently, the hyperparasite was in competition with its congeneric host for pollen vectors belonging to the local nectar bird guild (Meliphagidae and Zosteropidae). Amyema miquelii produced flowers that were longer-lived, and had a higher nectar content, than those of A. miraculosum. From mid February through March, A. miquelii plants offered more inflorescences, with open flowers, than A. miraculosum. There was an average of twice as many flowers on an A. miquelii inflorescence as on an A. miraculosum inflorescence, Not surprisingly, more than 70% of avian foraging bouts observed were to A. miquelii only. Eight bird species foraged for nectar on A. miquelii while only five were recorded on A. miraculosum.

The pattern of development of the fruits followed a sigmoid curve, and the beginning of the exponential phase of growth coincided with the beginning of the June drop. 'Monreal Clementine' had very low parthenocarpic fruit set capability, since in the absence of self-pollination, only 2% of the fruits attained maturity. Fruit set of 'Fino Clementine' could be increased dramatically (about 4 times) by using 'Sanguino Doble Fino' orange as the pollinator before anthesis, although the mean number of seeds per fruit was only three. Self-pollination of 'Fino Clementine' before anthesis did not significantly increase the percentage of fruit set, although most of the fruits obtained in this case also contained seeds. The increase of fruit set following the use of an appropriate pollinator was associated with a greater early rate of growth of the ovaries, which was preceded by a significant increase in size of the fertilized ovules. © 1984.",Clementine mandarin; fruit development; fruit set; parthenocarpy; seeds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006137264

Temperate zone islands have very low percentages of dioecious species. The percentages are higher in subtropical islands. Relatively high percentages of dioecism are found only in moist tropical islands or in floras that have had a moist tropical influence on their composition. Low islands in the tropics and rather arid islands in the sub-tropics have only small numbers of dioecious species in their floras. Latitude and maximum height of islands together account for 82% of the variation in percentage of dioecism in samples. Although autochthonous development of dioecism in an hermaphrodite immigrant cannot be ruled out yet, the percentage of dioecism in an island flora appears to be related to the percentage in a probable source flora in a comparable climatic zone. This equivalence probably mostly depends upon the long-distance dispersal, establishment and radiation of taxa, including dioecious ones. This may be facilitated for the dioecious taxa by 'leakage' in the dioecious breeding system, by dispersal of multiple-seed units, by longevity and vegetative propagation of perennial plants, and by an ability to utilize wind or unspecialized pollinators. In tropical regions, bird-dispersal of seeds particularly may have been involved in the stocking of forest on islands. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021539841

Biology, 202 Buckhout Lab, The Pennsylvania State Univ, University Park, PA 16802, USA.","Lotus corniculatus regularly produces many more flowers than mature fruits. Number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence, proportion of flowers that initiate, abort, and develop fruits to maturity, number of seeds per fruit, and seed mass vary within and among individuals of this species. These components of maternal investment were measured under control, resource enriched (N-P-K fertilizer), and resource deprived (partial defoliation) conditions on a population of even-aged, similar-sized individuals. Resources rather than pollination limit the reproductive output of the plants. Flower number and seed yield are regulated during the reproductive episode in response to resource availability. L. corniculatus regulates flower number and seed yield under the different resource conditions primarily by altering the number of successive inflorescences/infructescences. Plants subjected to the 3 experimental treatments did not, however, differ in the proportion of flowers that produced a mature fruit or in the proportion of initiated fruits that matured (or aborted). On each treatment only 1 of every 3 flowers produced a mature fruit, and 3 of every 5 initiated fruits aborted. The ratio of flowers to fruits has thus been selected for reasons other than uncertainties in resource availability. The flowers that fail to produce a mature fruit could be functioning only as males, or they could be providing plants with a 'choice' of fruits to mature.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021569454

When all the laminae were removed little N was taken up and only 35% as much N as in untreated plants moved from the shoot to the grain. Removal of all the laminae increased the N content per cent of dry weight of both grain and shoot at final harvest, but the other treatments did not have much effect on the N concentration of any of the parts of the shoot. Plants bearing grain, whether intact or with alternate laminae removed (half?defoliated) at the time of flowering, took up N approximately in proportion to their increase in dry weight during the 4 wk after flowering. The N taken up went to the ear (husks, core and grain) and so did N from the stem and leaves. Intact and half?defoliated plants with no developing grains, because pollination had been prevented, took up no N during this period, though they accumulated about as much dry matter as did plants with grain; the N increment of the husks and core was supplied by the stem and leaves. At final harvest total and grain N content of plants per unit area of land increased by 20 and nearly 30%, respectively, with increase in population between 2·3 and 6·1 plants/m2, but apparently fell slightly with further increase of population to 7·4 plants/m2. Until shortly after flowering N uptake was rapid enough to maintain similar N contents per cent of dry weight of the parts of the shoot in all populations. Uptake continued at a steady rate, though a slower one than before flowering, until near the time of final harvest in the most widely spaced population. In the denser populations uptake slowed down progressively after flowering, and in the densest population it apparently ceased a few weeks before final harvest. The N concentration of the grain of maturing plants fell with increase of population, but not that of the other parts of the shoot. At final harvest N content of the grain decreased from 1·6% in the most widely spaced to 1·2% in the densest population. That of the rest of the shoot varied between 0·70 and 0·79%.

The efficiency of sucrose solution uptake by Melipona was compared to that of domesticated European Apis mellifera. Dynamics of nectar foraging were also recorded for 3 of the Melipona visiting the forest shrub, Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae). 1. Sugar concentration in nectar brought to nests averaged from 21 to 60% sugar for 15 colonies of M. fasciata, M. compressipes triplaridis, M. fuliginosa and M. marginata micheneri. Concentrations ranged from 19 to 72%, and all species collected nectars ranging at least between 24 and 63% sugar. However, M. compressipes and M. marginata preferred higher concentrations and foraged less on dilute nectars. Peak colony nectar harvest occured in late morning or early afternoon; peak pollen harvest was in early morning. 2. Imbibing rates of bees given 20, 30, 45, 60 or 70% sucrose solutions were highest at ?45% sucrose, but caloric intake was most rapid at 60% sucrose for all species. All but M. marginata displayed greater net intake rates than domesticated European Apis mellifera. A foraging choice model incorporating caloric reward and imbibing rates of bees suggests M. compressipes and M. marginata should specialize on richer nectars. Rate of caloric intake per forager weight was higher for all Melipona (0.03-0.13g) than for A. mellifera (0.10 g). 3. The nectar of Hybanthus prunifolius (Violaceae), a shrub pollinated exclusively by Melipona, progressed from 35 to 60% sugar during the day. Bees foraged most when nectar was below 60% concentration, a pattern best explained as the result of intercolony competition and greater availability of lower quality nectar. 4. Sugar concentration in nectar harvested by colonies rose from lower to higher values through the day for Melipona. The increasing caloric reward of nectar is adaptive in exploiting foraging preferences of such bees. As standing nectar crop is depleted by competing bees, a gradual shift to more rewarding nectar should promote increased bee foraging range, more flower visits during a foraging trip, floral constancy, and genetic outcrossing. 5. The nectar load capacity of A. mellifera is greater than that of Melipona. Other factors being equal, Africanized A. mellifera, now a permanent resident of neotropical forests, should visit more flowers during a foraging trip. Additional species differences in foraging behavior are analyzed. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021539006

Arthropods were grouped into 5 guilds: chewing herbivores, sucking herbivores, flower-product feeders, parasitoids and predators. Sucking herbivores comprised the largest guild, based on numbers of individuals and of species. Changes in abundance of the 2 herbivorous guilds were not related to plant phenology. In contrast, herbivore species richness usually peaked during blooming. Flower feeders, parasitoids and predators all peaked in abundance and species richness during blooming. Nectar and pollen attracted the flower feeders and parasitoids (members of both guilds eat flower products). The dominant predators seemed to prefer mobile flower visitors as prey (flower feeders, parasitoids and several herbivore species); these visitors were most numerous during blooming. Overall, the panicles attracted a wider variety of arthropods than just pollinators because panicles offer a wider variety of resources than nectar and pollen. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021544892

Having determined, in the previous investigation, the incompatibility genotypes of the members of two families of autotetraploid ryegrass (Fearon era/., 1984), it is now possible to decide which of these hypotheses is true by using pollen from each of these tetraploids on the stigmas of related diploids of known genotype. The results of this part of the investigation of the inheritance and expression of self-incompatibility in autotetraploid ryegrass show with very little doubt that the first hypothesis is true; that is, only one S-Z pair of the pollen of tetraploids needs to be matched in the stigma for incompatibility to occur. The effects of both aneuploidy and of double reduction on our ability to distinguish between the pattern of pollinations expected on each hypothesis are considered; it is shown that neither of these disturbances is likely to reduce our ability to discriminate between the two hypotheses.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and morphometric analysis were carried out on cultivated material derived from seed collected from the main population of S. diclinis at Játiva. Only two out of 26 inferred enzyme loci showed substantial variation. There was some indication of population subdivision in both. The esterase locus also showed homozygote excess within the population as a whole and within one subpopulation. Morphological characters showed significant differentiation between subpopulations. Low allozyme variability characterizes populations of most endemic species that have been investigated. Isolation and historical events may have been as important as population size or edaphic specialization in causing this low variability. But S. diclinis resembles other outbreeding plants in showing population structure and homozygote excess, suggesting restricted within?population gene flow. Mechanisms that may restrict gene flow in S. diclinis include environmentally?induced differences in flowering time, poor seed dispersal and possibly short pollinator foraging distances. Morphological variability and the incidence of developmental abnormalities are speculatively linked with homozygosity. Storage of genetic diversity in space can occur in restricted as well as widespread species and sampling for gene banking should then be spatially representative.

Seed cones (megastrobili) were pollinated once and some were sampled at the different stages of development to study the pollination mechanism, seed-cone receptivity, and seed production potential. The proximal end of a seed cone emerged from the bud scales and was the area to be receptive first. As the seed cones continued to develop, the margins of the cone scales became reflexed to increase the surface area and to funnel pollen along the margins of two adjacent scales onto the micropylar arms. Pollen was transferred to a deep depression in the nucellus and it germinated in the depression a weel after pollination. Another week later the micropyle was sealed by the ingrowth and divisions of the cells in the micropylar canal. Receptivity of a seed cone lasted for about 10 days and the end of receptivity was signalled by the closure of cone scales. The optimal receptivity appeared to occur when seed cones approached the end of receptivity and this coincided with the peak of pollen shedding. It was evident that seed cones pollinated at this stage produced the most filled seeds, an average of 41.6 from a seed production potential of 88 seeds per cone. Total cone scales averaged 67.7 per cone of which 43.6 scales were fertile and located at the mid-portion of a cone. © 1984.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021556998

We have been studying selection on flower colour in the small perennial larkspur Delphinium nelsonii, a native to mountains of the western USA. Previously we showed that white-flowered forms, which are very rare in natural populations, produce fewer seeds than their common blue-flowered conspecifics, and that this selective disadvantage results from partial discrimination against white flowers by bumblebee and hummingbird pollinators7. Here we present evidence that discrimination occurs because white flowers have inferior 'nectar guides' and therefore require longer handling times than blue flowers. Pollinators may thus experience lower net rates of energy intake on white flowers, a sufficient reason for undervisitation by optimally-foraging animals. © 1983 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000691421

Two altitudinal accessions of L. hirsutum Homb. et Bnpl., from low and high altitude, a breeding line of L. esculentum (L.) Mill. and the hybrid between the latter and the high-altitude L. hirsutum were studied. The plastochron (P) values were estimated directly according to the formula of R.O. Erickson and F. Michelini (1957, Am. J. Bot. 44, 297-305), and indirectly through a linear model estimating the exponential rates of leaf elongation (r) and the ln of the plastochron ratios (q). The P values were obtained as P=q/r, and with one exception values obtained with both methods were comparable. Low temperature significantly decreased r in all genotypes, but the extent of this reduction depended on the genotype. The hybrid exhibited the least reduction, followed by the high-elevation L. hirsutum, L. esculentum and the lowelevation L. hirsutum. While the q values of the L. hirsutum accessions were significantly reduced by low temperature, those of L. esculentum and the hybrid were not. With the exception of the low-altitude L. hirsutum, low temperature significantly increased P, however the extent of the increase was significantly greater in L. esculentum. Analysis of temperature dependent changes of r, q and P indicate that L. esculentum extended its P by approximately the same factor its r was reduced. On the other hand, the L. hirsutum accessions increased P to a lesser extent, therefore having the ability to produce, comparatively, more leaves at lower temperatures than the cultivated tomato. The linear model of the plastochron is proposed as a tool for comparative studies of environmental growth responses of different genotypes. Plant size was reduced by low temperature. Considering plant size attained at high temperature as 100%, at low temperature sizes were reduced to 73% for the hybrid, 61% for the high-altitude L. hirsutum, 39% for L. esculentum and 30% for the low-altitude L. hirsutum. The low-temperature regime delayed flowering by two, three and nine plastochrons in the hybrid, the high-altitude L. hirsutum and L. esculentum, respectively, while the low-altitude L. hirsutum did not flower for the duration of the experiment. When artificially pollinated, L. esculentum yielded parthenocarpic fruits, while the high-altitude L. hirsutum and the hybrid produced fruits with viable seeds. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",Chilling; Lycopersicon (temperature response); Plastochron; Temperature and growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000239832

Darwin's theory of sexual selection showed how such traits could be selected through competition for mates even if they were otherwise detrimental1. Flowering displays of plants often show a comparable degree of gaudiness and profligacy, but exploration of the role of sexual selection in plants has only just begun 2-5. Bateman6 argued that sexual selection is caused by the greater ability of males than females to increase fitness by mating repeatedly, due to the females' greater energetic commitment to gametes or parental care. Similar reasoning applies to hermaphrodites2,3. In hermaphroditic milkweeds, most young fruits are aborted7-10 and female reproduction (seeds) is limited more by resources than by pollination11. Sexual selection theory therefore predicts that traits increasing mating success will have evolved because they increase male success through pollen. Here I report that a suite of floral traits of a hermaphroditic plant is best interpreted as having evolved through the male competition component of sexual selection, a result with important implications for evolutionary studies of pollination systems. © 1983 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021056259

Rates of pollinaria removal and pollinia insertion were similarly higher during the day than at night. Moths deposited a much lower proportion of their pollinia in stigmatic chambers (one-fifth) than did diurnal pollinators. In spite of the poor service provided by nocturnal pollinators, flowers produced four times as much nectar at night as at day, and sugar production (sucrose equivalents) at night was twice that of the daytime. Supplemental hand pollinations doubled the production of mature pods, indicating normal pollinia limitation. Mature pod production of clones within a 5-km diameter varied between 0.1 and 3.5 per flowering stem, and numbers of pollinia vectors at these clones were closely correlated with numbers of mature pods produced. Pollinia-limited clones should thus attract both diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, if costs are not too extreme.

This model analyses the efficiency of sugar intake, or energy flux, which for nectarivores closely approximates the rate of net energy gain. For both steady state and some non-steady flows of nectars, this energy flux is shown to be maximal at particular sugar concentrations referred to here as the maximum flux concentration. Higher concentrations actually yield lower energy intake rates because the concomitant rapid increase in viscosity sharply reduces the rate of fluid intake. For pure sucrose solutions, the maximum flux concentration is 22%. For flower nectars, which are chemically more complex, the maximum flux concentration is predicted to be closer to 26%, using the first viscosity measures obtained for flower nectars. This concentration is shown to be essentially independent of the pollinator's feeding organ morphology and of the type of potential inducing nectar flow. It is proposed that this concentration applies for virtually all pollinators that select nectars with maximal energy flux. However not all pollinators are expected to select such nectars because this 26% concentration is not necessarily ""optimal"". The model predicts that optimal sugar concentrations vary for particular pollinators as a function of two primary factors: (1) the energy flux derived from the nectar, as discussed above, as well as (2) the relative contribution of transit costs to overall foraging costs. Relatively ""dilute"" nectars, with sugar concentrations close to the maximal flux value, are predicted for flowers pollinated by organisms that minimize feeding time to reduce high feeding costs, such as that of hovering or of exposure to enhanced predation while feeding. More concentrated nectars are predicted for flowers pollinated by nectarivores that incur high foraging transit costs relative to feeding costs. Flowers pollinated by hovering pollinators, including many hummingbirds, hawkmoths and bats, have nectars with mean sugar concentrations in close accord with the 26% maximum flux concentration predicted. Moreover, these nectars have relatively low concentrations of nonsugar constituents, which increase viscosity and thereby decrease sugar flux. Over 75% of the flowers examined in this study, which are pollinated primarily by territorial hummingbird species, provide nectars that allow sugar uptake with an efficiency of 90% or greater of the maximal value. According to the model, these data suggest that feeding costs of these pollinators far outweigh foraging transit costs. In contrast, the model suggests that flower nectars taken by traplining hummingbirds and by bees, with sugar concentrations significantly above the maximum flux value, reflect the higher costs of foraging flight relative to costs of feeding for these pollinators. Increasing temperature decreases nectar viscosity, and thereby increases absolute nectar uptake rates sharply. This leads to a number of predictions regarding foraging behavior as well as flower location, orientation, and color. However, the maximum flux concentration is shown to be practically invariable over a wide range of temperatures-increasing by only 2% sugar from 10°C to 30°C. Thus, contrary to previous expectations, little change in average sugar concentrations of flowers pollinated by particular groups of nectarivores is expected from cooler to warmer regions. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020947455

I therefore investigated the relationship between flight distance and flight time for bumblebees and butterflies foraging on Senecio integerrimus and S. crassulus in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. I also compared patterns of pollinator visitation and seed set in two adjacent 15x 15 m plots in a population of S. integerrimus; one plot was experimentally thinned of flowering stalks, while the other was left at natural density. Mean flight distance had no effect on mean flight time or the number of florets or heads visited per unit time. There were no significant differences between the two plots in the rate at which plants received visits, although visitation rates varied through the season, with greatest activity at peak flowering. Pollinators were more selective in their visits to plants in the high-density plot, however. Bumblebee-visited plants in the dense plot had a lower variance in stalk height than the plant population average, while butterfly-visited plants in the dense plot had more heads than the population average. Plant density had no effect on number of heads visited per plant, but number of heads visited by bumblebees was correlated with number of heads per plant. Efficiency of visitation (percentage of flowering heads visited), declined with inflorescence size. Flowering plant density had no effect on seed production, and inflorescence size did not affect the percentage of florets setting seed. In Senecio, flowering phenology patterns and differences among pollinators in foraging behavior may have more important consequences for seed set and gene flow patterns than plant density or plant size. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020918577

Although only 40-60% of the ovules mature into seeds, hand-pollination experiments conducted in several populations over four years provided little evidence that reproductive success in this species was limited by pollination. Both honeybeess (Apis mellifera) and two small species of native andrenid bees effectively pollinate E. umbilicatum, as determined by measurements of seed set and counts of pollen tubes in the styles of flowers kept under cages and allowed a single visit. Full pollination of E. umbilicatum is promoted by: (1) large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract a variety of potential pollinators, (2) the small (2-3) number of visits required to fertilize all of a flower's ovules, (3) extended perianth persistence of unpollinated flowers. The latter two traits are also characteristic of other spring wildflowers and may contribute to fitness in a habitat where both physical factors and competition between plants for floral visitors can make pollinator service unpredictable. Causes of the observed deficiency in seed set in E. umbilicatum are complex and probably involve cold weather, low light levels or other unidentified physical factors, genotypes of pollen parents (i.e. quality of pollination), and diversion of resources from current year's seed set to future reproduction. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020925887

(Diptera), can be frequent. In experiments to test the ant-guard hypothesis, exclusion of ants from plants increased abundance of other insects on the developing capitula. The difference between ant-access and ant-exclusion treatments was related to ant abundance on the access plants. These effects were statistically significant in spite of the large variation in insect activity between sites and through the season. The increased abundance of insects on capitula following ant-exclusion did not, however, result in significant increases in the number of adult seed predators observed on capitula, the number of immature seed predators in capitula, or capitula damage as estimated between ant-access and exclusion treatments of either H. bracteatum or H. viscosum. Further, the ant-exclusion treatment on H. bracteatum had no significant influence on pollination as measured by seed set or on the degree of parasitism of Tephritis sp. by Megastigmus sp.

Cryptantha flava normally matures only one of the four ovules per ovary while C. flavoculata often matures all four. The general floral morphology and composition of insect floral visitors were found to be nearly identical in the two species, but C. flavoculata produces twice as much pollen per flower as C. flava. Despite this difference, the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas by pollinators is similar. This may be due to the larger stigmatic surface area in C. flava. In both species, the abortion of fertilized ovules, rather than insufficient amounts of pollen, appears to be the primary factor regulating the number of seeds per flower. The pollination ecology of these species is discussed in relation to current theories regarding the allocation of resources to the production of pollen and seeds. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020895431

Volume and sugar concentration of samples from individual flowers were measured and the sugar contained was calculated. The rate of sugar production remains constant for all ambient humidities and extraction intervals investigated; the mean value for all 180 samples is 1.55 mg sucrose equivalents/24h.

The consequences of the results for nectar production and nectar reward of individual flowers in the field and for the optimal foraging of pollinators are discussed.

Autoradiographic observation of labeled nuclei was made for fertilized egg cells, as well as for central and antipodal cells. The first and second DNA synthetic phases in fertilized egg cells were found 8-12 h and 21-25 h after pollination, respectively. The durations of each cell-cycle phase in the egg cell were estimated to be 4-6 h for G1, 4 h vor S and for G2, and 2 h for M. In the central cell, the first DNA synthesis took place at 3-4 h after pollination, i.e., immediately after fertilization, followed by the formation of the primary endosperm nucleus. Antipodal cells also showed labeled nuclei in the early stages after fertilization. The first divisions of fertilized egg cell and primary endosperm nucleus were observed at 16-18h and at 4-6 h after pollination, respectively.

This surface is ensheathed by a thin (75-100 nm) but highly impermeable cuticle, which encloses four to five ranks of secretory cells immersed in their secretory products. Experimental single-grain pollinations show that pollen cannot become hydrated or germinate on the intact surface. The cuticle is ruptured when the flower is tripped; the secretion is released, and captured pollen-self or cross-can then germinate. As in other papilionoid Leguminosae, this mechanism provides a guard against premature selling. The secretory cells are elongated; they remain in communication through persistent pit-fields as the intercellular spaces fill with secretion product. The secretion forms a lipid-rich emulsion, with a mucilaginous aqueous phase which reacts cytochemically for protein and carbohydrate and has esterase activity. During the early development of the stigma head, the cells possess a fine-structure appropriate to their secretory function, with abundant ribosomal and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, stratified or in the form of ramifying and anastomosing tubules, numerous mitochondria and a well developed Golgi system. Lipid globuli, partly invested in endoplasmic reticulum, are abundant in the young cells, but there is as yet no indication of how the lipid is transferred to the intercellular spaces during the secretory period.

The method is completely reliable and the percentage germination achieved is comparable to that found on a compatible stigma. The pollen tubes produced attain lengths equal to those growing in the style and exhibit similar growth kinetics. The major difference between this medium and other less-reliable media is the addition of 1 mM Tris. The efficacy of Tris is shown to be due in part to the establishment of an optimum pH but an ""amine effect"" is also identified. The optimum pH for growth in vitro may be different from that encountered on the stigma. Atmospheric concentration of CO2 and pollen population density are also shown to have pronounced effects on germination in vitro. Germination in vitro is not significantly affected by prior incubation on the stigma surface. Neither crossnor self-stigmas exert any apparent influence on pollen viability in this respect. Similarly the numbers of tube initials produced in atmospheres of 98% relative humidity (RH) are not altered by such treatments. Conversely, incubation in germination medium and in 98% RH prior to pollination appears to modify pollen-stigma interactions to some extent. Stigma extracts added to the germination medium cause an increase in the rate of hydration of both cross- and self-pollen, but this effect is greater in the case of cross-pollen. Evidence for specific inhibition of self-pollen germination by stigma extracts added to the medium was not obtained. The relevance of these phenomena to current concepts of the mechanism of self incompatibility (SI) are discussed and a potential use of the medium in overcoming the SI response is suggested. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica; Germination medium; Pollen; Pollen germination; Self incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250145175

Of the 18 species of insect foragers, bees (Trigona sp., Apis florea, A. cerana indica), wasps (Scolia cruenta. Rhynchium metallicum. Ropalidia spatulata), flies (Sarcophaga orchidea, Rhyncomya viridaurea) and butterflies (Catopsilia crocale) promote both geitonogamous and xenogamous pollinations.

Coevolution is not evident in the partners of the system. Jatropha occurs intermingled with other weedy taxa. Its flower visitors are those normally conditioned on other species, and their composition and abundance depend on the density of forage available at the simultaneously blooming sympatric species and on the extent of competition for that forage.

During seed development the changing levels of free aspartate, lysine, methionine, and threonine in endosperm as well as in embryos followed a bi-phasic pattern characterized by a minimum at 35 d post pollination. Up to that time, no striking differences were observed in any of these amino acids between normal and opaque-2 mutant tissues. However, during the second phase, increased levels of these amino acids in mutant endosperm- and to a certain extent in mutant embryos -indicate a feedback deregulation of one or several of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids originating from aspartate. The increases in these amino acids correlated with the demonstrated increased protein synthesis consisting mainly of endosperm and embryo globulins. Diaminopimelate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.20) activity was found to be equal in normal and mutant endosperm until 35 d post pollination, whereafter the activity declined sharply and appeared instead in embryos, especially in those of the mutant. Since lysine did not accumulate to any extent in mutant embryos, it is concluded that it was transferred to the endosperm, possibly for globulin synthesis. The data indicate that the embryo may play a specific role in controlling tissue levels of amino acids and thus be involved in the regulation of protein synthesis. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",Amino acid (maize); Aspartate family; Diaminopieelate decarboxylate; Kernel development; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005878592

The expected distribution should not be based on doling out random amounts of nectar to flowers, but based on random return times to flowers by pollinators (elapsed time=nectar accumulated). When this model is used, standing crop variance does not differ markedly from expectation. What differences do exist can be accounted for by variability in nectar production rates of individual plants. We also take issue with the use of the bonanza-blank terminology.

The corollas of unpollinated flowers too eventually abscise, 6 d after the stigma opens, however, they do so with only a minimal loss of fresh weight or corolla constituents. Pollination causes an increase in ethylene production detectable within 1 h. Increased ethylene production occurs initially only from the upper portion of the style, later from the lower portion, and lastly, between 23 and 48 h after pollination, from the ovary plus calyx. The pollination response can be induced by exogenous ethylene, the degree of weakening of the corolla abscission zone being dependent upon the concentration and duration of the exposure period and on the stage of flower development.

Plants flowered between June and September with flowering intensity depending largely on factors associated with shoot vigour in genotypes. The high predominance of male plants coupled with irregular flowering necessitate the establishment of many plants to ensure sufficient flowering individuals for a hybridization programme. In order to achieve good fruit set and seed yields, pollen should be collected from open male flowers around 14.00 h and mature female flowers pollinated within a week after they are bagged particularly during the early flowering months. Low fruit set in white yam (12%) is primarily due to inefficient pollination by insects. With hand pollination fruit set is improved three-fold. © 1983 H.

Seed set of C<inf>r</inf>/C was usually also greatly superior to that of C/C<inf>r</inf> and, using, self, incompatible pollen S instead of C<inf>r</inf>, S/C was nearly always much better than C/S. This is in accordance with the promotion of the second by the first (pioneer) pollen. Hence, when C<inf>r</inf> or S are applied second in C/C<inf>r</inf> or C/S, more ovules are rendered ineffective (blocked or aborted) than in the reverse combination when C<inf>r</inf> or S act as pioneer pollen. These observations are consistent with the trend that the combinations C/ C+S, C+S, C/S tended to produce more selfed seeds in that order. Although mentor or pioneer pollen assist in removing the style barrier for self pollen, embryo abortions appears to be a second obstruction towards seed formation. Indications are that high spring temperature during pollination promote the production of selfed seeds in the presence of compatible pollen. The surfeit of self pollen in orchards with a minority of pollinators is not necessarily an unfavourable factor, it may both directly and indirectly contribute to fruit and seed set. © 1983 H.

In contrast, S. lucida apparently is pollinated largely by halictine bees. In characteristically Bombus-pollinated taxa, protandry is accomplished by a change in the position of the terminal portion of the column with respect ot the lip. The present investigation documents protandry in S. cernua var. cernua, S. lacera var. lacera, S. lacera var. gracilis, S. laciniata, S. magnicamporum, S. ochroleuca, S. romanzoffiana, S. tuberosa and S. vernalis. Bees moving up the spike from the older female flowers to the younger male flowers act initially as pollen donors and later as pollen receivers; thus cross-fertilization is enhanced. Halictines occasionally act as pollinators of characteristically Bombus-pollinated taxa by visiting the flowers upside down so that the pollinia are inconspicuously attached to the lower side of the prementum. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021053875

Niche breadths were greater, implying less specialization, for A. incarnata (mean 0.30) and A. verticillata (mean 0.39). Paper wasps (Polistes) and digger wasps (Sphex) were numerous and effective pollinators of A. verticillata, but bumblebees comprised the largest proportion (27%) of pollinators at some sites.

Intraspecific comparisons of the similarity of pollinators among populations of A. syriaca gave values that were higher than corresponding values for different species within a locality, implying possible niche differentiation with respect to this species.

Pollen declines in vigor as flowers age. However, the overall effect of this decline on fruiting in the field is lessened by a simultaneous decline during anthesis in the rate of pollinium removal by insect pollinators. Within an umbel, earlier pollinated flowers are more likely to form mature pods than flowers pollinated 2 days later, apparently as a result of within umbel competition between developing pods for limited resources. The longer the delay between pollinations within umbels, the more mature pods form, probably as a result of a decline in intensity of competition between pods.

By the Cretaceous?Tertiary boundary the major groups of modern angiosperms were present, some of these probably being pollinated nocturnally by large insects and non?flying mammals and others with seeds dispersed by terrestrial vertebrates. Early bats were perhaps initially attracted to such flowers and fruit by the insects found around them, later finding the plants themselves nutritious.

Depending upon roosting habits and season, megabats may travel considerable distances each night to feed and may undertake seasonal migrations.

Accessions of P. antidotaleRetz. (blue panicgrass), P. coloratum L. (kleingrass), and P. deustumThunb. were self-pollinated and also crossed with one another. Following pollination, pollen germination and tube growth were studied in vivo by observing the pollinated pistils with fluorescence microscopy. Examination of the self-pollinated pistils revealed that pollen germination was approximately 90% for each species and germination occurred shortly after pollination. Pollen tubes grew to the micropyle within one hour after pollination in kleingrass and two hours in blue panicgrass and P. deustum. One P. deustum accession (PI 364953) was self-incompatible with pollen tube inhibition occurring in the style. In the cross-pollinations, the pollen also germinated shortly after pollination, and the overall germination ranged from 77 to 88% for the different crosses. In crosses between kleingrass and P. deustum, most pollen tube growth was arrested shortly after penetration of the stigma papilla, but a limited number of tubes grew to different locations within the stigma. Only four reached the upper part of the style. In crosses between blue panicgrass and P. deustum, the pollen tubes failed to grow beyond the stigma except in one cross where they grew into the upper half of the style. In the blue panicgrass x kleingrass crosses, the tubes grew into the style but were arrested before entering the ovary. In the reciprocal cross the tubes grew into the ovary, but the tubes became disoriented and grew in an apparently random manner, never penetrating the micropyle. Thus, cross-incompatibility systems are responsible for the failure to produce hybrids among these Panicum species. © 1983 Veenman B.V., Wageningen.",blue panicgrass; cross-incompatibility; fluorescence microscopy; hybridization; kleingrass; Panicum antidotale; Panicum coloratum; Panicum deustum; pollen-tube; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343671918

Delayed anthesis is usually triggered by rehydration of previously water-stressed trees resulting from leaf shedding or, in dry habitats, by rainfall. Because of different degrees of seasonal water stress, leaf fall and subsequent anthesis in several species extend over 3-4 months. Periodicity of anthesis in tropical trees is thus largely determined by seasonal changes in tree water status and is unlikely to be the result of selection for optimum tree-pollinator interaction.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020859336

Chemical weapons possess an astonishingly low deterrent effect whereas thick chitinisation (Coleoptera) is found to give very effective protection.

The species is nectarless and acts by deceiving various bees (Hymenoptera, Apoidea). Temporary seeking/exploratory drives of bees for foodsources were exploited by means of superiority in floral display. A floral reflectance maximum at 440 nm (blue) largely determines the colour in the visual spectrum of bees. The floral scent is composed to about 90% of monoterpenes. Nothing suggested mimesis of concurrent foodflowers either in colour or in scent. Anthesis covered a time period in late spring when (a) concurrent foodflowers for bees were rather few, (b) many bumblebee queens (Bombus Latr. spp.) were inexperienced as regards foodflowers and had no foraging routines, (c) cuckoo bumblebee females (Psithyrus Lep. spp.) recoveryfed on flowers after hibernation, (d) males of Eucera longicornis (L.) (Anthophoridae) patrolled far out from their nestarea, and when (e) many solitary bee species flew about. The pollinator fauna differed between sites, viz. either Bombus queens, Psithyrus females or E. longicornis males transported the majority of the pollinaria. The pollination system does not seem to be stabilised in the study areas. Floral morphology indicates that the plant's anthecological specialisation to bees as a group implies a graded unspecialisation to each species of bee in the legitimate pollinator group.

Although territoriality has been recognized among immature stages as well as in both sexes of adult insects, most of the published reports deal with the reproductive consequences of aggressive interactions among territorial males. Some dominance hierarchies have been described, particularly among cockroaches and megachilid and halictid bees. Lek behavior has also been reported among dragonflies, butterflies and Hawaiian drosophilids. Territorial behavior spreads males through a habitat, minimizing intruder interference with courtship and mating, and increasing the probability that females will be made. Besides these intraspecific effects, however, aggressive behavior towards unrelated species may reverberate through the larger community. Thus repeated attacks by aggressive flies may cause pollinating bees and aphidophagous predators to change their foraging routes, and thus prevent them from servicing particular habitats. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021031535

Its relative frequency decreases rapidly and significantly from the coast to the central valleys of southern California. Insect damage to developing flowers and seeds is high (35-61%). Exclusion of predispersal flower and seed predators caused a significant increase in the number of viable seeds released because of: 1) a decrease in insect-caused abortion of flower heads (11%), 2) an increase in pollination success (19%) , and 3) a decrease in damage to developing seeds (104%). A significant and proportionate increase in the number of seedlings established at sites over the climatic gradient from coast to inland valleys followed the exclusion of seed predators. In the inland area, however, extremely high mortality among established seedlings prevented recruitment of juveniles. Mortality of established adult plants was higher at the coast than inland (41 vs. 31%, respectively), suggesting that the geographic difference in the abundance of juveniles would persist. These results differ from those for a parallel experiment on H. squarrosus in which juvenile recruitment was determined by differential predispersal seed predation along the gradient and was not altered by differential mortality among seedlings. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021023543

In the present double-blind study, we tested the effectiveness of intranasal immunotherapy in 20 patients sensitive to both short ragweed (SRW) and orchard grass (OG). Patients sprayed increasing concentrations of either SRW (n = 11) or OG (n = 9) extract intranasally six times per day for 8 wk before the SRW pollination season. The effects of this treatment were determined by analysis of symptom score diaries and clinical examinations during the SRW pollination season. SRW-treated patients received cumulative AgE doses from 3 to 59 ?g (mean 21); this mean dose was approximately sevenfold less than that used in a previous study from our laboratory. All patients reported immediate hay fever symptoms after use of the nasal spray. Five patients (four SRW- and one OG-treated) reported episodes of mild epistaxis during treatment; no other unexpected side effects were noted. During the treatment period, more SRW-treated patients showed signs of nasal obstruction and edematous nasal mucosa than OG-treated control patients (p < 0.03). During the SRW pollination season, the SRW-treated patients reported lower mean weekly symptom scores than the OG-treated control patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. Supplemental antihistamine use was significantly higher (p < 0.016) in the OG-treated control patients during the SRW pollination period. Subjective assessment of treatment efficacy by patients was similar in both treatment groups.

Lysine-ketoglutarate reductase activity increased sharply with the onset of endosperm development, reached a peak at 20 days after pollination and then declined towards seed maturity. The peak of activity coincided with the period of maximum rates of nitrogen and zein accumulation in the endosperm. Amino acid analyses of sap taken from the ear vascular system during ear development showed considerable amounts of lysine and other protein amino acids. Lysine found in the sap could account for more than twice the lysine required for protein synthesis in the endosperm.

Rice and wheat together constitute the world's two most important food crops. Wheat is the staple food of many developed countries and constitutes the leading cereal in terms of total world production. Because of the importance of rice in many developing countries, especially in Asia, considerable effort has been expended during the past decades to develop varieties capable of responding to improved management and to reduce production hazards through the incorporation of genes resistant to major biological, chemical, and physical stresses. The successful development of hybrid maize in the 1930s provided an important impetus for breeders of other crops, including self-pollinating cereals such as wheat, rice, barley, and cross-pollinating sorghum, to utilize the principles of hybrid production. Heterosis was first reported in wheat when it was found that F1 plants were generally taller than the tall parent. The major yield components in rice and wheat are number of panicles per square meter, spikelet number per panicle, spikelet fertility percentage, and 1,000-grain weight. Significant positive mid-parent, high-parent, or standard heterosis has been observed for one or more of these components in a number of rice crosses. © 1983 Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956809765

As a result of asexual reproduction, a lack of long- distance dispersal of pollen and self-incompatibility, fruit production is very low. This pattern of reproduction is found in other species of primitive angiosperms; incompatibility mechanisms which undoubtedly aided the angiosperms to become dominant may now be one of the major factors responsible for their extinction.-from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020924672

In both years ragweed pollen and Alternaria spore counts, obtained with a rotoslide sampler, correlated significantly with immunochemically measured airborne ragweed and Alternaria allergenic activity. Airborne levels of the purified allergens AgE and Alt-I were successfully quantitated; these levels correlated closely with total airborne ragweed and Alternaria allergenic activities, respectively, and also with ragweed pollen and Alternaria spore counts. Eluates from filter sheets exposed during late summer and fall produced positive wheal-and-flare skin tests in patients with fall hay fever. In both years immunochemical measurements of allergenic activity due to airborne short ragweed correlated closely with mean symptom score indices in groups of short ragweed-sensitive individuals. Measurable levels of atmospheric ragweed allergenic activity were noted before and after the ragweed pollination season, and at these times we noted small increases in mean symptom score indices in the short ragweed-sensitive groups.

Processes of isolation and introgressive interplay between Platanthera bifolia L. Rich, and P. chlorantha (Custer; Reichb. (Orchidaceae). Platanthera bifolia and P. chlorantha are highly specialized for pollination by crepuscular and nocturnal Lepidoptera. The plants are largely sympatric, have overlapping flowering?times, and are completely interfertile. Principal differences exist in floral fragrance and column morphology. Isolation is effected by a set of integrated morphological, ethological, and seasonal mechanisms. Odour?based constancy by moths, differences in column structure, attachment of pollinaria, spurlength, nectar availability, and flowering?peaks reduce interspecific pollen transfer. The plants form a functional species pair in relation to their pollination environment and locally share the same main pollinator species. Hybrids, which infrequently occur in areas of sympatry, emit a blend of the species?specific fragrance compounds and have intermediate column structure. They are frequently visited by?moths but suffer a serious reduction in seed production due to imperfect interaction vis?à?vis the pollen vectors. Hybrid viscidia, in an intermediate position on the column, are touched by moths' scaly and hairy palps and get insufficient attachment, evidently causing hybrids to act solely as female recipient. First backcross individuals largely join the functional range of either species which promotes rapid introgression. The two gene?pools interplay, although always at a low level. Patterns of introgressive hybridization were exemplified. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

The focus has been on animals at the fruit crop rather than the seed shadows that they generate (and the fate of those seeds), and on the animals that arrive at flowers rather than where they take the pollen obtained or whence came the pollen they are carrying. Seed dispersal is a word that does not imply the fate of the seed; pollination relates to the fate of the pollen grain, and therefore the two words are not of parallel meaning. In like manner, seeds (the zygote contained within, are different individuals from the parents while pollen is much more like the parent. The following areas are discussed with respect to how seed and pollen movement compare: ability of parent plant to assess success; gene flow; dependency of animals on seeds, pollen and bait; disruption by animal loss; secondary movements; fate of most seeds and pollen; syndromes; selection for maximization of movement; exclusion of unwanted animals; adjustments to the needs of the animals; seeds and pollen as contaminants; necessity of dispersal and outcrossing. We need much more knowledge of what actually is happening in nature with seed and pollen shadows, and improved ability to think like a plant. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

To establish a relationship between T. timopheevi cytoplasm and the expression of a-amylase isozymes, mature and immature seeds from alloplasmic lines of T. aestivum var. erythrospermum (Tve), cv. Chinese Spring and cv. S-615, having this cytoplasm, and their corresponding normal lines, were studied by the disc-isoelectrofocuaing method. No variation was found among the lines tested for a-amylase isozyme bands in the cathodie side.

Immature seeds, 10 and 17 days after pollination, from all lines show activity of some anodic bands, but 24 day old seeds reveal no activity except in the alloplasmic Tve line that occasionally shows several active bands. Therefore, the regulation of a-amylase expression during seed development is somewhat disturbed by the T. timopheevi cytoplasm, resulting in the lack of seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting. © 1983, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Selfed progeny had the lowest biomass in all treatments, with inbreeding depression for growth ranging from 8-25% compared to out-crossed performance. Reduced growth and greater variation in growth for selfed, as compared to out-crossed, progeny are consistent with the hypothesis that inbreeding depression in these species results from homozygosity of rare, deleterious alleles which are not expressed in the heterozygous state. Relative biomass production varied more between sun and shade habitats for selfed, than outcrossed or naturally-pollinated progeny, suggesting that increased homozygosity following inbreeding reduces genotypic versatility.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020901317

There are 17 new reports from Eastern Himalayas and the Khasia hills. On the basis of the chromosome behaviour and karyotype analysis it has been concluded that in the subtribe Coelogy-neae, the genus Pholidota is allied to Coelogyne and those two represent homogeneous assemblages. In the subtribe Dendrobeae, the genus Dendrobium is quite homogeneous in which polyploidy and aneuploidy along with chromosome changes have played an important role in evolution. Intraspecific chromosome races are common and a clear case has been demonstrated in D. chrysanthum where such cytotypes are correlated with distinct environmental conditions. Dressier (1961) described the northern epiphytes of Mexico and also recorded the severe frost-damage in them excepting Epidendrum conopseum R. Br. (Dressier 1964). In the subtribe Sarcan-thineae, the affinity of Aerides with Sarcachilus has been revealed and presence of supernumerary constriction indicates the extent to which structural changes of chromosomes are operating in evolution. The cytological affinity of Stauropsis with Vanda has been shown. The position of the species Hexisea reflexa, newly recorded here from India, has been assigned under Sarcanthineae. In Vanda, polyploidy and aneuploidy occurring at intra and interspecific level as well as cryptic structural alterations have been considered to be the factors which have contributed to the wide geographical distribution and adaptation of the genus. In general, genera cannot be categorised on the basis of their karyotypes. In broad features of the karyotype, the family as a whole represents a normal grouping, as karyotype alterations, though playing a role in evolution, are equally effective at an intra and interspecific level.

Successive steps of the present technique are described whereby cotyledonary needles (secondary explants) were subcultured on a hormone?free medium after administration of cytokinin or auxin to 14?day?old seedling (primary) explants of Picea abies. For bud induction, N6?benzyladenine (BA) was applied either as a short?duration (3 h), high?concentration (125 ?M) pulse or by vacuum infiltration and incubation in a BA?containmg (5 ?M) infusion medium. Induced adventitious shoots were elongated with the aid of far?red light and rooted in vivo after a long?duration (12 h), high?concentration (625 ?M) application of indolebutyric acid. Pulse and infusion treatments resulted in the induction of greater numbers of adventitious buds (average of 12 per needle) over a three to four week shorter culture period than was the case with the conventional inclusion of growth regulators in the agarified medium. No exogenous auxin was required in the bud?induction programme; its inclusion even at nanomolar levels promoted histo? rather than morphogenesis. In cotyledonary needles, to the primary explants of which BA was applied as a pulse or by infusion, the cell divisions which gave rise to the meristemoids from which adventitious buds were produced, appeared to commence mainly in undifferentiated hypodermal layer cells but also in the mesophyll immediately below. By contrast, where BA was incorporated in the agarified medium the first divisions occurred mainly in cells of the epidermal layer. A number of factors affected plantlet regeneration, for instance seed variability, age of seedlings, and mode of application of growth substances. It should also be accepted that the xeromorphic nature of the conifer leaf might impose physiological and morphological constraints on its culture in vitro that could militate against easy morphogenic manipulation. It is deemed essential that the current mean ratio of regenerated plants to cotyledonary needles of 1:1 be increased 10 to 20 fold in order to approach commercial feasibility.

The pattern of segregation of allozyme bands suggests that aliozymes belonging to the same enzyme system are controlled by single loci. An unusual phenotypic pattern was observed in two crosses for the enzymes peptldase-2 and tetrazolium oxldase, and two other crosses produced a segregation ratio for tetrazolium oxidase that did not conform to the one-locus Mendolian expecta tions. The latter cases may be interpreted as resulting from either a two-locus control or control by a gene duplication.

This pigment is particularly abundant in the leaves and bracts of the subfamily Bromelioideae, occurring, for example in the pineapple, Ananas comosus. Three other novel cyanidin glycosides, the 3,3?-diglucoside, the 3-rutinoside-3?-glucoside and the 3-rutinoside-5,3?-diglucoside, occur in the family; the latter pigment has only been tentatively identified. The presence of a glucose residue in the 3?-position causes a hypsochromic shift in the visible spectrum and all these novel anthocyanins are scarlet instead of crimson in colour. Their production appears to be the result of natural selection for floral colouration preferred by bird pollinators. The 3,5-diglucosides of cyanidin, peonidin and malvidin regularly accompany these new pigments in this family. The orange-red flowers of Pitcairnia sprucei and P. integrifolia are distinctive in having pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, whereas most of the species with mauve or purple flowers have malvidin 3,5-diglucoside.

Average sugar content per flower was roughly similar in the three populations sampled. High variances in nectar abundance occurred also among nectaries within the same flower. Heterogeneity in pollinator rewards thus occurs simultaneously at several spatial scales, namely between nectaries, between flowers and between plants.

Most flower characteristics increased as day air temperatures at which plants were grown increased from 20 to 24°C and reached maximum values at 28°C before plateauing or declining at 32°C, although flower size and nectar secretion continued to increase as growing temperature increased to 32°C. Of two flower aroma components, emanation of one component increased while the other decreased with increases in growing temperatures.

The genus belongs to the LiliaceaeWurmbeoideae, a phytochemically distinct taxon sometimes treated as a separate family, the Colchicaceae. Ornithoglossum belongs to the tribe Iphigenieae, which is here amended to include the former tribe Glorioseae. Within the genus Ornithoglossum 8 species are here recognized, 3 of which are new, viz. O. parviflorum B. Nord., O. vulgare B. Nord. and O. gracile B. Nord. Two varieties of O. parviflorum are recognized. O. zeyheri (Baker) B. Nord. is a new combination. The chromosome number 2n = 24 is recorded for four species. The genus is believed to have originated in formerly arid regions of tropical Africa. Because of a climatic change, an increase in humidity, a south and southwestward migration took place, followed by speciation in response to factors in the new environment. Sympatric speciation may have been promoted by the development of differences in flowering times and by specialization to different pollinators. The evolution of the nectary region of the tepals is particularly illuminating, and taxonomically useful. The proposed taxonomy is further supported by ultrastructural features of the seeds and pollen grains. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025269343

Styles and stamens are reciprocally arranged in the three floral morphs. Differences in anther size, pollen size and pollen production are associated with the three anther levels. Controlled pollinations performed in the glasshouse indicate that physiological self?incompatibility accompanies floral trimorphism. Pollinations between morphs with anthers and stigmas at equivalent heights are highly productive of seed in comparison with self? or intra?morph pollinations. In each floral morph, substantial differences in seed production result from self?pollination with alternate anther levels. Overall, the mid?styled morph exhibits weak self?incompatibility whereas the long? and short?styled morphs are more strongly self?incompatible. In all pollen?stigma combinations pollen germinated readily and pollen tubes penetrated stigmatic tissue. Inhibition of pollen tubes occurs in the style and possibly the ovary. The rate of pollen tube growth differs between anther levels following self?pollination. The three floral morphs were represented in eight populations examined although there was a tendency for the long?styled morph to be under?represented. Strong pollen trimorphism allows the origin of pollen deposited on naturally pollinated stigmas to be determined. Considerable variation in the amount and composition of pollen deposited on stigmas by syrphid flies was recorded. The likelihood of legitimate pollination appears to be highest in the long?styled morph, intermediate in the mid?styled morph and lowest in the short?styled morph. Tristyly in P. sagittata is compared with the closely related P. cor data and P. rotundifolia. Implications of weak self?incompatibility in the mid?styled morph for the breakdown of tristylous breeding systems in the Pontederiaceae are discussed. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

Fresh weight gain in 'Franquette' appeared to follow a single sigmoid curve, with no prolonged period of slowed growth corresponding to that in the other cultivars.

The pattern of gene flow in both plots was very restricted, with most of the bitter pollen deposited within 2-3 m from the central bitter block.

In regions where neither white pine blister rust nor the white pine weevil are a problem, as in the central states of the U.S.A. and the warmer parts of Europe, primary attention is given to selection and breeding for vigor. Estimates for trees up to age 18 indicate that a first-generation genetic gain in volume of over 20% can be obtained from open-pollinated family selection within stands. Volume gains of 50% or more over local genotypes have been realized at ages 15-20 through the use of seed from selected southern Appalachian stands and in some individual tree crosses of eastern white pine with blue (Himalayan) pine. In the cool, humid regions of eastern North America and Europe, where blister rust resistance is important, breeding strategies include cloning of resistant P. strobus individuals, use of blue and Balkan pines in breeding programs, and exploitation of low-level rust resistance in low-risk localities. Eastern white pine losses from blister rust can be avoided in Japan and Korea by good plantation management without genetic selection. In some regions where the white pine weevil is the major problem, western white pine is useful both for hybridization and as an alternative, more weevil-resistant species. Analysis of relative photosynthesis of SO2- and O3-fumigated clones may be useful as a method of screening for pollution tolerance in regions where air pollution is likely to intensify. Efficient techniques for cloning by rooting of cuttings are now available. Efforts are under way to develop technology for micropropagation for mass production of superior clones.

We also attempted to show in these papers that the claim by Spoor (1976) and Hay (1978) that self-incompatibility in these species was determined by at least three genes was based on data which was open to question on technical grounds. Despite this criticism, however, McCraw and Spoor (1983a, b) have repeated this claim. In the present paper we show that their claim cannot be supported by their data because (i) they have not fully classified their pollinations into grades of compatibility; (ii) they have not attempted to fit a specific genetical model to their data; and (iii) the probability that their data, even if this is taken at face value, is consistent with their claim is very small. We argue, therefore, that these data and the conclusions that are drawn are too untrustworthy to be taken seriously. Since the only other case, not superseded by more recent work, is also vulnerable to this criticism (Murray, 1979), there is no justification for supposing that self-incompatibility, either in the genus Lolium or in the grasses in general, is determined by more than two genes.

Yield efficiency (YE) (yield per unit leaf area), the reported grain yield-limiting factor in tropical maize, should be compared with grain yield (GY) (yield per unit land area) as selection criteria for rapid improvement of tropical maize. Selections for GY and for YE were conducted in two open-pollinated tropical maize cultivars that contrasted in morphological and physiological traits. Effectiveness of each selection criterion, changes in morphological and physiological traits, and density responses of synthetics associated with each selection criterion were studied. S<inf>1</inf> lines were extracted in each population and evaluated in their area of adaptation at three locations in Southeastern Zaire during the 1976-77 growing season. The ten high yield-efficient and ten high yielding S<inf>1</inf> lines in each population were separately combined to produce synthetics for high YE and high GY, respectively. The two synthetics selected in each population were compared with their original population at four densities (40 000, 60 000, 80 000 and 100 000 plants/ha) at Kaniama, Shaba, Zaire during 1977-78. Selecting for GY effectively increased GY, but also tended to maintain or increase excessive vegetative growth. Selecting for YE effectively reduced plant vegetative growth in one population and individual leaf size in the other population. It did not increase GY or YE because environmental and genetic factors that operate on YE were confounded. Neither selection criterion improved density tolerance. Maize breeding should emphasize selecting for combined criteria of GY and YE to achieve high GY, high YE, and density tolerance. © 1983 Veenman B.V., Wageningen.",maize; morphological traits; physiological traits; selection; tropics; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250153589

In early generations, hyper-and hypoploids were frequently produced from euploids. In later generations, however, the chromosome number became less unstable. In euploids (2n=38), chromosome numbers at metaphase II showed some variation, and the mean frequency of the euploid chromosome number (n=19) was approximately 78%. This value was almost the same in white-and yellow-flowered plants through early and late generations. Nevertheless, yellow-flowered plants tended to produce euploids more frequently than did white-flowered ones. It is assumed that the difference in euploid productivity between yellow-and white-flowered plants is due to the difference in seed fertility between them. The progeny of each hypoploid showed higher chromosome numbers than their parents. The progeny of each hyperploid showed lower chromosome numbers than their parents: they were approaching to euploidy. This phenomenon, together with higher fertility of euploids and lower fertility of aneuploids, will favor the maintenance of euploidy of this strain. © 1983 Veenman B.V., Wageningen.",aneuploid; Brassicoraphanus; chromosome number; flower colour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004678135

Bumblebees are the main pollinators, and analysis of the stigmatic pollen load in naturally |xjllinated flowers shows that pin stigmas receive many more pollen grains than thrum stigmas. Intramorph pollination is considerable in pins, while thrums are subject to some differential pollination. Emasculation experiments have shown that intraflower pollination in the thrum morph is negligible.

Again, as in L. perenne, one of these genes, defined as S, is linked in its inheritance to the gene, PGI-2, which codes for the enzyme phosphoglucoisomerase, the best estimate of the frequency of recombination between these two loci being [Equation found]. However, whereas in all previous experiments S and Z appear to have assorted independently, in two of these L. multiflorum families there is evidence that these genes are linked, the best estimate of their recombination frequency being [Equation found]. Crosses were made between 27 pairs of plants which included pairs that were expected, on the basis of pollen-stigma reactions, to be incompatible, half-compatible, three-quarters compatible and fully compatible. Fourteen plants were also self-pollinated and ten were allowed to set seed by open pollination. The seed-set obtained from the selfs (0·39 per cent) showed that L. multiflorum is no less self-incompatible than L. perenne. However, the seed-set obtained from incompatible crosses was significantly higher (3·77 per cent) than that obtained from selfs. On the other hand, there were no systematic differences between the three categories of compatible cross which gave an average seed-set of 20·60 per cent. Though there is some overlap between the distribution of the seed-set of these and incompatible crosses, on average these results confirm the classification of the plants on the basis of their pollen-stigma reactions. A rather approximate estimate of the number of S and Z alleles in the species, based on the number found in the four parents of the families examined, suggests that at least 40 different alleles are likely to be present at each locus. © 1983, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966185727

Two plants that differed greatly with regard to P-10 induction were used in additional experiments in order to ascertain the mechanism involved in the induction of P-10. The increase in P-10 activity due to pollination or fertilization can partly be explained on the basis of auxin and auxin-induced ethylene activity.

Fruit growth was only affected by the treatment with GA3, decreasing size and fresh weight by 60%. The peak sequence of hormones during fruit development was ethylene-GAs-IAA-ABA.

Also, in seeded fruits, a high proportion of IAA and ABA was found in the seeds whereas this was not the case for GAs. Hormone levels of tomato fruits may be successfully, easily and reproducibly altered by inducing parthenocarpic fruit growth and thus eliminating development of seeds which are a major source of hormone synthesis.

Near Banff, Alberta, the flowering period of this species is synchronized with the emergence of its pollinators, large bumblebee queens, in late spring. Calypso flowers appear to rely on the initial attraction and deception of newly-emerged naive bumblebees for pollination. Indirect evidence suggests that individual bees subsequently learn to avoid these flowers and that avoidance is learned quite rapidly. Avoidance behavior by pollinators is obviously detrimental to sexual reproduction in Calypso. This negative effect appears to be offset by the large number of seeds produced in plants which are effectively pollinated. A test of the hypothesis that Calypso flowers mimic flowers of the shooting star, Dodecatheon radicatum (Primulaceae) failed to provide evidence for mimicry. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020376116

Pollination intensity was measured by counting the number of allogamous pollen grains on stigmas of the large one-day flowers. Hand-pollinations demonstrated that 25-50 pollen grains are required for fruit set, and >450 are needed for maximum seed set, with a pollen:seed ratio of about 1.6:1.0. Hummingbirds (Phaethornis superciliosus) delivered sufficient allogamous pollen for maximum seed set to only 28% of the flowers examined. Naturally pollinated flowers yielded fewer fruits and fewer seeds per fruit than those pollinated by hand. Most pollen transferred by humming-birds was self-incompatible; emasculated flowers yielded higher seed set than flowers with intact anthers. Visitation rates did not provide a good index of effective pollination. There were significant differences in ovule number, maximum seed set, and maximum per cent seed set among individual vines. More than half of an individual's flowers failed to set fruit, whether pollinated by birds or by hand. In this population, maximum reproductive potential may be limited by maternal resources for fruit development, but seed set varies with pollination intensity.

This study examines the net effect of predation by the inflorescence spider, Peucetia viridans (Hentz), for seed production by a native plant species on which it hunts. Both pollination and seed set of Haplopappus venetus (Asteraceae) were reduced on branches with spiders; however, the release of viable, undamaged seed was higher on inflorescence branches with spiders than on those without. Occurrence of P. viridans was associated with the flat-topped inflorescence branch structure characteristic of H. venetus rather than with the vertical structure of its congener, H. squarrosus. Thus, the interaction should be a reinforcing selective pressure on inflorescence branch morphology of H. venetus over time. Two factors providing constraints on the degree and rate of coevolution of the plant-spider interaction are suggested by the results: (1) the critical role of phenological synchrony and (2) the opposing requirements of interacting species and of subsequent life history stages within a species. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020381487

Plants vary considerably in number of flowers per umbel and number of umbels per plant. The major pollinators, bumble bees, show several characteristic behaviors in response to the plant's presentation. 1. Foraging bees preferentially visit umbels that bear large numbers of open, male-phase flowers. They also prefer shoots with large numbers of umbels. 2. If bees have received high nectar rewards at one umbel, they are more likely to visit a neighboring umbel rather than leaving the area. On drained umbels, bees probe more empty flowers before rejecting the umbel if they have been rewarded just previously. 3. Individual bees restrict their foraging to limited areas. Within these areas, they concentrate their visits on certain shoots which they tend to visit in repeatable sequences, or ""traplines"". It is inappropriate to consider these bees as ""searching"". 4. We discuss some of the implications of these data for two areas of current theoretical interest: plant reproductive strategies and optimal foraging. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020385082

Progenies derived from self-pollinated seeds from random plants taken from four generations (F8, F13, F23, and F45) were tested against four different races of scald (40, 61, 72, and 74), and rated as resistant, susceptible or segregating. Striking increases in the frequency of families resistant to races 40, 61, and 74 occurred in CC II. A test for randomness showed that quadruply susceptible and triply resistant families were more common than expected under the assumption that resistance to different races is independent. Positive correlations were found between resistance to races 40, 61, and 74, but resistance to race 72 was independent of resistance to all other races.

No differences were seen between self and cross tube behaviour on the pin stigma surface, but self tubes were inhibited within the stigmatic tissue with differences in tube length evident after 24 h. The stigma surface bears a proteinaceous pellicle and binds the lectin Concanavalin A. Removal of the stigma removes the incompatibility barrier in mature gynoecia. Bud pollination shows that pollen tubes cannot grow in a normal manner on immature stigmas; the random growth of tubes over the stigma surface resembles that of mature thrum selfs. Fewer compatible tubes reach the style base of young gynoecia and smaller numbers of seeds are set than in mature flowers. Pin and thrum pollen grains germinate and grow in aqueous media, thrum tubes growing longer than pin. The presence of H3BO4 and CaCl2 in the growth medium promotes tube elongation and lengths equivalent to compatible styles can be obtained. The pollen grains have proteinaceous materials in their walls which diffuse out on moistening. Prolonged washing in aqueous media removes these materials but the incompatibility reaction remains unchanged. Thus the incompatibility reaction is between pollen tubes and stigmatic tissue and differs from the homomorphic, sporophytic system where pollen wall proteins elicit the incompatibility response. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",Heteromorphic self-incompatibility; Pollen germination; Pollen tube growth; Pollen-stigma interaction; Primula obconica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005637480

Although the temporal pattern of emergence of pollinators results in a relatively close tracking of flower abundance within a season, the ratio of pollinators to open flowers does vary significantly within a season, as well as between seasons. At any point in time during the flowering season, the population of adult yucca moths is distributed evenly among the available flowers, so that the number of pollinators on an inflorescence is directly proportional to the number of open flowers available. The relative isolation of individual flowering plants appears to have little effect on the distribution of pollinators among inflorescences. The number of fruits initiated on a plant is directly proportional to the number of flowers produced, and is also partially determined by the time of flowering. Yucca whipplei always produces many more flowers than fruits. Most flowers are not fertilized, and the plants also generally abort and abscise immature fruits after flowering. Fruit production of at least some plants, however, appeared limited by pollination. It is also expected that in some years the relative abundance of pollinators will be low enough that most plants will be pollinator-limited. It is suggested that the pattern of flowering and fruiting of this species has evolved in response to the unpredictability of pollinator availability, both within and between seasons. Resource uncertainty and selection acting on the male component of fitness may also be involved. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020461436

Young trees are recruited into an established forest. When the sex ratio of the established forest is even, the reproductive success of both male and female recruits increases with forest density, and in general a recruit of either sex contributes the same number of successful gametes. When the sex ratio of the established forest deviates from unity, the recruit of the minority sex has a reproductive advantage over the recruit of the majority sex. Because a forest with a biased sex ratio can produce the same level of pollination as a forest with an even sex ratio, the quantity of pollen reaching the stigma of a flower does not convey enough information to permit the sex ratio of progeny to be biased adaptively as has been claimed. The male recruit has a slight advantage over the female recruit when the pollen-ovule ratio is low and vice versa.

Grain set in such plants was less than that in plants grown at the lower temperature and hand pollinated with similar pollen, indicating that female fertility was reduced by high temperature.

Fifty-six North American cultivars (varieties and advanced selections) were pollinated by diploid clones, either W 5295.7 or W 5337.3 which are homozygous recessive for ps. The segregation ratios in regard to 2n pollen production in derived tetraploid progenies, from 4x×2x crosses, reveal the genotype of ps in the cultivars. Microsporogenesis of 2n pollen producing 4x progeny was observed to avoid an overestimation of the frequency of 2n pollen producing plants due to mechanisms other than parallel spindles.

The high frequency of ps in the tetraploid cultivars clearly supports the hypothesis that 2n pollen produced by plants homozygous recessive for ps have been involved in the origin of cultivated tetraploid potatoes, since a higher frequency of ps in the tetraploid than in the ancestral diploid population can be expected from sexual polyploidization but not from somatic doubling.

Echinate pollen grains, such as those of Catananche, are shown to accomodate volume changes by folding along the colpi and possibly by volume changes in the cavea. The different patterns of echinolophate pollen respond in different ways. Folding along the colpi is important in Scorzonera and Tragopogon and to a limited extent in Cichorium and Epilasia whilst in Scolymus the colpi are almost immobilized. Movements of the lacunar floors take over the harmomegathic function to compensate for lack of colpus mobility. Bulging of the intine at the apertures and changes in the size of the cavea may account for part of the volume change accomodated in any pollen type. Echinolophate pollen is interpreted as being a superior means of regulating volume changes with the most economical and mechanically efficient use of wall material which has evolved independently in several tribes of Compositae. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",Catananche; Cichorium; Compositae; Epilasia; Function; harmomegathy; Lactuceae; palynology; Scorzonera; Tragopogon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000016479

Bees avoid revisiting flowers by being able to differentiate recently visited from unvisited flowers. This recognition occurs while bees are flying over open flowers and appears to be a response to the amount of available pollen within flowers. Random foraging with respect to direction is the optimal strategy when the probability of flower revisitation is low. Bumblebees appear to be moving preferentially between nearest neighbors, again as predicted by foraging theory. This behavior causes the establishment of pollen patches in the P. gracilis population. Unlike other pollinators studied in similar situations, bumblebees on P. gracilis do not forage utilizing an area-restricted searching behavior. Because floral reward quality can be assessed at low cost by bees foraging on P. gracilis, their tendency to move to nearby flowers even after encountering a poor quality blossom apparently yields a higher rate of net energy intake than does area-restricted searching. The data indicate that bumblebees exhibit great plasticity in foraging behavior and that they are able to forage efficiently under a wide range of environmental conditions. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020363451

Progressive degeneration of papular cells is observed in stigmas from open flowers and at anthesis papillae may be moribund and collapsed. Fluid emanating from the hollow style flows onto the surface through ruptures in the cuticle at the interpapillar junctions into the interstices at maturity. This secretion stains positively for protein. Stigmas are of the ""wet"" type. The cuticle overlying the papillar cells is ridged and at the final stages prior to flowering this cuticle becomes detached from the underlying cellulosic wall. The sub-cuticular space so formed is filled with secretion. In Aneilema species detachment of cuticle is at the papillar tip and along the lateral walls. In Commelina species the anticlinal walls of adjacent papillae are strongly attached for much of their length and thus detachment of cuticle is restricted to the papillar tip.

It flowers annually, and has an extended flowering period, with individuals flowering somewhat asynchronously, presenting small flowers with minimal visual lures. The flowers are visited by an unrestricted array of apparently imprecise opportunistic feeders, predominated by trigonid bees and butterflies. Most of these visitors exhibit low fidelity and forage opportunistically on numerous competing tree species. Presentation of nectar in alternating rhythms between the male and hermaphrodite trees appears to induce pollinator movement between them. Out of such alternating visits between the sexes, a low level of short?range inter?tree pollen transfer by trigonids and butterflies seems to occur. Despite the elaborate system which promotes pollinator movement between the sexes, this species has retained a low level of self?compatibility. The physical barriers to pollinator movement in the understorey, and high interspecific competition for pollinators by a large number of tree species, appear therefore to make it difficult to maintain an obligate outbreeding system. Hence, androdioecism may be one of the explanations for the survival of X. intermedium. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

Relative visitation rate on a species was uncorrelated with the amount of flowering time overlap experienced from species with similar pollinators; thus overlap is not a good indicator of competition for visits. Visitation rates were also measured on 3 species in artificial and natural competition experiments. In one species, pressure of a potential competitor decreased visitation, but in 2 others increased it. Whether interspecific overlap increases or decreases visitation probably depends on floral similarity, pollinator constancy, spatial proximity of interactants, and other idiosyncratic characteristics of the interaction. The role of competition for visits is discussed as one component of competition for successful pollination service. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020382127

A major selective force driving the evolution of separate sexes is suggested to be the partitioning of limited resources associated with pollinator maintenance and fruit production in a semi-arid mediterranean climate. The hummingbird Rhodopsis vesper atacamensis is the only known pollinator, and appears to be energetically dependent upon F. lycioides. Hermaphrodites are facultative in their fruit production, produce as much as 6 times more nectar than females, and feed birds both prior to flower opening and during anthesis. Females bear abundant fruit and produce only a relatively small amount of nectar during anthesis. Nectar production is extremely variable in both sexes but is unpredictable in hermaphrodites and apparently predictable in females. The unpredictability of hermaphrodite nectar production may be a key factor permitting the evolution of resource partitioning into large-flowered bird-feeding pollen plants and small-flowered reproductive individuals.-Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020341835

The study was carried out on the Devil's Ditch, Cambridgeshire where C. nigra is rayless, and on Hod Hill, Dorset where C. nigra is rayed, with a few results from a garden trial set out in the Cambridge Botanic Garden. In the counts of insects in each area of the Devil's Ditch the numbers recorded feeding on each Centaurea species per capitulum were approximately proportional to the nectar reward of each species. On Hod Hill the number of insect visits to C. nigra plants from which rays had been removed was half to three?quarters of the number of visits to rayed capitula. This is very similar to the difference on the Devil's Ditch between the number of visits to C. scabiosa (rayed) and C. nigra (rayless), and this difference may therefore be a result simply of the possession of ray florets in C. scabiosa but not in C. nigra. The difference between the two species on Hod Hill was greater (C. scabiosa receiving two to three times as many visits as C. nigra) although C. nigra possesses ray florets and therefore resembles C. scabiosa. Some bees were observed visiting C. scabiosa selectively on Hod Hill but none did so on the Devil's Ditch. On the Devil's Ditch both species had similar numbers of styles successfully fertilized on nearly all dates. Hod Hill on most dates a similar number of styles was fertilized in each species, but on a few dates C. scabiosa had more successful fertilizations than C. nigra. It is concluded that competition for pollinators is not a strong selective factor in Centaurea on the Devil's Ditch but may be a factor promoting the later flowering and the possession of ray florets in C. nigra on Hod Hill. Competition for pollinators may have been more important as a selection pressure in the past when less suitable habitat was available. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

Staminate and bisexual inflorescence faced a far higher probability of destruction than pistillate inflorescences. Although destruction of staminate spikes is not deleterious to the fitness contribution of staminate spikes since the pollen is carried on the bat's face or bird's feathers, destruction of the bisexual spike is deleterious since the investment in gynoecial structures is forfeited.

As a consequence of these differences, D. scandens is pollinated by euglossine bees and D. cissifolia is pollinated by Hypanthidium nr. panamense (Megachilidae). In the vicinity of Manaus, Brazil, a different ecotype of D. scandens occurs sympatrically with D. affinis. Here S. scandens differs from its sympatric congener in time of bract opening, amount of resin secreted and position of flowers in the inflorescence.

In the late-summer group all species overlapped considerably in flowering time and their insect visitors, which suggests that there has not been any strong selection against an overlap. There appeared to be a saturation of insect visitors in late summer, with particularly large numbers of B. lapidarius.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020409679

Groups of Trigona (Trigona) ferricauda (Apidae: Meliponinae) arrived at flowers in early morning; each bee dominated a single flower that it perforated to rob nectar. Robbers in each patch aggressively defended their feeding sites from the sole pollinator of the plant, the hermit hummingbird Phaethornis superciliosus (Trochilidae: Phaethorninae). Less visitation by hummingbirds and reduced seed production resulted from nectar robbing. Flower number in patches was not associated with visitation per flower by pollinators, but patches having the most flowers were entered more often by P. superciliosus. In contrast, thieving P. longuemareus and robbing T. ferricauda showed no patch preference related to total flower number. Seed production per flower was not related to total number of flowers presented in patches at one time. Average proportion of robbed flowers through the entire flowering episode was 36% among 66 patches at one site and 35% among five patches at a second site. Reduced seed production was not caused directly by robber damage to flowers, but indirectly through successful deterrence of birds via joint attacks by bees on and near the flower visited by a hummingbird. Although fewer seeds were produced by robbed flowers overall, robbed and unrobbed flowers in patches that were heavily robbed did not differ in seed production. Thus robbing primarily influenced reproductive success at the level of the flower patch. P. dasypetala was self-pollinating, yet unrobbed flowers that were not bagged produced 67% more seeds than those not visited by P. superciliosus. Persistent robbing by Trigona may result in selective advantage for autogamous or apomictic P. dasypetala.-Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020367758

In part of the experiments flower heads were emasculated before pollination. Gametic competition was deduced from the percentages of hybrid seeds in the various experiments with flower colour functioning as a marker. Among self pollen parent (SPP) clones large differences occurred for frequency of germinated pollen grains after self pollination. These differences were positively correlated with the degree of self-compatibility (SC) of the clones. No significant differences for pollen germination rate were found. Among SPP clones large differences occurred for general hybrid producing ability (GHPA). There was a significant negative correlation between GHPA and SC of the clones. Among foreign pollen parent (FPP) clones, used for pollination of SPP clones, large differences occurred for general hybrid inducing ability (GHIA). Results from removing the stigma and a part of the style at varying intervals after mixed pollination and results from double pollination with a delayed second, FPP, pollination suggest differences in pollen tube growth rate in the apical part of the style and in the basal part and/or in the ovary. Besides general HPA and general HIA also specific HPA (SHPA) and specific HIA (SHIA) occur. © 1982 H.

The island effect significantly exceeded even the high month-to-month, plant-to-plant variation in visits received within each plant population. 2) Pollen loads carried by hummingbirds and bananaquits on Tobago tended to be mixed, whereas birds on Trinidad often carried single-species loads. 3) In 2 of 3 plant species studied intensively, Tobago flowers secreted greater volumes of nectar than Trinidad flowers. An indirect measure of nectar standing crop, the time a hummingbird spent probing a flower, suggested that Tobago plants as a group secreted higher nectar volumes than Trinidad conspecifics. 4) Contrary to predictions that flowering seasons should overlap less on Tobago than on Trinidad, there was no discernible difference in flowering seasons between Trinidad and Tobago conspecifics. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020371188

Although I. douglasiana is a vigorous vegetative reproducer, outcrossing in this species is increased through the interaction of nectar flow, flower phenology and pollinator behavior. The flowers are protandrous, with a peak nectar production on the 1st day of stigma receptivity. Pooling of the nectar allows bees to remove most of the liquid reward from any one of the 3 floral units of each I. douglasiana flower. Bees have a strong tendency to visit only one unit of each flower before flying to another flower, thus increasing the possibility of outcrossing. Bees also show a consistently strong directionality in their flights, while showing no difference in the distance flown on calm or windy days.

Luehea candida, flowering during the wet season, has self-incompatible flowers pollinated primarily by sphingid moths. Generalist diurnal visitors, including stingless bees, flies and butterflies, were also common flower visitors, but they were ineffective pollinators. Luehea candida rejects pollen from nearby conspecifics as a means of limiting inbreeding resulting from pollination by poor outcrossers such as stingless bees. The principal pollinators of L. seemannii, which flowers during the dry season, were the same types of diurnal visitors that contributed nothing to pollination success of L. candida. Nocturnal moths were low in abundance during the dry season and pollinated few flowers. Individuals of the deciduous forest population of L. seemannii ranged from partially to fully self-compatible, though an evergreen forest population was self-incompatible.

Bumblebee queens which had just emerged from overwintering pollinated B. leucophaea, but only 10% of the flowers initiated pods and only 54% of the ovules within those pods matured. The distally opening flowers on the horizontal raceme of B. leucophaea successfully encouraged the queens to walk from flowers releasing pollen to those with receptive stigmas, thus promoting selfing. After a week, when neither Baptisia species flowered, B. leucantha began flowering and was pollinated by the worker off-spring of the queen bumblebees present earlier. The more numerous workers promoted pod initiation from all flowers and maturation of 78% of the ovules within the pods. Xenogamous pollen movements alone were encouraged on the erect B. leucantha racemes by varying nectar rewards in flowers of different age. Bees visited first the lower, nectar-rich flowers in the pistillate phase, then flew up the raceme toward nectar-poor flowers in the staminate phase. Although seed set was greater in B. leucantha, seed predation was higher later in the season. All seeds within 96% (1978) and 92% (1979) of the B. leucantha pods were destroyed. Most of the seeds that were produced came from a few plants hidden in shrubby vegetation along intermittent watercourses. In comparison, B. leucophaea lost significantly fewer pods to seed predators: 89% in 1978 and 65% in 1979. The overall result of low seed initiation but moderate seed predation in B. leucophaea was the consistent production of at least some pods with seeds through the prairie (1.2 seeds per plant in 1978). In most years, B. leucantha plants growing on the open prairie produced still fewer pods with seeds due to heavy seed predation (0.05 seeds per plant in 1978), but had a much higher seed production potential in years when seed predators were in low abundance. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020467853

Unlike most other members of the spring wildflower community, its flowers are nectarless and autogamous. The number of insect visits a flower receives varies markedly through the blooming season and is lowest when H. americana is in full bloom. Potential for outcrossing as measured by the seed set of emasculated flowers follows the same pattern. The mid-season decline in insect-pollination is most likely the result of competition with Erythronium umbilicatum, which flowers concurrently with H. americana and is much more attractive to the solitary bees that are the principal early season pollen vectors. Because of this competitive disadvantage, seed set of H. americana in piedmont North Carolina would be pollination-limited if the flowers were not autogamous. Autogamy may also be favored by flowering early in the spring before pollinators are available. Opportunities for outcrossing in H. americana are primarily the result of protogyny and blooming earlier than competitors.-Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020425184

Pollination experiments reveal that pollen from a particular species has the highest probability of reaching the ovules of its own species. The phenomenon of species-specific pollination appears to be related to the specific morphometry of scale-bract complexes and the terminal settling velocity of pollen of the same species. These data are interpreted as evidence for a reciprocity between the aerodynamic characteristics of airborne pollen and ovulate cones of some conifer species.

Seventeen of 30 interspecific pollinations in vitro failed to produce pollen tubes in the style over the same time.

Despite the problems that blowflies cause man, and the disgust they engender, they play a valuable role as pollinators of some plants in horticulture and can increase seed yields. Without the early invasion of carrion by blowflies and their preparation of it for the arrival of other arthropods, the processes of putrefaction and decay of corpses would be limited. Because blowflies are the first insects to arrive at a dead body, and different species groups oviposit in a strict sequence, they are valuable in forensic medicine as determinants of the time of death. The use of blowfly maggots for the healing of osteomyelitis wounds has been superseded by antibiotics but, when surgical maggots were in vogue, they helped heal large numbers of otherwise intractable lesions. The beneficial aspects of Calliphoridae extend even to their use as food by man, although this practice is not widespread and other insect species have more appeal and are eaten more frequently.

The relative frequencies of male and hermaphroditic flowers undergo a seasonal variation which is caused primarily by a decreased production of male flowers during the latter half of the season. The high frequency of male flowers coincident with the peak flowering period may be adaptive in preventing excessive fruit set.

Anthophorid bees of the genus Centris were the most important pollinators. Behavior of both small and large Centris species indicated no consistent preference for flowers either in the densest floral arrays or within the stratum containing most flowers in the local flowering population. Flowers 7-12m in height were never visited more often than flowers = or <4m from ground level. However, within groups of 5-33 flowers, Centris visited on average at least 50% of the flowers during a foraging bout. Pollinating bees were indiscriminate in selecting inflorescences within floral arrays, but they appeared to maximize the rate of resource harvest once a small group of flowers was entered. Cochlospermum fruit contained an average seed number equal to 13% of the average ovule number per flower. Seed-set per fruit was no higher among flowers visited more often by pollinators than among flowers visited less frequently. Female competition for pollinators was not detected, but male competition may have occurred at a site where bees preferred flowers that were most abundant in the patch as a whole. Efficient outcrossing of a tree is in direct conflict with the optimal foraging of its pollinators. Cochlospermum may manipulate pollinators by 1) presenting small numbers of open flowers, 2) presenting large, conspicuous flowers and no leaves, and 3) providing only pollen concealed in poricidal anthers as a reward. If pollinators rather than the physiological capacity of a tree limited reproductive success, this probably arose from deposition of incompatible pollen on stigmas, rather than intertree competition or low pollinator abundance.-Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020384798

Male and female flowers differ structurally, but appear superficially similar and the principal dry season pollinator, a butterfly Eurema daira did not discriminate between them. Female flowers offered little or no nectar reward and may mimic males in order to receive pollen. Male flowers last only 1 day; female flowers usually last 1 day but may remain receptive for 7 days if unpollinated. Flowers opened between 00.00 hours and 01.00 hours, opening earlier as the wet season approached. This shift is probably correlated with a change to nocturnal moth pollination in the wet season. Within an inflorescence there are c. 16 times more male than female flowers. Female flowers occur in the lowermost positions and open first. Female flowering is followed by a brief period when no flowers open and then by an extended period of male flowering. Although there is no overlap between male and female phases within an inflorescence, nonsynchronous development of several inflorescences on one individual means that selfing is possible for nearly all female flowers. However, observations of pollinator behaviour indicate that butterflies frequently move to another plant after visiting one inflorescence. Thus there is a large degree of outcrossing in practice.

Cross and self pollen tubes were cultured in Victoria plum flowers (Prunus domestica L.) at 5, 10, 15 and 20°C. Pollen?tube lengths measured at intervals were fitted by S?shaped growth curves (logistic function) and the parameters of the curves used to derive a generalized model for pollen?tube growth based on accumulated temperatures. Above the threshold of 2.5°C, maximum growth rate was 0.34 mm per day?degree and the tubes reached half their final length at 16.6 day?degrees above 2.5°C. The model indicates that fertilization of plum flowers requires 1620 d at a constant temperature of 5°C after pollination, but only 34 d at 15°C. Mathematical expressions based on the model are given for estimating pollen?tube penetration and growth rate from values of cumulated temperature since pollination, and for estimating the cumulated temperature necessary for pollen tubes to penetrate a given distance. Pollen?tube growth rates were the same in detached flowers, flowers attached to twigs, and flowers on young, grafted trees in pots. In detached flowers growth stopped before fertilization could occur, but some embryo sacs were fertilized in both the remaining treatments. Accurate pollen?tube growth assessments can therefore be made with detached flowers which are most convenient to use and can be accommodated in small incubators. Studies on fertilization, however, must use flowers on bulky and expensive grafted trees. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

The most tolerant population originated from a cliff site very exposed to natural salt spray. Reciprocal differences found between progeny of tolerant and non?tolerant maternal parents were explained on the assumption of illegitimate selfs in crosses produced by automatic cross pollination without emasculation. To allow for this, selfing parameters were introduced into a basic additive?dominance genetic model of generation means. The potential for selfing, estimated from isolated inflorescences, was found to vary between populations. The model gave a good fit with observed generation tolerance values when selfing estimates were included and additive and dominance components of the means were calculated. In general, tolerance was dominant to non?tolerance at salt levels similar to that of sea water but recessive at much higher salt levels, although populations differed in the degree of dominance expressed in the crosses with S59.

The half-inferior ovary normally contained two ovules. The embryo sac extended beyond the ovule at the micropylar end and into the placenta at the chalazal end. Half of the ovaries observed at both anthesis and 4 days following anthesis had no embryo sacs and the other half had one embryo sac. Occasional ovaries had two embryo sacs and some underdeveloped embryo sacs were observed that did not extend beyond the ovule or into the placenta. Pollen tubes had reached the ovary by 1 day following pollination and the stigma was receptive for 8 days following anthesis. Only half of the pistils had pollen tubes in the ovary.

Three differences in plant growth patterns appear to result from increasing growing season length: 1) temporal variability in environmental conditions during a long growing season leads to a greater diversity in plant life forms; 2) phenological stages are more separated in time, and their duration varies more among species in a community with a longer growing season; and 3) the staggering of flowering promotes insect pollinator specialization in the lowland prairie.-from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020343732

Pollinia were retained an average of slightly over one day on the mouthparts and one-quarter day on the feet. This long retention period enhances the possibility of outcrossing in this largely or completely self-incompatible species. Although many more pollinia were carried on the feet, the longer retention of those on the mouthparts resulted in their collective outcrossing potential exceeding that of pollinia on the feet. Once pollinia became attached to the bees (via their attachment mechanisms, the corpuscula), others often attached to the translator arms (connecting corpusculum with pollinia) of the first pollinia. Long strings of pollinia and corpuscula often resulted, but they frequently were shed down to a single corpusculum, which was usually retained for long periods (estimated retention time=12-43 days). During the middle and latter part of the flowering period about two-thirds of the bees' feet carried only a single corpusculum. Feet in this condition picked up extremely few pollinia and thus were largely unavailable as sites for pollen transfer. Having several single corpuscula on the feet greatly lowered the number of pollinia carried by a bee over the season. Single corpuscula occurred much less frequently on the mouthparts and were shed over 25 times as rapidly as those on the feet. Many more bumble bees moved between clones than did other possible diurnal pollinators, largely a result of being several times more abundant than all other visitors combined. This factor, plus their heavy pollinia load, suggests that they were the most important diurnal pollinators of these clones. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020456979

Viability was not affected by stress at any stage, but alterations in the dynamics of flowering reduced the number of pollen grains available for pollination of the last ears to silk within the stressed populations. In a second experiment the effects of stress at the start of pollen-shedding on the availability of pollen during the presentation of silks was studied in a set of six cultivars. There was considerable variability between cultivars in the number of pollen grains produced per tassel, and water stress decreased the quantity of pollen grains harvested. There was a strong association between pollen availability and kernel number in the apical ear (as a proportion of control values). Two effects of stress on pollen availability were distinguished: a reduction in the duration of exposure of silks of the apical ear to pollen, and a fall in the rate of pollen production during the period in which receptive silks were present. The relative importance of these effects in determining pollen availability varied with cultivar. © 1982.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001647538

Insectistasis can be evoked under natural as well as artificial conditions and denotes a state wherein the population density of phytophagous insect species is diminished to the extent of allowing plant growth without significant impairment. Numerous plant species are equipped with insectistatics which may either retard or interrupt the development and reproduction of harmful insect species (fig. 1) or diminish their population density on the plants consumed by them. Many flowering plants require for pollination certain insect species and are also protected against feeding and destruction by insects; the reproductive organs of numerous Spermatophyta are particularly defended by various physical devices such as sticky rings around the stalks, adhesive surfaces on different types of leaves, coagulating excretions as well as variegated mechanical barrieres. The adults of certain insect species approach flowers in response to a sequence of sensory stimuli originating in the colour, shape and scent of the former, while the larvae of many insect species are usually deterred from consuming plant tissues by means of various volatile and water?soluble repellents which act on the olfactory and gustatory receptors of the insects. Interestingly enough, some species of insects were capable to adapt themselves to deterrent plant species, eventually leading to habituation and adoption of new hosts by the insects involved. Several plant species can induce insectistasis in insects which cannot be deterred (fig. 2), the former resulting from a markedly retarded development which may be caused by excessive dilution or disproportion of the food components (e. g. phloem sap) or by the availability of nutrient?, metabolite? or other antagonists (e. g. vitamin C?oxidase, thiaminase, linamarase, phaseolunatin, gossypols, saponines, trypsin inhibitors). Insectivorous plants are capable to lure various insect species owing to a sequence of sensory stimuli provided by the colour, shape, scent and taste of both leaves and flowers as well as to capture and to digest their prey in more or less elaborate devices (fig. 3, 4). According to the type of capturing prey, carnivorous plant species may be grouped in pitcher, glandular and shutter traps. Since insectivorous Spermatophyta and Fungi are often growing in nutrient?deficient soil, their trapping devices permit them to obtain a food supplement, whereby the insect population of the environment may become diluted. The capture of insects by some higher Fungi (e. g. Amanitaceae) may be a means of protection against feeding and possibly an enrichment of the soil by nutrients. The adhesive traps (fig. 5) used by man for catching harmful flies (Cyclorrhapha) and storage moths (Phycitinae) are in fact a simplified imitation of the luring and trapping device of the Portuguese Sundew, Drosophyllum lusitanicum (fig. 3). Der regulierende Einfluß der Insektistasis auf die komplexen Wechselbeziehungen zwischen periodisch auftretender Pflanzen? und Insektenvermehrung wird anhand einiger Beispiele erläutert und diskutiert. Insektistasis kann natürlicherweise oder künstlich hervorgerufen werden und bezeichnet einen Zustand, worin die Populationsdichte phytophager Insektenarten dermaßen vermindert ist, daß die Weiterentwicklung der, in ihrer Umgebung befindlichen, Pflanzenarten nicht wesentlich beeinträchtigt ist. Viele Pflanzenarten verfügen über Insektistatika, die die Entwicklung und Fortpflanzung schädlicher Insektenpopulationen auf verschiedene Weise hemmen (Abb. 1), unterbrechen bzw. verlangsamen oder die Populationsdichte der Schadinsekten vermindern können. Blütenpflanzen, die einerseits die Insekten zur Bestäubung benötigen und sich andererseits vor Insektenfraß und ?Zerstörung schützen müssen, verfügen über mannigfache physikalische Schutzvorrichtungen ? besonders zur Erhaltung ihrer Fortpflanzungsorgane (z. B. Kleberinge am Stengel und Blütenstiel, Klebeflächen an verschiedenen Blättern, gerinnende Säfte sowie vielfältige mechanische Barrieren). Insekten (hpts. Imagines), die aufgrund einer Reizkette aus Farbe, Form und Duft an die Blüten gelangen, werden mit Hilfe gasförmiger bzw. wasserlöslicher Abschreckstoffe [Repellents], die auf die Geruchs? bzw. Geschmacksorgane der Insekten (hpts. Larven) wirken, vom Fraß an den Pflanzengeweben abgehalten. Erstaunlicherweise konnten sich jedoch manche Insektenarten an ursprünglich abschreckende Pflanzenarten langfristig adaptieren, womit letztere zu Wirten umfunktioniert wurden (Habituation). Bei nicht?abhaltbaren Insektenarten (Abb. 2) bewirken Pflanzen häufig Insektistasis aufgrund beträchtlicher Entwicklungsverzögerung oder ?Hemmung, hervorgerufen durch übermäßige Verdünnung bzw. Disproportionierung der Nahrungsbestandteile (bspw. Phloemsaft) oder Abgabe von Nährstoffantagonisten (z. B. Vitamin?C?Oxidase, Thiaminase, Linamarase, Phaseolunatin, Gossypole, Saponine, Trypsininhibitor). Insektivore Pflanzenarten sind in der Lage, verschiedene Insektenarten mittels Reizketten aus Farbe, Form, Duft und Geschmack zu ködern und zu verdauen, wozu sie mit einfachen bzw. hochentwickelten Fangvorrichtungen (Schlauch?, Drüsen? und Schließfänger) ausgestattet sind (Abb. 3,4). Diese Köderfallen ermöglichen den, häufig in nährstoffarmen Böden wachsenden, insektivoren Pflanzenarten zusätzlichen Nahrungserhalt, wobei die Insektenpopulation der Umgebung verdünnt werden kann. Die Insektenköderung und ?Abtötung an einigen Pilzarten (Amanitaceae) kann als Fraßschutz und möglicherweise Anreicherung des Nährbodens interpretiert werden.

Light availability was the most important environmental factor influencing among-plant differences in ratios of flower types and production of mature fruit, though variability of the former may also have had a large genetic component. Within inflorescences, bisexual flowers were most common basally, especially near the central inflorescence axis, and on the side of the inflorescence away from the branch bearing the inflorescence. Predator and pollinator behavior, and requirements for fruit support were potentially important in determining this pattern. Bisexual flowers tended to occur in inflorescences receiving most light, and having the most subtending leaves and greatest yearly twig elongation. Abundance of bisexual flowers through time showed 1) a strong negative correlation with intensity of predation on fruits produced from flowers borne at these times, 2) a negative correlation with intensity of predation on flowers, and 3) a positive correlation with probability of pollinator visitation.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020367784

This investigation evaluated methods for incorporating exotic germplasm into cultivated peanuts, especially for Cercospora arachidicolaHori resistance. Interspecific hybrids between A. hypogaea (cvs. NC 2 and NC 5) and the wild species A. cardenasiiKrap. et Greg.nom. nud. and A. chacoenseKrap. et Greg.nom. nud. were analyzed cytologically and for leafspot resistance. All F<inf>1</inf> hybrids were sterile, had irregular meiosis, and very few multivalents. They were highly resistant to C. arachidicola in field tests and had a 10-fold reduction of conidia per lesion in the greenhouse as compared to A. hypogaea cultivars. After colchicine treatments of F<inf>1</inf> hybrids, hexaploids (2n=60) and aneuploids (2n=54, 56, 63) were observed. The hexaploids had up to 18 univalents per pollen mother cell and very few multivalents, indicating a low frequency of intergenomic chromosome pairing. For C. arachidicola resistance, significant differences were not found among wild species parents, F<inf>1</inf> hybrids and two generations of hexaploids. Most hexaploids were stable at 2n=60 and embryos aborted when backcrosses with the respective wild species were attempted. However, when hexaploids were backcrossed to A. hypogaea, several fertile pentaploid (2n=50) offspring were obtained. Use of self-pollinating pentaploids is believed to be the quickest method to recover 40-chromosome hybrid derivatives in these hybrids. © 1982 H.

Fruit initiated early in the season tended to grow slowly at first, whereas those initiated later tended to grow rapidly; this growth pattern dampened the effect of the order of fruit initiation on maturation sequence. The hypothesis that more outcrossed fruit matured than selfed fruit was rejected. Experiments were performed to determine if a) fruit resulting from pollination by a particular plant mature more rapidly than do those resulting from pollination by other plants, and b) fruit resulting from mixed pollen loads mature more readily than those pollinated by a single plant. These ideas were also rejected. The hypothesis that fruit with a large number or percentage of fertilized ovules are selectively matured was supported by both glasshouse experiments and field observations. Percentage of fertilized ovules seemed to be more clearly related to fruit growth and maturation than was number of fertilized ovules. Natural selection may favor individuals that selectively mature fully fertilized fruit because such fruit 1) may be more resource-efficient because they contain less pericarp per seed, 2) may provide better dispersal of seed, or 3) may contain high- quality seed owing to increased gamete competition. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020363870

Although genotype x inoculation interaction was significant, the difference between the most resistant and most susceptible genotypes was maintained from the third to the fourth inoculation. The limited response to selection on an individual plant basis suggests that initial selection would have to be done on clonally replicated genotypes or by repeated inoculations of single plants.

This species is hemiphilic and polyphilic. Few of the many insects attracted to the flowers are effective pollinators, the most important being nocturnal scarab beetles and, to a lesser extent, small marsupials. Flower opening is usually triggered by effective pollinators with almost immediate removal of pollen. The stigma is not receptive until the next night. The species is self- compatible, with selfing (autogamy and geitonogamy) probably accounting for most seed set. Protandry usually fails as an outbreeding device (xenogamy) because of staggered anthesis within and between conflorescences. Pollinators serve essentially to move pollen geitonogamously from flowers in a staminate condition to those in a pistillate condition. The low level of fertilization (14% of mature flowers) indicates that the conflorescences can be considered functionally andromonoecious. The low seed set (6% of mature flowers) however, is due primarily to limited carrying capacity of the rachis.

When alleles failed to segregate into the expected S ratios, further studies were conducted to discover the cause of the deviation. Progenies of S2.3 plants were deficient in S2. possibly because of weakened expression of S3 in the style due to competition with S2 for a limited stylar substrate needed to make the Incompatibility reaction functional. An hypothesis of differing numbers of PSC genes loosely linked to S2 and S5 explained the deficiency of S2.2 plants in one and S5.5 in two other progenies from selfs and Intercrosses of S2.5 plants. Self pollination of S5.6 plants yielded two progenies that had a greater number of S5.5 plants than expected, possibly due to either a combination of linked PSC genes and latematuring S6 ovules or to selective fertilization.

Two protein bands (2.6 × 104 and 4.4 × 104 Dalton) were found to be vacuolar storage proteins, which accumulated during seed ripening (90 to 160 days after pollination) and which were specifically utilised during germination. Although the storage proteins are poorly soluble at pH 3.54.5, proteolysis during incubation of acetone dry powders is highest in this pH range. All proteins are digested at 50°C, pH 4.5. During seed incubation at 50°C, pH 4.5, however, the storage proteins are degraded preferentially although the cells are dead at 50°C.

Uplift of the Andes, mostly in Neogene time, led to an incredible burst of speciation in a number of Gondwanan families. A similar evolutionary explosion in the same taxa also took place in Costa Rica and Panama. The taxonomic groups that have undergone this evolutionary explosion have distributional centers in the N Andean region and S Central America, are poorly represented in Amazonia, and consist mostly of epiphytes, shrubs, and palmettos; their pollination systems suggest that coevolutionary relationships with hummingbirds, nectar-feeding bats, and perhaps such specialized bees as euglossines, have played a prominent role in their evolution. The evolutionary phenomena associated with the Andean uplift account for almost half of the total Neotropical flora and are thus largely responsible for the excess floristic richness of the Neotropics. Closing of the Panamanian isthmus in the Pliocene led to 1) southward migration of some Laurasian taxa into the Andes where they have become ecologically dominant despite undergoing little speciation, at least in woody taxa, and 2) northward invasion of lowland Gondwanan taxa of canopy trees and lianas into Central America, leading to their ecological dominance in lowland tropical forests throughout the region, despite little significant speciation in Central America.-from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020234522

The model has been devised by expressing the behaviour of the Bs, at various phases of the life cycle, in terms of mathematical equations. These equations contain parameters which determine the behaviour of the Bs at meiosis, pollen grain (and egg cell) mitosis and during the development of gametes and sporophytes. By exploring a range of values for the parameters it has been possible to ascertain that variation in the amount of meiotic elimination of Bs, as well as in their direction rate during nondisjunction in the pollen grain and egg cell, influence the final B-frequency equilibrium. Variation in the rate of nondisjunction on the other hand, affects the number of generations required to attain equilibrium more than the final equilibrium itself. Selection against gametes and plants containing Bs, even at levels which are higher than can reasonably be expected to occur naturally, cannot prevent the accumulation of Bs within populations, provided that high rates of directed nondisjunction are also occurring.

Different cluster and factor analyses were performed with this data matrix in order to identify phenetically similar taxa and at the same time reveal differences in results owing to different statistical procedures. Regardless of the clustering method applied, several genera or complexes are measurably distinct from each other and all other Pleurothallidinae, notably Dracula, Dresslerella, and the Pleurothallis alexandrae and Pleurothallis peduncularis complexes. After further, confirmatory studies, it may become appropriate to erect new genera for the Pleurothallis alexandrae and Pleurothallis peduncularis complexes.

Photoperiod and temperature influenced the number of days to first anthesis (FA) mainly during the emergence (E) to head-visible (HV) stage of growth. Leaf counts and plant height measurements supported this finding. There were major differences in the responses of the two cultivars to short photoperiods and low temperatures. The differences were removed by increasing temperature to a regimen of 27/22°C (day/night) or by increasing the photoperiod to 14 h. At low temperature, Sunfola 68-2 showed little response to photoperiods of between 10 and 14 h, whereas Hysun 30 showed a marked increase in duration of the E-HV stage for photoperiods shorter than 14 h. At photoperiods of 10 and 12 h there was a general decline in all measured attributes with increases in temperature, except the number of leaves on Sunfola 68-2 which remained relatively constant. Hysun 30 was similar to its male parent (R line) in response to photoperiod and temperature.

Removal of competitors and addition of water to plants showed that resource levels prior to fruit filling influence plant size which, in turn, is positively related to the number of fruit matured. Manual addition of pollen to flowers in the field did not increase number of fruit matured, suggesting that fruit production was not pollinator limited. Removal of rapidly growing fruit resulted in growth and maturation of fruit that normally would not have matured; resources thus limited fruit production. In 4 populations studied, 24-70% of initiated fruit matured, 12-40% aborted or died, 3-31% were still developing at the time of plant death, and 6-12% were lost to predators. In fruit that matured, between 23% and 73% of initiated seeds reached maturity, 22-43% were aborted, and 0-49% were lost to seed predators. Seed production was thus limited by resources and seed predators. It is hypothesized that overinitiation of fruit is here an adaptive response to: 1) variation in fruit quality coupled with the ability of the plant to selectively mature high-quality fruit, or 2) unpredictability of resource levels and survival during fruit filling.

Further studies showed that it is transmitted by inoculation of sap through seed; it is probably transmitted to plants by pollination. Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) shares all these attributes and is known to infect all yellows?sensitive raspberry cultivars except Puyallup and Sumner; however, neither of these cultivars has been tested by graft inoculation with RBDV. RBDV commonly infects plants symptomiessly, even those of yellows?sensitive cultivars, but it induced yellows when inoculated either manually to Norfolk Giant raspberry or by grafting to a yellows?sensitive raspberry selection. The evidence suggests that RBDV is the causal agent of yellows disease but that symptom expression is greatiy dependent on genetic and environmental factors. Many red raspberry cultivars are resistant, probably immune, to the type culture of RBDV and this character was shown to be conferred by a single dominant gene designated Bu.

All subjects were asked about the complaint of clinical manifestations from pollens and examined by the intradermal skin test with pollen extracts. Airborne pollens were collected in the pear orchard using a gravity sampler. The results are as follows. 1. Many pollen grains of annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) and other grasses were observed in the atmosphere of the pear orchard throughout the late April to May. Almost all pollen grains of Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) were found in the late April, although a few of them were detected during May. 2. The prevalence rate of nasal symptoms and ocular symptom of the farmers was about 20%. The peak of incidence of nasal symptoms and ocular symptom was observed in April to June. During these months, artificial pollinations of Japanese pears are carried out and the annual bluegrass pollens were wafting in the air. 3. Positive skin reactions to Japanese pear pollens were observed in 5.4% of the farmers and positive skin reactions to annual bluegrass pollens in 31.5% of them. All the positive skin reactors to Japanese pear pollens also showed the positive skin reaction to annual bluegrass pollens. The positive reaction to annual bluegrass pollens was more common among the farmers who worked more than 11 years than those worked less than 10 years. 4. Nasal symptoms such as sneeze were more common among the positive skin reactors to annual bluegrass pollens compared with the negative skin reactors. The seasonal peak of nasal and ocular symptoms was observed only among the positive skin reactors. These results suggest that the pear farmers were exposed to the pollen grains of Japanese pear and annual bluegrass, and the pollen allergens sensitized them inducing nasal and/or ocular symptoms. © 1982, Japan Society for Occupational Health.

Our work in P. veris suggests that for one population, within?morph incompatibility is nearly total at normal temperatures. The mechanism of incompatibility varies between the morphs. In within?pin pollinations, pollen germination is good, and tubes short and broad, being apparently unable to penetrate stigma papillae for physical reasons. In within?thrum pollinations, pollen germination is poor and the few tubes produced are broad and misshapen. These and the surrounding stigma papillae fluoresce strongly, and similar effects can be produced with pollen?free water extracts.

When compared with actual results, the model showed a large underestimation of dry matter for a growing season with relatively mild stress (1979). This underestimation was also reflected in kernel number and grain yield. For a relatively severe water-stressed year (1980) the model showed a fairly accurate prediction of dry matter accumulation. However, kernel numbers were overestimated, presumably because the model could not account for the effects of atmospheric stress on pollination. As in 1979, the estimation of kernel number for 1980 was reflected in grain yield. The model predictions of phenological events were consistently later than actually observed. However, in most cases this difference was not statistically significant. Because the date of physiological maturity was more accurately predicted than the anthesis date, the length of the grain-filling period was underestimated. This underestimation is reflected in a lower prediction of kernel weights. However, kernel weights do not seem to be as important as kernel number in calculation of yield. By simple parameter adjustment, it was not possible to obtain reasonable prediction of all aspects of growth and development under the conditions in which the model was tested. Thus, it was concluded that major alterations of the relationships in the model would appear to be necessary to obtain reasonable results for Missouri conditions. © 1982.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49049140838

Unlike most other tree species in this forest, which flower and fruit in synchrony at a particular time each year, some individuals of both fig species were producing fruit in all months. Nevertheless, a greater amount of fruiting occurred at the beginning and near the end of the 8-mo wet season than would be expected if the species were fruiting randomly. In both species, the major fruiting peak occurred when most other tree species were not producing ripe fruit. Large trees of both fig species tended to produce fruit crops at shorter intervals than small trees. Average interval between crops was slightly longer than a half year for F. yoponensis and slightly shorter than a full year for F. insipida. Results, combined with life history data, suggest that individuals of these Ficus species are fruiting asynchronously at relatively short intervals, thereby increasing total lifetime fruit production and ultimately maximizing reproductive success. Flexibility in the timing of fruit crops appears to have coevolved with the intricate mutualism between these Ficus species and their obligately species-specific wasp pollinators. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0020363423

The purple phenotype was predominant in the Australian seedlots from the higher altitude, inland provenances of the species range and in the South African population. The provenance from Tallaganda State Forest in New South Wales showed the highest mean frequency (93%) of purple phenotypes. The green phenotype was prevalent in the New Zealand exotic populations, attaining a frequency of 100% in some, and was also predominant in the provenance from Robertson, N.S.W. © 1982 CSIRO.

Topiary segregants may be recognized at the seedling stage, and there is good expression in interspecific hybrids. A genetically diverse diploid population, composed of accessions of 22 species selected for disease resistance and 2n gametes and crossed with sources of the topiary gene, is being developed. Recurrent phenotypic selection for yield and carliness of tuberization will be facilitated by the topiary trait, insect pollination and the self-incompatibility system. Standard varietal evaluation techniques including yield trials, sequential harvests, and tuber quality assessments can be applied to the population to alter gene frequencies or identify suitable parents for crossing to Tuberosum. Selected clones may be maintained in the field without clonal mixture. The population should retain most of the simply inherited disease resistance characteristics present in the original introductions. Adapted germplasm produced by this method should be especially valuable where the number of backcrosses to Tuberosum is to be minimized, as in the improvement of potatoes for quantitative traits such as yield, polygenic disease resistance, and environmental tolerance. Well-adapted clones may contribute a maximum input of genetic diversity through hybridization with Tuberosum haploids and subsequent polyploidization via 2n gametes. © 1982 H.

Therefore, operator species are more likely to be deceived by animal mimics than plant mimics. In addition, the autonomy of plant appendages implies that warning mimicry provides less advantage to plants than to animals because plants suffer less from sampling by naive operators. Therefore, the advantage of warning mimicry is much greater for animals than plants. These reasons may explain why plant mimicry is less common than animal mimicry, based on attraction of rather than avoidance by operator species, and limited to the class of aggressive mimicry.

The following types of abnormalities were observed in the cotyledons; albino (0.37%), yellow (3.56%), pale yellow (4.86%), pale green (7.40%), variegated (2.39%) and morphological (2.04%). Each type was also found in the foliage leaves at about a half the frequency in the cotyledons. The total frequency did not vary so much among the populations, ranging from 18.0 to 34.5%, with the exception of the Togakushi population, which had a low frequency. A significant north-south dine in the frequency was observed in fall type buckwheats. The frequency of abnormalities was also examined in randomly mating populations in farmer?s field and the total frequency was 0.020-0.072% in the cotyledons and 0.016-0.059% in the foliage leaves. The low frequency of homozygotes in randomly mating populations may be due to a large population size, panmixia by insect pollinations, and the virtual absence of inbreeding. Based on the estimated frequency per gamete and the estimated frequency in randomly mating populations, the number of loci affecting chlorophyll-deficiencies and the deleterious allele frequency per locus were estimated. The approximate number of loci was at least 70, probably close to 100, and the allele frequency was around 0,0010.004, implying that the detrimental genes in buckwheat populations are maintained by mutation-seleetion balance. © 1982, The Genetics Society of Japan.

Females and males share an ability to reproduce more efficiently than cosexes under certain conditions. The overwhelming predominance of gynodioecy over androdioecy, and the higher incidence of separate sexes in larger plants and in plants pollinated by generalist insects or by wind are considered to be primarily associated with the advantages of outbreeding for females.

Glasshouse and field tests in the first and second tuber-years showed that most of the offspring of highly blight-resistant dihaploids had high resistance to P. infestans. Two such dihaploids, PDH 182 and PDH 247, crossed with a tetraploid selected for high general combining ability for potato cyst-nematode (PCN) resistance, gave offspring all of which were highly blight resistant. About one third also had high PCN resistance. Detached leaflet tests were used for rapid blight resistance screening of other progenies from dihaploid x 4 x crosses in their seedling year. Differences were found in the effects of 4 x parents on the mean resistances of progenies from blight-resistant dihaploids. The results also showed differences between dihaploids in their effectiveness in transmitting blight resistance to 4 x offspring. This could be due to differences in the mode of unreduced female gamete formation, i.e. first division restitution or second division restitution (SDR). If all the unreduced gametes were produced by SDR, the differences could be due to differences in homozygosity between dihaploids with respect to blight resistance genes. The dihaploid x 4 x crosses gave few offspring per pollination. The few seedlings obtained may be offset by a higher frequency with the required characters. Since fewer seedlings would have to be grown in order to find the required combination of characters, savings could be made in planting and resistance-testing facilities over those required in conventional breeding. The tetraploid hybrids obtained can be used in a second cycle of breeding in three ways simultaneously : by crossing with other tetraploids, by crossing with dihaploids selected for complementary characters and to produce dihaploids with combined resistances. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.

Enzymatic activities of methanol-treated pollen were somewhat decreased, except for acid phosphatase which was enhanced over the control. This increase could be due to a higher hydrolysis rate by the alcohol, and/or to enzyme activation after damage of the lytic organelle membranes. Amylase, cellulase, ribonuclease and particularly acid phosphatase activities were stimulated in irradiated pollen.

Forty?six of the 56 species have small flowers (log length (mm) × log breadth (mm) 1). Thirty?six are hermaphrodite, 12 dioecious and eight dioecious, monoecious or polygamous. Compatibility tests showed that five (possible seven) of the hermaphrodite species are self?compatible, one hermaphrodite species is probably self?incompatible.

There is some interspecific temporal separation of flowering over the year, but a peak of species in flower in the drier to early wet season. Pollination syndromes were also studied. Of the 23 important species, 20 are generalist, two wind?pollinated, one bird?pollinated. For all species, 46 are generalist, six wind?pollinated, one, perhaps two, bird?pollinated, and possibly two moth?pollinated.

Cultivar plants showed a variation in chiasma frequency for the bivalent arms studied which was correlated with the frequency of bound arms per cell, indicating that the estimation for chiasma frequency by means of bound arm frequency has an error that increases with increasing number of bound arms per cell, (ii) Evidence of chiasma terminalization has not been found, (iii) It is suggested that the different rye chromosomes have different chiasma localization patterns, which, in turn, are related with the chiasma frequency. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019847081

In I. purpurea stigmas are generally exserted and there is much genetic variation for anther-stigma distance. Variation in this character has a significant effect on the ease with which selfpollination occurs. In contrast there is no variation for the character in the I. hederacea population, the anthers being invariably held at the same level as the stigma, an arrangement promoting self-pollination. © 1981 Dr W.

The major vegetation zones in the desert northwest and the sub-antarctic southwest and south of Argentina are discernible in the relative frequency of their respective pollen assemblages. Where quantitative comparisons of plant and pollen data are possible, representation factors for the pollen taxa are calculated. In addition to the conventional approach using percentage values, principal component and cluster analysis prove to be excellent and complementary techniques in that they reduce the data set into definite groups of representative taxa, both for plants and pollen. The comparison of these groups and their respective dominance along transects indicate that, for example, in the treeless vegetation zones of the desert northwest of Argentina, the transition zone between the grassland and desert scrub (Puneña) occupies a broader range, regionally, in the pollen data than in the vegetation. An explanation for this phenomenon is that the plant taxa representing this transition zone are predominantly wind pollinated, thus they are overrepresented in the pollen rain. Predominance of wind pollination also explains the relative over-representation of human disturbance zones in the pollen data compared to the vegetation data. It is important to recognize over-representation when changes are interpreted in fossil pollen assemblages which include transition or disturbance type pollen spectra, as these spectra evidently mask the other vegetation types. In the temperate forest region this problem does not occur, inasmuch as even the transition from forest to steppe can be recognized in the pollen assemblages. However, the upper timberline in the temperate region cannot be precisely defined. For several hundred meters above the treeline a species of Nothofagus that is present below the treeline occurs as dwarf shrub, thus maintaining relatively high pollen percentages both above and below the tree-line. Thus, the limit can only be defined with a precision of about two hundred meters, above which increasing percentages of herbaceous pollen taxa indicate the increasing openness of the vegetation in the pollen spectra. © 1981 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344392650

Gabo, were grown in a glasshouse for 4 weeks and then transferred to a controlled environment with 20±1 °C temperature and 16 h photoperiod. They were subjected to water deficit by withholding the water supply during various stages of floral development, including those immediately before meiosis and all stages until just after anthesis.The proportion of apparently normal florets which produced grain was reduced when water deficit occurred during and immediately after meiosis in the generative tissues. The effect of this reduced grain set on total grain yield was partially compensated by an increase in the weight of the remaining grains. Cross-pollination between stressed and well-watered plants showed that grain set was reduced as a direct consequence of the induction of male sterility by water stress, whereas female fertility was unaffected. A large proportion of the anthers on water-stressed plants were small and shrivelled, did not dehisce normally and contained pollen which was devoid of normal cytoplasmic constituents and showed no staining reaction with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. This effect on male fertility was not a result of desiccation of the sporogenous tissue, but an indirect outcome of the decrease in water potential elsewhere in the plant. © 1981 Annals of Botany Company.",Grain set; Male sterility; Pollen; Sporogenesis; Triticum aestivum L.; Water stress; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001205255

A classification of types of cleistogamy is proposed. In this review, a restricted definition of cleistogamy is used to refer to species which show real floral dimorphisms, with divergent developmental pathways leading to CL and CH as well as intermediate floral forms. Reductions in the androecium and corolla are the most common feature of the CL flowers. The structural, developmental, and functional aspects of cleistogamy are reviewed.

These shoots were grown in vitro and one of them (rGV-1) was found to contain the T-DNA specific enzyme lysopine dehydrogenase (LpDH) and to form roots.

However, bumblebees (Bombus spp.) foraging for pollen on flowers of Aquilegia caerulea rarely moved in a straight line among successively visited plants. Most flights from plants visited were either to closely neighboring plants or were longer and involved bypassing near neighbor plants. Bees biased their flights toward plants with relatively large numbers of flowers yet visited only a small fraction of the flowers on each plant. Such foraging tactics might result when the energetic costs of revisiting plants are minor. Alternatively we suggest that bumblebees foraging for pollen may not perceive revisitations and their associated costs because they do not assess pollen returns on a per plant basis. In this case energetic-efficiency arguments predicting the pattern of foraging movements among plants may be inappropriate. A better level of analysis would be where the bees assess net energy returns, perhaps between bouts of pollen-combing and corbiculae-packing. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040271996

Significant increases were detected for percent tuberization, mean yield per hill, mean tuber weight, and average rating for tuber appearance. The earliest improvement in yield was largely the result of improving percentage of tuberization. Later gains came from improving mean tuber weight as well as continued improvement in percentage of tuberization. The largest improvement was observed during the last cycle of selection. Changes in combining ability were studied in twenty test-crosses produced by pollinating four Tuberosum females with bulked pollen from plants within each of five of the six Andigena cycles.

The most advanced hybrids outyielded a comparable group of seven Tuberosum ×Tuberosum progenies with regards to total yield, tuber number, and yield of large tubers. Mean tuber weight was similar in both groups. The overall results suggest the potential of Andigena in the production of inter-group hybrids.

Blockage may occur, a) on the stigma surface through the failure of germination or of pollen tube penetration after germination, b) in the stigma head during the passage of the tube through the specialized transmitting tissue of the head, or c) in the transmitting tract of the style. None of the barriers is complete, and the prohibition of selfing or intramorph crossing depends upon the cumulative screening effect of one following upon the other. In both morphs, the germination of incompatible pollen on the stigma is enhanced in high ambient relative humidity, but many tubes still fail to penetrate the stigma. Those that do are retarded or blocked in their growth in the transmitting tissues of the stigma head and style. Crude extracts from the tissues of the stigma head and style show some differential effect on the growth of pollen tubes in vitro, and dialysates of extracts containing high molecular weight fractions show a consistent differential effect, those from thrum tissues retarding thrum tubes while having a lesser effect on pin tubes, and those from pin tissues retarding pin tubes while having lesser effect on thrum.

In enclosures, the domestic honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and the bumblebee species, Bombus fervidus Fabricius, seemed to lack any ""cue"" to initiate visitation of the flowers. When honey was placed on a few flowers, visitation was stimulated. The honey bee tore and chewed at the anther cone to collect pollen, while B. fervidus probed for nectar which was not present. Shortly afterward, both species ceased visitation and could not be induced to visit further, regardless of the honey stimulus. Neither species was effective as a pollinator. It is concluded that neither species will be useful for large-scale crossing of potato populations. However, another bumblebee species, Bombus impatiens Cresson, is very effective in pollinating potatoes in the field. Manipulating the behavior of such indigenous populations of bumblebees is likely to be the most effective method of exploiting insect pollination in the potato. © 1981 Springer.",Apis; Bombus; bumblebees; honeybees; Potato; Solanum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001423968

The functional response of individual pollinators to the density of plants is considered and this makes possible the existence of two equilibrium points for the association. The stability analysis is framed in terms of two parameters of the model: the nectar rewards which the plant offers the pollinator and the specificity of the pollinator to the plant. The main results are: (a) there is an optimum level of nectar production which maximises the plant birth rate; (b) increasing nectar production and/or decreasing pollinator specificity produce more stable associations; (c) for highly specific pollinators a conflict arises between stability of association and optimality in nectar production. © 1981.,,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019404040

It was found that S. nicolai produced large quantities of low quality nectar (1.74 j/?l); that nectar production was highest during the day-time; and that the flowers displayed several characteristics attractive to bird-visitors. The flowers were large, conspicuous and provided the birds with a perch, facilitating easy access to the nectar. Flowers were visited by four species of sunbirds: Olive Sunbird Nectarinia olivacea, Grey Sunbird N. veroxii, Black Sunbird N. amethystina, and Collared Sunbird Anthreptes collaris. Sunbirds visited the flowers throughout the year, and apparently cued into changes in the flower angle as an indication of nectar flow rates. Sunbirds perched on the flowers in a manner which effected pollination, the pollen being transferred to the stigma via the birds' feet. Besides the sunbirds, there were other visitors (bushbabies, monkeys and insects) to the flowers, but they did not visit the flowers frequently nor did they appear to be significant pollinators. The high seed set of S. nicolai in the study area attests to the efficacy of the sunbirds as pollinators. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001248143

In Coleotrype natalensis, Cyanotis species and Siderasis fuscata a fringe of papillae is present around the neck of the open stylar canal whereas in all other species the number and size of papillae are large enough to cover the opening.

The female moths oviposit in the ovaries of the yucca flowers and actively pollinate the same flowers with pollen which they have collected previously. The selective pressures imposed on the moths by 1) the plant's need for pollen transfer via an insect pollinating agent, 2) its partial self-incompatibility, and 3) its ability to regulate seed set by aborting excess fruits, have molded the pollinator's behavior in such a way that its offspring have the greatest possible chance of surviving through the early larval stages. The evolutionary responses of the pollinator include the following: 1) the female moths consistently fly to a different plant after collecting pollen, thus insuring cross-fertilization of the flowers, 2) they always pollinate after depositing the first egg in a flower, but not necessarily after subsequent ovipositions, and 3) females emerging near the end of the flowering season frequently oviposit in developing seed pods, as opposed to open flowers which are more likely to be aborted by the plants. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002272885

The two finch species consume nectar and pollen, pollinate the obligatorily out-crossing flowers, consume the aril around the seeds, crack the seeds and occasionally disperse them. (2) In the dry season the two finch species open Opuntia flower buds, thereby gaining early access to pollen. But in the process, and at partially open flowers, they snip the style and destroy the stigmas in up to 78% of the flowers. (3) Stigma snipping prevents fertilization of the ovules and the development of seeds which are an important food item later in the year when food supply is likely to limit finch population sizes. Stigma snipping almost ceases in the main part of the wet season, corresponding with an increase in the density of Opuntia flowers and other food types, and a decrease in the proportion of feeding time spent on Opuntia flowers. Stigma snipping neither increased the time flowers remained open nor influenced nectar flow or the number and duration of subsequent visits to flowers by potential pollinators. This last result precludes the possibility that snipping is a means of marking the flower to signal a previous visit to the flower and pollen removal. (4) We conclude that the two finch species snip stigmas to facilitate removal of pollen from the central incurving stamens which are masked by the stigma in a closed or partially open flower. The finches gain a short-term benefit from the removal of stigmas in easy access to pollen and possibly nectar. They potentially suffer in the long term through diminished dry season food supply (seeds), particularly in drought years but we were unable to detect any fitness decrement suffered by the individual finches which do the snipping. (5) An important implication of these results and interpretations is that a behavioral trait which confers a short-term benefit to the individual may increase the chances of the population going extinct. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001516767

This prediction was tested using two populations of Polemonium foliosissimum and their primary pollinators Bombus flavifrons and B. bifarius. The results of these tests were equivocal. Bees did not perform exactly as the marginal value theorem predicted they should to maximize their rate of net energy intake. Instead of visiting more flowers per plant as movement costs increased bees were observed to alter their behavior in other ways in an attempt to maximize their rate of net energy intake. They were demonstrated to be flying randomly with respect to direction, flying short flight distances relative to the plant spacing distances encountered, flying predominately between nearest neighbor plants, and to be visiting flowers of other plant species while enroute from one P. foliosissimum flower to another P. foliosissimum flower. Such behavioral flexibility strongly implies that optimal foraging models which predict a shift in any particular behavior in response to environmental conditions are too simplistic to accurately predict foraging behavior. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250246091

Data on reproductive expenditure, fruit abortion and fruit maturation were obtained for 108 flowering individuals at two sites. The proportion of flowers maturing fruits was less than 10% at both sites. Inflorescences produced an average of 2,045±111 and 1,743±77 flowers at the two sites, initiated an average of 439±48 and 304±21 fruits, and matured an average of 194±16 and 162±10 fruits, respectively. Overall, 51% of the fruits which initiated development were aborted and abscized in an early stage of development. The hypothesis that fruit abortion serves to regulate seed yeild, matching fruit production to the available resources, yields three predictions which are borne out by our findings: (1) the proportion of initiated fruits which abort is an increasing function of the number of fruits initiated, (2) the number of fruits matured is an increasing function of estimates of the amount of resources available to support fruits, and (3) on any inflorescence, fruits initiated early have a lower probability of aborting than fruits initiated late. These results suggest that low fruit set in Yucca whipplei is caused by shortage of resources to support developing fruits, rather than by a shortage of pollinators. Possible explanations of the adaptive significance of regulating maternal investment via fruit abortion are mentioned, but further experimentation is required before any conclusions can be drawn. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001764594

To determine the factors responsible for low fruit set, the relation between pollinator availability, the amount of resources spent on reproduction (as indicated by inflorescence size), and the number of fruits matured was studied during 1978 and 1979 at 18 locations in chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and desert scrub communities of southern California. The following results support the conclusion that pollinators do not usually limit fruit production in Yucca whipplei. Rather, fruit production is limited by the amount of resources available to support developing fruits. (1) Fruit production is positively correlated with inflorescence size both within and between populations. The average size of inflorescence for a population is an excellent predictor of mean fruit production. Furthermore, 54% of the total variance in fruit production of individual plants can be explained by inflorescence size. (2) In contrast, although fruit production within most populations is positively correlated with an index of the number of pollinator visits to an inflorescence, the relative abundance of pollinators for a population is a poor predictor of mean fruit production, and only 9% of the total variance in fruit production can be explained by the visitation index. Furthermore, at four sites studied for two years, there was little change in average inflorescence size or fruit production from 1978 to 1979, despite large differences in relative abundance of pollinators at each of the sites. (3) Based on geographic proximity, and physiographic and vegetational similarities, study sites were grouped into regional clusters. Both inflorescence size and fruit production varied considerably between regions. Of the total variation in fruit production, 27% can be attributed to differences between regions. Most of this variation is the result of regional differences in inflorescence size, which in turn influence fruit production. Why does Yucca whipplei produce such large inflorescences if so few fruits can be supported? Two relevant hypotheses are discussed: (1) the floral display is the result of selection for pollen dissemination at the expense of fruit set; and (2) the floral display is the result of selection for a bet-hedging strategy either to increase the probability of adequate pollination when pollinators are unusually rare, or to allow individuals to support more fruits when resources are unusually abundant. © 1981 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000898347

Most of the inhibition or retardation of pollen tubes occurred between the style base and top of the embryo sac, expecially with the low crossable genotypes where both Kr-genes are present. The results also indicate that Kr1 is a greater inhibitor than Kr2. Seed set is also highly correlated with the number or proportion of micropyles having pollen tubes.

We studied the kinetic properties and molecular weights of a large number of genetically defined and highly purified PGIs in C. xantiana, a species with the duplication, as a means of examining the biochemical consequences of the evolution of a new gene locus. This species is primarily outcrossing, but also includes several previously described predominantly self-pollinating populations. Both cytoplasmic PGI loci in the outcrossing populations are polymorphic and their enzyme products are readily separated by electrophoresis. The PGIs from the outcrossing populations were generally closely similar in molecular weight, pH optimum, heat sensitivity, energy of activation, and apparent Km (fructose-6-phosphate). The PGI loci in the selfing populations are monomorphic and specify enzymes having identical electrophoretic mobilities to those coded by the most frequent alleles of the outcrosser. The PGI isozymes in the selfers differed fivefold in Km, suggesting that they have a very different catalytic effectiveness. The high Km of the PGI-3A? isozyme (1.1 mm) was anomalous among the examined and would likely be disadvantageous in a species which lacked other more normally functioning PGIs. But in the cytoplasm of the selfing plants, it is present with other PGIs that have low Km values. The PGI-3A? enzyme is a good candidate for a gene product coded by a ""forbidden"" mutation that could not have been established in the absence of the duplication. The rationale for this suggestion is described and it is also pointed out that the divergence of duplicated genes is influenced by many factors such as the breeding system and other population factors as well as the effect of particular mutations. © 1981 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Clarkia xantiana; gene duplication; isozymes; phosphoglucose isomerase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019482980

Wind tunnel analyses of scale models showing the various stages in the consolidation of these preintegumentary lobes indicated that turbulent flow increases and becomes localized around the nucellar apex (salpinx) with the syngenesis and length reduction of those lobes.

Gardn., a small tree endemic in south-western Australia, is unusual in the genus in being predominantly if not exclusively pollinated by birds. Many individual honeyeaters but no insects were recorded feeding on its nectar during the 1980 flowering season. The large pendulous flowers deny entry to most large insect visitors because the stamens form an impenetrable dome over the floral cup. Access to nectar is only possible through a narrow opening lined with anthers in the centre of the staminal dome. Honeyeaters visited few flowers per tree (average 1-5) and about 18% of the movements of individual birds from one flower to another were between flowers on different trees. Most intertree movements were between trees farther apart than nearest-neighbours. Hence a high rate of outcross pollination is inferred. Analysis of the mating system of E. stoatei using allozyme seed markers in one population indicated an average level of outcrossing of 82%, among the highest so far recorded for eucalypts. The study therefore supports the hypothesis that bird pollinators may effect high levels of outcrossing, although other factors such as protandry and incompatibility probably are also involved. Adaptations favouring exclusive bird pollination in E. stoatei may have evolved to promote outcrossing and heterozygosity in the face of inbreeding depression imposed by a dissected population structure. and in response to the relatively low number of seeds per plant produced by the species. © 1981 CSIRO.

The mentor pollen was applied in a mixture (1:1) with the incompatible/incongruous pollen and the pioneer pollen was applied one day in advance of the other pollination. Two trials in 1976 with dead methanol-treated mentor pollen on apple were moderately successful, probably because of the hot spring weather. In the apple and pear trials of 1979 neither the methanol-treated nor the viable irradiated (100 krad) mentor or pioneer pollen significantly improved the seed set by self pollen or that after intercrossing. Competition and early embryo abortion after selfing or intercrossing probably contributed to the lack of success of these methods. The viable irradiated pollen induced a rather high 'parthenocarpic' fruit set, whether applied on its own or mixed with or in advance of the incompatible pollen; the inviable methanol-treated pollen had no such stimulating influence. © 1981 Veenman B.V.",apple; fruit set; incompatibility; incongruity; Malus; mentor pollen; pear; pioneer pollen; Pyrus; seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0013117942

Br. and anthophilous insects were observed on Öland and in Uppland, Sweden, during 19741980. The pollen vectors were mainly ichneumons (Hymenoptera Parasitica, Ichneumonidae), sawflies (Hymenoptera Symphyta) and beetles (Coleoptera). These three groups transported on Oland 56, 28 and 10% and in Uppland 28, 54 and 15% of the pollinia. The most common visitors were Diptera. In the Ichneumonidae, males were on average over three times as frequent as females and carried 81% of the pollinia. Various data indicated anthecological specialization to about 812 mm long, relatively strong insects, which show abundance and diversity in the biotopes with L. ovata. They have mediumsized almost hairless heads with short and rather small mouthparts. Perhaps optimal interaction takes place with ichneumon males. Since floral adaptation to the legitimate group obviously includes generalized chemical attractants and complete accessibility of nectar, the spectrum of visitors reaches that of an umbelliferous plant. The touchsensitive rostellum has probably induced evolution of the long nectariferous furrow on the labellum surface. The floral fragrance is essentially a terpeneblend.

Plants of typical A. pavia have red, tubular flowers with exserted stamens and are effectively pollinated by ruby-throated hummingbirds. Plants of var. flavescens have yellow, campanulate flowers with included stamens that can be pollinated effectively by large bees. These ethological reproductive isolating mechanisms are further augmented by a difference in flowering time between the two sets of populations and by geographical restriction of the yellow-flowered plants to localities on the Edwards Plateau. The yellow and red-flowered plants constitute two morphologically distinct groups, despite evidence of limited introgression in counties along the Balcones Escarpment.

The letter is caused by a diminished disappearance of albumins in mutant endosperms during the final phase of development as compared to normal endowperms. Albumins from the opaque?2 endosperms appeared on gel electrophoresis as a similar but heterogenous polypeptide population comparable to that of the normal endosperms except that in al opaque?2 forms a 70?kDa polypeptide was increased. Similarly, one to three specific globulin polypeptides (47 kDa, 52 kDa and 58 kDa) were, depending on the genotype, increased in the mutant lines. The accumulation of albumins, globulins and zeins, studied in developing W 64A opaque?2 mutant and corresponding normal maize kernels from 10 days after pollination until maturity, demonstrated two?phasic accumulation patterns for all proteins in the mutant, the first phase extending to about 30 days post pollination and the second one form there on until maturity. The transition time?point from first to second phase was characterized in mutant endosperm by a sudden reduction in accumulating albumins (also seen in normal endosperm), by an enhanced accumulation of globulins and the cessation of further accumulation of zein. Preferential accumulation of certain globulins has been found in the mutant during the second phase of globulin formation. The increased accumulation of globulins in the opaque?2 mutant endosperm is considered a response to the arrest in zein synthesis. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

Nine pollen types with a number of subtypes are recognized. These are arranged into two main groups. The first comprises the macromorphologically anomalous genera Calopogonium, Herpyza and Pachyrhizus which, although united by some pollen characters, are distinct both from each other and from the rest of the subtribe. The second group, consisting of the remaining genera which can to some extent be distinguished from each other by their pollen morphology, nevertheless appear to make up both macromorphologically and palynologically a more natural Diocleinae. The six pollen types in the second group are further divided into two slightly overlapping subgroups. Luzonia and Macropsychanthus are palynologically somewhat distinct but, together with Dioclea and Canavalia, have generally rather large, oblate pollen grains with a complete or perforate tectum, in contrast with the pollen of the genera Camptosema, Collaea, Cratylia and much of Galactia which is smaller, spheroidal with a reticulate tectum. Dioclea has some species with isopolar pollen and others with heteropolar pollen grains and this more or less correlates with subgeneric divisions within the genus. Galactia from the Caribbean area has similar but much smaller pollen. The taxonomic significance of this parallel between the pollen morphology of Dioclea and Caribbean Galactia is unclear. The pollen of Canavalia appears to show no significant variation. A possible correlation between the pollen subgroups with ecological habitat and pollinators is discussed. © 1981.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011476931

However, little or no information is available regarding the effects of radiation on kernel abortion in different genetic backgrounds within a species or the transmission of different alleles at the same locus. To study these aspects, four populations which had the same female parent and were heterozygous at one of four endosperm mutant loci (waxy, sugary-1, shrunken-2, opaque-2) were used. Fresh, mature pollen grains from each of these heterozygous populations (Wxwx, Su1su1, Sh2sh2, O2o2) were exposed to seven levels of ultraviolet radiation (254 nm) from 0 to 8.16 × 105 erg/cm2 at 1.36 × 105 erg/cm2 intervals. After exposure, the pollen grains were used to pollinate their source. On each of the resulting ears, the frequency of the partially-aborted (embryo and/or endosperm visibly defective) kernels in the total number of normal (both embryo and endosperm fully-developed in size and appearance) and partially-aborted kernels was determined. The frequency of recessive kernels in the total number of normal kernels was also obtained for each heterozygote. For both the partially-aborted and recessive frequencies, the F values for the main effects, heterozygote and exposure, and their interaction were significant at the 1% level. Over all heterozygotes, the partially-aborted frequency ranged from 0.020 at 0 level to 0.581 at 6.80 × 105 erg/cm2 with a non-significant decrease to 0.577 at 8.16 × 105 erg/cm2. The major increases occurred at the lower and intermediate levels. With increasing exposure, O2o2 showed the largest increase (from 0.022 at 0 level to 0.774 at 8.16 × 105 erg/cm2) in partially-aborted frequency while Su1su1 exhibited the smallest (from 0.010 at 0 level to 0.412 at 8.16 × 105 erg/cm2). Estimates of dominant lethality followed a positive linear pattern with smaller differences present between heterozygotes. Over all heterozygotes, the recessive frequency ranged from 0.237 at 0 level to 0.283 at 6.80 × 105 erg/cm2 with a non-significant decrease to 0.267 at 8.16 × 105 erg/cm2. With increasing exposure, O2o2 showed the greatest increase in the recessive frequency ranging from 0.241 at 0 level to 0.343 at 5.44 × 105 erg/cm2 with a non-significant decrease found above this level. Su1su1 and Sh2sh2 expressed a similar but less pronounced increase in the recessive frequency with increasing exposure while the response of Wxwx was quite erratic. The results indicated that increasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation increased: (1) Partial abortion with the amount dependent on the genetic background of the pollen source; and (2) The transmission of the recessive allele with the amount dependent on the locus. © 1981.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009880196

Thus, when the first rains begin in autumn, the summer drought is first broken in the upper soil horizons, and annuals and shallow-rooted perennial herbs and subshrubs begin their seasonal growth cycle. Growth of deeper-rooted evergreens generally begins in spring. Stem growth is often deferred until spring when the danger of frost damage is reduced. The time schedule of nutrient uptake is partly linked to the availability of nutrients as well as to those periods favourable for plant growth. Flowering occurs over a greater period than does stem growth; movement out of phase from general growth can take place using stored reserves so as to take advantage of pollinator availability. A certain similarity in phenological pattern is evident between the mediterranean shrublands of California, Chile and the Mediterranean Basin, but in Australia and the Cape region of S Africa there is summer as well as spring growth by shrubs. Phenological comparisons between California and Chile show a protracted growth season in Chile, probably as a result of the presence of more species with non-overlapping phenological activities (a trend also seen in coastal compared to interior California).

Discusses nectar-feeding birds (not only morphological, but ecological and behavioral specializations to flowers as a food source). Different bird groups vary widely in their degrees of specialization for flower-feeding; bird-flower coevolution has followed very different courses, and has led to widely divergent ecological systems in different geographical areas. The hummingbirds are the most specialized avian nectarivores, although they are approached in this regard by some members of certain passerine groups, notably among the sunbirds. Several groups of passerine nectarivores also occur with the hummingbirds in many New World areas. Patterns of ornithophily and nectarivory are examined in detail for this area, concentrating on Southern Central America, especially Costa Rica. The altitudinal and geographical distributions of the two main groups of hummingbirds, the hermits and nonhermits, differ, as are the taxonomic and ecological affinities of their primary foodplants. Hermits are most numerous in wet lowlands and the adjacent foothills, and are primarily associated with large monocotyledonous herbs, notably Heliconia. Nonhermits reach their greatest taxonomic and ecological diversity in the lower middle elevations, and are the only group present at high elevations; they seem to have coevolved with the flowers of a variety of dicot families, and the bromeliads among the monocots.

Between 1964 and 1979 significant numbers of fertile seeds were recorded only after the exceptionally warm summer of 1976. In contrast, large or moderate crops of fertile seed were produced at sites in central and southern England in at least 8 of these years. Comparative studies of pollination, fertilization and seed development at sites in north?west England, central England and northern France show relatively small differences in the proportions of flowers which are pollinated but significant differences in the rates of extension of pollen?tubes. In samples collected in 1977 from north?west England germinated pollen was present on most receptive stigmas but many pollen?tubes extended only a short distance down the style and the few which reached the base appeared to be arrested in the ovary wall. In French samples pollen had germinated on all receptive stigmas and numerous pollen?tubes had reached the ovary within 2 days of pollination. These differences cannot be attributed to variation in the incidence of self?pollination, as at least some trees of T. cordata in northern populations are almost certainly self?fertile. The differences are correlated with temperatures at the time when the samples were collected. When pollen?tubes are growing in sucrose solutions, their rate of extension shows a large response to temperature over the same range (15 to 25°C). Analysis of records shows that temperatures in north?west England at the time of flowering are frequently too low to permit fertilization. This is confirmed by studies of the development of ovules. Although a high proportion of ovules in T. cordata lack embryo sacs, normally at least one is functional in each ovary. In over 90% of fruit formed in north?west England, embryos are contained in none of the 10 ovules.

These different patterns may largely arise in response to reproductive competition resulting from sexual selection. But the efficacy of sexual selection in zoophilous species is mainly determined by pollinator behavior. The evolution of a particular sexual system must therefore be influenced by the dynamics of the pollination system. The role of pollinators in the evolution of sexual systems is examined by considering several types of interactions between flowers and pollinators. The role of cost-sharing between paternal and maternal function in pollinator attraction is stressed in the evolution of hermaphroditism. Andromonoecism is considered in terms of loss of pistils in that part of the flower crop which is produced merely to attract pollinators and/or to fulfill male function. In the evolution of andromonoecism, the role of stamens of hermaphroditic flower in the functional integrity of the pollination system is evaluated. The evolution of protogyny is considered in relation to long inhabitation of pollinators in flowers and inflorescences. The evolution of dioecism is examined in relation to the ability of pollinators to respond to minor changes in floral resources thereby altering the patterns of pollen donation and pollen receipt. The importance of stamens in hermaphroditic plants in attracting pollen collecting bees is emphasized in the maintenance of androdioecism. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019747985

Improvement work was started in 1962 and progress has been achieved through mass selection with some progeny testing in seedling seed orchards and, more recently, through provenance trials. The latter show that in some cases the local breeding material is inferior to new imports. A country-wide search for good phenotypes is in being and the urgency of the breeding work is likely to grow as the indigenous woodlands come increasingly under pressure from an expanding population.

Most families proved to be relatively homogeneous in stigma type, whilst others were strikingly diverse. Among the latter were certain supposedly primitive families such as the Liliaceae, a fact that may have some phylogenetical significance. Sometimes where a family proved to be homogeneous in respect to the more general characters of the stigma, fuller investigation revealed great variation in detail. An example is given by the Boraginaceae, a family in which stigma characters are of potential taxonomic importance. The stigma papillae in this family are often capitate, with heavily cutinised heads, and pollen has to be inserted forcibly between the papillae. There is a strong correlation between pollen size and stigmapapilla size, so that certain types of cross pollination are impossible. These specialisations can thus play a part as isolating mechanisms. The form of the stigma papillae is probably also important in genera of the Boraginaceae adapted to arid conditions, since the contiguous cutinised caps overarch the actual receptive surfaces and so. presumably, offer protection from desiccation. In both monocotyledons and dicotyledons, clear relationships exist between stigma type and physiology, and notably with the type of selfincompatibility system. It is already apparent that stigma characters can have predictive value in the investigation of breeding systems.

Polleniferous figs of F. carica produce numerous male flowers with plenty of pollen (multistaminate type). Mature anthers contain a normal fibrous layer and open spontaneously. On the other hand, figs of F. sycomorus produce a comparatively small number of male flowers, their anthers have a degenerated endothecium and do not dehisce normally. In pollination (pollen loading and unloading) the great differences occurring in the organization of the androecium of F. carica and F. sycomorus may be seen to be associated with different behaviour patterns of their specific pollen vectors, the agaonid wasps Blastophaga psenes and Ceratosolen arabicus, respectively. While the pollinators of F. carica become passively coated with pollen on their exit from the native fig (topocentric pollination), the pollen vectors of F. sycomorus help in opening of the anthers and load the pollen purposively, by direct lifting of the pollen from the anthers on to special pockets on the body of the insect (ethodynamic pollination).

Within each resistant population, all individuals have the same pattern of esterase and populations collected in the same area have the same zymogram. However, populations from different areas have distinct zymograms. These data suggest that the resistant populations originated in the region where they now occur, and that there is a high rate of self-pollination in each resistant population. After treating a susceptible population with a low dose of atrazine, about 1% of plants survived and these have a high frequency of the esterase zymogram typical of resistant individuals.

O. Kuntze in a former river bed of the Waal and in two concrete tanks situated in the grounds of the Catholic University of Nijmegen (The Netherlands). The structure of the flowering stem and the flowering pattern have been described. The plant grows in such a way that a continuous field of flowers is maintained over a long period of the season. In the development from flower bud to mature fruit, eight stages are distinguished. The structure of the flower is described. The flowers of Nymphoides peltata fall within category 'B' of the system of H. Müller who divided the entomophilous flowers in seven categories, as they are not strongly specialized to cater for the visiting of only one insect group, while the nectar is totally hidden. The u.v. pattern can be considered a specialized feature of the N. peltata flower within the genus Nymphoides, being the same as in N. geminata (R. Br.) O. Kuntze (also a yellow flowering species), as a primitive feature the heterostytyl combined with a weak incompatibility system. Nymphoides peltata is a day-flowering species, the flowers withering within one day. Features of the flower which attract anthophilois insects are: a high flower-frequency and long flowering period within the season; the yellow coloured corolla with a characteristic u.v. pattern and an average diameter of 3.54 cm; a height, on average, 3.27 cm above the water surface; and a weak, sweet odour. The existence of higher temperatures round the flower than exist in the surrounding area perhapps plays no role as an attractive features, as the difference is small. The flowers have to offer nectar (sheltered by staminodes of 0.5-0.6 cm in height, pollen and perhaps some stigmmatic exudate. Predators are attracted by the insects present. The list of flower-visiting creatures contains 44 species, of which 43 are species of Hexapoda and 1 is a species of Aranea. The possible reasons for flower-visiting of the insects and their possible role in pollination are discussed. With respect to pollination, species of Apidae, Syrphidae and Ephydridae seem to be most important. Species of Apidae and some species of Syrphidae can reachh the nectar by using their long tongues (longer than 5-6 mm). Most species of Syrphids and all Ephydrid species use pollen and liquid substances, but their tongues are too short to reach the nectar, which contains fructose and glucose in equal amounts. Apidae and Syrphidae fly from flower to flower while the Ephydridae show an irregular pattern of flower visiting; they are very important as they are present in large numbers. In contrast to the Apidae and Syrphidae, the Ephydridae also occur very commonly on the floating leaves of Nymphoides peltata. Of the 44 species mentioned, 30 species were seen only on the flowers while 14 species were also commonly found on the floating leaves. The first category is attracted most strongly by the characteristics features of the flower, while the second category is more strongly attracted to the nymphaeid system. Each flower visitor can cause pollination, and in the case of short-styled flowers also self-pollination, by which small capsules are produced with a low number of seeds (generally below 10-15). The release of developed seeds occurs 32-60 days after the day of anthesis of the flowers. Both in the field and the concrete tanks where both floral forms occur, distinct differences in the fruit and seed production were observed. The number of fruits and the number of developed seeds per m2 was much higher in the concrete tanks due to the development of much more flowers than in the Oude Waal, but the average number of seeds per fruit was here much lower and the percentage of fruits with a number of seeds below 15, was higher which indicates that the flowers in the small isolated concrete tanks were not so efficiently pollinated as in the field, possibly because some important Ephydrid species such as Notiphila brunnipes R.-D. were not present in the concrete tanks. The seeds of Nymphoides peltata produced in the Oude Waal numbered more than 3000 per m2, which initially floating on the water surface, and then become dispersed over the water by wind, and by water birds. When the frost period begins, nearly all seeds have sunk to the river bottom. © 1981.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345370718

Patients were selected on the basis of an elevated IgE serum antibody level, a positive intradermal skin test, and a positive intranasal challenge to SRW antigen. SRW-treated patients sprayed SRW solutions intranasally six times a day for 12 wk preseasonally. Placebo-treated patients used nebulized solutions containing buffer or histamine that were interchanged randomly throughout this period. The SRW-treated group reported more preseasonal symptoms than the placebo-treated group (p < 0.003); however, during the SRW pollination season, the SRW-treated group reported significantly less sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, red/itchy eyes, itchy nose/throat, and cough/wheeze. Supplemental antihistamine usage was similar in both groups. The treatment did not affect serum IgE antibody levels to crude SRW, AgE, Ra3, or Ra5 in either group at any time during the study. No significant production of IgG antibody to SRW was seen in either group. One SRW-treated patient developed acute sinusitis after 2 wk of treatment; otherwise no side effects other than symptoms of hay fever were noted. Although intranasal SRW immunotherapy may offer an effective and less costly alternative to parenteral immunotherapy, reduction in hay fever symptoms during the pollination season was achieved at the expense of provoking these symptoms during the preceding weeks. © 1981.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019470227

The style is solid in the first two and hollow in the latter two taxa. In all the taxa, stigma-surface esterase could be detected in a thin surface layer (pellicle) from a very early stage of pistil development, irrespective of the presence or absence of the exudate. However, the taxa showed variation in stigma receptivity. In Petunia and Nicotiana, stigmas from pistils of all the stages supported pollen germination and tube growth. In Amaryllis and Crinum, stigmas of only the mature pistils, when the exudate is present on the stigma, supported normal pollen germination and tube growth. It is inferred that in taxa characterized by a wet stigma and solid style, the factors required for pollen germination are present from an early stage of pistil development and the exudate per se is not involved in pollen germination. In taxa characterized by a wet stigma and hollow style, however, the pellicle does not carry the factors required for pollen germination and tube growth; they appear to be present in the exudate. © 1981 Annals of Botany Company.",Amaryllis vittata Ait.; Crinum defixum; Esterase activity; Ker-Gawl; Nicotiana tabacum L.; Petunia hybrida Vilm; Pollen germination; Pollination; Stigma receptivity; Stigma-surface esterase; Stigmatic exudate; Tobacco,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002624946

Of the winter-flowering species B. menziesii, in addition to inhabiting a slightly more elevated, drier habitat in the reserve, showed pollen-style incompatibility with both B. littoralis and B. telmatiaea. B. littoralis and B. telmatiaea appear to be potentially hybridized as they share the same lowland habitat, flowering period, and a few common pollinators, and artificial interspecific pollen germination was achieved. It is suggested, however, that these two species may be adapted morphologically and physiologically to the attraction of different animal pollinators although it is more likely that the Banksia species maintain genetic identity through behavioural constancy of individuals of those animal species. © 1981 CSIRO.

Five s alleles have been found in two small samples of a cultivated variety; these alleles show dominance relationships typical of the sporophytic system. A self-compatible allele sc has been found, which is recessive to two alleles in both pollen and style, and dominant in the pollen but recessive in the style to the a allele lowest in the dominance series. Pollen dominance with a lower allele of the series confers a high selective value to s, under the pressure of self-pollination.

Peanut breeding, like all other plant breeding efforts, is based upon confidence that application of the Darwinian theory of selection alters the hereditary constitution of the plant. In a self-pollinated crop such as the peanut, it is advantageous to insert genetic sequences of known and specific desired effect into the superior cultivars one already has, thus maintaining or enhancing the superiority already gained through the transformation of wild ancestors into cultivated plants. It has been demonstrated that there exist environments in which ordinary land races of peanuts are equal in productivity to the best products of the modern plant breeder. Peanut improvement programs have placed major emphasis on the development of cultivars with high yields, high oil content, good flavor, and characteristics desired by the processor. Peanut yields in the United States have more than doubled during the past years. Breeders have contributed from one-quarter to one-third of this increase through the development of high-yielding cultivars. The progress from breeding has been hampered by several factors, including the late initiation of peanut breeding programs, the regional importance of the crop in the United States, and the lack of financial resources. © 1981, Academic Press, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006037164

Many species, including the Australian sea nymph, Amphibolis antarctica, have filiform pollen grains. These grains have no exine1-4 - the resistant pollen wall layer characteristic of terrestrial plants - and each may be up to 5 mm in length. The pollen has a similar density to seawater so that it remains suspended or floats after release from the anther. The stigma of the sea nymph and related seagrasses is a simple branched structure which protrudes between the leaves when receptive and has a surface secretion with cytochemically detectable enzymatic activity1-3,5. This stigma coating is not dispersed in seawater. However, submarine pollen-stigma interactions have never been observed in any species of seagrass. We demonstrate here that pollination in the sea nymph has several unusual features when compared with the events in terrestrial flowering plants. These features include the waterproof nature of the adhesive binding the pollen to the stigma surface, the unique mechanism for pollen germination in the inaperturate filiform grains, and the mode of pollen germination in the inaperturate filiform grains, and the mode of pollen tube penetration into the stigma. Taken together these characteristics suggest a considerably more refined level of adaptation to the marine environment than hitherto supposed. © 1980 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004717499

Spatial restriction of gene flow can lead to non-random mating and to subdivision of a population into genetic neighbourhoods. On the other hand, extensive gene flow over large geographical areas can overshadow the influence of selection, leading to genetic similarity among populations and increased uniformity within a species. The extent and magnitude of actual gene flow are thus relevant to a broad range of disciplines. While the central role of gene flow is widely recognised, actual measurements of gene flow in either plants or animals are few. In plants gene flow can occur via seed or pollen dispersal. Levels of gene flow due to pollen dispersal have usually been inferred, either by marking pollen with a chemical or radioactive label for wind pollinated species or by determining the distribution of pollinator foraging flight distances for insect-pollinated species. Measurements of gene flow via pollen movement in plants have been limited to studies of a few agricultural species, where the minimum separation distance required to isolate stocks genetically was of interest1,2. Here I report the measurement of the pollen component of gene flow in the insect-pollinated species, Lupinus texensis, compare the actual gene flow distribution with the distribution inferred from pollinator flight movements, and finally, determine the genetic neighbourhood size of this species from the pollen and seed dispersal distributions. Actual gene flow via pollen is found to be greater than would be inferred from pollinator movement alone. Gene flow and neighbourhood size are nevertheless very restricted. © 1980 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018823907

Control fruitlets had a small embryo (4-14 cells) and numerous endosperm cells by seven days after pollination. Cotyledon development had commenced by 21 days and a root/shoot axis was present at 28 days.Over 90 per cent of the fruitlets which abscissed during the first week after the end of flowering were unfertilized and 18 per cent were abnormal. By the fourth week after the end of flowering all abscissed fruitlets were fertilized and none abnormal. Abnormalities included ovaries with more than one embryosac or ovule, with an immature embryo-sac, with an ovule in an abnormal position or with a deficiency in ovule structure. In a few fertilized abscissed fruitlets either the embryo or endosperm had ceased development first. In the majority of cases embryo and endosperm were anatomically normal. The majority of fertilized abscissed fruitlets had reached a stage corresponding to 14 days after pollination of the control tree. Degeneration was often observed in both unfertilized and fertilized abscissed fruitlets. It is suggested that this degeneration occurred in the period between the cessation of development and abscission of the fruit. This period was approximately one week.The proportion of abnormal ovaries was too low to significantly affect yields, and sufficient flowers had been fertilized to give an adequate crop. No anatomical reason for the high rate of fruitlet abscission was observed. © 1980 Annals of Botany Company.",Abscission; Avocado; Embryo; Embryo-sac; Endosperm; Persea americana Mill,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001708411

This research was undertaken to measure the changes in adaptation and earliness that have taken place in the process of selection. Field experiments with different harvest dates and a controlled daylength experiment in the greenhouse in Ithaca showed: 1) an increase in percent tuberization, tuber weight and size, and harvest index; 2) no change in total fresh weight (haulm + tuber); and 3) a decrease in fresh weight of haulm. Greatest differences among cycles of selection were observed at the early harvest date. Tuberization on cuttings was well correlated with other measures of maturity. Cycles three and four, which were started from open-pollinated seed, tended to ""revert"" to the form of the original population in terms of late maturity (or low tuberization and yield at the early harvest date) and low harvest index. These results are interpreted as a gain in photoperiod adaptation and earliness with possible effects of mating system and selection pressure on the rate of progress. © 1980 Springer.",andigena; neotuberosum; Photoperiod response; selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008304632

Crosses involving the addition of mentor pollen produced fewer seeds and hybrids than crosses involving normal pollination. Lower seed set with mentor pollen was deduced to result from the use of less viable pollen, approximately half the pollen having been killed by alcohol. Pollinations at the diploid level resulted in more hybrids than at the tetraploid level, perhaps because genes for male sterility produced higher female sterility in the tetraploids. The self-compatible stock produced more seeds, mostly selfs, than the self-incompatible stock, but produced more hybrids only in one cross, T. pratense L. × T. diffusumEhrh. The use of male-sterile female parents reduced selfing but produced fewer hybrids than male-fertile female parents.

Merrill, was studied using cultivar 'Clark', isoline E 1t, which has relatively long racemes for convenient identification and observation of individual flowers. On each raceme studied, pod set was greatest at the proximal (basal) positions, whereas shedding was greatest at the most distal positions. When proximal flowers were removed as they reached anthesis, pod set increased at the more distal positions. Pod set was increased in some instances by application of water directly to the ovaries as a drop in the calyx cup. Peroxidase activity changed in parallel with ovary development, increasing rapidly in growing pods but not in shedding flowers. Increases in flower peroxidase was mainly in ovary walls. Flowers taken at or near anthesis from positions with high percent pod set could be grown in vitro with especially good ovary enlargement, whereas ovaries in flowers taken from positions of low pod set did not enlarge in culture.Unidentified substances were extracted from young pods which, when incorporated into lanolin and tested in an in situ bioassay, could mimic the effect of proximal flowers in inducing shedding of distal flowers. Indole-3-acetic acid resembled the extracted materials in inducing shedding, but differed by eliciting side-effects that extracts did not. The growth substances abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and benzyladenine did not promote shedding in the in situ test.The evidence was taken to indicate that soybean flower shedding is induced in distal flowers by substances from the more proximal, fertilized ovaries, and that this is possibly due to interference with some of the intense metabolic changes that follow pollination and fertilization. © 1980 Oxford University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000913313

The parameters which decide the frequency of capture and of consumption are as follows: flying ability, sense of direction, body type, size, weight and abundance. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000144523

Progeny differences for both self-and out-cross seed production could be largely attributed to G.C.A. effects which were essentially uncorrelated. For cross-pollinated inflorescences heterosis was also important. Significant differences were found for selfed seed set and its two components, the proportion of flowers producing seeded siliquae and the numbers of seed per seeded siliqua, between parents with the same S-allele which could not be attributed to S-genotype alone. No evidence of increased self-compatibility in particular S-allele heterozygotes (mutual weakening) could be found. Outcross seed production depended primarily on the numbers of seeds set per seeded siliqua while self seed production was largely determined by the proportion of flowers which produced seeded siliqua. It is suggested that this is a key character for the production of inbred lines with reduced partial self-compatibility. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica oleracea; Partial self-compatibility; S-alleles; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345148229

On entry into the stylar transmitting tissue both types of tubes accelerate, but the compatible achieve a higher terminal velocity than do the incompatible, which eventually slow and stop. Grafting experiments show that the top 1 mm of the stylar tissue can play an important rôle in determining the future development of the pollen tube. Following mixed pollinations, proportionally too many 'compatible' pollen tubes reach the ovary than would be expected from the results of 'pure' compatible and incompatible pollinations indicating that incompatible pollen in some way helps 'prime' the style for growth of compatible pollen tubes.

These events have been considered in terms of the acquisition of the self-incompatibility response, which occurs while the pistil is enclosed in the bud. Apart from several minor differences, the young pistils differ only from the mature in that their transmitting tissue cells fail to respond to pollination by undergoing characteristic ultrastructural changes. Data from electrofocusing indicates that several proteins, mobilised in the mature transmitting tissue some three hours after pollination, are absent from bud pistils. It is proposed that the pollination-stimulated release of certain polypeptides, believed to be involved in the self-incompatibility response, does not take place in young pistils.

Pollination accelerates the rate of flower-development for about 4-6 days. Pollination experiments show that D. brasiliensis is not self-sterile; because of mechanical devices the sticky pollen grains do not normally come into contact with the stigmata unless an animal pollen vector is involved. The pollinators are diurnal Coleoptera, Diptera and Thysanoptera which eat from the pollen, lick from the stigmatic exudates and (in case of the flies) probably also from the staminal glands. Fruit- and seedeaters are birds which seem to be the main dispersal agents. Establishment of new individuals normally is through seedlings, but also by vegetative propagation through plagiotropous branches which may root and separate from the mother plant.

The pollen in Enhalus acoroides and Thalassia hemprichii is spherical and has an ornamented exine. An exine layer is not found in Halophila stipulacea where reniform pollen grains are contained within transparent moniliform tubes. Cytochemical tests show that the pollen wall in the three species contains acidic and neutral polysaccharides and acid hydrolase acitivity is detected in the intine of H. stipulacea and T. hemprichii. In Thalassia, one of the intine enzymes, acid phosphatase, is unambiguously associated with cytoplasmic inclusions.Flowering in Thalassia is coincident with the spring tides and the pollen is released as a mass suspended in a thecal slime which contains approximately 5 per cent by weight carbohydrate, the principal mono-saccharide being mannose. Electrophoretic analysis of the pollen-free slime shows a single glycoprotein component.The stigmas of the three seagrasses are papillate and of the 'dry' type possessing a continuous protein-aceous pellicle subtended by a cuticle. The stigma pellicle exhibits cytochemically detectable esterase activity and binds the lectin concanavalin A. Acid phosphatase activity is localized beneath the cuticle at the tips of the stigma papillae.The discoveries show that the characteristics of the pollen and stigmas in the seagrasses are comparable with those found in terrestrial flowering plants. The similarity in enzymatic properites of the pollen wall and stigma pellicle suggests that, intriguingly, a similar mechanism of cuticle erosion might well follow compatible pollination both on land and in the sea. © 1980 Annals of Botany Company.",Enhalus acoroides; Halophila decipiens; Halophila stipulacea; Hydrolytic enzymes; Seagrasses pollen wall; Stigma surface; Thalassia hemprichii,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007355786

At the onset of storage protein accumulation (16-18 d after pollination) storage protein-like material appears within Golgi vesicles and preformed vacuoles. At a later stage (24 d after pollination) similar material can also be detected within vesicles formed directly by the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is concluded that there are two routes for storage protein transport from its site of synthesis at the ER to its site of accumulation in the vacuome. The first route involves the participation of dictyosomes while the second route bypasses the Golgi apparatus. It appears that the normal pathways of membrane flow in the development of central vacuoles in post-meristematic cells are used to deposit the storage protein within the protein bodies.

Hence net heterozygote advantage has been postulated. An alternative proposal for the observed heterozygous excess is that it arises from fluctuating outcrossing rates. This study analyses the effects of variable outcrossing on heterozygosity and on the expected inbreeding, using simple models and simulations. Generally, estimates of observed heterozygosity are not seriously biased. However, estimates of the predicted fixation index, estimated from the current outcrossing rate, were biased upward, especially when both over-dominant selection operates and the distribution of outcrossing is markedly skewed. Such an upward bias would increase the difference between observed and expected heterozygosity. Even so, only a small portion of the observed excess heterozygosity in inbreeders is likely to be due to variable outcrossing. The bias can be effectively reduced by a few independent measurements of outcrossing in different generations. © 1980.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018823661

On both self-and cross-pollinated inflorescences significant amounts of additively controlled genetic variation were found for seed set per flower. For cross-pollinated inflorescences this was also the case for the two components of seed set, seeded siliquae per flower and seeds per seeded siliquae, but for self-pollinated ones only seeded siliquae production showed significant additive variation. Considerable heterosis and gene interaction were always present and a simple additive dominance model did not explain the variation. Two of the parents transmitted lower levels of partial self-compatibility to their progenies and, in one of these, dominant genes appeared to be responsible. The most important feature determining the production of self seeds was found to be the number of flowering sites at which the incompatibility mechanism failed rather than the number of seeds produced at each site. © 1980 H.

Seeds were collected at intervals between seed solidification (110\s-120 days postpollination) and harvesting of ripe fruits at 175\s-180 days. Lipid accumulated in seeds at a rapid, linear rate after the seeds solidified until near the beginning of ripening, when lipid build up proceeded at a greatly reduced rate. Triglyceride was the major lipid component at all stages of maturity, increasing from 69% to 96% of the total lipid over the period studied. The contributions of other lipid components to total lipids became less prominent as fat accumulated in seeds. However, on an individual seed basis their mass increased throughout development, except for phospholipids and diglycerides, which decreased on a mass/seed basis in the latter stages of fruit maturation. Since the rate of triglyceride production slowed at about the same time, the reduced amounts of phospholipids and diglycerides indicate the classical Kennedy pathway for triglyceride synthesis is operative in seeds of cacao. Fat present early in seed development was more unsaturated than typical cocoa butter of commerce. However, as lipid deposited during the period of active lipid synthesis, starting at about 130 days postpollination, a normal fatty acid composition was quickly established and did not change materially thereafter. © 1980 American Oil Chemists' Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249186884

By assessing their 15-year performance synthetically and objectively by using principal component analysis, the following results were obtained. (1) The contribution from factors, which were reduced to the three, was able to successfully account for about 80% of all variation obtained. Eigenvectors showed that the first three principal axes, z1, z2, and z3 represented growth conditions, stem-form, that is, crookedness and forking, and forking only, respectively. (2) Factor loading made a classification of the traits possible. (3) From the scatter diagrams and the variance analysis of the main scores, hybrid weakness of growth and also an increment of variance as to stem-form were clearly recognized in the hybrid group used. Therefore, it was revealed that the natural hybrids might almost never be adequate for commercial plantation of pine in Japan. P. densiflora was significantly higher in forking than P. thunbergii, but there was no significant difference in growth between them. Growth was affected mostly by site conditions; that is, in z1significant differences were found between replicates, among slope positions, and even among R×S. This provided some meaningful suggestions for an experiment established on a mountain site. Forking was affected little by site conditions, so it appeared to be largely inheritable. (4) It could be imagined that the hybrid weakness phenomenon in this study might mean, from the genecological point of view, hybrid breakdown which was a kind of isolation mechanism that prevented the introgression between P. densiflora and P. thunbergii. © 1980, THE JAPANESE FORESTRY SOCIETY.

Forty-five species of nectarivorous animals were recorded. Diurnal visitors included seven bird, nine butterfly. four moth (including two hawkmoth), two bee, two ant, one wasp, three blowfly, one fruit fly, two beetle and one weevil species. while nocturnal visitors included one bat and 12 moth (including three hawkmoth) species. Floral dimensions were such that only the vertebrate and larger insect species regularly contacted anthers and stigmas while foraging. Of these groups the feral honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most common flowet visitor. Honeyeaters and hawkmoths appeared to be the most important native pollinators; they were abundant in the study area and visited numerous flowers (50-250) in quick succession (1-3 s per flower) on each foraging bout. The only major differences in foraging times observed in the pollinator array were between diurnal, diurnal and crepuscular, and nocturnal floral visitors. Spatial partitioning of the nectar resource was limited to one instance of territoriality involving a Macleays honeyeater (Meliphaga rnacleayana) on a densely flowering branch prior to peak blooming time, occasional aggressive chases by honeyeaters, and a division of foraging modes into rapid, erratic flights of 0.5-4 m between flowers (hawkmoths) as against nearest-flower movements (all other groups). This lack of major spatial partitioning may have been due to the mass flowering of S. tierneyanum and the resultant superabundance of nectar. The vast majority (c. 99.95%) of interflower movements observed in foraging bouts of birds (and of hawkmoths) were within the same plant. This suggests that most seeds of S. tierneyanum may be derived from self-pollination. © 1980 CSIRO. All rights resereved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971024017

The diel patterns of anthesis and nectar availability are described and related to the timing of bee visits and pollination. Flower-bagging experiments confirmed that the setting of fruit depended on cross-pollination, was prevented by exclusion of flower visitors, and was sometimes limited in the field by inadequate pollination. Bees collected Passiflora nectar, and evaporated it on their tongues from 4550 % to 6263 % sugar before storing it. But the Passiflora pollen deposited on the bees dorsum was groomed off and rejected; only Gliricidia pollen was used for bee bread. Thus the bees treated acceptable (Gliricidia) pollen and unacceptable (Passiflora) pollen differently, and since pollen unacceptability improves the pollens chance of reaching a stigma, it may be a widespread adaptation. The yellow passionfruit flower shows many features characteristic of tropical Xylocopa flowers. Here, as elsewhere, this introduced crop depends for its pollination on indigenous bees which, though suitable morphologically and behaviourally, are not abundant enough to cause a high proportion of flowers to set fruit. The setting of fruit might be improved by increasing bee populations through provision of more timber for nest-sites, and suitable flowers to supply pollen and nectar throughout the year. © 1980, Cambridge University Press.

The amounts of pollen deposited annually in Tauber traps exposed in a mixed deciduous forest in southwestern Denmark 1967-76 were measured. The variations in the frequency of pollen from the local trees showed distinct biennial patterns. Flowering intensity in years following a year with low flowering was correlated with precipitation in April of the preceding year (negative, Betula and Alnus) or average summer temperature also of the preceding year (Quercus and Fagus). The pollen frequencies of grasses, herbaceous plants and Calluna were correlated with the precipitation of seasons that preceded the flowering. Years with very high pollen frequencies (1968 and 1969) must have been unpleasant for hay fever patients. Such severe pollen seasons can be predicted with fair accuracy. © 1980 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Climiatic influence; Hay fever; Herbaceous plants; Pollen productivity; Trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945645436

New Holland honeyeaters, white-cheeked honeyeaters, western spinebills and honey possums were all found to carry pollen of species of Banksia, Adenanthos, Lambertia (Proteaceae), Beaufortia and Calothamnus (Myrtaceae), whereas southern bush rats and house mice carried virtually none. Honeyeaters carried significantly larger pollen loads of the Proteaceae species than did honey possums. The honey possums carried the largest loads of Myrtaceae pollen. The loads on honey possums and southern bush rats may have been underestimated because these mammals were live-trapped and may have preened themselves prior to sampling for pollen. It was found that the two dominant banksias had divergent floral characteristics, some of which previous authors had suggested were adaptations to either bird or mammal pollination (e.g. straight styles in B. baxteri as against hooked styles in B. occidentalis). However, birds and mammals appeared to feed without preference on, and carry the pollen of, both species. The net effect of the divergent characteristics of the two banksias was that B. occidentalis transferred more pollen to vertebrate vectors and set more seed per inflorescence than did B. baxteri. Further work is needed to clarify the functional roles and adaptive significance of floral characteristics in these and other banksias. © 1980 CSIRO.

These cells are thought to originate mostly from the blood basophils and to play an important role in the manifestation of nasal symptoms. We carried out this study in order to elucidate the mechanism of BGC appearance in nasal secretion after the exposure to the antigen in patients with Japanese ceder pollinosis. The following parameters were chosen; 1) the basophilic leukocytes count of peripheral blood 2) the degree of the nasal symptom, 3) the degree of nasal provocation reaction, 4) the numbers of BGC in nasal secretion, 5) the appearance times of BGC in nasal secretion after nasal provocation, 6) the serum IgE and serum IgE antibody levels, 7) the percent histamine release from leukocytes. The parameters were measured both in a pollination season and in an off-season of Japanese ceder pollen. The results were as follows: 1) The numbers of BGC in nasal secretion and the degree of nasal provocation reaction were concurrently increased in a pollination season more than in an off-season. These changes were more significant in the patients with single sensitization of ceder pollen when compared with the patients who had combined sensitization to other antigens. 2) The numbers of blood basophils increased in a pollination season and decreased in an off-season. 3) The serum IgE levels remained unchanged but the IgE antibody levels and percent histamine release slightly increased in a pollination season. 4) In a pollination season, it took only 2 hours for the marked increase of the BGC in nasal secretian after nasal provocation, while in an off-season, it took longer than 16 hours. The decrease of blood basophils was observed one hour after provocation in a pollination season. We conclude that 1) the antigen exposure induces the increase of BGC in nasal secretion and 2) the increase of BGC contributes significantly to the increased sensitivity to antigen provocation in a pollination season. The mechanism of the difference of the appearance time of BGC after provocation in a pollination season and in an off-season remains unknown. © 1980, The Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan, Inc.

Reproductive characters are strongly associated within a given level of comparison (e.g. stems per plant with flowers per plant) but show relative independence between levels (e.g. stems per plant with umbels per branch). Plant size is negatively correlated with fruit production on a proportional basis (fruit?set) but positively related to the absolute numbers of fruits produced. The invocation of a pollen donor strategy to explain the occurrence of large inflorescence displays in Asclepias is unnecessary, as these large plants have a larger female contribution to the next generation, irrespective of their male contribution. Self?pollination is proposed as a process determining the upper limit of inflorescence size in Asclepias. Experimental pollinations suggest that early competition among ovaries within umbels is very important in determining levels of fruit?set. Competition among ovaries in different umbels, time of pollination, and location of umbels also exert an effect. Inflorescence architecture likely represents a series of evolutionary compromises between maximization of pollinator attractiveness on the one hand and maximization of fruit maturation on the other.

All species except Anigozanthos flavidus set few seeds on selfing relative to numbers set on intrapopulational crossing, and thus were predominantly outbreeding. Interpopulational crossing barriers in A humilis were usually non-existent.

Since nectar sugar concentration varies little among populations, increased nectar secretion results in a greater mass of sugar per flower for pollinator attraction. These differences in the amount of reward offered per flower account at least in part for observed higher levels of pollinator activity in populations with high nectar production. Nectar production is correlated also with nectary depth, i.e., flowers in populations with deep nectaries have higher rates of nectar secretion than those with shallow nectaries. Nectary depth differences adapt populations to different pollinator-types. Populations with deeper nectaries are adapted to pollination by bumblebees with longer tongues and more specialized foraging behaviors. In conclusion, there are basic differences in pollination ecology among geographical races of a. columbianum, which are indicated by correlated interpopulution differences in (1) nectar production, (2) level of pollinator activity, (3) nectar depth, and (4) pollinator-type. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040778471

In view of the morphological, physiological and biochemical parallels between fungal infection and pollination, it is further argued that there are common metabolic links between the effects of boron deficiency, wounding and infection and the presence of callose in pollen grains and tubes, the stigmatic deposition of callose in response to some incompatible pollinations and the boron requirement for the germination of pollen.

Equations are derived for the calculation of the rate of net energy intake of a foraging bumblebee. The assumptions that form the basis of these energy equations are discussed. As examples, the rates of net energy intake are calculated for Bombus flavifrons workers foraging on neighboring patches of Aconitum columbianum and Delphinium barbeyi. If the bumblebees forage optimally, their net rates of energy intake in the two patches should be equal. The observed rates are consistent with this hypothesis.

Red clover is adapted to a wide range of soil types, pH levels, and environmental conditions. This plasticity has enabled red clover to retain its usefulness for hay, silage, pasture, and soil improvement in much of the temperate region of the world. Red clover is a nitrogen-fixing legume, thus contributing to the supply of nitrogen available in the soil for subsequent crops. Red clover is a self-incompatible cross-pollinated species that, under natural conditions, produces very few self-seed. The mechanism of self-incompatibility is the one-locus, gametophytic S-allele system in which plants with the same S-alleles are prevented from selfing by slow growth of pollen tubes through styles. The system also prevents cross-fertilization of plants that have the same S-allele genotype.

So wrote Algarotti to Voltaire on May 31, 1759, concerning the new operatic reforms at the Bourbon court at Parma.1 From about 1745 onwards, the winds of change blew with gathering momentum across the operatic landscape of Europe, causing a fragmentation of previously stereotyped forms, and leading to their cross-pollination with those of different national traditions and with other modes of dramatic expression. The climate of innovation, experiment and regeneration, once spawned, profoundly influenced not only the theory and practice of opera, but also those of ballet and incidental music. Until the first production of the Viennese version of Glucks Orfeo ed Euridice in 1762, the operatic traditions of Europes foremost court theatres in Berlin, Dresden, Naples, Munich, Vienna and in Paris itself, appeared to preserve a series of ossifying Neapolitan, Venetian or Parisian styles, usually through the encouragement of composers particularly skilled in their execution (e.g. Hasse, Graun). In Italy in particular, the stagione system, which largely restricted operatic productions to the Carnival season between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday, helped to protect such traditions against change. The mechanism of the Italian stagione, graphically outlined in Villeneuves Lettre sur le meZhanisme deopera italien, was an ad hoc measure, under which a maestro and a group of singers were brought together in one centre, usually about a month before the Carnival season, to compose and rehearse an opera of usually twenty-five or twenty-six numbers linked by recitatives.2 Under such an arrangement, the casting and distribution of solo numbers tended to follow a hierarchic grading of singers according to their ability and/or reputation. With the exception of the Viennese circle, the proponents of change were the smaller rulers and princelings: In particular, the Dukes of Parma and Württemberg, the Palatine Elector at Mannheim, and the geographically peripheral court of the Braganzas at Lisbon. A comparative investigation of the theatrical conditions and practices at these courts in this period reveals a common pre-occupation in blending French spectacle and costuming with progressive reform and, at times, radical modification of the Metastasian tradition, as appeared implicit in Algarottis reform ideals.3 Moreover, each of these theatres sought to add to the spectacle through the incorporation of extended ballet sequences, which in Stuttgart and Mannheim, under the direction of such choreographers as Noverre and Laucherry, flowered into the ballet daction,4 Several of these centres were also linked through incumbencies of the same composer-reformers: Jommelli was active in Vienna, Stuttgart and Lisbon, Traetta ip Parma, Mannheim and Vienna, Holzbauer in Stuttgart and Mannheim, and the widely performed Perez in Lisbon. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958589150

In the mother lines cell size doubled between day 15 and 33, whereas in Mutants 56 and 1508 cell growth stopped after 21 days. In Mutant 86 the growth was more similar to the mother line. A reduced starch deposition could account for the smaller grains of the mutants. In Mutant 56 and Mutant 1508, the reduced starch deposition was partly due to a reduction in the size of the large starch granules, as well as an almost complete lack of small starch granules. In Mutant 86, fewer large starch granules were found. Mutant 56 had a reduced amount of B?hordeins, whereas, in Mutant 1508, B? and C?hordeins were almost absent. In Mutant 86 a delayed onset of the hordein synthesis was revealed. There was a correlation between the amount of hordein present and the content of protein bodies per cell.

Bromus inermis Leyss is also known as bromegrass, Austrian brome, Hungarian brome, Russian brome, and most commonly, smooth bromegrass. Smooth bromegrass is most often encountered as an octoploid although a range of chromosome numbers, suggesting a polyploid series, has been reported. The perennial nature of the species, together with its persistent and aggressive growth habit, has perpetuated a number of chromosome aberrations. The plants of smooth bromegrass are cross-pollinated. This lack of selffertility is the outcome of two causes. First, structural differences in the chromosomes resulting from inversions and translocations have caused meiotic irregularities. Second, irregularities arise from physiological imbalance, which is frequently the outcome of hybridization. © 1980 Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011573478

Within the ecotone, hybrids between E. melanophloia and E. crebra are about one-fifth as frequent as those between E. populnea and E. crebra.

The frequency of resistant plants was fairly high in all field-selected lines except 73N22-1 and very low in all glasshouse-selected lines except the Nosovsky resistant selection. Coefficients of correlation between disease scores at maturity in the field and scores of young plants in each of four different glasshouse environments were significant for all but one environment. The highest correlation was observed in the case of the procedure involving a single inoculation 10 days after sowing and growth of seedlings under a daily temperature regime of 25/20°C. The five lines ranked most resistant in this test were also the five most resistant lines in the field. © 1980, CSIRO. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002226595

Anthers of the upper and lower stamens differ in size and shape, and lower anthers produce much more pollen than upper ones. Pollen is released only when the poricidal anthers are forcibly beaten. The configuration of the androecium suggests that feeding and pollinating stamens are present; the manner of pollen discharge suggests vibratile pollination by heavy?bodied bees. According to the direction in which the style is deflected, C. alba and C. lutea have right?handed and left?handed flowers. In these two species, the lower stamen is deflected in a direction opposite to that of the style. Artificial pollinations were carried out with plants sampled from various field populations of the four species. The seed set data obtained indicate the presence of physiological self?incompatibility. No significant differences have been found in fertility of pollen from lower and upper anthers. In C. alba and C. lutea, the floral dimorphism together with a low number of flowers open at any time may be effective in promoting outbreeding. The ratio of pollen grains per flower to the number of seeds produced is much smaller in C. alba and C. lutea than in the other two species. It is possible that smaller numbers of pollen grains are required here, because the floral dimorphism enhances pollinations between flowers of different types. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

These symptoms appeared at the flowering time of apple tree and was observed during the pollination work in the apple farm. 17 patients out of the 21 cases were farmers engaged in the apple pollination work for 725 years. Other 4 patients have lived near the apple farm. Thus, the contact with large amount of apple pollen was thought to be the cause of the sensitization. Generally speaking, these patients had severe nasal symptoms and eosinophilia in nasal secret, and showed high sensitivity to the apple pollen in the intradermal test and the provacation test to the nasal mucosa. However, IgE value by RIST (mean value: 484 u/ml) showed no seasonal change, and the value of IgE antibodies by RAST was lower than those of the other pollinosis, though it was determined as positive.

The fruits develop slowly and can take a year or more to ripen. Carbon fixation patterns include C3, C4, and CAM. The chemical diversity and adaptive features of the orchids are enormous.

Most commercial pine seedlots in South Africa are derived from open pollinated clonal seed orchards and grading, by use of a table, is shown to tend to separate the families. In practice, growth differences between seed grades could be a measure of genetic origin, since seedling development is not related to seed Size. Thus if seed is graded to facilitate the operation of a mechanical sowing device, the genetic constitution of a seedling bed can only be preserved by sowing all grades of the seed mixture in that bed. If seed is graded with the added intention of obtaining more uniform development through sowing likesized seed in each bed, the genetic constitution of each seedling bed will differ. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346075886

The theoretical consequences of making this substitution on the sensitivity of the tests for epistasis and on the reliability of the estimates of the additive and dominance components of variation in the presence and absence of epistasis are described for Fa and Foo populations. The practical consequences are illustrated by comparative analyses of normal families of a triple test cross and their selfs for the F»o population using a population of 80 Fls families produced from a cross between varieties 1 and 5 of Nkotiana rustica. Both in theory and in practice the additive genetic component D is detected and estimated with similar reliabilities from the normal families of a triple test cross and their selfs. On the other hand, the dominance component H is detected and estimated with much lower reliability from the selfs and in the presence of epistasis the estimate is more biased. The sensitivity of the standard test for epistasis is also lower for selfs but for an Foo population this is partially offset by the additional test for epistasis involving the means of the Foo families (Pj) themselves. In the comparative analyses family size and replications for the normal families and their selfs have been kept the same to make direct comparisons possible. In normal circumstances, however, one would not devote the time and effort required to produce the selfs unless as a result larger families and more replicates could be raised. Depending on the magnitude of the resulting increase in the number of plants raised the loss of reliability in the estimate of H and of sensitivity in the test for epistasis would be partly or wholly restored. © 1980 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966161428

Values of r were calculated for hypothetical cohorts composed of individuals flowering at the same age. Maximum rates of r are achieved by plants which flower at the earliest possible age. Although older plants produce more flowers, this increase is not sufficient to compensate for the effect of increased T on r. Few plants in each population flower at the youngest possible age, and for the majority reproduction is delayed, generation times are longer and r lower than achieved by plants flowering at younger ages. Delayed reproduction may be favored by greater seed set, due to pollinator attraction to larger flower stalks, as well as broader seed dispersal which could increase the probability of seedling establishment. Delays greater than those observed may be selected against by decreasing probability of survival, a decrease in the rate of addition of flowers with increasing size, and slower transitions between leaf number classes in larger plants. Staggered reproduction by an individual's offspring, whether environmentally or genetically determined, has the effect of insuring survival in an environment with high variability in pollinator effectiveness (see d set), germination, and seedling establishment. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-8044242146

The variation of relative frequency of one of the two kernel types from apex to base of the resulting ear, made it possible to measure the competitive ability by regression coefficients. The effect of the pollen marker on the character was estimated by analyzing the progeny of heterozygous o2/+ plants self-pollinated through four generations. The o2 allele-bearing pollen revealed a slower germination rate than the dominant counterpart; no differences between the two pollen types were observed with regard to tube growth rate. The occurrence of intergametophytic interactions was confirmed: the competitive ability of a line varied according to the genotype of the competing pollen.

Plants which rely on animals to disperse their pollen potentially compete for pollinators by processes similar to interference and exploitative competition. Coexisting plant species may evolve to avoid or reduce such competition by character displacement in floral morphology and/or phenology. One important difference between competition for pollinators and most other kinds of competition is that pollinator resources are not used up and made absolutely unavailable to competitors. Consequently, plant species can potentially overlap completely in their utilization of pollinators. The disadvantages of competing apparently are sometimes outweighed by the advantages of sharing pollinators, because distantly related plant species frequently show evolutionary convergence in floral morphology, blooming time and nectar rewards to utilize the same pollinators.Distantly related animal taxa may compete for floral nectar and pollen by both interference and exploitation. The mechanisms of such competition depend primarily on the energetic costs and benefits of foraging and aggression. Exploitative competition is very important because nectar feeders of small body size and low energy requirements can forage economically and reduce nectar availability to levels that will not support larger animals. Thus small nectarivores often can exclude larger competitors from flowers to which both taxa have equal access. Plants may evolve to influence the outcotre of competition among animal visitors and favor species that provide the best pollination services. Thus flowers specialized for pollination by large animals often show morphological or phenological specializations which make rewards unava'lable to smaller animals. Interference is adaptive only when the benefits of exclusive use of a resource outweig.i the costs of defending it. Because distantly related kinds of flower visitors often differ in body size and energetic requirements, interference competition among them is probably rare although it is often important among closely related nectarivores.The community level consequences of competition in the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator associations are still poorly understoood. Competition among distantly related pollinators for plant floral rewards appears to play a major role, but competition among plants for pollinator services may be only a weak force. Although the basic interaction between plant and pollinator usually is a mutualistic one, certain species of both plants and animals parasitize this interaction and compete with the mutualists for limited resources. Thus some animals rob nectar and pollen and compete with legitimate pollinators without providing pollination services. Similarly, some plants offer no floral rewards but obtain pollinator services by mimicing rewarding flowers of other species. The effects of these kinds of interactions on the organization of communities of plants and pollinators provide a fertile area for future research. © 1979 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548246097

Increased pollen loads produced increased seed set and reduced flower longevity progressively to a minimum of one day after pollination with pure pollen. Weakening of the abscission zone was detectable 8 h after pollination, whilst the pollen tubes were still within the stigmatic zone, suggesting that a stimulus, moving at 4 mm h-1 minimum, was transmitted through the style and ovary. Soon after pollination removal of the stigma prevented the pollination-induced corolla abscission. Later it was necessary to remove the stigma and upper style, and later still the whole style to delay abscission.

Activities were measured using pollen tube penetration and seed set data from reciprocal crosses between each S-allele heterozygote and its two corresponding S-allele homozygotes. In pollen the S-allele activities ranged from zero to 100% inhibition of pollen tube penetration and seed set, and in the stigma they ranged from 8 to 100% inhibition. Of the sixty-eight S-allele activities measured, thirty-three (48%) were 90 to 100% inhibition, nine (13%) were 80 to 89% inhibition and one to five were within each ten-unit range below 80% inhibition. In an S-allele heterozygote, each subset of two S alleles had an activity for each allele in both pollen and stigma which was highly repeatable among duplicate pollinations within and among successive years. Each subset of two S alleles had a specific S-allele interaction in the pollen, and the same or another specific interaction in the stigma. In pairings with six other S alleles, allele S2 had four calculated levels of activity in pollen that ranged from 88 to 94%, and five levels in the stigmas between 15 and 94%. When paired in a heterozygote, alleles S3 and S5 had activities ranging between 42 and 59%, representing mutual weakening of S-allele activity. Also, heterozygote S15S3 had pollen activities, respectively, of 25 and 6%, i.e. mutual weakening in the pollen. These results indicate that in heterozygous combination with a series of other S alleles, each S-allele may have activity in pollen and also in stigma that potentially is between zero and 100% inhibition. They further indicate that the defined sexual-organ X S-allele-interaction Types I, II, III and IV are extremes; all intermediate variations including complete weakening of both alleles are possible. Recessiveness is weakening of the activity of but one of the two S alleles.

It then grew around the funicle, through the micropyle in the inner integument and between the papillate cells at the apex of the nucellus. It entered the embryo sac via a synergid. Sperm nuclei were present in the embryo sac at 48 h after pollination and fusion of the polar and sperm nuclei took place before fusion of the egg and sperm.

Maximum values for galactosyldiglycerides and diacylphospholipids (nonstarch lipids) were reached at 16-23 DAP, and all decreased to very low values at maturity.

Nearly equal amounts of phenotypic variability were found in the two species. L. alba had higher within-family variability than L. floccosa, but this result was highly heterogeneous among characters. A study of between- and within-population variance estimates did not reject the null hypothesis that L. alba and L. floccosa are similar with regard to the partitioning and amount of variability for quantitative characters. However, allozyme variation at 11 loci in a large number of populations showed L. alba to be highly polymorphic in contrast to the virtual monomorphism within L. floccosa populations. The average number of alleles per locus in L. alba and L. floccosa was 1.97 and 1.02, respectively, and on an average, L. alba and L. floccosa populations had 63% and 3% loci with polymorphism, respectively. Three groups of allozyme allelic combinations emerged which correlated well with the taxonomic delineation of allogamous L. alba, three semi-autogamous L. floccosa forms and two autogamous L. floccosa forms. All taxa showed a significant reduction in the seed output per plant due to moisture stress. L. alba suffered a further loss of fecundity under the paucity of pollinators, L. floccosa ssp. floccosa showed no significant effect from this factor, whereas L. floccosa ssp. grandiflora exhibited a curvilinear response which peaked at 'partial pollination' and decreased to a lower level at 'full pollination.' The geographic distribution of the two species with regard to the temperature and rainfall distribution did not suggest L. floccosa to be living in drier marginal areas. Patterns of variation in flowering time showed L. alba to be less variable than L. floccosa. Overall, there seemed to be little direct support for the thesis that inbreeding species originated from outcrossing taxa in marginal environments as a direct adaptation to a shortened growing season of xeric environments and to the lack of pollinators. Alternative hypotheses suggest that autogamy in L. floccosa might have evolved as a reproductive isolating barrier acting through either cleistogamy or divergence in flowering times. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",Electrophoretic variation; Evolution of inbreeding; Phenotypic plasticity; Variation patterns,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001079981

Fourteen of these hybrids were of the classical type, which possesses the full gametic complement of chromosomes from each parent. These hybrids are more like tripsacum than maize. They are perennial, tiller profusely, and begin to flower in approximately two years from germination. So far, none of these hybrids has produced pollen and all backcrosses have been unsuccessful. Five of the 19 hybrids were not of the classical type, and possessed a variable number of chromosomes in cells of the same root tip. Most cells examined contained 20 maize and no tripsacum chromosomes. Other cells contained 20 maize chromosomes and up to eight of tripsacum. However, in at least three hybrids some cells contained a total of 20 chromosomes, of which up to four were tripsacum substitution chromosomes. These five non-classical hybrids are more maize-like, and are annual. Most have flowered within three months of germination. Although they have produced no viable pollen, four plants have set seed after backcrossing to maize. The production of F1 hybrids is discussed with view to their subsequent assessment and utilization for maize improvement. © 1979 H.

The first, independent of pollination, results in the deposition of an intercellular matrix, rich in protein and carbohydrate. The second, triggered by pollination, although independent of the compatibility of the pollen grain, involves synthesis of molecules believed to be specific to the S(incompatibility)-gene system.

Four types of pollination systems are known to occur in the southwestern cactus flora: bee, hummingbird, hawkmoth, and bat pollination. Two other modes are suspected but not documented: miscellaneous smallinsect pollination and autogamy.-Bee flowers comprise a wide and nearly continuous series of size classes from very small to very large. The large bee flowers, with perianths 5.5 to 12.5 cm in diameter, form a prominent but arbitrarily delimited subcategory in the bee pollination system. Promiscuous flowers and autogamous flowers, if they occur, are included with the medium-sized and small bee flowers in our present classification, due to lack of information, and will have to be separated out when our knowledge is more complete. The overwhelming majority of species in the southwestern cactus flora are bee flowers. Between 39 and 44% of the species are large bee flowers. Another 50 to 56% of the species are classified as medium-sized and small bee flowers; while some of these may turn out to be promiscuous flowers and autogamous flowers, most of them are undoubtedly bee flowers.-Hummingbird, hawkmoth, and bat pollination are conspicuous but statistically minor components of the pollination spectrum, occurring in only one or a few species (see Table 2). Hummingbird pollination has arisen from bee pollination in the Southwest. The species or species groups with hawkmoth and bat pollination, on the other hand, are basically tropical groups which developed their advanced pollination systems in the tropics. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",Cactaceae; Flower pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002821702

The number and length of pollen tubes were not different between selfings and interspecific crosses. Fertilization was completed in all matings and the time of fertilization was maternally dependent which may reflect the degree of maturation of embryo sacs at pollination. A large difference between reciprocal crosses was found in the time of endosperm and embryo division in relation to the time of fertilization. When P. vulgaris was the female parent and P. acutifolius the male parent, endosperm division occurred at the same time as in P. vulgaris upon selfing, while in P. vulgaris x P. lunatus crosses the time of endosperm division was intermediate as compared with the two parents. The time lapse between fertilization and endosperm and embryo division in P. acutifolius x P. vulgaris crosses was longer than in either parent upon selfing. In P. lunatus x P. vulgaris crosses, endosperm division occurred in only 7-12% of the ovules at 72 hours after pollination.

Following pollination, and prior to fertilization approximately 2 days later, the embryo sacs completed development and consisted of two synergids with prominent filiform apparatus, an egg cell, a central cell with two polar nuclei and three antipodal cells. Sperm nuclei were observed within the embryo sac at 2 days and by 4 days the endosperm was proliferating. In the non-pollination treatment the embryo sac was still intact after 4 days although the antipodal nuclei were becoming hard to distinguish.

Simulation results indicate that there are mechanical limitations upon the range of nectar sugar concentrations and nectar extraction times available to butterflies. There is a unique optimum for net rate of energy gain at 20-25% nectar sugar concentration which is independent of the metabolic rate and of proboscis shape and size over the ranges found in butterflies. The optimal nectar extraction rate depends upon the size and shape of the proboscis.

Honeyeaters and lorikeets are the most persistent flower-feeders and some species depend almost entirely on nectar as a source of energy. Silvereyes, parrots, woodswallows, pardalotes, thornbills, and a few other species of passerines occasionally visit flowers. The genera most frequently visited are Eucalyptus, Callistemon, Banksia, Grevillea, Adenanthos, Dryandra, Epacris, Astroloma, Amyema, Correa, Xanthorrhoea, Anigozanthos, and Eremophila. Some flowers, e.g., those of Eucalyptus, are very generalised in structure and are visited and pollinated by insects as well as birds. Other plants have shown a range of adaptations to attract birds to their flowers or deter insects. Birds require significant rewards so that flowers must produce copious nectar. Rowers are often clumped into inflorescences (e.g., Banksia) or individual flowers become large and tubular or gullet-shaped (Eremophila). Flowers visited by birds are often red, though yellow (Adenanthos) and green (e.g., Amyema, Correa) are common. Hairs in tubular flowers, and lack of attractive smell may deter insects without affecting birds (e.g., Astroloma). In Australia the relationships between birds and plants are not as specific as those shown for hummingbirds and some of their flowers in tropical America. Most species of birds visit a wide range of plants, and most plants are visited by a wide range of birds.Pollen is usually placed on the forehead, face, and chin feathers of the bird or on its beak. Birds have been proved to be effective pollinators of many plants in temperate Australia. Little work has so far been carried out in tropical Australia.Bird-pollinated flowers have mostly originated from insect-pollinated flowers though it is possible that some (e.g., Banksia) were, or still are, pollinated by mammals.It is not clear why so many of the dominant plant genera in temperate Australia are pollinated by birds. Birds may be more reliable pollinators than insects when the climate and flowering season are unpredictable, or during winter when many of the specifically bird-pollinated plants flower. Birds may also increase the chance of outcrossing as they fly further between plants than insects. Nutrients are often limiting in Australian ecosystems, whereas energy rarely is. Therefore, massive nectar production is unlikely to place a strain on plants, unless water is scarce. Finally, it is possible that birds may provide a service in addition to pollination, they may protect the plant from herbivorous insects. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001080770

Modern relations between the angiosperms and anthophilous insects and the fossil records of both groups suggest that co-evolution was important in the radiation and perhaps even the origin of the angiosperms. An integral part of understanding the evolution of the angiosperms is understanding the evolution of their pollination mechanisms. Enough well-preserved flowers and inflorescences have now been assembled from the Claiborne Formation to allow a consideration of the types of floral morphology and of probable pollination systems that had evolved by the Middle Eocene. Flowers and inflorescences with floral and pollen morphology well adapted for wind pollination are common in the Clairborne Formation. Among these are representatives of two important extant families of the ""Amentiferae"". These had diversified by the Middle Eocene and were as well adapted for wind dispersal of pollen as modern representatives of the families. Furthermore, it appears that significant evolution has taken place within the two families since the Middle Eocene. Flowers and inflorescences with morphology suggestive of pollination by all four orders of anthophilous insects are present in sediments of the Claiborne Formation. Several of the trends commonly postulated to have taken place with increasing specialization for insect pollination have progressed to a significant degree by the Middle Eocene, but evidence for certain features thought to be characteristic of more sophisticated insect pollination mechanisms is missing from the fossil flower record of that time. In addition, the fossil flower record of the Middle Eocene suggests that there has been significant evolution within certain extant families since the Middle Eocene and that certain families of angiosperms have originated since the Middle Eocene. © 1979.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011433558

All except Prosoestus spp. visited female inflorescences after visiting male inflorescences during anthesis and transported pollen to the receptive female flowers. At a rough estimate, about 20 000 individuals visited each female inflorescence during the period of receptivity, and about 70% of the pollen transported was viable. In Peninsular Malaysia, Thrips hawaiiensis (Morg.) is almost certainly the main pollinating agent. Some 200 000 individuals were estimated to visit a single male inflorescence. They also visited female inflorescences, Where up to 7.3 thrips per flower were estimated to be present at any one time, each carrying 45 pollen grains, of which 76% were viable. In Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, a momphid moth. Pyroderces sp., may contribute to oil palm pollination. As natural pollination of all oil palms in Cameroun and taller palms in Peninsular Malaysia is considered adequate while in most areas of Sabah where few insects visit the flowers it is inadequate, it is concluded that the insects observed achieve pollination so the oil palm should be considered an entomophilous rather than an anemophilous plant. © 1979, Cambridge University Press.

The history of Australian pollination studies is briefly discussed and particular emphasis given to the contributions made by some of the more outstanding workers in this field. The enormous diversity of the pollen-vector fauna is documented and emphasis given to the adaptations of particular vector types and of the blossoms that they visit.The pollination role of the Australian invertebrate fauna is discussed and an assessment made of the proportion of anthophilous (i.e., flower-frequenting) taxa in various insect groups. Critical examination of recorded feeding habits of the Australian coleopteran and dipteran faunas reveals that at least 28 of the 121 coleopteran families (i.e., 23%) and 44 of the 87 dipteran families (i.e., 51%) contain anthophilous species. The Australian bee fauna, consisting of c. 3000 species, is exclusively anthophilous and constitutes the most important group of invertebrate pollinators; a comprehensive table listing those bee taxa that have been recorded visiting the blossoms of native plant genera, is provided.Two vertebrate pollination systems are important in the Australian context: ornithophily, involving flower-visiting birds as the pollen vectors, and therophily whereby flying or non-flying mammals act as the pollen transporters. Mammal pollination (therophily) is discussed at length, and several new terms introduced to describe the syndromes of marsupial (metatherophily), placental (eutherophily), and rodent (sminthophily) pollination respectively; comprehensive tables listing the anthophilous chiropteran and marsupial taxa of Australia are also provided.The role of various types of pollen vectors in promoting convergent and divergent floral evolution in the Australian flora is illustrated with examples from selected plant taxa. New information on the pollination biology of the tribe Boronieae (Rutaceae) is presented, and some of the more unusual floral adaptations noted. The review concludes by emphasising those areas where future research is needed and where broad co-operative studies would be most productive. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001250505

The values of the sample of overlap indices for plants pollinated by the same animals was significantly smaller than the values for plants pollinated by different animals; plants which share pollinators are less alike in height than those that don't share pollinators.

'Hayward') flowers was examined before, and after, hand-pollination and the course of pollen tube development was followed. At the time of flower opening the style had a well defined canal which opened at its distal end to form a V -shaped stigmatic furrow. The surface of the furrow was covered with unicellular papillae. The exposed wall of each papilla was covered with a cuticle and a distinct pellicle. The papillae were supported by a layer of hypodermal cells and an extensive layer of thin-walled transmitting cells. The transmitting tissue extended from the tip of the style through the stylar canal to its junction with the ovary. A single vascular strand, which extended along the length of the style adjacent to the stylar canal, branched into the stylar parenchyma on each side of the V -shaped furrow. Pollen grains germinated on the stigmatic papillae and grew through the intercellular spaces of the transmitting tissue. Pollen tubes were restricted to the transmitting tissue in the lower half of the canal adjacent to the vascular strand. Starch grains in the stylar parenchyma and transmitting tissue progressively disappeared as the pollen tubes traversed the length of the style.

The stainability and production of pollen from pins exceeded those of thrums. About 20% of pin pollen and 48% of thrum pollen was removed from anthers by insect visitors. Pins and thrums were present in a 1:1 ratio in 1971 but pins outnumbered thrums in 1976. Thrums produced more seeds per flower than pins though the number of ovules produced by each was similar. Two methods for collecting stigmas from open flowers and analyzing them for pollen loans produced somewhat different results. For pin stigmas, the pollen load consisted of 223% thrum pollen; for thrum stigmas, the pollen load consisted of 071% pin pollen with most stigmas having less than 50% pin pollen. In general, intermorph pollen flow is less than would be expected if pollen flow were random. It is probable that most intramorph pollen on stigmas is a result of self? or geitonogamous pollination. The extensive literature concerning the natural pollinators of the primrose is reviewed. Although Darwin's hypothesis concerning the functional significance of distyly in promoting intermorph pollination was never quantified, the pollen flow patterns observed in P. vulgaris are unexpectedly deviant and are similar to those patterns observed in several unrelated heterostylous species in other plant families.

To achieve this, multiple homozygous chromosomal translocations and inversions are incorporated into one group, isolating it genetically from the other. Any hybrid of the two isolates is sterile because it is heterozygous many times over with respect to inversions and translocations. This creates an unstable equilibrium in a cross-pollinated species at a gene frequency of pe = wa/(1+wa), where wa is the relative fitness of the less-fit isolate. Any gene frequency not at this equilibrium point tends away from equilibrium and toward a population composed entirely of whichever of the isolates had the favored frequency initially.In a wind-pollinated species, another route is also possible. If a predominantly new-isolate planting were made that was downwind of a pollen and seed barrier, the asymmetrical pollen distribution would slowly, progressively overwhelm wild-type populations located downwind of the new isolate.

Winslow et al. (the incitant of fireblight) and measurement of the resulting cortical lesion when extension is complete. Data are now available on practically all commercial cultivars, some of which have a useful level of resistance. Some newer cultivars, particularly those with resistance to scab (Venluria inaequalis [Cooke] Wint.) derived from Malus floribunda, have good resistance to E. amylovora. A very high level of resistance is present in Asiatic Malus species, including M. x robusta, M. x sublobata, M. x atrosanguinea, and M. prunifolia, and in the North American species M. fusca. This type of resistance appears to be inherited polygenically, and because of its detectability in young seedlings can be used conveniently in breeding. Objectives of pear breeding programs are aimed at developing superior fruit quality combined with resistance to fireblight, psylla, and Fabraea leaf spot. Many high quality cultivars of Pyrus communis are extremely susceptible to E. amylovora and sensitivity appears to be controlled by a dominant gene Se. A high level of resistance is present in P. ussuriensis but varies considerably between clonal selections of other Pyrus species. Pear seedlings from controlled pollinations are artificially inoculated in the glasshouse with a similar bacterial suspension as used for apples, and only the most resistant ones are selected and planted in the field for future evaluation. In Beltsville, heritability studies of crosses between nonsensitive parents have indicated that selection for resistance within progenies results in a high degree of genetic gain. Interspecific hybridization has an advantage over P. communis crosses mainly when insect or fungus resistance is required. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell.

After introductory remarks on the problematic subdivision of the genus Ruppia and on its distribution in the world, a detailed picture is given of the distribution of the European Ruppia taxa in three study areas at different latitudes (Finland, The Netherlands, S. France), in relation to important environmental factors, e.g. salinity, size and permanence of the water body, substrate type. Ruppia cirrhosa (Petagna) Grande appeared to be characteristic for medium and large permanent water bodies with an annual mean salinity between 2 and 35 Cl- (total range 1.5-60 Cl-). Ruppia maritima var. maritima L. proved to occur mainly in small and medium-size permanent water bodies with an annual mean salinity between 0.5 and 8 Cl- (total range 0.3-15 Cl-), whereas R. maritima var. brevirostris (Agardh) Aschers. Graebn. proved to be characteristic for temporary waters of various sizes (salinity range 1-42 Cl-). An examination of the ionic content of the water of 8 Ruppia habitats in The Netherlands revealed that the minor components of salinity (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-) showed considerable variations, resulting in conspicuous differences in proportional ionic compositions in different waters. The Na, K, Mg and Ca contents of Ruppia taxa were measured in material from several natural habitats. The metal contents of Ruppia cirrhosa proved to be similar to those found for Zostera marina L.R. maritima var. brevirostris differed greatly from the other two Ruppia taxa regarding the metal content and showed similarities to fresh water species in this respect. The development of the Ruppia taxa in their natural habitats is described in detail. The switch from winter quiescence to exponential growth is temperature-determined in both Ruppia species. In contrast, the moment of biomass decrease is determined by plant properties: after 4 months of exponential growth, long stems decompose near their base resulting in easy detachment of above-ground parts of the vegetation. In The Netherlands, a further decay is followed by quiescence, whereas in S. France another period of exponential growth can start from the remaining horizontal runners. Further, the biomass decrease is strongly influenced by mechanical damage due to wind action and by bird and macrofauna grazing. Ruppia maritima var. brevirostris is capable of completing its entire life cycle in a few months and is therefore well-adapted to temporary environments. In Finland, it also occurs on exposed shores in moving sandy sediments. The results of outdoor culture experiments carried out in The Netherlands with the three Ruppia taxa are discussed. Both Ruppia species had a better development on soft mud than on sand and showed a decreased growth rate in water containing 18.5 Cl- compared with 3.5 Cl-. In 28 Cl-, only Ruppia cirrhosa survived, but little growth was observed. The similar reaction of the two species was rather surprising. The taxonomical characters proved to be very constant in the cultures. A principal difference in pollination mechanism between R. cirrhosa and R. maritima proved to exist: the pollination of R. cirrhosa takes place at the water surface; consequently, the peduncles have a length significantly related to water depth. R. maritima has an under-water pollination mechanism in which an air-bubble envelops the pistils; the pollen freed from the same inflorescence floats on the surface of the bubble and causes self-pollination. The characteristics of R. maritima var. brevirostris proved constant even after 2 subsequent generations cultivated from seeds. In a final evaluation, the importance of plant properties to the distribution and the strategy for survival of the Ruppia taxa is discussed. © 1979.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000308149

Recent views on evolutionary advantages and drawbacks of apomixis are surveyed. Gametophytic apomixis implies two main deviations from sexual reproduction: the formation of unreduced embryo?sacs, and the capacity of their egg cells for parthenogenetic development. Examples are discussed where either of these phenomena occur in sexual taxa.  The genetics of apospory has been elucidated in some cases. In Ranunculus auricomus and Panicum maximum, apospory is controlled by one pair of alleles, and is not recessive to sexuality. The mode of reproduction is influenced by the pollinator (cf. induced parthenogenesis in sexuals) and environmental factors, as well as by level of ploidy. Diploid?tetraploid?haploid (?diploid) cycles with alternations between apomixis and sexuality are known in grasses and in Potentilla. Crossing experiments between sexual crops and related apomicts have been performed, for instance between maize and Tripsacum dactyloides, and between sugar beet and Beta lomatogona. Attempts are made to select apomicts (partly following mutagen treatment) after cloning of vigorous but sterile hybrids between Festuca and Lolium species.

In regions where the disease is endemic, holdover cankers are the most important source of primary inoculum. Dissemination of primary inoculum occurs by rain or by crawling or flying insects. Often, blossoms infested with Erwinia atnylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al. provide secondary inoculum that is disseminated by pollinating insects or by rain. Later in the growing season, secondary inoculum produced in infected tissues may be disseminated by rain or by sucking and biting insects. Relatively rare sources of inoculum and inefficient means of dissemination may be responsible for introducing the pathogen to areas where fireblight has not been found previously. E. amylovora may be carried to new locations in intimate association with host tissues (infected nursery stock), in association with vectors (insects, birds or man), or by wind as strands or in airborne water drops. Every effort should be made to prevent introduction of E. amylovora into areas now thought to be free of fireblight. Attempts to eradicate the disease from several new areas in northern Europe have been unsuccessful. Because weather conditions and the host plants present in southern Europe are especially conducive to severe damage from fireblight, plant protection personnel are advised to prepare now for the possible introduction of disease. Personnel should be trained to recognize the disease and plans should be drawn to contain it or to manage host plants to minimize disease losses. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell.

Approximately 65% of the species in the community were found to be hermaphroditic; the frequencies of monoecious and dioecious species were 15% and 20% respectively. Controlled pollinations were made on 25 hermaphroditic species; self-incompatibility was found in 88% of these species. The self-incompatibility systems, however, broke down frequently either due to experimental techniques and/or due to inherent physiological-genetic factors. The majority of species appeared to display the gametophytic type of incompatibility system with pollen tubes from the self-pollen growing up to the ovules. Although the majority of tropical trees appear to be outcrossed, the possibility that they are inbred due to small effective population size remains to be eliminated. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001361055

Spring and summer are the main flowering periods, but many species flower in winter and examples are described. Of some 1800 indigenous species of flowering plants 1213% are dioecious, c. 2% gynodioecious, and 9% monoecious. But in many cases the unisexuality is characteristic of a widespread family or genus and cannot be claimed as having evolved in New Zealand. The morphological differentiation between male and female flowers settles down at a level characteristic of the genus and the degree of differentiation need not reflect the time since differentiation began. In hermaphrodite species heterostyly is not known, and demonstrated examples of self-sterility are few. A classification of 649 species with attractive flowers gives 60.6% white, 17.2% yellow, 12.4% blue lilac or dark purple, 5.7% red to crimson, and 4% green. A large sample from the British Isles has 25.1% white flowers. It is emphasised the flowers classified as white are rarely completely so, that a white plus yellow group is important, and that not all the flower colours need have evolved under New Zealand conditions. Nectar and honey-dew from native plants provide useful honey sources, but work on nectar has been confined to cases of bee poisoning. Available pollinators are birds (7 spp.), bats (1 sp.), butterflies (16 spp.), and solitary bees (c. 40 spp.) as well as many species of moths, beetles, and flies and several introduced bees. The general impression is of widespread self-fertility in hermaphrodite plants and variety in respect of insect visitors. It is emphasised that although much attention, everywhere, has been given to methods of pollination, more attention should be given to the results, i.e., the percentage of ovules which produce seeds. And it is also emphasised that a better understanding of the characteristics of New Zealand flowers will be obtained by studying their relatives in other lands. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001718009

The concentration of sugar in the nectars of unprotected flowers of several species was measured and did not reach the high values that would be in equilibrium with the daytime humidities recorded outside the corolla, although the sugar concentration was highly correlated with ambient relative humidity. This paper examines features that maintain low nectar sugar concentrations at low ambient humidities. Post?secretory changes in concentration are influenced to a small extent by nectar composition but depend largely on physico?chemical and microclimatic effects. Factors contributing to the maintenance of steep gradients in water activity between the nectar and the ambient air include corolla morphology, sugar concentration gradients and waterproofing lipid monolayers on the nectar surface. This paper considers the relative importance of such features in relation to the pollination syndrome. A simple technique is described for the measurement of intrafloral relative humidity.

The floral morphs differ reciprocally in stamen and style lengths. They often differ in pollen grain size and production, and may differ in pollen exine sculpturing, pollen colour, presence of starch in pollen, stigmatic papillae, or corolla size or morphology. There are two morphs in distylous plants and three morphs in tristylous plants. Distyly is much more common than tristyly. Tristyly is known to occur only in the Lythraceae, Oxalidaceae, and Pontederiaceae, although there are unconfirmed reports in the Connaraceae and in Hugonia of the Linaceae.In distylous plants the supergene determining floral morphology also controls a diallelic sporophytic self-incompatibility system, so that only pollinations between morphs are compatible. Tristylous plants usually possess a two-locus diallelic sporophytic self-incompati-bility system associated with the floral trimorphism, but whether or not a supergene is involved has not been demonstrated genetically.The functions of the various morphological components of the heterostylous syndrome are not well understood. The difference in style and stamen lengths in the morphs results in asymmetric pollen flow in heterostylous populations. In distylous species, the long-styled (pin) form has a higher rate of self pollination and captures more total pollen than the short-styled (thrum) form. Heterostyly does appear to increase disassortative pollination, as Darwin suggested, and may be selectively advantageous because it increases seed set in plants with diallelic self-incompatibility, where many of the plants in a population are cross-incompatible. Differences in pollen size, pollen production, and pollen storage products may have been selected to offset the effects of asymmetric pollen flow among forms, and/or to compensate for differences in style length. Current models suggest that diallelic self-incompatibility systems evolved before the morphological differences, and that the evolution of diallelic self-incompatibility may involve a functionally gynodioecious stage. Both distylous and tristylous systems have evolved into systems with greater inbreeding, by the loss of self-incompatibility, the production of homostyles, or the loss of one or more morphs from self-compatible populations. In addition, distylous systems have occasionally evolved into dioecism.© 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650121192

Each type of abnormality was also found in the foliage leaves at about a half the frequency in the cotyledons.

The frequencies of all the abnormalities except the morphological one were also examined in random mating populations in farmer's fields. The total frequency of homozygotes was very low, around 0.02-0.05% in the cotyledons and not much different in the foliage leaves, probably because the population sizes are large and breeding is by insect pollination.-Based on the frequencies of abnormalities in the inbreeding experiment and those in random mating populations, the mechanism whereby detrimental genes are maintained in buckwheat populations was discussed.

Crossing the F1 (S1.3) with an self-incompatible (SI) plant (S2.2) produced plants which were used for computation of a standard linkage test. An approximate map distance of 28 units was found between the S specificity locus and the major gene(s) which influenced its expression.

The fossil history of flowering plants has had little influence upon current concepts of primitive features of the flower. Several reproductive characters of non-angiospermous plants demonstrate the diversity of flower-like characters common to some extinct major groups of plants. Various Lower and Middle Cretaceous angiosperm reproductive structures illustrate the nature of the early receptacles, carpels and perianth parts. Pteridosperms (seed ferns), which bore separate clusters of ovules and microsporangia are considered a likely ancestral source of the angiosperms. Probable radiations of both diclinous (unisexual), mainly wind-pollinated, and monoclinous (bisexual), mainly insect-pollinated, lines are suggested for the ancestral flowering plants. The primitive flower types are thought to be quite simple with subsequent elaboration and other modifications of the flower, resulting from the adaptive ecological strategies of reproductive mechanisms through time. Insects have played a major role in floral evolution but not to the exclusion of ancient wind-pollinated forms. There have been major and minor shifts of the reproductive ecology in various groups of angiosperms so that the diverse flowers and fruits seen today are the product of reticulate patterns of evolution. © 1979.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848866100

The great majority of visits occurred between 9 and 14 h. Foraging bees exhibited floral preferences which changed during the day. Staminate flowers were relatively more attractive than pistillate for the greater part of most days, and this is probably related to the higher sugar concentration found in the nectar of staminate flowers. Bees spent almost twice as long per visit on a pistillate flower as on a staminate flower, which is correlated with the amount of nectar available. Except in early morning and late afternoon, the average time a bee spent on a flower decreased throughout the day. The average, 11.4 sec per flower visit, corresponds to a foraging rate of 5.3 flowers per min.

The patterns of the observed frequency of heterozygotes, compared with panmictic expectations adjusted only for inbreeding, are summarised for 23 outbreeding and 7 inbreeding plant species. There is a trend for outbreeders to show less heterozygosity than expected, and inbreeders to show more, despite the contrary evolutionary pressures on the mating system (the so-called heterozygosity paradox). An annual life cycle and pollination by animal vectors seem to increase the discrepancy in outbreeders. Of the several forces which might account for this paradox, the effects of intense microgeographic differentiation, of low gene flow, of self compatibility and of overdominance of linked segments are predominant. The evidence indicates that inbreeding plant species show more intense geographic and microgeographic differentiation, and more intense multilocus associations than outbreeders. Recent attempts to describe selection operating on variants by the analysis of life cycle components, of physiological processes, and of genetic demography are discussed. The fundamental importance of mating systems and their variation, as a distinctive feature of plant populations is already clear from the studies in hand. Therefore a closer integration of the joint microevolution of mating systems, and of genetic variation is required in both theoretical and experimental studies. © 1979.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3543036490

Muell by means of karyotype analysis of a sample of 191 native plants taken from 69 collection sites throughout the species range between Yanchep and Geraldton on the coastal sand plain north of Perth in Western Australia. Both polymorphic and polytypic variation occurred. Of the 42 haploid genomic combinations of chromosomes defined in this study, no less than 26 were found as heterozygotes only and were of localized occurrence. 16 stable genomes, occurring as homozygotes, generally had more extensive but polytypic distributions. Although pollen fertility in native plants was always found to be greater than 40%, and usually greater than 90%, synthetic crosses proved to be totally or almost completely pollen sterile. This is explained on the hypothesis that chromosome repatterning in this species is associated with the generation and modulation of recessive zygotic lethal systems which exist in locally coadapted combinations.

Various floral characters of the two morphs were measured, but differences were found only in height of stamens and stigma, and size of pollen. In studies with a scanning electron microscope (s.e.m.) pollen was discovered to have a continuous, equatorial girdle formed by the transverse furrows extending laterally from the ora. The stigmatic papillae were composed of a stalk with a many?armed crown. The ratio of number of thrum to pin plants was approximately 1:1 fulfilling theoretical expectations. Six different Bombus spp. and a specimen of Psithyrus bohemicus were observed as visitors to P. obscura, which displays a range of adaptations to Bombus pollination. Thirty per cent of the Bombus specimens had corbicular pollen loads, which were almost 100% pure Pulmonaria pollen. Pollen flow was revealed by analysing the pollen loads on stigmas and proboscides. Both stigma types had more illegitimate pollen than expected on the basis of the ratio of production of the two pollen types. This could be caused by a high degree of intrafloral pollen flow.

The losses of C1, Sh1, Wx on chromosome 9 were analyzed in detail. The results indicate frequent occurrence of interstitial chromosome deficiencies, although they have seldom been reported as yet with ultraviolet light. The points of breakage seemed to be nonrandomly distributed along the chromatid.

Embryos of the viviparous mutants of Zea mays do not undergo arrest but germinate directly on the ear. This study investigates the possibility that the mutants vp1, vp5, vp7, vp8, and vp9 are defective in some aspect of ABA action. Mutant and wild type embryos were removed from developing seeds at 18, 21, and 24 days after pollination and cultured aseptically on media containing a range of ABA concentrations. Seedlings were harvested after seven days when lengths and fresh and dry weights were recorded. The results indicate that these five viviparous mutants differ in their response to ABA. Two mutants, vp5 and vp8, exhibit the same sensitivity to growth inhibition by ABA as wild type. The remaining three mutants, however, manifest a range of decreased sensitivities with vp1 being the least sensitive, followed by vp7 and vp9.

Of these species, about 42% are outcrossed, 52% self-pollinated, and another 6% contain both sorts of breeding systems within a single species. In outcrossed species, the stigma is always elevated above the anthers at anthesis. The three principal modes of enforcing outcrossing are protandry, in Epilobium, Clarkia, and Lopezia (with protogyny in most species of Circaea); male sterility, independently derived in four small sections of Fuchsia; and genetic self-incompatibility, found in at least 76 species, representing 4 of the 7 tribes and 10 of the 17 genera of the family. Nearly all of the trees and shrubs in the family, but only about one third of the annuals and perennial herbs, are outcrossing. Clarkia is an example of an entirely annual genus that consists predominantly of outcrossing species, whereas Ludwigia and Epilobium are predominantly perennial genera that consist of a majority of self-pollinating species (and, in contrast to Clarkia, are largely polyploid). Less than one fifth of the trees, shrubs, and annuals in Onagraceae, but about 60% of the perennials, are polyploid. Aneuploid changes in chromosome number and the evolution of complex heterozygotes, the latter represented by 52 species of 4 different genera of the tribe Onagreae, take place largely among annual species in this family.Data summarised for the pollination systems of the approximately 283 modally outcrossing species of Onagraceae indicate that 37% of the species, representing 12 genera, are bee-pollinated; 31% bird-pollinated; 17% hawkmoth-pollinated; 7% pollinated by syrphid and tachinid flies; 6% noctuid-pollinated; and 0.4% (1 species: Clarkia concinna) by a combination of cyrtid flies and butterflies. No species is known to be modally pollinated by bats, by beetles, or by wind, and none has apomixis involving seeds, nor heterostyly. Some 22 individual shifts in pollination system would be sufficient to account for the evolution of the roughly 283 outcrossing species of the family, but an additional number of shifts probably involving at least 300 events would be necessary to account for the evolution of the 353 modally autogamous species. The repeated evolution of autogamy is clearly the most important evolutionary process involved in the multiplication of species of Onagraceae.© 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000396911

While quadrivalents and trivalents were commonly found in all the mutagenic treatments, hexavalents were seen in the gamma-ray treatment only. Ring quadrivalents were common in all the treatments and their frequency was higher in gamma-ray treatment than in the treatments with the chemical mutagens of which EI produced more quadrivalents than DES. The variety 'BIL3B' was more responsive to all the mutagens used than 'Tift-23B' in which, excepting in gamma-ray treatment, no multivalents were observed in EI and DES treatments. The quadrivalents induced by different mutagens were of different types involving different chromosomes, indicating some kind of specificity of the mutagens in causing chromosome breaks. Thus, in EI-induced quadrivalents the nucleolar chromosome, the shortest chromosome of the complement, was involved, whereas in the case of DES and gamma rays it was the longest chromosome of the complement that was involved in the quadrivalent. Apparently the breaks must have been produced in different chromosomes preferentially. Self-pollinated seeds of two heterozygotes whose interchanges were induced by EI and gamma rays were given a second cycle treatment with gamma rays, again at the LD50 dosage (35 kR), and interchange stocks involving different chromosomes, up to a maximum of eight chromosomes were realized. Alternate use of EI and gamma rays offered better possibilities of obtaining inter-change heterozygotes involving more, if not all, chromosomes in a ring than two successive treatments with gamma rays alone. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.",Interchange; Mutagens; Octovalent; Second cycle; Specificity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250261800

Adaptive radiation has created a wide range, from beetle-pollination with production of solid food bodies for the visitors to pollination by small Hymenoptera and syrphid flies with production of a pool of stigmatic fluid in which, on the first day of anthesis when the flower is functionally pistillate, pollinators drown. In the latter category, there is striking sophistication in the features that ensure proper deposition and germination of the pollen grains. In the tropical water lilies examined, the sugar level of the stigmatic fluid was 1%1.5% which is well below the threshold of perception for honeybees regardless of the nature of the sugar; fructose and glucose were present in roughly equal concentrations. In Nymphaea odorata, a temperate zone water lily, the sugar concentration was about 3%, a considerable part of which was sucrose; glucose and fructose were again present in almost equal concentrations. No obvious biological reasons for the difference in sugar composition and concentration can at present be identified. The ability of Nymphaea pollen to germinate in a fluid so close to pure water in composition must be considered exceptional. The high boron level in the stigmatic fluid, as well as the amounts of calcium, potassium and magnesium ions, are close to optimal for pollen germination. Chloride, present at a concentration several times higher than that of the surrounding pond water, is the most important anion. A number of free amino acids are present in very low concentration. The diurnal taxa examined opened and closed on at least three successive days. On the second and third days, the stamens form a protective cone over the central pool of stigmatic fluid, while the flowers are functionally staminate, shedding their pollen. Insect visitors collecting the latter can now come and go with impunity. However, on the basis of their first-day activities, the flowers must still be considered exploitative, rather than as partners in a mutually beneficial relationship with insects. © 1979 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002646275

This, and the size of the trees, pose obvious difficulties for the maintenance of pan-mixis, and tempt speculation on the processes by which such diversity has evolved and may now be favoured. Fedorov2 suggested that natural selection is low and self-pollination prevalent, favouring random genetic drift. Prevalence of random drift, or apomixis - agamospermy - would contradict Ashton's3 view that, given a stable environment, evolution proceeds through ecotypic differentiation while diversity accrues through ever increasing niche specialisation; for this view to be correct, maintenance of genetic variability within breeding groups would be essential. Solid evidence has been meagre but there is evidence4 that genetic polymorphism, and hence heterozygosity, is common in the emergent tree Shorea leprosula Miq., and Xerospermum intermedium Radlk., an understorey species. The pattern of spatial variation is consistent with the view that these species are outbreeders in which predominantly short-range pollen and fruit dispersal are accompanied by short-range heterogeneity in gene frequencies.

They were hand crossed in all possible combinations. Their compatibility was studied by the percentage of flowers forming pods and number of seeds per pod during crossing. The variances for GCA, SCA and reciprocal effects were significant for percentage of pod set with a narrow sense héritability of 64 %. This suggested maternal influence of clones on percent pod set, controlled primarily by additive genetic components. GCA was the only significant component for number of seeds per pod with a narrow sense heritability of 71%. There were wide differences between the clones in their relative magnitude of GCA, SCA and reciprocal effects for both traits used as compatibility indexes. Performance of the diallel crosses was judged by studying seed yield and its related characters, namely seeds per pod, dry matter per plant, frost resistance, plant vigor and plant height. Although GCA and SCA variances were significant for all characters, reciprocal differences in general were absent. The SCA values were very high as compared to GCA. Narrow sense heritability values were very low while broad sense heritability were much higher. This suggested that almost none of the variation was due to additive genetic components and all the variability is controlled by interactions of a digenic, trigenic and quadrigenic nature and heterzozygosity. Heterosis was evaluated by comparing the seed yield of single crosses with their mid-parent and high-parent, and very high values were observed. Thus selection of better genes may not be feasible and further improvement in selected clones may have to be brought about by utilization of various interactions and heterosis. An attempt was made to find combinations of characters that may be used for the selection of seed yield but none were found to be satisfactory. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Autogamous; Heritability; Heterosis; Medicago sativa; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005704507

Mutation frequency from Bz to bz was observed after harvest of F1 seeds. No clear difference in the mutation frequencies between single and fractionation series was observed. To investigate the effects of water content upon mutation frequency of neutron and gamma-rays, seeds heterozygous for the Yg2-gene were used. Moisture-stabilized (13%) seeds and seeds steeped in water for 24 hrs were exposed to neutrons or to gamma-rays, and mutation from Yg2 to yg2 was detected as color change green to yellow-green in the seedlings. In the gamma-ray treatments, the mutation frequency of wet seeds was about 1.5 times higher than that of corresponding lot of dry seeds. In the neutron treatment, on the other hand, no clear difference in frequency between wet and dry seeds was observed.

It is separated from the nucellus and embryo sac by layers of cuticle. The thickness, uniformity and continuity of cuticle is variable not only in diverse taxa but also at different places in the same species. The cuticular layers manifest interruptions, and the embryo sac wall bears certain ingrowths in the regions of these discontinuities. Ultrastructurally, the endothelial cells show characteristics of meristematic as well as secretory cells. Sometimes they develop wall projections and even contain multivesicular bodies. Large quantities of proteins, carbohydrates, ascorbic acid and some enzymes such as oxidative enzymes, amylases, proteases are also known to occur. Besides, a deposition of callose at the onset of pollination is recorded in Petunia. Proliferation of the integumentary tapetum in some hybrids results in seed abortion.

As additional thorough survey work is done, the exceptions become increasingly common and the generalizations are weakened. A methodological problem in flavonoid surveys concerns documenting the ""absence"" of particular compounds and the question of quantitative versus qualitative variation of certain constituents. Consideration of flavonoid biosynthesis suggests that simple genetic differences likely control the classes of compounds present and this in turn indicates that caution be used in placing phylogenetic significance on such differences. Features of floral morphology used in studying angiosperm phylogeny have a complex genetic-developmental basis as compared to the genetic factors governing the presence of various flavonoid classes. This ostensibly is an important factor in explaining why reversals in certain trends of floral morphology are rarely noted and why these features are usually constant at higher taxonomic levels. By contrast, variation of flavonoid classes (by virtue of the small genetic differences controlling the presence of different classes) occurs at lower taxonomic levels. Genetic and enzymological studies of flavonoid biosynthesis also indicate that a single compound may be synthesized via different pathways, and this has significant implications for the use of flavonoid distribution in a phylogenetic sense. Given similar selection pressures, the same compounds may arise independently in distantly related plants. Clearly, this has occurred with floral anthocyanidins, where the distribution of particular compounds is related to pollinators. Flavonoid compounds will continue to be useful systematically at the generic level or lower, and possibly at the familial level in some instances. However, studies of the genetics and enzymology of flavonoid compounds in different groups of plants are needed if flavonoids are to be employed in a phylogenetic or evolutionary sense at higher taxonomic levels in the angiosperms. Much additional work in the difficult area of flavonoid functions is to be desired. Many more investigations of comparative flavonoid chemistry of fossil and extant members of what are considered the same genus must be carried out if any appreciation of flavonoid change through evolutionary time is to be achieved. © 1978 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000094858

Each nectar-feeding bird has potential advantages and disadvantages as a pollen vector, related to its size, morphology, and foraging behavior. Which available bird is the optimal pollinator depends on the plant's growth habit, spatial distribution, and breeding system. The various adaptations shown by plants favoring one pollinator over another all revolve around the secretion of nectar and the manner of presenting it to the birds. However, other aspects of plant morphology, physiology, ecology, or life cycle may affect the production and presentation of nectar, and influence plant-pollinator coevolution.

Limited pollen tube growth down the style in reciprocal crosses led to reproductive isolation between the self-compatible P. parodii and self-incompatible P. inflata. The interspecific hybrid was successfully produced by bud-pollination of P. parodii with P. inflata as the male parent in 22 percent of attempts, but not in the opposite direction. In vitro pollination of P. parodii ovaries with P. inflata pollen also produced hybrids. The small size of the ovary made it technically impossible to use P. inflata as the female parent for in vitro pollination. The interspecific hybrids were intermediate, as compared to the two parents, for six of the seven plant and flower characters measured. Furthermore, the hybrids had high pollen fertility, set abundant seed upon self-pollination, and readily inter-crossed with the parental species. The results are consistent with a high degree of chromosomal homology in the parental species and with minor genetic divergency leading to reproductive isolation that is pre-zygotic in nature. Overcoming the barriers to cross-incompatibility by practical techniques resulted in fertile interspecific hybrids that segregated for parental characters. The potential value of employing the parental species in somatic hybridization experiments is discussed. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Bud-pollination; In vitro pollination; Petunia; Somatic hybridization; Unilateral cross-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0040140180

Energetic costs of maintenance, temperature regulation, foraging and reproduction increase in direct proportion to body mass raised to fractional exponents, which may vary from 0.5 to 1.0; overall costs probably vary with an exponent of 0.75. Avian nectarivores acquire most of their energy from flower nectar; in so doing they compete with other nectar feeders and pollinate plants. Larger pollinators are more reliable and move pollen greater distances, but to attract them plants must secrete more nectar and protect it from utilization by smaller animals. Minimum body size of avian nectarivores (2g) appears to reflect both competition with insects and the limited capacity of the smallest birds to acquire and store energy relative to the demands of fasting, temperature regulation, and reproduction. Hummingbirds have attained significantly smaller size than other nectar feeding birds because lower metabolic rates and use of hypothermic torpor reduce their energy expenditure relative to income. Maximum body size of avian nectarivores (approximately 80g) apparently reflects the upper limit of plant energy expenditure for reliable, long distance pollination. Between these limits, size variation reflects divergence to reduce interspecific competition and coevolution with plants to promote specificity. © 1978 American Society of Zoologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957209813

Phenotypic expressions within the population are shown to undergo abrupt transitions as a result of discontinuous fitness-functions. Evidence for rapid and abrupt phenotypic variation is explored by analyses of speciation (= origination) rates within the fossil record. In general, a high correlation exists among the area/volume changes of sedimentary rocks known for each geologic period and the apparent speciation rates seen in selected vascular/non-vascular plant groups. Regressions of speciation rates on rock area/volume plots indicate that the Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian show significant divergences (= residual) rates from predicted origination rates. The Cretaceous shows the highest residual value as a consequence of the rapid appearance of angiosperm fossils. A similar pattern in diversity changes for the mandibulate terrestrial invertebrates is also apparent. The coupled evolution of the angiosperms with specific insect groups appears to be the most tenable explanation for the residual Cretaceous origination rate of the former group. It is postulated that the angiospems have evolved in part as the result of a phytochemical cost-function such that phytophagous insects are warded off, while potential pollinators are favored. Quantitative/qualitative differences observed in the distribution of secondary metabolites may be evidence for coupled evolution. A ""predatorprey mediated co-existence"" between phytophagous insects and angiosperms may have served as a factor in allowing the co-existence of less than optimal plant species providing an impetus for relatively rapid speciation turnover. © 1978 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951512976

Thus, hummingbird pollinated species such as Ipomopsis aggregata generally contain pelargonidin sometimes with cyanidin, while bee and beefly pollinated species (e.g. Gilia latiflora) contain mainly delphinidin. On the other hand, lepidopteran species such as Leptodactylon californicum have cyanidin or mixtures of cyanidin with delphinidin. The above three anthocyanidins occur usually as the 3-glucoside, 3,5-diglucoside, 3-(p-coumarylglucoside) and 3-(p-coumarylglucoside)-5-glucoside, although other types are occasionally found. The distribution of glycosidic types and of acylation, unlike that of the anthocyanidins, is more closely correlated with systematic position than with pollinating vectors. In autogamous species where animal pollination is absent or unimportant, anthocyanin pigmentation in the flowers retains the complexity present in related animal-pollinated taxa. Anthocyanins were also identified in hummingbird pollinated plants from two related families and pelargonidin derivatives were detected. In Fouquieria splendens (Fouquieriaceae), the glycosidic pattern was different from that in Polemoniaceae in being 3-galactoside. In Penstemon (Scrophulariaceae) a study of flower anthocyanins was consistent with Straw's hypothesis that the wasp-pollinated P. spectabilis originated by hybridization between the hummingbird-pollinated P. centranthifolius and the bee-pollinated P. grinnellii. © 1978.","acylation with p-coumaric acid; Gilia; hummingbird pollination; Ipomopsis; Leptodactylon; pelargonidin, cyanidin and delphinidin glycosides; plant systematics; Polemoniaceae; pollination ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002627676

However, the taxonomic and phyletic relationships within and between these genera have been based strictly on floral morphology and may simply reflect the primary pollinators of these genera [4,5]. The flavonoid chemistry of eight species in three of the four genera, Rigidella, Sessilanthera and Fosteria, was investigated as part of a systematic study of Tigrideae.

In nearly 400 genera in 65 plant families, the anthers dehisce by means of short apical slits or true pores. In these forms, the small light pollen can only be efficiently released by native bees capable of vibrating these stamens. This intrafloral behavior propels pollen out of the pores striking the bees on their venters. It is then collected for use in larval cell provisions. Aspects of the historical development of this novel pollination syndrome, known as ""buzz"" or vibratile (equals vibrational) pollination, are presented including a discussion and figures of a poricidal anther, a buzzing bee and the model system. A biophysical model for the pollen/locule wall interactions resulting in pollen expulsion upon bee or artificial vibration is developed. The model was created with the morphology of anthers of Solanum (Solanaceae) in mind, but the results obtained are generally applicable to any apically dehiscent flower which is vibrated by bees to release pollen. The anthers were modeled as a tall rectangular box with an apical pore and containing numerous small particles. As the box vibrates, particles striking the walls rebound elastically. If a pollen grain strikes a receding wall, it loses energy. If a grain strikes an advancing wall, it gains energy in the collision. In each oscillation, there is a net gain in the energy of the particles. As the anther (box) is shaken, vibrational energy is transmitted from the pterothorax of the bees to the flower, the pollen grains gaining significant energy. As the energy increases and the particles begin to move about more and more vigorously, they will begin to escape through the hole in the box (or stamina] pore). The rate at which particles leave the box and time required to empty the box are calculated as functions of the geometry of the model system and the frequency of vibration. In order to test the influence of air currents, Bernolli effects and viscous drag, the flowers were mecahnically vibrated in vacuum. The pollen cloud thus produced was virtually unchanged ans so it seems unlikely that air plays any significant role in the phenomenon of vibrational pollen release. Finally, variables such as: inelastic interactions, electrostatic forces, slightly sticky pollen due to presence of ""pollenkitt"", duration and types of bee buzzes are discussed in relation to the mathematical model presented. © 1978.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0017819554

Varieties that are resistant when first released often become susceptible later due to the spread of previously undetected races but the time taken for this to occur in very variable. It often occurs so rapidly as to curtail the commercial use of otherwise satisfactory varieties. Some varieties, however, are widely grown for many years and remain adequately resistant to the prevalent rust diseases. They may aptly be described as having durable resistance. This durable or long-lasting resistance can be detected without any assumptions about, or detailed knowledge of, whether durability depends on any particular mechanisms of resistance, on various degrees of racespecificity or on many or few genes. Cappelle-Desprez is given as an example of a wheat variety with durable resistance to yellow rust. The most powerful test for the detection of durable resistance occurs when a variety is widely grown commercially for several years. A much weaker test is obtained by growing varieties in small disease nursery plots even when the test is repeated for several years. Usually, resistance which is durable is also partial or incomplete. Often, however, partial resistance of wheat to yellow rust has not been durable. Thus the observation that resistance is partial is not, of itself, a satisfactory criterion for the detection of durable resistance. It is suggested that the most obvious sources of durable resistance for use in breeding programmes are varieties which have been widely grown and have displayed this character. The transfer of such resistance during breeding may be achieved if the creation or incorporation of higher levels of resistance that have not been tested for durability is avoided. It should then be possible to derive resistance from the durably. resistant parent. Methods of achieving this are discussed. © 1978 H.

Four variety hybrids, BSSS(R)CO x BSCB1(R)CO, BSSS(R)C7 x BSCB1(R)C7 [from a reciprocal recurrent selection program involving Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS) and Iowa Corn Borer Synthetic #1 (BSCB1)], BS12CO x B14A, and BS12C6 x B14A [from a half-sib selection program involving the open-pollinated variety Alph (BS12) and the inbred tester B14A] were grown at 59 300 and 98 800 plants/ha near Ames, Iowa We obtained data on CO2-exchange rate (an estimate of photosynthetic rate), grain yield, grain-yield components, flowering dates, maturity traits, light interception and use, shelling percentage, harvest index, and various other plant traits. CO2-exchange rate did not change appreciably with recurrent selection for yield. Grain yield per hectare and per plant were larger for the improved than unimproved hybrids. Grain-yield components did not change significantly with recurrent selection. Kernel weight of BSSS(R)C7 x BSCB1 (R)C7, however, was larger than that of BSSS(R)C0 x BSCB1(R)C0. Pollen-shed-to-silking interval was shorter for the improved than the unimproved hybrids, and grain-filling duration was longer in C7 x C7 than in C0 x C0 of the reciprocal recurrent selection program. Furthermore, improved hybrids were characterized by smaller tassels and more upright canopies. Usually, plant traits and leaf-area-related traits were similar for all hybiids. Although dry-matter productivity was similar for all hybrids, those that were improved by recurrent selection produced more grain per unit leaf area and per unit light interception. Also, BS12C6 x B14A was characterized by a higher harvest index than BS12CO x B14A. We concluded that the source (i.e., photosynthetic capacity) was not limiting grain yield in BSSS(R) x BSCB1(R) and BS12. Increased grain yields that resulted from recurrent selection were consequences of longer grain-filling duration for BSSS(R) x BSCB1(R) and increased translocation of photosynthate from source to sink for both BSSS(R) x BSCB1(R) and BS12. © 1978 H.

Merr. Comparisons were made between the average numbers of pollen grains and the average numbers of coenocytic microspores with respect to environment where plants were grown and to stamen position in the flower. Five male sterile lines were used. They included the North Carolina ms1 mutant, the cultivar Hark with the ms1 gene, and mutants identified as the Urbana, Tonica, and Ames male steriles. Three environments used were the Agronomy Farm, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia; the Agronomy and Agricultural Engineering Research Center, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa; and the Agronomy Greenhouse, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa. Pollen production from fertile plants varied from 374 to 760 pollen grains per anther among genetic lines and environments. This variation may be an important consideration in selecting a male parent to use as a pollinator for hybrid seed production. Among fertile plants, the average numbers of pollen grains per anther of the separate stamen and and of the lower whorl of stamens were significantly different only in greenhouse-grown plants. Among male sterile plants, the average numbers of coenocytic microspores per anther of the separate stamen and of the lower whorl of stamens were significantly different in three genotype x environment combinations. These three exceptions did not conform to any genetic or environmental pattern. Deviations from the expected ratio of 4 pollen grains from fertile plants: 1 coenocytic microspore from sterile plants were attributed to initial differences in the average number of microspore mother cells between the two genotypes. © 1978 H.

Complex gene interactions were considered to be responsible. The characteristics of the method of assessment used and the relationship between self- and outcross seed production are discussed. It appears unlikely that the component lines could be selected for reduced self seed set, but selection for higher outcross seed set may be possible. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica oleracea; Partial self-compatibility; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2142786901

The first influence is demonstrated by reduced pollen tube growth rates when pollen grains are few in number. This may indicate direct effects of pollen tubes upon the stylar tissues or perhaps more complex interactions between pollen and style. The second and potentially more important influence of limited pollination is upon the progeny. This was demonstrated with studies on three species. In each case, variation among the resultant plants was greater when pollen was limited than when normal, that is excessive, pollen was used. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not certain, but our data indicate that it is not simply an artefact of variation in seed size. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Fertilization; Pollen quantity; Pollen tubes; Progeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002290008

Ear-to-row selection was effective in improving 'Kitale Composite A' (KCA). Data from a diallel of the cycle-6 ear-to-row substrains showed that where less than 10 lines were selected, inbreeding appeared to depress gain, but differences among the various ear-to-row experiments were not significant. Intererossing the substrains was predicted to reduce the effect of inbreeding. Yield gains in reciprocal recurrent selection and ear-to-row selection were associated with increases in ears per 100 plants. The reciprocal recurrent selection variety cross yield gain was estimated at 3.5% per year (7%/cycle) and that of the best ear-to-row procedure at 2.6% per year. The variety cross syn-2 from reciprocal recurrent selection was predicted to improve at the same rate as the best ear-to-row procedure (E7) with one long growing season per year. Under a cropping system with two similar seasons per year, however, ear-to-row selection should be more effective than reciprocal recurrent selection or its derived syn-2. Mass selection at 10% selection intensity produced significant improvement, but not at 2% selection intensity. S1 and three half-sib selection methods were ineffective in KCA. Inbreeding and the lack of linkage equilibrium in KCA were discussed as contributing. Theoretical substrain compositing required 30 to 40 lines selected to equal the effectiveness of ear-to-row selection with 10 lines. Full-sib selection was effective in improving yield at 1.2% per year. All the recurrent selection methods showed a significant increase in ears per 100 plants. Population size was shown to be important in reducing losses due to inbreeding. If a hybrid or variety cross is potentially useable, reciprocal recurrent selection provides the best population approach. Initially, the variety cross syn-2 could be released with no additional breeding effort. Transition to variety crosses or traditional hybrids from extracted lines could be done as farmer husbandry improves and seed production facilities develop. Otherwise, open-pollinated varieties superior to existing maizes can be effectively developed using ear-to-row selection. The other methods may be effective in breeding populations when larger effective population sizes are used, but they were not effective in KCA when only 10 lines were recombined each cycle. © 1978 H.

The species with cleistogamous (closed) flowers produce far less pollen of more variable average diameters than the species with chasmogamous (open) flowers. Pollen grains of P. lanceolata captured by stigmas of female plants were smaller than a general sample of pollen collected from the anthers of perfect plants, indicating that large pollen grains are not as effective as small grains in wind dispersal. The rapid decrease in pollen density on the stigmas of P. lanceolata with increasing distances from the pollen sources suggests that plants of this self?incompatible species must produce great amounts of pollen in order to pollinate nearby plants. The cost of this high pollen production associated with wind pollination can be seen in P. lanceolata in the increased production of reproductive tissue and larger seeds in female plants when compared with normal plants.

Don and A. humilis Lindl in the shire cemetery at Gingin, W.A. Differences in phenology, nectar production, stem height and floral dimensions between F1 hybrids and the two parental Anigozanthos species were also documented to assess their influence on foraging behaviour and interspecific pollen flow. The red wattlebirds showed a 97 % fidelity for A. humilis at its seasonal peak in August 1976 and, a month later, an equally strong fidelity (97 %) for A. manglesii at its seasonal peak. Interspecific foraging movements constituted only 1.2% of the total of 925 observed during these two study periods. The spatial distribution of flowering individuals and plant stature appeared to be principal factors determining assortative pollination, presumably because of their influence on the energetics of foraging. It is suggested that the observed nearest-neighbour foraging pattern results in spatial restrictions on pollen flow and may be responsible for the confinement of hybrids to ecotonal zones where the parental species grow intermixed. Gene exchange between species is also restricted by differences in pollen deposition/retrieval sites arising from the divergent floral structures of A. hurnilis and A. rnanglesii.

In the untreated area, Wasmannia rochai Ford formed 22% of the ants collected and Brachymyrmex pictus Mayr, Crernatogaster ? parabiotica Forel, Iridomyrmex sp., Pheidole sp. and Solenopsis sp., a further 48%, whereas in the treated area, 47% were C. parabiotica, 14% W. rochai and 9% B. heeri Forel. There was evidence of a mosaic distribution pattern for the ant species. No cocoa pollen was found on any of the insects collected. Total pollination ranged between 7Â·4 and 8Â·1 % and effective pollination between 3Â·7 and 2Â·8 % in the treated and untreated areas, respectively. Approximately 76% of the pollen masses were stylar, with 38% of the ball type and 54% of the smear type, whereas the 16% stigmatic pollen masses consisted of 63% ball and 29% smear types; 44% of the stigmatic pollinations were effective, compared with only 33 % of the stylar ones. Some quadrats were more attractive to pollinators than others, and there was a significant positive correlation between percentage effective pollination and insolation, probably due to the favourable effect of sunshine on Forcipomyia activity. © 1978, Cambridge University Press.

The substance that induces pollen germination in the stigmatal extract is water?soluble and heat?stable. Crosses could not be achieved between chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers because of structural incompatibility. Pollinated pistils of chasmogamous flowers release a large amount of ethylene. The burst of ethylene release is due to an interaction between pollen tubes and stylar tissue and is directly proportional to the quantity of pollen placed on the stigma. Cleistogamous flower buds also produce a burst of ethylene at the time of pollination within the closed flower. The ethylene release may be a cause of reduced corolla development associated with cleistogamous flowers. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981671309

Early successional species may not experience consistent, strong selection against competition and can be expected to have broader niches with more overlap than later successional species. This paper presents data from 2 early successional winter annuals that show clear niche separation under conditions in which coevolution is unlikely. Lactuca scariola L. and Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers. flower in mid-summer and attract the same insect visitors. Erigeron, the more common species, begins to flower in mid-morning when insect visitors are quite active. Lactuca flowers open earlier in the morning and close just before Erigeron flowers open. The early morning hours are not optimum for Lactuca visitation, as most of the visits occur just before floral closing. Both species can selffertilize without a vector, and Lactuca was introduced from Europe. It is, therefore, not possible that niche separation inflowering time and subsequent time of visit in Erigeron and Lactuca is a result of coevolutionary niche differentiation between the two species. This separation is likely to be a preadaptation resulting from coevolution with other species. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011394028

Massachusetts, Amherst, Mass. 01003, United States","Many flowering plants are unable to set seeds with their own pollen because a system known as gametophytic self-incompatibility is operating. The basis of this system is a single multiallelic locus S, and if the S allele carried by a pollen grain matches one of the two S alleles carried in the style, as it is certain to do upon self-pollination, then pollen tube growth is inhibited. Should one of the self-pollen grains carry a mutated S allele, however, it would not match either of those carried in the style and would therefore, not be inhibited. Gametophytic self-incompatibility thus provides a mechanism for discriminating between such mutant and nonmutant pollen grains. Knowing the numbers of pollen grains available to the stigma, and also the numbers of seeds produced, it becomes possible to estimate the frequency with which mutations occur at the S locus. Assay systems of mutagenesis which employ gametophytic self incompatibility will allow very large numbers of pollen grains to be screened for S allele mutants, which should indicate the mutagenicity of the environment. These systems have the added benefit that screening is done by the stylar tissues, rather than technicians. Finally, they may be used to construct largely autonomous assay systems which would provide continuous monitoring of the environment.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018195753

Long-term effects were investigated by comparing late summer Bombus population densities among sites representing various spray histories. For all species combined, abundances in unsprayed areas averaged 3 times higher than in fenitrothion treated areas. Population recovery appeared to be complete within a few years after discontinuation of spraying. Foraging performance by laboratory reared colonies was significantly higher in sprayed areas with reduced bee populations than in a control area, possibly because of relaxation of competitive stress. The diversity of plant species used for pollen collection was nearly twice as great in the control as compared with sprayed areas, suggesting that the effect of fenitrothion spraying on cross-pollination may be greatest for plants which are subdominant in the hierarchy of bee preference.

Individual population estimates varied from 0 to 9.6 per cent outcrossing. The overall average was 1.6 per cent, with a 95 per cent confidence range of 0.8-2.7 per cent. The evidence indicated that outcrossing was significantly higher in populations growing in the more mesic (2.1 percent), than in the xeric regions (0.4 per cent). The average frequency of multilocus homozygosity for the 22 loci was 0.963 which was in agreement with the level expected under the observed high rate of self-fertilisation, indicating no heterozygous excess. However, the heterozygotes encountered, displayed a very high degree of multiple heterozygosity which arises from extensive gametic phase (or linkage) disequilibrium. In general, these results do not support the contention that the bulk of the genetic polymorphism found in H. spontaneum in Israel has arisen in recent times by periodic introgression from cultivated barley (H. vulgare L.). Rather they indicate that extensive genetic polymorphisms probably predates the domestication of the crop, and is maintained independently of introgression. © 1978 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966144261

Two classes of models of partial assortative mating mediated by a multiallele trait are studied. The first involves two phenotypic assorting classes determined by the level of heterozygosity, and the second assorting grouping specifies each genotype as a separate phenotype. It is established that increased allelism facilitates the existence and stability nature of central polymorphic states, although the rate of approach is diminished. The nature of the equilibrium realizations is determined by a balance in the intensity differential between homozygote and heterozygote assorting rates against the relative viability forces acting between the phenotype classes. As in the case of two alleles there is possible simultaneous stability of fixation outcomes and a central polymorphism. Increased allelism allows more scope for these more complex multiple stability contingencies. © 1978.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018213949

Features of the floral morphology of W. paniculata suggest that it is pollinated by a large?bodied insect, possibly Xylocopa. The dimorphism in the position of anthers and stigmas probably increases the level of intermorph pollination. The low sugar concentration of the nectar, low pollen production per flower, and few flowers per plant also probably result in pollinators visiting more than one plant during their foraging activities, thus reinforcing the floral dimorphism and increasing the opportunities for intermorph pollination.

Attention was restricted to plants which have flowers arranged on vertical inflorescences and to the bumblebees which visit these plants. It was found that the bumblebees tend to commence foraging at the bottom of each infloresence, that they tend to move from one flower to the closest vertically higher flower, that they miss flowers as they move upwards and that they tend to leave each inflorescence before reaching the top. It was also found for the four common plant species considered that nectar abundance per flower decreases with flower height on an inflorescence, that the flowers with receptive stigmas are restricted to the bottoms of the inflorescences while the flowers shedding pollen occur above them, and that the flowers are arranged approximately in spirals on the inflorescences. The pattern of movements of the bumblebees and the various properties of the plants appear to represent coevolved adaptations. Furthermore the bumblebees' movement patterns appear to be optimal in the sense that they result in the maximum net rate of energy gain to the bumblebees. Further studies are necessary, however, to determine whether or not the plants can be considered to be optimal. An exception to the above scheme is provided by a plant which is quite uncommon in the study area. This plant also has flowers on vertical inflorescences and appears to be pollinated by bumblebees. However, while the pattern of movements of the bumblebees on this plant species are extremely similar to those on the four common species, this plant species exhibits quite different properties from the other four.

Traces of oil were detectable in cypsela (seed) almost immediately after pollination. Much of this appeared to be present in the hull (pericarp), which is well developed at this stage. Significant production of oil commenced with the development of the embryo about 150 day-degrees after pollination, and the oil content reached a maximum value just prior to physiological maturity of the seed. Linoleic acid constituted the major component of the oil at all stages of seed development, and under favourable temperature conditions increased from c. 50% soon after pollination to over 70% at physiological maturity. High temperature during the development of the seed was associated with a reduction in total oil yield. However, under field conditions this effect was variable owing to confounding with other environmental factors such as moisture stress, which also influence the yield of oil through their effects on growth and development of seed. Elevated temperatures, and in particularly high night temperatures, caused a marked reduction in the percentage of linoleic acid, apparently due to the effect of temperature on the activity of the desaturase enzymes which are responsible for the conversion of oleic to linoleic acid. These results support the hypothesis that reduced yields and altered composition of sunflower oil from crops matured under high temperature conditions in midsummer are due to the effects of heat stress on the biosynthesis of fatty acids. © 1978, CSIRO.

Inhabitation of the short?styled flowers by the wasp Blastophaga psenes L. not only transformed the flower ovary into a gall and induced the development of parthenogenetic endosperm, but also exerted a significant influence on the development of the fruit.

Interspecific pollen transfer led to strong competitive effects when availabilities of pollen, receptive stigma surfaces, or pollinator movements were limited relative to the total number of fertilizations possible in the mixed population. Results from simulations suggest that competition for pollination through interspecific pollen transfer can result in rapid exclusion of one of two species, and that such competition represents a selective force promoting stable divergence of potential competitors in habitat affinity, flowering time, or other characteristics related to pollinator sharing. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000660734

Numerous samples have been collected in the French Mediterranean region and the percentage of mS varies from 5 to 95% in different populations. By studying environmental conditionsthe area covered at ground level by vegetation, stones and rockshigh percentages of mS are found to be related to a high vegetation cover and an absence or a scarcity of stones. Grasslands and old fields favour mS, while rocky sites favour mF. This relationship, which has been found both on the plains and on a mountain, is related to the most important reproductive characteristics of T. vulgarisgenetic control of male sterility, mode of pollination, percentage of selling and seed production. These relationships agree with the assumption that unstable environmental conditions such as grasslands or old fields in southern France favour maximum seed production and outcrossing. The greater stability of uncultivated areas such as rocky sites allows for the maintenance of autogamy. Consequently, it is natural selection which adjusts the percentage of male sterility in natural populations of Thymus vulgaris. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.

Self-pollination of a long-styled form resulted in 94.3% capsule set with pollen from mid level anthers, whereas only 12.2% of flowers pollinated with pollen from short level anthers produced capsules. A semi-homostylous race of E. azurea from Costa Rica is self-compatible, autogamous and possesses dimorphic pollen. E. azurea is similar to E. crassipes (Mart.)

(1) Degeneration of the embryosac cell (1.4% per all ovules), (2) abnormal female gametophyte that appears at an early free nuclear stage (3.4%), (3) degeneration of the female gametophyte at the last free nuclear stage (11.4%), (4) abnormal female gametophyte that appears at the last stage of development (21.5%).

In unpollinated ovules, the integument developed normally, but the female gametophyte degenerated after the time of fertilization. The type of sterile seed depends on the stage of degeneration of the female gametophyte.

Beekeeping Unit, Luddington EHS, ADAS, Stratford-on-Avon, United Kingdom; Walker, J., Nat. Beekeeping Unit, Luddington EHS, ADAS, Stratford-on-Avon, United Kingdom","Honeybees are a particularly useful species for studying side effects of pesticides because most colonies are under fairly constant observation and their death or changes in behaviour are likely to be readily noticed. Although estimates of colony numbers are approximate, they are often more accurate than those of other insects that may be equally beneficial and that may be studied. Many conclusions from studies of honeybees may apply to other pollinating insects. At Rothamsted three techniques are used to obtain information about pesticide poisoning of honeybees and its avoidance: laboratory assessment of acute toxicity of unformulated pesticides; field evaluation of the toxicity of formulations applied to crops when bees are foraging and therefore at risk; investigation of samples of bees thought by bee keepers to have been poisoned. Investigations under the first two headings have yielded much valuable information and enabled us to devise standard test procedures which are now incorporated in the Pesticides Approval Scheme of the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) for the registration of pesticide products. The third technique has proved the most useful for assessing actual hazard in practice. The accumulation of data from the three sources described has enabled identification of the principal dangers to honeybees from the use of modern pesticides in England and Wales, to monitor the effects of change in agricultural practice and to make recommendations for the protection of honeybees. Results of the laboratory and field studies agree well with data obtained from poisoning incidents; the former therefore seem valuable for a preliminary assessment of the potential hazard of proposed treatments with new pesticides in situations where bees may be atrisk. Experience has shown that honeybees from different sources vary little in their response to insecticides. Honeybee poisoning and the suggested preventive measures are discussed separately for each type of insecticide application. The injudicious use of insecticides can cause financial loss to beekeepers, but insecticides are an essential part of maximum food production and their absence would make some crops uneconomic. Unless beekeepers accept this fact and contractors and farmers recognise their responsibility to preserve beneficial insects, attempts to establish cooperation between them will be counter-productive. As well as attempting to bring farmer and beekeeper closer together, the aim must be either to keep the insecticide and the bee apart or to use a selective chemical with low toxicity to honeybees.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018117725

From 87 volunteers with a history of both spring and fall hay fever, 42 patients with evidence of strong sensitivity by basophil histamine release to both ragweed pollen and mixed grass pollen extracts were selected for study. On the basis of the histamine release data, the patients were divided into two groups matched for sensitivity to both grass and ragweed pollens. In 1970, May and June symptom diaries showed the two groups to suffer quite similar severity of symptoms during the grass pollination season. One group of patients was started on a preseasonal course of immunotherapy with alum-precipitated aqueous extract of ragweed pollen while the other group received placebos containing histamine. By fall there had been a considerable rise in IgG-blocking antibodies to ragweed in the treated group. Symptom diaries in August and September showed that the treated group showed significantly less severe symptoms than the placebo group. Both groups received booster injections at 2-wk intervals from the fall of 1970 to the fall of 1971. Doses in the treated group were raised to attempt to administer the largest possible dose. Again there was no difference in the symptoms reported by the two groups during the grass pollination season, but an even greater difference emerged between the two groups during the ragweed season. The following year 1972 the same results were obtained. These data demonstrate that treatment with ragweed pollen extracts has little or no effect on grass pollen symptoms and confirm that immunotherapy is clinically as well as immunologically specific. Antibody responses to the second year of high-dosage booster injections was not greater than responses to a comparatively short preseasonal course given the first year. © 1978.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018104843

The reciprocal recurrent selection breeding method is designed to aid in simultaneously selecting for both types of gene action and requires that plants be both crossed and selfed. For adaptation of this method to sugarbeet, some modification is necessary, because the sugarbeet is normally cross-pollinated and is very difficult to emasculate. Incorporation of the self-fertile gene, Sf (dominant), and the male-sterile gene, a1 (recessive), makes this method useful for sugarbeet improvement. The biennial nature of sugarbeet necessitates a five-year selection cycle. This method incorporates selection for root yield, sugar percent, disease resistance, and ""O"" type. The amount of material tested for combining ability for yield is reduced to a workable level by selecting for additive, highly heritable traits in the early phases.

In contrast, it was found that the first lipid droplets appear (about 12-14 d after pollination) in the ground cytoplasm near the surface of plastids. Subsequently these nascent lipid droplets, which lack any detectable boundary structure at this stage, become encircled by a cisterna of rough endoplasmic reticulum. At the same time an osmiophilic coat of about 3 nm thickness becomes detectable at the lipid/water interface. In the cotyledon cells of germinating seedlings a centrifugally moving front of fat degradation moves from the central vacuoles(s) towards the cell periphery, leaving behind collapsed coats of oleosomes which are depleted of their lipid contents (saccules). Although saccules appear tripartite in cross section, they are structurally different from endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The oleosome coats can be isolated from oleosome preparations by extracting lipids with organic solvents. The coat material is insoluble in detergents like Triton X-100 or deoxycholate and shows a tripartite, lamellar structure (similar to collapsed saccules) under the electron microscope. Upon dissolution with dodecylsulfate, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a polypeptide composition (9 major bands) which is qualitatively different from that of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Also the buoyant densities of defatted oleosome coats and defatted endoplasmic reticulum membranes are very different. It is concluded that oleosome lipids accumulate in the ground cytoplasm and are bounded by a lamellar structure originating de novo from proteinaceous elements synthesized by specific regions of the endoplasmic reticulum. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Embryogenesis; Lipid bodies; Oleosomes; Sinapis; Spherosomes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002643372

Optimum temperatures with differences for day and night, high light intensity, sufficient aeration, and low planting density are key points in the development of a Si deficiency. Symptoms of Si deficiency may be summarized as follows: 1) The deficiency symptoms appear after the first bud flowering stage. 2) The leaflets of the new leaves showed malformations such as curving to the outside, warping, hardening, and sometimes thickening. 3) The growing poillt at the top was retarded in development, but did not die back as with boron deficiency. 4) The leaves were slightly yellowed, and necrotic spots appeared on the lower leaves; these spots generally spread upwards to the upper leaves. 5) In severe cases, the plant began to dry up from the lower leaves upward. 6) The silicon-free cultured plants can bloom, but often fail to pollinate; often they bear malformed fruit or no fruit. 7) The appearance (color, shape etc.) of the roots are normal. 8) Silicon-free plants already showing deficiency symptoms developed normal shoots after silicon was supplied, while silicon applied plants growing normally, developed deficiency symptoms when they were given silicon-free treatment in the flowering stage. 9) Si deficiency symptoms increased by long-day treatment and decreased by short-day treatment. From these results, we conclude that silicon has an effect on the reproductive growth of the tomato plant. © 1978 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",Degenerate anther; Si deficiency; Sterile pollen; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001127873

Counc., Ottawa, Ontario K1A OR6, Canada","Chlorpyrifos (0,0 diethyl 0 (3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridyl) phosphorothioate) is a broad spectrum insecticide registered in Canada for control of mosquito and agricultural pests including bertha armyworms, cutworms, root maggots, and chinch bugs. Of particular concern in assessing the impact of chlorpyrifos on terrestrial ecosystems will be its overall effect on beneficial insects, e.g. pollinators, and possibly small birds. There are insufficient data to evaluate the impact, especially over the long term, of this insecticide in situations where the possibility of recovery of severely affected populations through recolonization is precluded. Such situations are likely to be encountered when large portions of natural ecosystems are treated. This gap in available information is not unique to chlorpyrifos. It has been identified in the analysis of the impact of each of the other pesticides studied in this monograph series and most likely reflects the state of the art of ecotoxicology today. Chlorpyrifos is known to be highly toxic to aquatic organisms. The manufacturer and registration authorities have concerned themselves, by means of restrictive labelling, with limiting the potential impact of accidental or deliberate introduction of this insecticide to streams, lakes and ponds. Some beneficial invertebrates and fish are affected at the rates used for mosquito control (0.014 to 0.056 kg ai/ha). The authors found that the studies on the dynamics of chlorpyrifos in aquatic systems were sufficiently detailed to indicate that useful predictive correlations of residues and toxicity might be developed to interrelate the application rate with the risk of direct fish kills. However, if chlorpyrifos is applied to a significant portion of an economically important aquatic ecosystem there is currently not enough information available to permit adequate assessment of the long term consequences on community recoverability and fish production.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018176970

From theoretical considerations it was expected that: a) with the random matings of lines In, (obtained by self-pollination of n generations), some lines would be cross-incompatible (all the plants within these lines would be homozygous for S-genes) and the rest would be cross-compatible (retain heterozygosity for one or more S-genes); b) in the case of random matings of Unes InGm (obtained by self-pollination of n generations and by random pollination for m generations), some lines would be cross-incompatible (heterozygous for one S-gene) and the rest would be cross-compatible (retain heterozygosity for two or more S-genes); c) the relative proportion of sterile plants, obtained by random pollination of cross-compatible lines, would be related to the number of segregating S-loci and to the generation in which the lines are studied. Forty-four inbred lines of sugar beet derived from self-incompatible plants of a population were analysed. Comparisons of the observed values with the theoretically expected ones demonstrated that: a) of 18 In (I1-I4) lines, 6 were cross-incompatible (homozygous for S-genes) and 12 were cross-compatible having one S-locus segregating in 7 lines and two S-loci segregating in 5 lines; b) of 22 InG1 (I2G1 and I3G1) lines, one line was self-fertile, 7 lines were cross-incompatible (heterozygous for one S-loci) and 14 lines were cross-compatible (heterozygous for two S-loci). No line was found to have three or more segregating S-loci. The results of this population genetics analysis of self- and cross-incompatibility in sugar beet comply with diallel analysis data on sugar beet incompatibility and indicates that it is under the gametophytic control of two basic S-loci. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.",Betavulgaris L.; Gametophytic control; Genetic analysis; Incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008285308

In those fruits the incipient recovery from wilting, an increase in volume and a decrease in specific gravity, coincided. Parthenocarpic fruits showed an increase in volume at almost the same rate in any transverse quarter of a fruit, in contrast to the pollinated ones in which the most distal quarter enlarged more than the other parts.

Six stages of flower development were defined, covering the period from flower opening to withering of the style. Regular counts were made in the 1976 season of the total number of flowers at each stage during the flowering of twenty?nine umbels representing four cultivars and six inbred lines. The pattern of flowering was similar in all cases, although the number of flowers per head varied from 126 to 681. At first the number of flowers opening was small, but rapidly increased, giving a peak, which lasted for a mean of 410 days. During the middle of the peak flowering period the maximum number of flowers open at one time was often more than 50% of the total flowers on the head. A particular flower could not easily be pollinated with its own pollen because the stigma did not become receptive until about 23 days after the anthers had started to dehisce. Protandry was not considered to be effective in preventing pollination between flowers on a single umbel because there was abundant pollen available from the time the first stigmas became receptive, almost until the end of flowering. Other factors which may account for high out?crossing rates in onions are discussed. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000397666

The low germination at 0% RH was completely restored after transfer to 100% RH. Germination in medium decreased with increasing X-ray exposures between 0 and 400 kR. This decrease was caused by pollen rupture. No in vitro germination occurred at exposures of 400 kR and more. The radiosensitivity of pollen in vitro was minimal at 80% RH. Transfer of pollen to the stigma post-X-irradiation resulted in resistance to much higher exposures of irradiation (750 kR). The differences in radiosensitivity of the pollen germinated in vitro and in vivo are due possibly to the differences in composition of the germination medium and the stigmatic exudate. Pollen tube growth of irradiated pollen after compatible or incompatible pollination at first showed retarded then normal tube growth. A conclusion is that X-irradiation of pollen cannot influence the characteristics of pollen tube growth after compatible or incompatible pollination. © 1978.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349137157
