Diseased individuals produce fungal spores instead of pollen in their anthers, which allows for pollinator-mediated transmission of spores. We build on existing meagre knowledge of this plant-pathogen system by elucidating the known host range of T. capensis and by assessing its effect on host morphology and reproduction. Three new hosts were identified, bringing the total number of known host species to twelve. Infection of O. incarnata, O. lanata and O. nidulans generally has negative effects on all morphological traits assessed. However, the magnitude of effect on various characters varied between populations and hosts. Fungal spore presence on stigmatic surfaces of healthy O. incarnata and O. lanata did not compromise seed set. However, diseased individuals were usually sterile, indicating that T. capensis has major population-level impacts. Determining the full host range and consequences of infection are essential, as it will allow for comparisons with similar systems to formulate and test general hypotheses of vector-borne disease dynamics.",Greater cape floristic region; Microbotryum violaceum s.

However, delimitation of the genus is still subject to debate. In its present state, Orchis s.str. appears to be composed of two welldifferentiated, monophyletic groups of species, now treated as subgenera (Orchis s.s. and Masculae). Here we present detailed morphological measurements of floral and vegetative traits collected for a large number of species of the two subgenera and the related genus Anacamptis to provide further insights in the taxonomy of this genus. Using multivariate analyses, we show that three groups of species are clearly separated morphologically and that this separation is more pronounced between the two subgenera than between Masculae and Anacamptis. This morphological variation is also supported by significant differences in seed micromorphology of the two subgenera. Review of the literature further provided significant differences in pollinator assemblages between the two subgenera, suggesting substantial pre-zygotic reproductive isolation, and a significant difference in diversity of fungal associates with species of the two subgenera, possibly contributing to post-zygotic reproductive isolation. The fact that no viable hybrid between the two subgenera has ever been observed under artificial or natural conditions is in line with these findings. Based on these findings, an appropriate taxonomic rank for the two groups is discussed. © 2012 Magnolia Press.",Generic delimitation; Masculae; Morphometrics; Orchid phylogenetics; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871478247

Two Oxalis cytisoides aggregations were found and the flower visiting bees were observed. The 3 floral morphs were found at the following proportions: 16 long-, 37 mid-, and 34 shortstyled individuals (n = 87). Anthesis lasted one day (6:30 AM to 3 PM). No fruit was formed in the autogamy test; thus, pollination was dependent on the visitors. The pollen grain size varied between the stamens and morphs and formed subsets in accordance with the stigma height (long/mid/short). We collected 165 bees from 30 species visiting the flowers. Hypanthium divaricatum was the most abundant bee species (34%) and the males were often observed patrolling the flowers in search of females for mating. Analysis of the pollen loads from 34 females showed that 27 carried O. cytisoides pollen. The most frequent bees that carried O. cytisoides pollen grains on their bodies were considered pollinator agents, responsible for transferring pollen grains among the floral morphs. © 2012 Cristiane Krug et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871395918

These cones generate diel midday thermogenic temperature increases as large as 12. °C above ambient during their approximately two week pollination period. The cone temperature response model is shown to accurately predict the cones' temperatures over multiple days as based on simulations of experimental results from 28 thermogenic events from 3 different cones, each simulated for either 9 or 10 sequential days.The verified model is then used as the foundation of a new, parameter estimation based technique (termed inverse calorimetry) that estimates the cones' daily metabolic heating rates from temperature measurements alone. The inverse calorimetry technique's predictions of the major features of the cones' thermogenic metabolism compare favorably with the estimates from conventional respirometry (indirect calorimetry). Because the new technique uses only temperature measurements, and does not require measurements of oxygen consumption, it provides a simple, inexpensive and portable complement to conventional respirometry for estimating metabolic heating rates. It thus provides an additional tool to facilitate field and laboratory investigations of the bio-physics of thermogenic plants. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Cycads; Metabolism; Respirometry; Simulations; Thermogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866786264

However, limited information on male cone development in the species is available. In this study, we observed the morphological and anatomical changes that occur during male cone development in M. glyptostroboides using semi-thin sections and scanning electron microscopy. The male cones were borne oppositely on one-year-old twigs that were mainly located around the outer and sunlit parts of crown. Male cones were initiated from early September and shed pollen in the following February. Each cone consisted of spirally arranged microsporophylls subtended by decussate sterile scales, and each microsporophyll commonly consisted of three microsporangia and a phylloclade. The microsporangial wall was composed of an epidermis, endothecium and tapetum. In mid-February, the endothecium and tapetum layers disintegrated, and in the epidermal layer the cell walls were thickened with inner protrusions. Subsequently, dehiscence of the microsporangia occurred through rupturing of the microsporangial wall along the dehiscence line. These results suggest that the structure, morphology, architecture and arrangement of male cones of M. glyptostroboides are mainly associated with the production, protection and dispersal of pollen for optimization of wind pollination. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Anatomical structure; Development; Male cone; Metasequoia glyptostroboides; Microsporangium dehiscence; Microsporangium wall; Microstrobili; Morphological structure; Pollen cone; Pollen release,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871229248

These systems prevent self-fertilization by the recognition and rejection of self-pollen and pollen from closely related individuals. The most widespread SI system is based on the action of a pistil ribonuclease, the S-RNase, which recognizes and rejects incompatible pollen. S-RNases are endocyted by pollen tubes and stored into vacuoles. By a mechanism that is still unknown, these vacuoles are selectively disrupted in incompatible pollen, releasing S-RNases into the cytoplasm and allowing degradation of pollen RNA. Recently, we have studied the timing of in vivo alterations of pollen F-actin cytoskeleton after incompatible pollinations. Besides being essential for pollen growth, F-actin cytoskeleton is a very dynamic cellular component. Changes in F-actin organization are known to be capable of transducing signaling events in many cellular processes. Early after pollination, F-actin showed a progressive disorganization in incompatible pollen tubes. However by the time the F-actin was almost completely disrupted, the large majority of vacuolar compartments were still intact. These results indicate that in incompatible pollen tubes F-actin disorganization precedes vacuolar disruption. They also suggest that F-actin may act as an early transducer of signals triggering the rejection of incompatible pollen. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",F-actin; Nicotiana alata; Pollen; S-RNase; Self-incompatibility; Signaling; Vacuole,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871248961

Studies have included 40 trees that originated from 5 provenances in the Balkan Peninsula. Within each provenance, seeds were collected from five trees growing in extremely harsh habitat (rocky terrain population) and three trees growing in a favorable habitat (control population). The specifics of the studied provenances, populations and open-pollinated trees have been confirmed in the analysis of salt soluble protein with molecular weight from 12.42 kDa to 240kDa. Variability and stability of proteins were observed on the seed, and then on 9-day-old seedlings obtained on a 4% sucrose solution (drought conditions) and distilled water (control). The analysis of seed protein complex shows the most significant differences between the analyzed provenances, whereas the differences between populations and habitat conditions are insignificant. Also, there is a high intra- and inter- open-polinated trees variability of the analyzed proteins.

Nectaries are tubular and consist of an external epidermis, a photosynthesizing parenchyma, large branches of vascular tissue, a nectar-producing parenchyma, and an internal epidermis. The external epidermis is characterized by thick outer walls and a thin cuticle. Cells of the photosynthesizing parenchyma are characterized by chloroamyloplasts. The nectar-producing parenchyma consists of small cells with lobed nucleus, several small vacuoles, and numerous undifferentiated elongated plastids. These cells contain lipid bodies, Golgi membranes, and rough endoplasmic reticulum and are connected by numerous plasmodesmata. Parenchyma cells around sieve elements contain some amyloplasts. The outer cell wall of the internal epidermis displays a central thinned area containing a depression. The cuticle is very thick with amorphous structure, especially evident in its proximal part. Secretion takes place only in the inner basal region of the nectary cup. The surface of the internal epidermis is devoid of secreting structures. Nectar is released by fracture of the cuticle and underlying cell wall; however, epidermal cell death is not apoptotic. This holocrine secretion is coupled with a more common merocrine secretion through which nectar accumulates in subcuticular spaces. This combined secretion mode produces an enriched ""nectar soup"" crucial for interactions with pollinators and yeasts during winter flowering.",Helleborus foetidus; Holocrine secretion; Nectar secretion; Nectary structure; Ranunculaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871026093

Changes in levels of free bases, ribosides, ribotides and glucosides of both isoprenoid and aromatic CKs were followed. Before BA application, the pool of endogenous CKs in all sets of cotyledons was dominated by isoprenoid ribotides, but 1. h after BA exposure, aromatic CKs (mainly active free bases and ribosides of topolins) accounted for more than 90% of the pool. BA N-glucosides were also observed, levels of which (and topolins) rose from 2. d until the end of the (six-day) culture period. The CK profiles of the two selected pine families also differed, although the general trends were similar.

On the one hand, evolutionary classification states that similarity and common descent are two criteria for biological classification and paraphyletic groups are natural units of biological classification. On the other hand, cladistic classification considers that common descent is the only criterion in biological classification and monophyly should be strictly adhered to. Holcoglossum is used herein as a case to illustrate this problem. Although Holcoglossum is a small orchid genus of less than 20 species, there is little consensus about its generic circumscription since it was established, which leads to confusion in taxonomic treatments in the Aerides-Vanda group. Based on the analyses of molecular and morphological evidence, our results suggest that the clade comprising Holcoglossum s.s., Ascolabium, Penkimia and Ascocentrum himalaicum is strongly supported as a monophyly, and that the three taxa are nested within different subclades of Holcoglossum s.s. Thus, it is reasonable to recognize a monophyletic circumscription of Holcoglossum, which is also well supported by some vegetative and floral characters. The Holcoglossum s.l. would facilitate a better understanding of pollinator-driven floral divergence and vegetative stasis than a paraphyletic and narrowly defined genus. © 2012 Xiang et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871328287

Models predict that the area of suitable habitat will further contract and move upslope, resulting in a reduced incidence within protected areas with increasing annual mean temperature. Areas of potential habitat for all five species are also predicted to become increasingly isolated from one another, further reducing the exchange between metapopulations and subpopulations, exacerbating existing threatening processes. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Australia; Climate change; Conservation planning; Cycads; Distribution; Macrozamia; Maxent; Queensland; Threatened species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901325131

Previous studies have shown that Bsister genes from eudicots are involved in cell differentiation during ovule and seed development. However, the complete function of Bsister genes in eudicots is masked by redundancy with other genes and little is known about the function of Bsister genes in monocots, and about the evolution of Bsister gene functions. Here we characterize OsMADS29, one of three MADS-box Bsister genes in rice. Our analyses show that OsMADS29 is expressed in female reproductive organs including the ovule, ovule vasculature, and the whole seed except for the outer layer cells of the pericarp. Knock-down of OsMADS29 by double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) results in shriveled and/or aborted seeds. Histological analyses of the abnormal seeds at 7 days after pollination (DAP) indicate that the symplastic continuity, including the ovular vascular trace and the nucellar projection, which is the nutrient source for the filial tissue at early development stages, is affected. Moreover, degeneration of all the maternal tissues in the transgenic seeds, including the pericarp, ovular vascular trace, integuments, nucellar epidermis and nucellar projection, is blocked as compared to control plants. Our results suggest that OsMADS29 has important functions in seed development of rice by regulating cell degeneration of maternal tissues. Our findings provide important insights into the ancestral function of Bsister genes. © 2012 Yang et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871197939

First, the number of progeny inheriting a dominant sulfadiazine resistance marker linked to p5cs2 was determined. Second, the number of p5cs2/p5cs2 embryos was determined. A ratio of resistant to susceptible plantlets close to 50%, and the absence of aborted embryos were consistent with the hypothesis that the male gametophyte carrying both p5cs1 and p5cs2 alleles is rarely transmitted to the offspring. In addition, in reciprocal crosses with wild type, about 50% of the p5cs2 mutant alleles were transmitted to the sporophytic generation when p5cs1 p5cs2/P5CS2 was used as a female, while less than 1% of the p5cs2 alleles could be transmitted to the outcrossed progeny when p5cs1 p5cs2/P5CS2 was used as a male. Morphological and functional analysis of mutant pollen revealed a population of small, degenerated, and unviable pollen grains, indicating that the mutant homozygous for p5cs1 and heterozygous for p5cs2 is impaired in pollen development, and suggesting a role for proline in male gametophyte development. Consistent with these findings, we found that pollen from p5cs1 homozygous mutants, display defects similar to, but less pronounced than pollen from p5cs1 p5cs2/P5CS2 mutants. Finally, we show that pollen from p5cs1 p5cs2/P5CS2 plants contains less proline than wild type and that exogenous proline supplied from the beginning of another development can partially complement both morphological and functional pollen defects.Conclusions: Our data show that the development of the male gametophyte carrying mutations in both P5CS1 and P5CS2 is severely compromised, and indicate that proline is required for pollen development and transmission. © 2012 Mattioli et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Arabidopsis; Male gametophyte; p5cs1 p5cs2/P5CS2; Proline,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870915736

Here, we characterise pollen movement for an insect-pollinated Neotropical canopy palm, Oenocarpus bataua, and relate these data to adult mating system and population genetic structure. The study covers a 130-ha parcel in which all adult trees (n185) were mapped and genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci, allowing us to positively identify the source tree for 90% of pollination events (n287 of 318 events). Mating system analysis showed O. bataua was effectively outcrossed (t m 1.02) with little biparental inbreeding (t m t s 0.005) and an average of 5.4 effective pollen donors (N ep) per female. Dispersal distances were relatively large for an insect-pollinated species (mean303 m, max1263 m), and far exceeded nearest-neighbour distances. Dispersal kernel modelling indicated a thin-tailed Weibull distribution offered the best fit to the genetic data, which contrasts with the fat-tailed kernels typically reported for pollen dispersal in trees. Preliminary analyses suggest that our findings may be explained, at least in part, by a relatively diffuse spatial and temporal distribution of flowering trees. Comparison with previously reported estimates of seed movement for O. bataua suggests that pollen and seed dispersal distances may be similar. These findings add to the growing body of information on dispersal in insect-pollinated trees, but underscore the need for continued research on tropical systems in general, and palms in particular. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Arecaceae; chapil palm; Chocó rainforest; neighbourhood model; phenology; spatial genetic structure; weibull distribution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869221217

Here, we examine changes in population size, pollinator visitation and seed set of the tree lupin, Lupinus arboreus, in Tasmania between 1999 and 2010. Lupinus arboreus is a native of California that has become a major environmental weed in New Zealand and Chile, but has not yet become a serious weed in Tasmania. Our data suggest that the main pollinators of L. arboreus are honeybees and the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, which invaded in 1992. There was no clear evidence for an impact of the arrival of bumblebees. Lupinus arboreus population size increased by 76% between 1999 and 2010, despite weed control programmes. Populations appeared to be unstable; 43% of populations detected in 1999 were extinct by 2010, but this was more than offset by establishment of new populations. Inland populations tended to be smaller and were more likely to go extinct, compared with coastal populations, and some coastal populations had increased fourfold in 11years. Large populations in 2010 tended to have higher seed set than smaller populations. The overall rate of increase suggests that L. arboreus may become a major environmental weed in Tasmania. Control of expanding populations is likely to become more difficult if, as we observed, seed set increases with population size. © 2012 The Authors.

Recent phylogenetic comparisons have supported this model of diversification for both insect herbivores and specialized pollinators. An exceptional case where contemporaneous plant-insect diversification might be expected is the obligate mutualism between fig trees (Ficus species, Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Agaonidae, Hymenoptera). The ubiquity and ecological significance of this mutualism in tropical and subtropical ecosystems has long intrigued biologists, but the systematic challenge posed by 750 interacting species pairs has hindered progress toward understanding its evolutionary history. In particular, taxon sampling and analytical tools have been insufficient for large-scale cophylogenetic analyses. Here, we sampled nearly 200 interacting pairs of fig and wasp species from across the globe. Two supermatrices were assembled: on an average, wasps had sequences from 77 of 6 genes (5.6 kb), figs had sequences from 60% of 5 genes (5.5 kb), and overall 850 new DNA sequences were generated for this study.We also developed a newanalytical tool, Jane 2, for event-based phylogenetic reconciliation analysis of very large data sets. Separate Bayesian phylogenetic analyses for figs and fig wasps under relaxed molecular clock assumptions indicate Cretaceous diversification of crown groups and contemporaneous divergence for nearly half of all fig and pollinator lineages. Event-based cophylogenetic analyses further support the codiversification hypothesis. Biogeographic analyses indicate that the present-day distribution of fig and pollinator lineages is consistent with a Eurasian origin and subsequent dispersal, ather than with Gondwanan vicariance. Overall, our findings indicate that the fig-pollinator mutualism represents an extreme case among plant-insect interactions of coordinated dispersal and long-term codiversification.

With the rise in demand for pollinator-dependent foods, such productivity losses may accelerate conversion of natural areas to cropland. Pollination-compensation measures involving managed pollinators or hand pollination are not always optimal or are too costly. Introducing areas of native vegetation within cropland has been proposed as a way to supplement crop pollinators, but this measure is perceived by farmers to carry costs outweighing benefits to agricultural production. Studies quantifying benefits of small patches of native flowers to crop pollination are therefore necessary to encourage such practices. To ascertain whether provision of floral resources within farmlands can facilitate pollination, and hence, crop yields, small experimental patches of perennial native plants (native flower compensation areas, NFCAs) were created in nonproductive areas of large commercial fields of several cultivars of mango Mangifera indica. Pesticide use and isolation from natural habitat were associated with declines in flying visitors and in mango production (kg of marketable fresh fruit), but presence of NFCAs ameliorated these declines, and NFCAs did not harbour any mango pests. In areas far from natural vegetation, orchards near NFCAs had significantly higher diversity and abundance of mango flying visitors, as well as mango production, than orchards far from NFCAs, although these measures were still lower than in orchards close to natural areas. Neither the most abundant flower visitors to mango (ants) nor initial fruit set was significantly affected by distance, pesticides or NFCAs, suggesting that although fertilization is associated with factors unaffected by isolation from natural habitat and pesticide use (i.e. self- and ant-pollination), viable fruit set (and ultimately, production) requires cross-pollination, for which flying visitors are essential. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that the presence of small patches of native flowers within large farms can increase pollinator-dependent crop production if combined with preservation of remaining fragments of natural habitat and judicious use of pesticides. Native flower compensation areas represent a profitable management measure for farmers, increasing cost-effectiveness of cropland while indirectly contributing to preservation of natural habitat.

In this paper, we investigated pollination requirements, pollination mechanism, occurrence of pollination deficit, and the role of biotic pollinators in a large commercial plantation of castor bean. Our results show that R. communis bears a mixed breeding system favoring selfing by geitonogamy, although the wind promotes mostly outcrossing. We also found that the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) foraging on castor bean can both transfer pollen from male to female flowers within the same raceme and boost the release of airborne pollen by male flowers. Both situations increase geitonogamy rates, raising significantly fruit set and seed yield. This is the first report of an animal foraging activity increasing seed yield in an anemophilous and geitonogamous crop and elucidates the role of biotic pollinators in castor bean reproduction.",Oleaginous crop; Pollination deficit; Pollination requirements; Seed yield; Wind insectassisted pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870901549

We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of ants and bees on pollen in two regions: a tropical rainforest in Amazonian Peru and temperate forests and old fields in Canada. We found support for three predictions that follow from the antibiotic hypothesis. (1) For all 10 ant and 11 plant species in our study, contact with ants significantly reduced pollen germination, confirming the generality of this effect. (2) Contact with two bee species did not have similar effects; pollen exposed to bees germinated as well as control pollen. (3) Consistent with the presumed greater abundance of entomopathogens in the tropics, which may have selected for stronger antibiotic secretions in tropical ants, tropical ants had more negative effects on pollen than temperate ants.

A number of pathogens have evolved mechanisms to exploit these close associations and use pollinators as vectors of infective propagules. Factors that affect pollinator movements and successful pollination may in turn also influence successful transmission of fungal spores. Here we investigate the effect of host density and the frequency of diseased Oxalis lanata individuals infected by the anther-smut fungus, Thecaphoracapensis, on the likelihood of receiving pollen and fungal spores. Specifically, we determined the numbers of spores and pollen grains deposited on stigmatic surfaces of selected flowers under natural and standardized conditions where host density and disease frequency varied. The effect of host flower density and diseased flower frequency on pollen and spore transfer was variable under natural conditions and these factors interacted significantly. However, an increase in host density and disease frequency significantly influenced pollen and spore deposits under standardized conditions. The effect of host density was, however, not linear and an optimal flower density for pollen and fungal spore transmission was found. Similar to other systems of vector-borne disease, the transmission of anther-smut of Oxalislanata is more frequency-dependent than density-dependent. This study represents a first step towards understanding the disease transmission process of T. capensis on Oxalis and lays the foundation for future comparative studies between this and other systems to develop and test general hypotheses of disease dynamics in vector-borne disease transmission systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Anther-smut; Microbotryum violaceum; Oxalis lanata; Spore transmission; Thecaphora capensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869504734

Detailed studies on larval and gall development are required to more fully understand how resources are exploited and adaptations fine-tuned by each partner in nursery pollination mutualisms. We studied the larval development of the active pollinating fig wasp, Pegoscapus sp., and the galling process of individual flowers within the figs of its monoecious host, Ficus citrifolia, in Brazil. The pollinator development is strongly dependent on flower pollination. Figs entered by pollen-free wasps were in general more likely to abort. Retained, unpollinated figs had both higher larval mortality and a lower number of wasps. Pegoscapus sp. larvae are adapted to plant development, with two contrasting larval feeding strategies proceeding alongside gall development. The first two larval stages behave as ovary parasites. Later larval stages feed on hypertrophied endosperm. This indicates that a successful galling process relies on endosperm, and also reveals why pollination would be a prerequisite for the production of high-quality galls for this Pegoscapus species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agaonidae; Coevolution; Larval biology; Mutualism stability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870366066

Microsatellite genotyping and Bayesian clustering analysis of the fig community indicated strong reproductive barriers among sympatric species. A total of 1-2% of fig populations consisted of hybrid individuals. A new experimental method of manipulating fig wasps investigated the reproductive consequences of conspecific and heterospecific pollinator visitation for both mutualists. Fig wasps introduced to Ficus hispidioides pollinated and oviposited in receptive figs. Seed development and seedling growth were largely comparable between conspecific and heterospecific crosses. Heterospecific pollinator fitness, however, was significantly less than that of conspecific pollinators.

They can also affect the strength of each other's impact by modifying traits in their shared host, producing super- or sub-additive outcomes. This phenomenon is especially relevant to biological control of invasive plants because most invaders are attacked by multiple agents. Unfortunately, complex interactions among agents are rarely studied. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the effect of two biocontrol agents and generalist pollinators on the invasive weed Centaurea solstitialis, and to identify and quantify the direct and indirect interaction pathways among them. The weevil Eustenopus villosus is both a bud herbivore and a predispersal seed predator; the fly Chaetorellia succinea is also a predispersal seed predator; Apis mellifera is the primary pollinator. We conducted this work at three sites spanning the longitudinal range of C. solstitialis in California (USA) from the coast to the Sierra Nevada Mountains. SEM revealed that bud herbivory had the largest total effect on the weed's fecundity. The direct effect of bud herbivory on final seed set was 2-4 times larger in magnitude than the direct effect of seed predation by both agents combined. SEM also revealed important indirect interactions; by reducing the number of inflorescences plants produced, bud herbivory indirectly reduced the plant's attractiveness to ovipositing seed predators. This indirect, positive pathway reduced bud herbivory's direct negative effect by 11-25%. In the same way, bud herbivory also reduced pollinator visitation, although the magnitude of this pathway was relatively small. E. villosus oviposition deterred C. succinea oviposition, which is unfortunate because C. succinea is the more voracious of the seed predators. Finally, C. succinea oviposition indirectly deterred pollinator visitation, thereby enhancing its net effect on the plant. This study demonstrates the powerful insights that can be gained from the SEM approach in understanding the multiple direct and indirect interactions among agents and pollinators and their effects on an invasive weed. Such an approach may improve our ability to manage weeds with biocontrol agents by identifying pathways that could be exploited by future agents and minimizing the possibility of interference with established agents. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",California; Centaurea solstitialis; Chaetorellia succinea; Eustenopus villosus; Herbivory; Pollination; Seed predation; Structural equation modeling (SEM); USA; Yellow starthistle,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871214651

We investigated the implications of a shift from passerine bird to beetle pollination in Protea for floral scent chemistry, and also explored the functional significance of Protea scent for pollinator attraction. Using headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we found distinct differences in the emission rates and chemical composition of floral scents between eight bird- and four beetle-pollinated species. The amount of scent emitted from inflorescences of beetle-pollinated species was, on average, about 10-fold greater than that of bird-pollinated species. Floral scent of bird-pollinated species consists mainly of small amounts of ""green-leaf volatiles"" and benzenoid compounds, including benzaldehyde, anisole and benzyl alcohol. The floral scent of beetle-pollinated species is dominated by emissions of linalool, a wide variety of other monoterpenes and the benzenoid methyl benzoate, which imparts a fruity odour to the human nose. The number of compounds recorded in the scent of beetle-pollinated species was, on average, greater than in bird-pollinated species (45 versus 29 compounds, respectively). Choice experiments using a Y-maze showed that a primary pollinator of Protea species, the cetoniine beetle Atrichelaphinis tigrina, strongly preferred the scent of inflorescences of the beetle-pollinated Protea simplex over those of the bird-pollinated sympatric congener, Protea roupelliae.

Millspaugh] is the only shrubby food legume crop with drought tolerance in the world. Insect pollinators are essential to flower pollination in cytoplasmic genetic male sterility (CGMS) pigeonpea lines, and the species, abundance, and visiting frequency of insect pollinators are the key factors for pigeonpea hybrid production. More than 46 species of insects have been reported to be flower visitors in the open field for pigeonpea production outside China, of which Megachile spp. are the major pollinators. In this study, the species, abundance, and visiting frequency of flower-visiting insects at flowering stage, as well as hybrid yield of pigeonpea, were investigated in the pigeonpea hybrid production field in Yuanmou County, Yunnan Province, China, using CGMS-based ICPH2671 hybrid. A total of 25 species of flower-visiting insects were detected, including 5 major pollinator species, Megachile velutina Sm., Megachile sp-5, Xylocopa tenuiscapa Westw., Apinae sp-1, and Megachile sp-2. At the blooming stage, the flower-visiting insects visited each primary branch at a frequency of 2.8 times per 10 min for the CGMS male sterile line, while at a frequency of 5.2 times per 10 min for the CGMS restorer line. This indicated the preference of flower-visiting insects to the flowers of restorer line. This significant difference between the male sterile and the restorer lines resulted in very similar dry seed yields of the male sterile line (383.7 g per plant) and the restorer line (357.0 g per plant). Therefore, enough pollens can been transported from the restorer line to the male sterile line by insect pollinators, even much less visiting frequency on the flowers of male sterile line compared to that of the restorer line. © 2011 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",CGMS system; Hybrid seed production; Insect pollinators; Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869004147

E. nigrita uniquely collects the nectar from the flowers of P. alata, nevertheless, it needs to visit other plants to collect pollen, nectar and other resources for its survival. There are two methods to identify the species of plants used by bees in their diet: by direct observation of the bees in the flowers, and through identification of pollen grains present in brood cells, feces, or in the bees' body. In order to identify the other plants that E. nigrita visits, we analyzed samples of pollen grains removed from the bee's body in the course of the flowering period of P. alata. Among our results, the flora visited by E. nigrita comprised 40 species from 32 genera and 19 families, some of them used as a pollen source or just nectar. In spite of being a polyletic species, E. nigrita exhibited preference for some plant species with poricidal anthers. P. alata which has high sugar concentration nectar was the main source of nectar for this bee in the studied area. Nonetheless, the pollinic analysis indicated that others nectariferous plant species are necessary to keep the populations of E. nigrita. Studies such as this one are important since they indicate supplementary pollen-nectar sources which must be used for the conservation of the populations of E. nigrita in crops neighbouring areas. In the absence of pollinators, growers are forced to pay for hand pollination, which increases production costs; keeping pollinators in cultivated areas is still more feasible to ensure sweet passion fruit production.",Bee; Conservation; Maintenance of pollinators; Pollinic analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869074125

Our aim was to compare communities of wild bees in 31 equally managed apple orchards located in three contrasting landscape types (either dominated by apple, forest, or grasslands) and along an elevation gradient and to test a potential interaction between landscape context and elevation. The study was carried out in 2009 in Trentino (NE Italy), one of the major apple growing areas of Europe with ?12,000. ha of commercial orchards distributed between 150 and 950. m a.s.l. We found that apple-dominated landscapes drastically reduced wild bee species richness and abundance in the orchard compared to landscapes dominated by either grassland or forest. Forest-dominated landscapes benefited local species richness more than grassland-dominated landscapes, while abundance did not differ between grassland and forest. Total species richness and abundance further declined with increasing elevation, while no interactive effect was found between temperature and landscape context. The abundance of Apis mellifera in the apple-dominated landscapes was two to four times higher than in the landscapes dominated by forest and grasslands, respectively. Measures to restore natural pollinator communities by providing suitable habitats around the orchard would not only benefit conservation of general biodiversity, but would probably also contribute to reduce the dependence of apple pollination on managed honey bees. © 2012 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Apis mellifera; Climate; Forest; Fruit tree; Grassland; Honey bee; Pesticide; Pollination; Semi-natural habitat; Wild bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870443477

Previous studies on Serapias species have ascertained that reproductive isolation is based on pre-pollination barriers, that secretory cells and trichomes are typically distributed on the floral labellum and that flowers produce aliphatic compounds. In this study we compare the floral scent composition of four widespread, co-occurring Serapias species, namely Serapias lingua, Serapias parviflora, Serapias vomeracea and Serapias cordigera. Our goals are to assess if differences in floral scent may act as interspecific pre-pollination barriers and if these olfactory signals may be involved in the pollination strategy of Serapias. We find that all the selected species produce C20-C29 alkanes and alkenes and, in addition, have detected the presence in S. cordigera of large amounts of oleate and stearate ethyl ester. Our findings help to clarify that the sympatric Serapias species have slightly different floral scent signatures that may account for their relevant role as pre-pollination barriers. Therefore, the pollination strategy of Serapias relies not only on the tubular shape of their floral corolla but also on the production of olfactory signals that may lure potential pollinators and even assure a sufficient degree of pollinator fidelity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Aliphatic compounds; Alkanes; Alkenes; Orchids; Pollination strategy; Reproductive barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868646655

Our objectives are to compare compartments obtained with these three approaches and to explore the role of several species attributes related to pollination syndromes, species phenology, abundance and connectivity in structuring compartmentalization. BM could not identify compartments in our network. By contrast, UM revealed four modules composed of plants and pollinators, and GM four groups of plants and five of pollinators. Phenology had a major influence on compartmentalization, and compartments (both UM and GM) had distinct phenophases. Compartments were also strongly characterized by species degree (number of connections) and betweenness centrality. These two attributes were highly related to each other and to phenophase duration. Differences among compartments in abundance were only apparent with GM. We attribute this to the fact that abundance is strongly correlated with Degree, and the GM algorithm is particularly powerful at discriminating species based on degree. On the other hand, the role of pollination syndrome-related features in compartmentalization mostly emerged with UM. Only UM compartments differed in corolla length and pollen production. Both UM and GM compartments differed in their pollinator spectra. We found inconsistent reciprocity between plant attributes and pollinator spectra, thus it is difficult to conclude compartments follow clear-cut syndromes. Also, both UM and GM identified a compartment composed of pollinators with long activity periods that acted as connectors, linking all compartments providing cohesiveness to the network. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869885658

Early pollination success was measured by counting pollen tubes in the style of E. argophloia 12 days after pollination. We compared the early pollination success of 1) Artificially Induced Protogyny (AIP), one-stop and three-stop methods of pollination; 2) flowers pollinated at 2 day intervals between 2 days before and 6 days after anthesis and 3) fresh pollen and pollen that had been stored for 9 months. Our results show significantly more pollen tubes from unpollinated AIP and AIP treatments than either the one-stop pollination or three-stop pollination treatments. This indicates that self-pollination occurs in the unpollinated AIP treatment. There was very little pollen tube growth in the one-stop method indicating that the three-stop method is the most suitable for this species. Stigma receptivity in E. argophloia commenced six days after anthesis and no pollen tube growth was observed prior to this. Fresh pollen resulted in pollen tube growth in the style whereas the stored pollen resulted in a total absence of pollen tube growth. We recommend that breeding programs incorporating E. argophloia as a female parent use the three-stop pollination method, and controlled pollination be carried out at least six days after anthesis using fresh pollen.",Artificially induced protogyny; One-stop pollination; Stored pollen; Three-stop pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889240390

It is not yet well understood which traits are critical for pollinator attraction, although colour, shape and scent have all been implicated. We conducted field-based behavioural experiments using pairwise combinations of plastic flowers differing in spectral and shape properties offered to long-proboscid tabanid flies (Philoliche aethiopica) at two sites - one where the fly-pollinated orchid mimic Disa pulchra occurs with its pink-flowered model, the iris Watsonia lepida and another where the flies forage on a blue-flowered rewarding plant Agapanthus campanulatus. Flies intensively visited and probed plastic flowers of colours indistinguishable in a fly vision model from those of the rewarding plants. Inflorescence architecture and brightness of plastic flowers made little difference to fly attraction, but those that matched the shape and nectar guides of Watsonia flowers were significantly more attractive. Flowers of the three focal plant species are weakly scented and divergent in scent chemistry. This study shows that traits that mimic, in order of importance, the spectra, shape and nectar guide patterns of flowers of rewarding plants would be under strong selection in food-deceptive orchids as they maximize attractiveness to their pollinators. Our experiments also help to explain why deceptive orchids in general often seem to match the flowers of sympatric rewarding plants more in visual attributes than in scent chemistry. © 2012 British Ecological Society.",Batesian floral mimicry; Colour; Disa; Fly pollination; Scent,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869864645

Chloraea membranacea Lindl. is one of the few non-Andean species in this group, and the aim of the present contribution is to elucidate the pollination biology, functional floral morphology and breeding system in native populations of this species from Argentina (Buenos Aires) and Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul State). Methods:Floral features were examined using light microscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The breeding system was studied by means of controlled pollinations applied to plants, either bagged in the field or cultivated in a glasshouse. Pollination observations were made on natural populations, and pollinator behaviour was recorded by means of photography and video.Key ResultsBoth Argentinean and Brazilian plants were very consistent regarding all studied features. Flowers are nectarless but scented and anatomical analysis indicates that the dark, clavate projections on the adaxial labellar surface are osmophores (scent-producing glands). The plants are self-compatible but pollinator-dependent. The fruit-set obtained through cross-pollination and manual self-pollination was almost identical. The main pollinators are male and female Halictidae bees that withdraw the pollinarium when leaving the flower. Remarkably, the bees tend to visit more than one flower per inflorescence, thus promoting self-pollination (geitonogamy). Fruiting success in Brazilian plants reached 60·78 in 2010 and 46 in 2011. Some pollinarium-laden female bees were observed transferring pollen from the carried pollinarium to their hind legs. The use of pollen by pollinators is a rare record for Orchidaceae in general.ConclusionsChloraea membrancea is pollinated by deceit. Together, self-compatibility, pollinarium texture, pollinator abundance and behaviour may account for the observed high fruiting success. It is suggested that a reappraisal and re-analysis of important flower features in Chloraeinae orchids is necessary. © 2012 The Author.",Breeding system; Chloraea membrancea; Chloraeinae; Halictidae; Orchidaceae; orchids; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870188044

Each of the hybrids was studied both under selfpollination and open pollination. In vitro pollen germination was also performed as well as characteristics of flowering phenophase and flowering abundance. Generally, the results suggest lower flowering abundance in the second year of the study. Pollen germination ranged from averagely 25.31% (29/29/87) to 40.01% (38/62/70). With averagely 31.59% final fruit set under self-pollination and 29.38% under open pollination variants, respectively, hybrid 34/41/87 gave the best results.

This study compares three methods to calculate the coancestry coefficient within open-pollinated progenies of the dioecious tree species, Myracrodruon urundeuva, using six microsatellite loci. The methods compared were: 1) correlated mating model (CMM) (RITLAND, 1989); 2) TWOGENER method (SMOUSE et al., 2001) to estimate the differentiation among pollen pools (TGM); and 3) HARDY et al.'s 2004 method using the estimate of coancestry from LOISELLE et al. (1995) (HLM) and from RITLAND (1996) (HRM). The data analysis was based on four data sets: two populations were composed of 12 progenies, two of 24 progenies, and all progenies consisted of 15 plants. The coancestry estimated using CMM ranged among populations from 0.145 to 0.158, using TGM it ranged from 0.153 to 0.181, using HLM from 0.153 to 0.162, and HRM from 0.144 to 0.147. To investigate the bias of the estimates of true relatedness within progenies we simulated two half-sib and two full-sib populations. The most accurate method found in the study was CMM because the estimated values presented no bias for true half- or full-sib progenies and these values were very similar to those expected (0.125 and 0.25, respectively). These results have significant implications for breeding and conservation programs because coancestry-within-progenies is a key parameter in assessing the variance effective size.",Additive genetic variation; Effective population size; Kinship; Mating system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876072463

The growth and yields of the OPV were higher than those of the hybrid, illustrating the greater adaptability of this variety to the drier conditions of minor seasons. The least beneficial impact of organic matter on growth, yield and nitrogen use was with rice straw, a low quality organic matter, while Tithonia leaves promoted root growth. Application of Gliricidia leaves produced the highest yields followed by the use of Tithonia. N use patterns were enhanced to similar extents by the addition of Tithonia and Gliricidia leaves, and the beneficial impact was greater than when rice straw was used. Incorporation enhanced the benefits of the organic matter, especially in the hybrid, which produced lower yields, which is considered less adaptable to the environments of this season.

Seed and pollen dispersal patterns can respond differently to the increased isolation resulting from habitat fragmentation, with unpredictable consequences for gene flow and population structuring. In a recently fragmented landscape we compared the pre- and post-fragmentation genetic structure of populations of a tree species where pollen and seed dispersal respond differentially to forest fragmentation generated by flooding. Castanopsis sclerophylla is wind-pollinated, with seeds that are dispersed by gravity and rodents. Using microsatellites, we found no significant difference in genetic diversity between pre- and post-fragmentation cohorts. Significant genetic structure was observed in pre-fragmentation cohorts, due to an unknown genetic barrier that had isolated one small population. Among post-fragmentation cohorts this genetic barrier had disappeared and genetic structure was significantly weakened. The strengths of genetic structuring were at a similar level in both cohorts, suggesting that overall gene flow of C. sclerophylla has been unchanged by fragmentation at the regional scale. Fragmentation has blocked seed dispersal among habitats, but this appears to have been compensated for by enhanced pollen dispersal, as indicated by the disappearance of a genetic barrier, probably as a result of increased wind speeds and easier pollen movement over water. Extensive pollen flow can counteract some negative effects of fragmentation and assist the long-term persistence of small remnant populations. © 2012 The Authors.

We used morphological and microsatellite markers to investigate the reproductive ecology, in relation to fire, and population genetic structure of the endangered shrub Allocasuarina emuina. Highly significant differences (P0.001) were detected among populations for all cone- and seed-related morphological traits, which revealed distinct northern and southern groups of populations, a pattern repeated in the genetic component of the study. Results also indicated that the reproductive viability of A. emuina is more related to fire interval than population size and confirmed that seed viability declines with time since fire. The highest level of genetic diversity for the species was observed in the population on Mt Emu (AE4A; HE?0.688). Contrary to the expectations of population genetic theory, no relationship was found between the level of genetic variation and population size, density or degree of isolation, hinting that genetic diversity is being conserved as a result of polyploidy and apomixis. However, genetic signatures in the northern populations indicated that unidirectional dispersal of genetic material from the putatively refugial population on Mt Emu to the surrounding coastal plain has been occurring with recession of sea levels following the last interglacial. The findings of the study will aid in both the conservation of natural populations and translocations of A. emuina and have significant implications relating to the biogeographical history of a considerable number of co-occurring heathland taxa. © CSIRO 2012.",apomixis; conservation genetics; endangered plants; fire ecology; polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871849276

Additionally, low plant densities could promote self-pollination due to the better synchronization of pollen and silk emergence. To address these hypotheses selection was applied for three generations using as starting material the F2 of the maize hybrid 'Costanza' under open-pollination conditions and a density of 0.74 plants m-2. The selection was based on two equations: one to estimate the yield genetic potential of single plants and the other the yield genetic potential of entries/ lines. The results were promising in terms of enhanced gene fixation and exploitation of additive gene action. The high selection pressures applied led to fairly homogeneous half-sib lines that approximate the productivity and stability levels of 'Costanza'. Utilization of such lines in the production of hybrids is expected to increase the crop yield potential, while progressive line improvement could ultimately reduce the line-tohybrid gap. Concluding, progressive replacement of less by more favorable additive alleles is accomplishable when ultra-low plant densities are used so as to maximize pollen production and diminish the anthesis-to-silking interval, thus promoting selfing. The application of the procedure in commercially successful hybrids is recommended in order to develop highly homogeneous lines of superior performance; the hybridization between such lines is bound to lead to less heterogeneous hybrids and reduced seed cost.",Additive gene action; Homeostasis; Line-to-hybrid gap; Plant yield potential; Selection intensity; Ultra-low density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872792228

These in turn are expected to respond to plant population size and flower density. High floral densities for example usually attract large numbers of pollinators that visit more flowers per plant or patch, which increases pollen deposition at short distances. Thus, population characteristics might serve as indicators for pollen dispersal patterns and help to identify suitable habitat size and quality for conservation measures. To test this hypothesis, we observed floral visitors of a generalist, entomophilous species, Comarum palustre, and compared their abundance and visitation rates in populations of different sizes and flower densities. At the same time, we mimicked pollen flow using fluorescent dye. In the large and dense populations, pollinator abundance and visitation rates were high and dye was dispersed to the edges of the populations (up to 200. m). In the medium-sized population with high flower density, insect abundance and visitation rates were unexpectedly low and dye dispersal declined very quickly. On the contrary, in the smallest population with scattered flowers, especially bumble bee abundance was similar to the large populations and dye dispersal mirrored this high bumble bee activity. Thus, our results indicate that in smaller habitat fragments, the mere size of a population might be insufficient to suggest pollen flow for a plant species. Instead, the abundance of its major pollinators should be considered. © 2012 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Bombus spp.; Flower density; Flower visitation rate; Fluorescent dye; Insect abundance; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870429092

Thus, invasion success may strongly depend on their reproductive biology. A high number of self-compatible plants species are known to be successful colonizers of new habitats, even able to establish populations from single propagules. However, many other invasive species require pollen vectors. Here, we investigated the mating system of Buddleja davidii, a fast growing shrub native to China that colonizes quickly in disturbed habitats such as quarries, river banks, along railways and roads, both in its native and invasive regions. It was intentionally introduced to Europe as an ornamental plant because of its fragrant and showy flowers. We additionally studied its vulnerability to biparental inbreeding depression by performing a controlled crossing experiment using pollen from the same population or from geographically close and distant populations, respectively. As a measure for pollination success, we used capsule weight, seed number per capsule and seed weight for each treatment. The self-incompatibility index for B. davidii was found to be 96% suggesting that successful reproduction strongly depends on cross-pollination and the presence of appropriate pollen vectors. Since cross-pollination did not reveal significant differences in measured traits, it is assumed that invasive B. davidii-populations do not suffer from biparental inbreeding depression. B. davidii has fragrant and rewarding flowers that mainly attract butterflies. We conclude that the long distance pollen transfer performed by these insects may have prevented inbreeding so far and thus contributes to the invasive spread of B. davidii in Europe. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Biological invasion; Biparental inbreeding depression; Mating system; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870410079

Knowledge about the nectary structure and dynamics of nectar production of this species represent a key step toward understanding its relationship with pollinators. Methods: Mahogany tree fl oral buds and fl owers in anthesis were collected, fi xed, and processed for study by light and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of nectar and the nectary pigments was also studied.Key results: Both staminate and pistillate fl owers have nectaries, which contain a papillose epidermis and stomata. The nectariferous tissue is parenchymatous, with the cell cytoplasm primarily containing mitochondria and plastids. Secretory activity initiates at the beginning of anthesis, which occurs at nightfall. Flowers undergoing anthesis become structurally modifi ed, with starch grains in the plastids disappearing. The number of plastoglobuli in the plastids also increases when nectaries change color from pale yellow to intense red. Pistillate and staminate flowers produce meager nectar rewards. Conclusions: Changes in plastoglobuli number seem to be related to an increase in carotenes and color changes during anthesis. Carotenes can be linked to the protection of the plant against oxidative stress, which results from secretory activities. Nectary color has a limited role as a pollinator attractant. Floral rewards comprise small nectar droplets in both fl ower types, in addition to a few pollen grains in staminate fl owers. These meager rewards are probably adapted to attract small generalist insects. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Carotenoid; Floral nectary; Mahogany; Meliaceae; Nectar secretion; Swietenia macrophylla,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875192805

Air samples were collected onto solid adsorbent cartridges from branch enclosures on the tree species crabapple (Malus sp.), horse chestnut (Aesculus carnea, ""Ft. Mc- Nair""), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos, ""Sunburst""), and hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata, ""Pauls Scarlet""). These species constitute ~65% of the insect-pollinated fraction of the flowering tree canopy (excluding catkin-producing trees) from the street area managed by the City of Boulder. Samples were analyzed for C10-C15 BVOC by thermal desorption and gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector and a mass spectrometer (GC/FID/MS). Identified emissions and emission rates from these four tree species during the flowering phase were found to vary over a wide range. Monoterpene emissions were identified for honey locust, horse chestnut and hawthorn. Sesquiterpene emissions were observed in horse chestnut and hawthorn samples. Crabapple flowers were found to emit significant amounts of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde. Floral BVOC emissions increased with temperature, generally exhibiting exponential temperature dependence. Changes in BVOC speciation during and after the flowering period were observed for every tree studied. Emission rates were significantly higher during the blooming compared to the post-blooming state for crabapple and honey locust. The results were scaled to the dry mass of leaves and flowers contained in the enclosure. Only flower dry mass was accounted for crabapple emission rates as leaves appeared at the end of the flowering period. Total normalized (30 °C) monoterpene emissions from honey locust were higher during flowering (5.3 ?gC g-1 h-1) than after flowering (1.2 ?gC g-1 h-1). The total normalized BVOC emission rate from crabapple (93 ?gC g-1 h-1) during the flowering period is of the same order as isoprene emissions from oak trees, which are among the highest BVOC flowering period floral emissions observed from plants to date. These findings illustrate that during the relatively brief springtime flowering period, floral emissions constitute by far the most significant contribution to the BVOC flux from these tree species, some of which are leafless at this time. Experimental results were integrated into the MEGAN biogenic emission model and simulations were performed to estimate the contribution of floral BVOC emissions to the total urban BVOC flux during the spring flowering period. The floral BVOC emitted during this three-month simulation are equivalent to 11% of the integrated monoterpene flux for the Boulder urban area. © Author(s) 2012.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871270256

Detection of disrupted interactions often relies on anachronistic plant characteristics, such as spines in the absence of large herbivores or large fruit without dispersers. However, obvious anachronisms are relatively uncommon, and it can be difficult to prove a direct link between the anachronism and a particular faunal taxon. Analysis of coprolites (fossil feces) provides a novel way of exposing lost interactions between animals (depositors) and consumed organisms. We analyzed ancient DNA to show that a coprolite from the South Island of New Zealand was deposited by the rare and threatened kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), a large, nocturnal, flightless parrot. When we analyzed the pollen and spore content of the coprolite, we found pollen from the cryptic root-parasite Dactylanthus taylorii. The relatively high abundance (8.9% of total pollen and spores) of this zoophilous pollen type in the coprolite supports the hypothesis of a former direct feeding interaction between kakapo and D. taylorii. The ranges of both species have contracted substantially since human settlement, and their present distributions no longer overlap. Currently, the lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) is the only known native pollinator of D. taylorii, but our finding raises the possibility that birds, and other small fauna, could have once fed on and pollinated the plant. If confirmed, through experimental work and observations, this finding may inform conservation of the plant. For example, it may be possible to translocate D. taylorii to predator-free offshore islands that lack bats but have thriving populations of endemic nectar-feeding birds. The study of coprolites of rare or extinct taxonomic groups provides a unique way forward to expand existing knowledge of lost plant and animal interactions and to identify pollination and dispersal syndromes. This approach of linking paleobiology with neoecology offers significant untapped potential to help inform conservation and restoration plans. ©2012 Society for Conservation Biology.",Dactylanthus taylorii; Ecological interactions; Herbivory; Kakapo; New Zealand; Pollination; Strigops habroptilus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868667324

Both are diverse and widespread in angiosperms. The systematic distribution of the different forms of monosymmetry and asymmetry indicates that both evolved numerous times. Elaborate forms occur in highly synorganized flowers. Less elaborate forms occur by curvature of organs and by simplicity with minimal organ numbers. Elaborate forms of asymmetry evolved from elaborate monosymmetry. Less elaborate form come about by curvature or torsion of organs, by imbricate aestivation of perianth organs, or also by simplicity. Floral monosymmetry appears to be a key innovation in some groups (e. g., Orchidaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiales), but not in others. Floral asymmetry appears as a key innovation in Phaseoleae (Fabaceae). Simple patterns of monosymmetry appear easily ""reverted"" to polysymmetry, whereas elaborate monosymmetry is difficult to lose without disruption of floral function (e. g., Orchidaceae). Monosymmetry and asymmetry can be expressed at different stages of floral (and fruit) development and may be transient in some taxa. The two symmetries are most common in bee-pollinated flowers, and appear to be especially prone to develop in some specialized biological situations: monosymmetry, e. g., with buzz-pollinated flowers or with oil flowers, and asymmetry also with buzz-pollinated flowers, both based on the particular collection mechanisms by the pollinating bees.

The present investigation deals with the objective of ascertaining the concentration and number of sprays of common salt (NaCl) effective for temporary breakdown of self-incompatibility in the S-allele lines (1-4-6 and II-12-4-7) of cabbage. The S-allele lines were grown at the Experimental Farm and the pollinations viz. BP (selfing in bud stage) and OP (selfing in freshly opened flowers) were carried out manually in the plants enclosed with insect proof nylon nets. There was seed-set in BP on all the test plants during 2009-2010, but erratic seed-set in OP after NaCl sprays in the S-allele line I-4-6 probably due to too long time lag between spray and pollination and also the use of relatively lesser volume of spray (25 ml/plant). However, in II-12-4-7, there was practically no seed-set in OP probably due to the presence of stronger S-allele.

The increase from 50 ng g-1 fresh weight to 2.9 ?g g-1 fresh weight from 1 to 14 days after pollination was much larger than that previously reported by enzyme-linked immunoassay methods. The largest increase in IAA content coincided with the start of the major starch deposition phase of grain-fill. The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. These results confirm the importance of the tryptophan aminotransferase/YUCCA pathway in this system. All three genes were expressed in endosperm; expression of OsYUC11 appeared to be confined to endosperm tissue. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that OsYUC11 and AtYUC10 belong to a separate clade of YUCCAs, which do not have orthologues outside the Angiosperms. This clade may have evolved with a specific role in endosperm. Expression of tryptophan decarboxylase in developing rice grains did not correlate with IAA levels, indicating that tryptamine is unlikely to be important for IAA synthesis in this system. In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, OsYUC11 and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development. © Physiologia Plantarum 2012.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869079596

In this study, species richness and distribution of hoverfly and wild bee communities were investigated in a changing tropical landscape in southern Yunnan, south-west China by Malaise traps periodically from 2008 to 2009. Species were recorded from the traditional land use types (natural forest, grassland, shrubland and rice field fallows), and from recently established rubber plantations of different ages. Hoverflies (total 53 species) were most common in young successional stages of vegetation, including rice field fallow and shrubland. Species richness was highest in rice field fallows and lowest in forests and showed a highly significant relationship with the number of forb species and ground vegetation cover. In contrast, the highest richness of wild bees (total 44 species) was recorded from the natural forest sites, which showed a discrete bee community composition compared to the remaining habitat types. There was no significant relationship between the bee species richness and the environmental variables, including the numbers of different plant life forms, coverage of canopy and ground vegetation, successional age of vegetation and land use type. At the landscape scale, open land use systems, including young rubber plantations, are assumed to increase the species richness of hoverflies; however, this might decrease wild bee diversity. The present land use change by rubber cultivation can be expected to have negative impacts on the native wild bee communities. © 2012 The Authors Insect Science © 2012 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Apidae; Insects; Pollinators; Rubber plantations; Syrphidae; Tropical forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870235156

Pollinators are declining due to various factors, including habitat degradation and destruction. Grasslands, an important habitat for native bees, are particularly vulnerable. One highly imperiled and understudied grassland type in the United States is the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie. No studies have examined native bee communities in this prairie type. To fill this gap, the bee fauna of the Zumwalt Prairie, a large, relatively intact remnant of the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie, was examined. Native bees were sampled during the summers of 2007 and 2008 in sixteen 40-ha study pastures on a plateau in northeastern Oregon, using a sampling method not previously used in grassland studies-blue vane traps. This grassland habitat contained an abundant and diverse community of native bees that experienced marked seasonal and inter-annual variation, which appears to be related to weather and plant phenology. Temporal variability evident over the entire study area was also reflected at the individual trap level, indicating a consistent response across the spatial scale of the study. These results demonstrate that temporal variability in bee communities can have important implications for long-term monitoring protocols. In addition, the blue vane trap method appears to be well-suited for studies of native bees in large expanses of grasslands or other open habitats, and may be a useful tool for monitoring native bee communities in these systems.",bee monitoring; community composition; grasslands; native bees; Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie; temporal variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874454475

Enhancing habitat heterogeneity in agricultural landscapes promotes biodiversity and, whilst erecting fences adjacent to watercourses is widely advocated as a means of mitigating diffuse pollution, associated biodiversity benefits have been largely overlooked. A range of riparian margins and their adjacent grassland fields were investigated to determine the effects of riparian management on the diversity and functional structure of carabid assemblages. Carabid assemblages of fields and open margins (i.e. unfenced watercourses) were more diverse and species rich than those of fenced margins. The functional structure of carabid assemblages in fenced margins differed from grassland fields and open margins. This disparity was greater in wide margins (i.e. fences erected over 5·4 m from watercourses) than narrow margins (i.e. fences erected within 2·6 m of watercourses). Wide margins had the highest relative proportions of carabids which had pushing body forms, were flightless, very small in size and Collembola specialists. During early summer, wide margins also had the highest proportion of carabids that overwinter as adults. The taxonomic and functional structure of carabid assemblages was more sensitive for detecting impacts of agricultural management than measurements of diversity. It is likely that this also applies to other taxa, thus emphasising the need to consider a wide range of assemblage attributes when investigating agricultural impacts on biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Fenced riparian margins, particularly those over 5·4 m wide, harbour carabids with poor dispersal ability which are vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. While lack of management benefits sedentary species, a wider range of taxa (e.g. pollinators, foraging birds and flowering plants) are enhanced by management to obtain a more open vegetation structure (e.g. restricted grazing or mowing). It is important that management practices are implemented at a sufficiently fine spatial scale to allow recolonisation of species with restricted dispersal from adjacent undisturbed habitats. Wide riparian margins have the potential to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity at the landscape scale. Management actions must, however, be carefully balanced to ensure that they promote a wide range of taxa without unduly interfering with the margin's ability to mitigate diffuse pollution.

However, the major biological function that has been ascribed to petals is the mediation of interactions with pollinators. Here we show that petal surfaces can effectively capture and quickly allocate nitrogen ions available in wet atmospheric deposition into ovaries and developing seeds. In laboratory and field experiments we used 15N stable isotope at trace concentrations and measured petal intake in five species from five different families. We observed significant 15N increases in fully developed seeds when petals were exposed to 15N, contrasting with the lack of seed enrichment when 15N was applied just to soil or foliage. Translocation of 15N through petals occurred in a matter of hours, and mass recovery rates of isotope tracers in seeds were much higher through petals (44.6%) than soil (7.4%) or leaves (0%). Our experiments suggest that when reactive N is available from atmospheric sources, flower petals could act as permeable surfaces that can help reproductive structures meet demands of limiting nutrients. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869870697

The most striking visual cue is a highly reflective, blue speculum region at the centre of the labellum, which mimics the corresponding female insect and reaches its strongest development in the mirror orchid, O. speculum. We explored the structure and properties of the much-discussed speculum by scanning and transmission electron microscopic examination of its ultrastructure, visible and ultraviolet (UV) angle-resolved spectrophotometry of the intact tissue, and mass spectrometry of extracted pigments. The speculum contrasts with the surrounding labellar epidermis in being flat-celled with a thick, smooth cuticle. The speculum is extremely glossy, reflecting intense white light in a specular direction, but at more oblique angles it predominantly reflects blue and UV light. Pigments in the speculum, dominantly the cyanidin 3-(3??-malonylglucoside), are less diverse than in the surrounding regions of the labellar epidermis and lack quercetin copigments.

Knowledge about the nectary structure and dynamics of nectar production of this species represent a key step toward understanding its relationship with pollinators. Methods: Mahogany tree floral buds and flowers in anthesis were collected, fixed, and processed for study by light and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of nectar and the nectary pigments was also studied. Key results: Both staminate and pistillate flowers have nectaries, which contain a papillose epidermis and stomata. The nectariferous tissue is parenchymatous, with the cell cytoplasm primarily containing mitochondria and plastids. Secretory activity initiates at the beginning of anthesis, which occurs at nightfall. Flowers undergoing anthesis become structurally modified, with starch grains in the plastids disappearing. The number of plastoglobuli in the plastids also increases when nectaries change color from pale yellow to intense red. Pistillate and staminate flowers produce meager nectar rewards. Conclusions: Changes in plastoglobuli number seem to be related to an increase in carotenes and color changes during anthesis. Carotenes can be linked to the protection of the plant against oxidative stress, which results from secretory activities. Nectary color has a limited role as a pollinator attractant.

Three centers of diversity, 58 genera, and about 3,140 bromeliad species are currently recognized. We compiled all of the studies related to the reproductive biology, genetic diversity, and population structure of the Bromeliaceae, and discuss the evolution and conservation of this family. Bromeliads are preferentially pollinated by vertebrates and show marked variation in breeding systems, from predominant inbreeding to predominant outcrossing, as well as constancy in chromosome number (2n = 2x = 50). Autogamous or mixed mating system bromeliads have a high inbreeding coefficient (FIS), while outcrossing species show low FIS. The degree of differentiation among populations (FST) of species ranges from 0.043 to 0.961, which can be influenced by pollen and seed dispersal effects, clonal growth, gene flow rates, and connectivity among populations. The evolutionary history of the Bromeliaceae is poorly known, although some studies have indicated that the family arose in the Guayana Shield roughly 100 Mya.

This report deals with the histochemical location of the activity of four basic types of enzyme involved in these processes in the olive (Olea europaea L.). The detection of peroxidase, esterase and acid-phosphatase activities at the surface of the stigma provided evidence of early receptivity in olive pistils. The stigma maintained its receptivity until the arrival of pollen. Acid-phosphatase activity appeared in the style at the moment of anthesis and continued until the fertilization of the ovule. RNase activity was detected in the extracellular matrix of the styles of flowers just before pollination and became especially evident in pistils after self-pollination. This activity gradually decreased until it practically disappeared in more advanced stages. RNase activity was also detected in pollen tubes growing in pollinated pistils and appeared after in vitro germination in the presence of self-incompatible pistils. These findings suggest that RNases may well be involved in intraspecific pollen rejection in olive flowers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that evidence of enzyme activity in stigma receptivity and pollen selection has been described in this species. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Enzyme activity; GSI; Olea europaea L.; Pollen-pistil interaction; Stigma receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866278040

In close vicinity of the flower, visual signals may enhance attraction, as was shown recently in the sexually deceptive orchid Ophrys heldreichii. Here, we conducted an in situ manipulation experiment in two populations of O. heldreichii on Crete to investigate whether the presence/absence of the conspicuous pink perianth affects reproductive success in two natural orchid populations. We estimated reproductive success of three treatment groups (with intact, removed and artificial perianth) throughout the flowering period as pollinaria removal (male reproductive success) and massulae deposition (female reproductive success). Reproductive success was significantly increased by the presence of a strong visual signal-the conspicuous perianth-in one study population, however, not in the second, most likely due to the low pollinator abundance in the latter population. This study provides further evidence that the coloured perianth in O. heldreichii is adaptive and thus adds to the olfactory signal to maximise pollinator attraction and reproductive success. © 2012 The Author(s).",Eucera berlandi; Male bees; Ophrys heldreichii; Pollination; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870393720

Fruit set upon hand pollination with pollen from other individuals was significantly higher than the results of selfed, bagged, emasculated and control treatments.

The current descriptions of the phenotypic traits for male and female flowers are not comprehensive and there have been no reports about the process of J. curcas from pollen germination on stigma to pollen tubes conducting fertilization after entering the ovary and ovule. To assess this, experiments were undertaken to study the reproductive biology characteristic of J. curcas in Guiyang Guizhou Province, China. Floral structure and pollen germination process were described in detail and the breeding system was determined. The results showed that flower of J. curcas was both unisexual and monoecious, with a flowering phase between April-November. Both female and male flowers have five petals in contorted arrangement and five calyxes in imbricated arrangement. Female flower originated from bisexual flower finally formed unisexual flowers as the stamen ceased growth in different period. The pistil had 3-5 styles, connected at base and separated into 3-5 stigmas on the top. Each stigma had 2-4 lobes. The styles were hollow. The pollen germinated on the surface of the stigma, is then transported via the vascular tissues, which was arranged in bundles, and finally channeled through the micropyle to enter the blastula. The pollen tube was shaped in a long uneven cylinder. The top end of it became swollen and formed a small round hole for the purpose of releasing sperm nuclei while the pollen tube itself was growing and extending. Estimation of out-crossing index and artificial pollination experiments indicated that J. curcas was capable of both self-pollination and cross-pollination. The germination speed of the pollen on the stigma did not differ so much between the one by self-pollination and the one by cross-pollination, and the pollen from the two different sources could both reach the ovary within one day.

In order to understand what developmental mechanisms enabled the speeding of fertilization, comparative data are needed from across the group, especially from early-divergent lineages. I studied the pollen germination process of Austrobaileya scandens, a perennial vine endemic to the Wet Tropics area of northeastern Queensland, Australia, and a member of the ancient angiosperm lineage, Austrobaileyales. Methodology: I used in vivo and in vitro hand pollinations and timed collections to study development from late pollen maturation to just after germination. Then I compared the contribution of pollen germination timing to progamic phase duration in 131 angiosperm species (65 families). Principal findings: Mature pollen of Austrobaileya was bicellular, starchless and moderately dehydrated-water content was 31.5 % by weight and volume increased by 57.9 % upon hydration. A callose layer in the inner intine appeared only after pollination. In vivo pollen germination followed a logarithmic curve, rising from 28 % at 1 hour after pollination (hap) to 97 % at 12 hap (R2 = 0.98). Sufficient pollen germination to fertilize all ovules was predicted to have occurred within 62 min. Across angiosperms, pollen germination ranged from 1 min to &gt;60 h long and required 8.3±9.8 % of the total duration of the progamic phase. Significance: Pollen of Austrobaileya has many plesiomorphic features that are thought to prolong germination. Yet its germination is quite fast for species with desiccation-tolerant pollen (range: &lt;1 to 60 h). Austrobaileya and other early-divergent angiosperms have relatively rapid pollen germination and short progamic phases, comparable to those of many insect-pollinated monocots and eudicots. These results suggest that both the pollen germination and pollen tube growth periods were marked by acceleration of developmental processes early in angiosperm history. © The Authors 2012.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863651482

However, little is known about how honey abundance in tropical habitats fluctuates with season and how chimpanzees respond to this. For a woodland-savannah habitat inhabited by the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee subspecies, we analyzed monthly proportions of flowering trees and vines as a proxy for honey production. We found a stria negative correlation between flowering and rainfall, probably because pollination benefits from dry conditions. Honey-gathering behavior of the Gashaka-Kwano chimpanzee community was reconstructed from tools abandoned at extraction sites. The apes use sturdy digging sticks and more slender probes, sometimes successively as a tool set, to access honey from subterranean and tree-dwelling colonies of stingless bees and honeybees. Chimpanzees exploited beehives throughout the year. However, during the dry season, when colonies had presumably hoarded more honey, hives were targeted with a greater number of tools. This was not because chimpanzee foraging party sizes had increased. Instead, individual apes used more probes during a given honey-gathering event - suggesting that dipping remained worthwhile for longer. In this situation, as tool tips become soft and unsuitable after prolonged dipping, the chimpanzees need to source new implements that possess hard tool points. The apes did not obtain them by breaking previously used tools into fragments, as these would be too short for successful insertions. We assume this because the average length of tools did not decrease with the increased number of apes that worked a hive. This indicates that each tool is sourced individually from raw material in the surroundings of the extraction site. Chimpanzees thus adjust the use and manufacture of tools to honey abundance, reflecting that the sugary fluid is a sought-after resource. © Society for Tropical Ecology.",Chimpanzee; Flowering; Honey; Honey-gathering; Honeybee; Insectivory; Seasonality; Stingiest bee; Tool use,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881234064

It has recently been shown that new epigenetic variants are generated at a higher rate than genetic variants and several studies have shown that epigenetic variation can be influenced by the environment. Although the heritability of environmentally induced epigenetic traits has gained increasing interest in past years, it is still not clear whether and to what extent induced epigenetic changes have a role in ecology and evolution. Some reports on model and nonmodel species support the possibility of adaptive epigenetic alleles, indicating that epigenetic variants are subject to natural selection. However, most of these studies rely solely on phenotypic data and no information is available about the underlying mechanisms. Thus, the role of inherited epigenetic variation for plant adaptation is unclear and further investigations are required to gain insights into the significance of epigenetic variation for ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we review mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, epigenetic responses to environmental challenges, their inheritance, and their implication for adaptation and plant evolution. © 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881510549

The multivariate analysis indicated that BC1, slash, and loblolly pine have different relationships among the traits studied, suggesting that a separate path analysis was required for each taxon. Path analysis coefficients of determination of the final models were 0.69, 0.73, and 0.65 for the pseudo-backcross, loblolly, and slash pine families, respectively. The ranking of traits by relative magnitude of effect on total growth was, for the pseudo-backcross crown projected area (CPA), fascicle length (FL), number of nodes (NN), number of branches (NB), number of needles per fascicle (NF), and fascicle diameter. For loblolly, this was CPA, NB, FL, NN, NF, initiation, and specific leaf area. For slash, this was CPA, NN, FL, NF, and NB.

Valldemossa km 7.5, ES-07122 Palma, Spain","Apium bermejoi is a critically endangered species that is native to Menorca, an island of 702 km2 located in the western Mediterranean basin. We investigated the reproductive biology of this species and evaluated flowering/fruiting phenology and reproductive output in wild subpopulations over four years (2007-2010). We used ex situ cultivated plants to study floral biology and performed bagging experiments to elucidate the breeding system. We addressed the role of ants in seed dispersal/predation in wild subpopulations by analysing the presence of A. bermejoi seeds in the waste accumulated on the refuse piles of all anthills. Our observations indicated that flowers are protandrous but that there is no dichogamy between flowers within and among umbels of the same individual. Moreover, individuals are mixed in the field because the close germination of several seeds and the plant's caespitose habit promote cross-pollination. Bagging experiments demonstrated that the species is autogamous, and seeds from selfing (bagged with muslin) showed high final germination (&gt;80%). However, the fruit set of selfed umbels (0.3-0.4 per 1) was lower than that of open-pollinated umbels (0.6-0.8 per 1), and the high pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio (3641±133, n= 30) was also indicative of xenogamy. Plants bagged with muslin, bagged with tulle or barred from contact from ants exhibited similar fruit sets, lower than those observed in isolated and control groups, suggesting that anemophily and pollination by flying insects were less effective than ant-based pollination. We identified eight species of floral visitors, and we noted that ants were the most frequent visitors. Although we found some A. bermejoi seeds in the refuse piles of Messor bouvieri anthills, most of the seeds were not damaged (99.1%), and the number of seeds found represents only a small proportion of the overall fruit production. Because sexual reproduction is the main reproductive mechanism of these plants, despite their high potential for space colonisation and vegetative propagation, the reproductive output for each year determines the subpopulation configuration in the following year. © 2012 The Authors.

Using ten polymorphic loci, we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of a genetic structure within a 40 m × 60 m plot in a small (1.0 ha) fragment of Atlantic Rainforest to investigate the processes shaping the distribution of genetic diversity. Individuals (n = 345) from seedlings to adults were grouped and analyzed in four diameter classes. The results showed a high average level of genetic diversity (He = 0.438), but genetic diversity parameters did not vary significantly among cohorts. The spatial distribution pattern analysis of individuals showed significant levels of aggregation among small- and medium-diameter classes and random distribution among the highest diameter class, likely due to processes of competitive thinning. There was an association between demographic and SGS at short distances (less than 10 m) which is likely the consequence of restricted seed dispersal. The degree of SGS decreased across small- to large-diameter classes. We inferred that limited seed dispersal and subsequent density-dependent mortality from the family clusters are responsible for the observed changes in fine-scale SGS across different demographic classes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Cohorts; Genetic diversity; Protium spruceanum; Random thinning; Seedling bank; Spatial patterning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869888412

The mean percentage of flowering per clone which was calculated by dividing the number of flowering ramets by the number of ramets used was low on A. mangium for each season, whereas it was more than 60% on A. auriculiformis for each season, with no significant variations among the seasons. The flowering initiation and flowering period also showed non-significant variations or differences among the seasons and among most of the clones within the seed sources.

The value of the services other than food production, such as flood water buffering, pollination, carbon storage and so on, that land can provide is relatively large compared with the value in reducing environmental burdens from pesticide use, nutrient pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that might arise by farming less intensively. More land will need to be brought into cultivation in order to provide the same amount of food if the intensity of farming is reduced and the resultant loss of ecosystem services (ES) outweighs the reduction in other burdens. Nevertheless, losses of nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), from agriculture are a serious concern and the current cost of the environmental footprint of agriculture is significant compared with the value of the food it produces. This article examines nutrient burdens and analyses the means by which the total environmental burden might be reduced relative to productivity. These include increasing the efficiency of farming, removing constraints to yield, and establishing multiple uses for land at the same time as farming. It concludes that agronomic measures which improve nutrient capture and which obtain more yield per unit area are valuable means to avoid degradation of environmental quality because both nutrient pollution and land consumption can be avoided. © 2012 by the authors.",Crop production; Modelling; Nitrogen use efficiency; Nutrient management; Nutrients; Soil,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872398206

Hypothesis: The pattern and structure of phenotypic variance-covariance matrices of putative adaptive traits differ from those produced by random processes. Population differentiation in quantitative floral traits (QST) of D. inoxia exceeds the magnitude of population differentiation in neutral characters (FST), supporting a selection-driven differentiation scenario. Organism: Datura inoxia Mill. (Solanaceae). Field sites: Six natural populations in Mexico (latitudinal range: 18°48N to 26°41N). Methods: Using different methods (Mantel and modified Mantel tests, jackknife MANOVA, Flury's method, and QST-FST of Whitlock and Guillaume), we contrasted the pattern of phenotypic variance-covariance matrices as well as the magnitude of population differentiation in seven quantitative floral traits, against population structure of D. inoxia in neutral loci (molecular markers). We also contrasted floral characters measures and integration indices with local inbreeding values (FIS) for each population to contrast selection mediated by pollinators and selection of selfing. Conclusions: Datura inoxia populations are genetically structured in both quantitative traits and neutral loci but population differentiation in four of seven floral traits is greater than expected by random differentiation. The strong correlations in characters related to attraction of pollinators and pollen deposition/removal are in agreement with a pattern expected for the adaptive evolution of funnel-shaped corollas in outcrossing species. © 2012 J.

In contrast, 57% of outcrossed flowers produced achenes filled with endosperm, with every capitulum yielding some fertile seeds. Freely visited flowers from a wild population produced 91% fertile achenes, indicating that seed production was not pollinator limited.

Cytological analyses of megasporogenesis revealed that meiosis of the maternal parent was asynchronous. This cytological evidence suggests that 2n eggs result from FDR after treatment with colchicine, as a portion of megaspore mother cells (MMCs) were within the first division at the post-pollination stage.

However, these arguments have downplayed the potentially negative consequences of outbreeding depression once mixed provenances interbreed. In this study, we compared intraspecific F1 hybrid performance and molecular marker differentiation among four populations of Stylidium hispidum, a species endemic to Southwestern Australia. Multivariate ordination of 134 AFLP markers analyzed genetic structure and detected two clusters of paired sites that diverged significantly for marker variation along a latitudinal boundary. To test for outbreeding depression and to determine the consequences of molecular population divergence for hybrid fitness, we conducted controlled pollinations and studied germination and survival for three cross categories (within-population crosses, short- and long-distance F1 hybrids) for paired sites distributed within and between the two genetically differentiated regions. We found evidence of outbreeding depression in long-distance hybrids (111-124 km), and inbreeding depression among progeny of within-population crosses, relative to short-distance (3-10 km) hybrids, suggesting an intermediate optimal outcrossing distance in this species. These results are discussed in light of the evolutionary consequences of mixing seed sources for biodiversity restoration. © 2012 The Authors.

The two groups, unfortunately, became known as ""Gymnosperms"" and ""Angiosperms"", a distinction not made by Brown. The names are, at best, useful only as identifying labels. As is established here, gymno-ovuly and angio-ovuly would have been better words and should serve as the most consistent distinguishing character among groups of seed plants. Although conifers can hardly be claimed to be members of any lineage that led to the Angiosperms, the gymno-ovulate method of reproduction must have occurred in the direct ancestors of flowering plants. Interpolating development and functional evidence serves to resurrect Robert Brown's important but neglected observation and correct misstatements implied in generally accepted systematic terminology. The result of this approach is to discover that the conifers in their reproductive diversity show some trends indicative of those characters that define the flowering plants. Although non-homologous these character manifestations provide useful models which can lead to a better understanding of the origin of ""Angiosperms"" from ""Gymnosperms."" In the complex and extended process of reproductive development in both major groups regular transpositions occur, depending on whether ""gymno-""and ""angio-""are applied to ovules or seeds. Gymno-ovuly and angio-spermy are the most common conditions in conifers but result in intrinsically opposed processes of pollen reception and subsequent seed protection, which are resolved by successive changes in seed-cone structure. The modern conifers illustrate considerable diversity of ovulate and seed cone structure in relation to several biological functions, including traits that anticipate the angio-ovulate condition, in cone inception, ovule enclosure, pollen and embryo development and seed dispersal. From the paleobotanical record we do have a good grasp of the structural changes in the progressive modification of the coniferous seed cone in conifers, starting with the antecedent Carboniferous Cordaitales. These changes have involved the progressive condensation of a lax, branched strobilus and end with the highly condensed uniovulate ""cone"" as in many Podocarpus species in which the equivalent of a bitegmic ovule exists. The progressive changes can be perceived typologically among existing conifers but need to be understood as the result of biological processes that suggest increased reproductive efficiency, and can be added to our present quite robust understanding of conifer phylogeny. © 2012 The New York Botanical Garden.",Angio-ovuly; Angiospermy; Conifer phylogeny; Coniferales; Gymno-ovuly; Gymnospermy; Seed cone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871329080

For example, bumblebees, solitary bees and honeybees, are crucial to the pollination of many of the world's crops and wildflowers, with over 70% of the world's major food crops dependent on the pollination services provided by these insects. The larvae of some butterfly species are considered to be pests; however, together with moth and sawfly larvae, they represent a key dietary component for many farmland birds. Spiders and ground beetles predate on crop pests including aphids, whilst soil macrofauna such as earthworms are vital for soil fertility services and nutrient recycling. Despite their importance, population declines of invertebrates have been observed during the last sixty years in the UK and NW Europe. For example, seven UK bumblebee species are in decline, and in the last 20 years, the species Bombus subterraneus (short-haired bumblebee) has become extinct, whilst there was a 54% decline in honeybee colony numbers in England from 1985 to 2005. Comparable trends have been documented for butterflies with a 23% decline in UK farmland species such as Anthocharis cardamines (orange tip) between 1990 and 2007. These declines have been widely attributed to the modern intensive arable management practices that have been developed to maximise crop yield. For example, loss and fragmentation of foraging and nesting habitats, including species-rich meadows and hedgerows, have been implicated in the decline of bees and butterflies. Increased use of herbicides and fertilisers has caused detrimental effects on many plant species with negative consequences for predatory invertebrates such as spiders and beetles which rely on plants for food and shelter. © 2012 Research Information Ltd.

Disease severity and fumonisin B 1 contamination vary considerably among maize-growing regions and from year to year. A 2year field study was conducted in six locations in the USA, to evaluate the roles of planting date, maize hybrid, rainfall, temperature and insect pests in the variation in fusarium ear rot symptoms and fumonisin B 1 contamination. Grain samples were inspected to determine percentage of kernels with fusarium ear rot symptoms, categorized as 'moulded' or 'starburst'; grain was also analysed by ELISA for fumonisin B 1. Hybrid and planting date frequently had significant effects (P?0·05) on fusarium ear rot and fumonisin B 1 contamination. Earlier planting consistently resulted in lower ear rot severity, fumonisin B 1 levels and insect damage. Mould symptoms were highly correlated with thrips populations (Frankliniella occidentalis) (r=0·78) and with fumonisin B 1 concentration (r=0·89). The starburst symptom was not as closely correlated with thrips (r=0·33) or fumonisin B 1 (r=0·18). A multiple linear regression model identified highly significant effects on fumonisin B 1 for thrips, lower average daily precipitation after flowering, and location. These results strengthen the evidence that locations with high populations of ear-infesting thrips and dry conditions after pollination have an increased risk of fumonisin contamination, and suggest that high fumonisin levels are much more likely in visibly moulded kernels compared to those with 'starburst' symptoms. © 2012 The Authors.

Intraspecific hybridization and purposeful selection were the methods used. Crossing between interspecific hybrids and crossing of interspecific hybrids with sunflower cultivars or lines were applied. Self-pollination, sib-pollination, backcross with pollen from cultivated sunflower and pollination with pollen from different interspecific hybrids were carried out. Phytopathological and biochemical evaluation of seeds and plants and morphological characterization of sunflower forms, lines and hybrids were performed. New sunflower forms and lines were created as a result of this investigation. A greater part of them possess resistance to downy mildew, phomopsis, phoma and alternaria, tolerance to sclerotinia and full resistance to the different races of the parasite broomrape. The new forms were distinguished by new plant architecture, different vegetation period and seeds with different size and coloration. New B/A and R lines having high combining ability and seed oil and fatty acid contents were obtained. Fifteen sources of cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) were obtained from interspecific hybrid forms, as were 251 sources of genes for restoration of fertility (Rf genes). Five new hybrid cultivars of the oilseed type that were obtained on the basis of these lines were created and registered.

In the progeny, 45 triploids were determined by both flow cytometric analysis and somatic chromosome counting. The period 66-72 h after pollination was the most suitable for high temperature-induced triploid production during embryo sac development in the 'Zheyin3#'. Cytological analysis showed that the frequency of eight-nucleate embryo sacs rose at an increased rate during 66-78 h after pollination, which suggested that the third mitosis during embryo sac development could be the optimal stage for high temperature-induced triploid production. The highest frequency of triploid production was 40%, which was obtained in the 44°C for 2 h treatment 72 h after pollination. In view of both triploid number and production efficiency, treatments with 41 °C for 4-6 h or with 44°C for 2 h during 66-72 h after pollination were both effective for triploid induction in 'Zheyin3#'.

The results of the study show 24% increase in the leaf chlorophyll as the irrigation carried out after 140 mm evaporation from the evaporation pan in comparison to the irrigation after 50 mm evaporation. In addition, there was 129% increase in the stomatal resistance as the irrigation performed after 170 mm evaporation from the evaporation pan in comparison to 50 mm evaporation. Irrigation after 170 mm evaporation from the evaporation pan in plant establishment stage and branching caused 23 and 45% reduction in the number of stomata and 18 and 27% reduction in the size of stomata in the leaf abbaxial. Irrigation after 80, 110, 140 and 170 mm evaporation from the evaporation pan led to 17.65, 34.09, 50.18 and 59.02% reduction in grain yield. The stress practiced at the plant establishment, branching, and flowering stages caused 50.91, 38.51 and 32.29% reduction in grain yield compared to the irrigation after 50 mm evaporation. As stress practiced, for delay in irrigation, on the basis of 1 mm evaporation from the evaporation pan 3.03 units of grain yield were decreased. The results show that low levels of water application before pollination lead to decrease in the grain yield. Amaranth yields 3 t/ha in natural conditions, whereas in the most severe drought conditions it decreases to 1 t/ha which is a high yield in comparison to other crops. Thus, it requires more attention to this new crop.",Amaranth; Drought; Growth stage; New crop; Physiological traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879855616

Loss of honeybee has been observed in the Kashmir valley of India, too. The lipid peroxidation, known to cause oxidative stress/damage, was found to be increased in nervous system of Apis mellifera exposed to chlorpyrifos. Further exacerbation of chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative damage was observed in ·OH-generated H2O2 system. The ·OH radical scavenger, DMSO, mitigated the initiation of lipid peroxidation mediated by either H2O2 or CPF. The DMSO also repressed the combined oxidative effect of H2O2 and chlorpyrifos on the nervous system. Findings suggest that oxidative stress/damage caused by chlorpyrifos in honeybee nervous system accomplished the toxic ·OH build up, which successively provides a possible mechanism for chlorpyrifos neurotoxicity and its mitigation by ·OH scavenging biomolecules. Elevated malondialdehyde may possibly serve as an indicator of neurooxidative stress in bees and their loss due to chlorpyrifos- contaminated environment. © 2012 Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science and Springer.",Apis mellifera; Chlorpyriphos neurotoxicity; Dimethylsulfoxide; Honeybee; Hydrogen peroxide; Hydroxyl radical; Lipid peroxidation; Malondialdehyde; Oxidative damage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873275953

We first define Diversified Farming Systems (DFS) as farming practices and landscapes that intentionally include functional biodiversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales in order to maintain ecosystem services that provide critical inputs to agriculture, such as soil fertility, pest and disease control, water use efficiency, and pollination. We explore to what extent DFS overlap or are differentiated from existing concepts such as sustainable, multifunctional, organic or ecoagriculture. DFS are components of social-ecological systems that depend on certain combinations of traditional and contemporary knowledge, cultures, practices, and governance structures. Further, as ecosystem services are generated and regenerated within a DFS, the resulting social benefits in turn support the maintenance of the DFS, enhancing its ability to provision these services sustainably. We explore how social institutions, particularly alternative agri-food networks and agrarian movements, may serve to promote DFS approaches, but note that such networks and movements have other primary goals and are not always explicitly connected to the environmental and agroecological concerns embodied within the DFS concept. We examine global trends in agriculture to investigate to what extent industrialized forms of agriculture are replacing former DFS, assess the current and potential contributions of DFS to food security, food sovereignty and the global food supply, and determine where and under what circumstances DFS are expanding rather than contracting. © 2012 by the author(s).",Agroecology; Ecological diversification; Food justice; Food sovereignty; Industrialized agriculture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871979462

Current methods for examining their nest structure, such as natal cells and contents of storage cells, are destructive in nature because the cells need to be opened for physical inspections. This research describes how the internal structures of the artificial nests of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L.

For the first time, B. terrestris nest structures, and their contents such as larvae, pupae and eggs, were non-invaseively viewed and assessed. This technique will enable future experiments to take morphological measurements of egg, larval, and pupal development over time. Moreover, combining these measurements with measures of food-storage will provide a good assessment of colony health. The method will also allow tracking of individually marked adults, to monitor their behaviour and help gain a better understanding of the processes involved in the global declines of B. terrestris, which will in turn promote better management of these valuable pollinators. © This is an open access paper.

DH onion lines were produced from diverse highly heterozygous material in development within the Cornell onion breeding program. These DH lines were evaluated in multiple replicated trials in onion fields in New York as lines and as parents of hybrids to assess the impact and commercial potential of DH onions. Twenty DH onion lines were compared with open-pollinated cultivars developed from the same source germplasm and with a commercial hybrid over two years. The vegetative vigor of the DH lines was comparable to that of related openpollinated cultivars, showing minimal, if any, inbreeding depression. Two sets of hybrids were produced using the DH lines as males and two different females that are the female parents of the commercial hybrid controls. Therefore, hybrids in each set are half-sibs, and any performance differences are attributable to their DH male lines. In four replicated trials of these hybrids and controls, the experimental hybrids were either not significantly different or significantly better in measures of vegetative vigor compared with conventional half-sib hybrid controls. The vegetative vigor of DH lines, and their derived hybrids, might result from selection of plantlets without deleterious sublethal genes during gynogenesis. The shortened development timeand equivalent quality ofDH lines compared with the traditionally bred onion inbreds warrant their use.

The half-sibling families were planted at two sites in western Kentucky and southeastern Missouri. The six full-sibling families, generated from selections based on exhibition of parental disease resistance and susceptibility to a variety of diseases, were also planted near Stoneville, MS at the US Forest Service Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research. All full-sibling families planted at the Stoneville site were inoculated in the fall 2002 with the leaf-scorch-causing bacterium, Xylella fastidiosa. Diameter and height data for trees of both half- and full-sibling families were recorded at ages three, five, seven, and nine at the various sites. Bacterial leaf scorch disease presence was also recorded as symptomatic or asymptomatic/ mildly symptomatic. Average family heritability across ages was 0.58, 0.50, and 0.55 for height, diameter, and volume, respectively, indicating that increased growth traits can be gained from family selection. In conjunction with derived age-age correlations, selection based on age-five data results in the greatest gain per unit time for age nine gains for half-sibling families. Breeding for bacterial leaf scorch resistance can also be successfully undertaken if proper selection and breeding of two resistant parents are undertaken which can result in a 4.5 fold decrease in the probability in symptoms of offspring by age nine. Results indicate a large potential for increased growth and disease resistance in American sycamore through traditional breeding.",Bacterial leaf scorch; Disease resistance; Genetic gain; Selection; Sycamore,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889594816

They are involved in the attraction of seed dispersers and pollinators, the repellence of enemies via direct or indirect mechanisms and the induction of defence systems in other parts of the same plant or in other plants in the vicinity (Dudareva et al., 2006). It has been shown previously that the VOCs spectrum emitted by plants hardly depends on their physiological state (Kant et al., 2009). However those phenomenons were poorly studied at the edaphic level. Thus, the Rhizovol project, a multidisciplinary project in Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech was set up to study the emissions of VOCs by plant roots and their interactions with other organisms of the rhizosphere. As a partner of this project, the Plant Pathology Unit of Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech chose to study the effect of a fungal infection on the profile of VOCs emitted by plant roots, based on three model organisms, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), since it is a major crop in Belgium that can suffer a large range of aggressions, and two pathogenic fungi, Cochliobolus sativus and Fusarium culmorum, responsible for root and foot rots and seedling blight on cereals (Wiese, 1977). Later in the development, C. sativus produces elongate brown-black lesions (spot blotch) and F. culmorum induces head blight and produces mycotoxins that make the grain unsuitable for consumption (Nielsen et al., 2011). The objective of this work was to identify the VOCs emitted during the dual interactions between barley roots and a pathogenic fungus. The study was performed in two steps; first, the independent analyses of the VOCs emitted by each of the partners (C. sativus, F. culmorum and healthy barley roots), then the analyses of the VOCs spectrum emitted during dual interactions.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882935426

While all of these populations were recorded in full bloom during February and March, they displayed a temporal scatter. Detailed studies revealed these population types to be morphologically similar but distinct in the many aspects studied. An interesting phenomenon noted for the plants of this species was in situ pollen germination, which was recorded in about 28.8% of the flowers studied. The species under investigation also showed an appreciable amount of ovule abortion. The ovule abortion in pistils was found to be non-random, with the peduncular ovule aborting at a higher rate than the stylar one. The rates and patterns of ovule abortion were studied vis-à-vis in situ pollen germination and were compared between different populations. Interesting results were obtained, indicative of the fact that precocious pollen germination does affect the ovule abortion in one way or other. © Indian Academy of Sciences.",Anther dehiscence; In situ pollen germination; Open pollination; Ovule abortion; Unassisted selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876425618

There was a strong interaction of progenies x locations, which led to obtaining estimates within each location. Broad variation was observed in inbreeding depression, with mean values of 6.7% and 13.4%, comparing AU progenies with PL progenies. It was observed that the population has high potential for selecting promising inbred lines.

Among stingless bees, Tetragonisca angustula is widely distributed in tropical habitats, and has been considered an important pollinator of different plant families. To support a rational economic use of this group, there is a need to characterize the plant species that represent important sources as part of their diet, as preferred, alternative or casual food sources. The aim of this survey was to distinguish the plant species that T. angustula visited most often. The study was undertaken in four regions of the Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil) over a year from March 2008 to February 2009. For this, we collected bees, flowering plants and bee pollen loads from the four sites, and evaluated pollen morphology in the laboratory. Field observations showed the presence of plants belonging to ten different families and pollen loads showed the presence of pollen types belonging to 26 plant families. There were strong differences between pollen types, especially regarding pollen grain shape. The present survey suggests a high value of these plant species as trophic resources for the T. angustula in the understory of Atlantic Rainforest.

Multiple individuals within each family were genotyped and phenotyped, which facilitated a comparison of standard association testing methods and an alternative method developed to relate markers to additive genetic effects. Narrow-sense heritability estimates indicated there was significant additive genetic variance within this population for assessment traits (?2=0.28 to 0.44) and genetic correlations between the three traits were negligible to moderate (rG = 0.08 to 0.50). The significance of association tests (p values) were compared for four different analyses based on two different approaches: (1) two software packages were used to fit standard univariate mixed models that include SNP-fixed effects, (2) bivariate and multivariate mixed models including each SNP as an additional selection trait were used. Within either the univariate or multivariate approach, correlations between the tests of significance approached +1; however, correspondence between the two approaches was less strong, although between-approach correlations remained significantly positive. Similar SNP markers would be selected using multivariate analyses and standard marker-trait association methods, where the former facilitates integration into the existing genetic analysis systems of applied breeding programs and may be used with either single markers or indices of markers created with genomic selection processes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Corymbia; Genetic correlation; Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); Tests of association,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869880427

The silent epigenetic marks should, however, be excluded from active genes. By genetic approaches, we study mechanisms to remove the heterochromatin marks from transcribed genes. Based on our observations on control of TE transcription, we propose a possible trigger for the TE-specific accumulation of DNA methylation. A critical difference between TEs and genes could be their responses to the DNA methylation in the internal part of transcribed regions. When their internal region is methylated, genes are still transcribed, but TEs could be silenced, which may reflect the obligatory position of every critical cisacting element within the TE itself. This initial difference of TEs and genes will be amplified by positive feedback loops to stabilize active or silent states. Thus, the mechanisms to accumulate heterochromatin marks within transcribed regions could provide a trigger to induce differential DNA methylation between genes and TEs. © 2012 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881484905

Detection of the canopy coverage at tree level provides information about the growth capacity of the tree and enables estimation of the possible yield or the influence of reduced water supply in an orchard. Detection must be performed in an automated mode that may be achieved by means of two optical approaches: NIR image analysis, with the calculation of leaf coverage within the image versus non-covered area, and counting the number of laser-scanner (LiDAR) hits per tree. The present study, conducted in an experimental orchard of 180 plum trees, aimed to evaluate and compare these methods using a vertical top-down viewing direction for the sensors. Image analysis showed a higher susceptibility to the sensor mounting height and tilting movements of the carrier vehicle than did the LiDAR measurements. However, on uniform terrain, a Pearson correlation of 0.917 between the systems could be achieved. Both techniques were compared with the manually counted number of leaves per tree for the entire orchard and with the estimated total leaf area for 30 strategically distributed trees. Due to different shapes of the tree crown, the comparison with the leaf numbers yielded lower Pearson correlations for the pollinator cultivar (0.703 with LiDAR, 0.668 with camera) than for the productive trees (0.805 with LiDAR, 0.832 with camera).

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to dietary imidacloprid in feeder syrup at dosages between 0.08 and 125?gl-1. Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10-30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10?gl-1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent. We emphasise that our study does not suggest that honey bee colonies are invulnerable to dietary imidacloprid under field conditions, but our findings do raise new concern about the impact of agricultural neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Apis mellifera; Bombus terrestris; Detoxification; Neonicotinoid; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870240538

The ants feed on the mutualistic fig-pollinating wasps as well as on parasitic non-pollinating fig wasps. Nevertheless fig-wasps may not constitute a sufficient food source to ensure permanent presence of ants on the tree as the ants were observed to be frequently associated with hemipterans such as coccids and aphids. Fig wasps seem to constitute a reliable and sufficient food source on some dioecious Ficus species. On the contrary, in monoecious Ficus species, resident ants have always been observed to tend homopteran in addition to feeding on fig wasps. Frequent fruiting, prolonged fruit ripening period, ramiflory and rapid growth could constitute traits facilitating strong association based on fig-wasps' consumption of the monoecious F. subpisocarpa with ants.

We examined population genetic structure, sex-specific dispersal patterns, and morphology in relation to rainfall patterns across an island and three peninsulas in South Australia. The study system was the New Holland Honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), a nectarivorous passerine that is a key pollinator species. We predicted that rainfall-related mechanisms would be driving local adaptation of morphological traits, such that in areas of lower rainfall, where nectar is less available, more insectivorous traits - shorter, deeper bills, longer tarsi, and longer wings - would be favored. The study populations differed in phenotype across the Eyre, Yorke, and Fleurieu Peninsulas and Kangaroo Island despite high gene flow (single continuous population) and sex-biased dispersal (males were philopatric and females dispersed). We tested the role of rainfall in shaping the observed phenotypic differences, and found strong support for our predicted relationships: birds in areas of higher rainfall had higher condition indices, as well as longer bill-head length, deeper bills, and shorter tarsi. Bill depth in males in high-rainfall sites showed signals of stabilizing selection, suggesting local adaptation. In addition to these local indications of selection, a global pattern of directional selection toward larger size for bill-head length, bill-nostril length, and wing length was also observed. We suggest this pattern may reflect an adaptive response to the relatively dry conditions that South Australia has experienced over the last decade. We conclude that rainfall has shaped aspects of phenology in P. novaehollandiae, both locally, with different patterns of stabilizing and directional selection, and globally, with evidence of adaptive divergence at a landscape scale. © 2012 The Authors.",Adaptation; Birds; Natural selection and contemporary evolution; Population ecology; Population genetics - empirical,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875054138

Theory and models have explored how population size can affect invasion probability and dynamics. In contrast, there have been few studies of small population size and invasions in the wild, especially for plants. Here, we identified 21 naturally-occurring small populations of the invasive annual grass Lolium multiflorum to elucidate the effects of population size on plant reproduction and potential invasiveness. We compared seed production of focal plants to three attributes of the population: population size, a focal plant's floret neighborhood (a measure of the size and pollen production of nearby potential pollen donors), and focal plant size. Population size and floret neighborhood were weighted by inter-plant distance to account for variation in density and spatial arrangement. Variation among populations in the proportion of florets producing a seed was explained by population size and floret neighborhood. In contrast, the focal plant's size did not significantly affect the seed production proportion. A decrease in reproduction due to the size and density of the population (while accounting for maternal size) is an Allee effect, which may limit the ability to predict invasion risks and rates early in the invasion process, particularly if the effect is not recognized. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Allee effect; Invasive species; Pollen limitation; Seed abortion; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868313347

The seed development from pollination to maturity in sunflower takes 50-60% (60 days) of the life cycle duration (120-150 days). This technique allows the production of fertile plants from immature embryos of 11 sunflower genotypes. Immature embryos of 10-12 days after pollination were dissected from seed grown plants (SGP), were transferred into MS medium allowing shoot and root development for 5-10 days. Young plantlets were transferred to soil, developed to maturity and were then self pollinated and set seed. The first cycle of immature embryo raised plants (IERP) was obtained. The four cycles of IERP were obtained from immature embryo culture technique in contrast to one generation per year with conventional breeding. The majority of cultured embryos developed into vigorous plantlets with 3-6 leaves. Out of 1320 immature embryos, the average response of the explants were 92.1% (1216). The 75% of the developed plantlets had vigorous roots and were transplanted into viol containing 1:1:2 peat: perlite: soil mixture (v/v) at 24 ± 2oC in 16h/8 h (light/dark) in the growth chamber. The only 70.3% of them was grown to maturity, self-pollinated and set seed. The overall result was average 40-45 regenerated and matured plants per 100 immature zygotic embryos. The regenerated plants also showed no morphological changes. The analysis of variance for all agronomic characters (plant height, head diameter, number of leaves, stem diameter, number of branches and seed number per head) taken from the mean of four generations in vitro grown plants resulted in significant differences among genotypes at 5% level.

The objective of this study was to determine seed germination potential and seedling vigor of Palmarosa varieties under four temperature regimes at daily 16 h light/8 h dark regimes. At 25°C, germination percentage was highest for variety PRC-1 (67.8%), followed by varieties Tripta (59.3%), Trishna (57.5%), and Vaishnavi (35.5%). The mean for seedling vigor index I was highest for Trishna (277.7), followed by Tripta (259.3), PRC-1 (256.2), and Vaishnavi (140.4). However, vigor index II mean was highest for Tripta (0.2826), followed by PRC-1 (0.2615), Trishna (0.2600), and Vaishnavi (0.1388). Regardless of variety ranking by vigor index I vs. index II, the highest seedling vigor for all varieties was at 25°C using either index. However, since mass is a better indicator of seedling growth/health than length, vigor index II (based on mass) would give a better indication of early seedling vigor than index I (based on length). The low germination percentage and vigor of Vaishnavi is attributable to the genetic constitution of this self-pollinating variety. Significant decreases in germination percentage and vigor index I and II were observed at 20°C, 30°C, and 35°C. Days 2-3 and days 5-6 after sowing were the ideal times for making the first and final germination count, respectively.

We examined these relationships using the predominantly insect-pollinated Eucalyptus socialis. Progeny were collected from trees located in three increasingly disturbed landscapes in southern Australia and were planted out in common garden experiments. We show that individual mating patterns were increasingly impacted by lower conspecific density caused by habitat fragmentation. We determined that reduced pollen diversity probably has effects over and above those of inbreeding on progeny fitness. This provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for the indirect density dependence often inferred between conspecific density and offspring fitness. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",density dependence; global change; plant genetic resources; plant mating systems; revegetation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870943423

Concerns regarding gene flow from genetically modified (GM) crops to non-GM crops have stimulated research to estimate outcrossing in wheat prior to the release and commercialization of any transgenic cultivars. The aim is to ensure that coexistence of all types of wheat with GM wheat is feasible in accordance with current regulations. The present study describes the result of a field experiment under the semi-arid climate conditions of Madrid, Spain, at two locations (""La Canaleja"" and ""El Encin"" experimental stations) in Madrid over a 3-year period, from 2005 to 2007. The experimental design consisted of a 50 × 50 m wheat pollen source sown with wheat cultivars resistant to the herbicide chlortoluron ('Deganit' and 'Castan' respectively) and three susceptible receptor cultivars ('Abental', 'Altria' and 'Recital') sown in replicated 1 × 1 m plots at different distances (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 100 m) and four directions. Outcrossing rates were measured as a percentage of herbicide-resistant hybrids using an herbicide-screening assay. Outcrossing was greatest near the pollen source, averaging 0.029 % at 0 m distance at ""La Canaleja"" and 0.337 % at ""El Encin"", both below the 0.9 % European Union regulated threshold, although a maximum outcrossing rate of 3.5 % was detected in one recipient plot. These percentages declined rapidly as the distance increased, but hybrids were detected at different rates at distances of up to 100 m, the maximum distance of the experiment. Environmental conditions, as drought in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, may have influenced the extent of outcrossing. These assays carried out in wheat under semi-arid conditions in Europe provide a more complete assessment of pollen-mediated gene flow in this crop. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870382521

The following question was asked: are functional response traits and plant community strategies indicators of TAA (time since agricultural land use abandonment), thus of a specific succession stage. Indirect gradient analysis (DCA) was used in order to observe the position of the relevés along the axis and to correlate it with TAA. It was found that the position of relevés on DCA axis 1 is our proxy for TAA. Correlations (Spearman's rho) between the occurrence of plant functional traits and TAA were performed. Low-growing herb species with scleromorphic leaves and green or red flowers are the predominant plant type on grassland areas, while plant species with digitate, hydro or mesomorphic leaves and white flowers typically prevail in forest. The proportion of chamaephytes increases immediately after land abandonment (afforestation). In a closed forest stand, there are many more herb species with vegetative propagation (bulbils). Herbal species in those stands most often reward pollinators with pollen. The ecological strategy of the entire plant community changes with spontaneous afforestation.

Harvest period began seven days after pollination and was performed on 10 occasions. The genotypes had higher seed yields per head and larger 1,000-seed weights in Serbia. The highest seed yield per head was produced by the genotype Ha-121. The yield grew gradually until the midpoint of the period studied, but only the first three dates produced yields significantly lower than those from the dates after the three earliest ones. In Serbia, there was also a significant decrease of yield on latest harvesting dates. The genotype Ha-121 had the largest average of 1,000-seed weight. Harvesting dates revealed a quadratic regression, with some maximum yields being recorded at seed moisture levels of 40% or more, especially in Serbia. At both sites, 1,000-seed weight grew for the most part in a linear fashion until the very last of the harvesting dates.

A fundamental assumption used for existing multilocus analysis approaches is Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at which maternally- and paternally-derived gametes unite randomly during fertilization. Given the fact that natural populations are rarely panmictic, these approaches will have a significant limitation for practical use. We present a robust model for multilocus linkage disequilibrium analysis which does not rely on the assumption of random mating. This new disequilibrium model capitalizes on Weir's definition of zygotic disequilibria and is based on an open-pollinated design in which multiple maternal individuals and their half-sib families are sampled from a natural population. This design captures two levels of associations: one is at the upper level that describes the pattern of cosegregation between different loci in the parental population and the other is at the lower level that specifies the extent of co-transmission of non-alleles at different loci from parents to their offspring. An MCMC method was implemented to estimate genetic parameters that define these associations. Simulation studies were used to validate the statistical behavior of the new model. © 2012 Liu, Wang, Wang, Li and Wu.",Gametic linkage disequilibrium; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; Molecular marker; Non-equilibrium population; Zygotic linkage disequilibrium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876040010

We evaluated annual patterns of basal-area and height growth of coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotusga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings from four seed sources that were planted in four diverse environments as part of the Douglas-fir Seed-Source Movement Trial. Stem diameters and heights were measured periodically during the 2010 growing season on 16 open-pollinated families at each study installation. Stem diameters were measured on a subset of trees with electronic dendrometers during the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. Trees from the four seed sources differed in phenology metrics that described the timing of basal-area and height-growth initiation, growth cessation and growth rates. Differences in the height-growth metrics were generally larger than differences in the basal-area growth metrics and differences among installations were larger than differences among seed sources, highlighting the importance of environmental signals on growth phenology. Variations in the height- and basal-area growth metrics were correlated with different aspects of the seed-source environments: precipitation in the case of height growth and minimum temperature in the case of basal-area growth. The detailed dendrometer measurements revealed differences in growth patterns between seed sources during distinct periods in the growing season. Our results indicate that multiple aspects of growth phenology should be considered along with other traits when evaluating adaptation of populations to future climates. © 2012 The Author 2012.",Adaptation; assisted migration; budburst; cambium; dormancy; genecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871184063

The diet of P. viridans was composed exclusively of arthropods (spiders 32%, insects 68%). Body length of prey was 5.9 ± 1.0 mm, and prey size range was 11.0 ± 0.4 mm (i.e. 0.14-1.3 times larger than the spider). Based on feeding frequency and time available for prey capture and feeding, one spider may capture up to 3.9 prey items per day, depending on the time of year. From June to October 1998 we tested the number of floral visits affected by the presence or absence of spiders (visual effect). Four treatments were tested on inflorescences: (1) no spiders, (2) with spider, (3) with modified spider (carapace painted red), and (4) with decoy spider. We found two patterns depending on the response of floral visitors to ""invisible"" spider treatments (with and no spiders) and ""visible"" spider treatments (painted and decoy). These patterns were closely associated with the abundance of visitors. Using panicle enclosures, we estimated the effect of spider presence on seed set. In months with lower abundance of floral visitors (June, July and October), panicles without spiders had significantly more seeds than those with spiders. Whereas in August and September, the months with the highest number of floral visitors, there were no significant differences between treatments. Our results suggest that floral visitors were able to recognize visible spiders and avoid the inflorescences that have them, but were unable to recognize the presence of unpainted P. viridans. Since many of those visitors are potential pollinators, spider presence may indirectly decrease seed set by C. multilobus on months when floral visitors are less abundant.",Extrafloral nectaries; Mexico; Tritrophic systems; Veracruz,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872543042

A seed stock collected in the same six populations was also grown in a greenhouse to control for possible environmental variability. Floral VOC emissions of both the wild and greenhouse-grown plants were sampled using the dynamic headspace sampling technique. VOCs were identified and quantified using a GC-MS-FID. The variability in the flower scent of A. majus was mostly explained by systematic differences between the subspecies, both in the wild-grown and in the greenhouse-grown plants. The qualitative and quantitative differences in flower scent between the two subspecies were reproducible among the populations. The floral emissions were more variable in the wild plants than in the greenhouse-grown plants, but we failed to explain this variability by available micrometeorological variables.

These discoveries have led to increased clarity on the molecular pathology of disease and have also demonstrated considerable overlap in the genetic roots of human diseases. In light of this large genetic overlap, we tested whether cross-disease research approaches lead to faster, more impactful discoveries.Methods: We leveraged several gene-disease association databases to calculate a Mutual Citation Score (MCS) for 10,853 pairs of genetically related diseases to measure the frequency of cross-citation between research fields. To assess the importance of cooperative research, we computed an Individual Disease Cooperation Score (ICS) and the average publication rate for each disease.Results: For all disease pairs with one gene in common, we found that the degree of genetic overlap was a poor predictor of cooperation (r2=0.3198) and that the vast majority of disease pairs (89.56%) never cited previous discoveries of the same gene in a different disease, irrespective of the level of genetic similarity between the diseases. A fraction (0.25%) of the pairs demonstrated cross-citation in greater than 5% of their published genetic discoveries and 0.037% cross-referenced discoveries more than 10% of the time. We found strong positive correlations between ICS and publication rate (r2=0.7931), and an even stronger correlation between the publication rate and the number of cross-referenced diseases (r2=0.8585). These results suggested that cross-disease research may have the potential to yield novel discoveries at a faster pace than singular disease research.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the frequency of cross-disease study is low despite the high level of genetic similarity among many human diseases, and that collaborative methods may accelerate and increase the impact of new genetic discoveries. Until we have a better understanding of the taxonomy of human diseases, cross-disease research approaches should become the rule rather than the exception. © 2012 Duda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870060365

To date, the impact of plant population size on pollen collection by pollinators has not yet been investigated. From 2008 to 2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus hortorum s.l., Bombus hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s.l., Bombus vestalis s.l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m2 to over 3.1 ha. Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and especially the proportion of individuals of large bumble bee species diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel observation was that bumble bees seemed to switch foraging behaviour according to population size: while they collected both pollen and nectar in large populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee species, which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen loads of bumble bees we found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant population size but rather on the extent shrub cover and/or openness of the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species (V. uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in small populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum, nevertheless, it provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and declining populations of this plant could have negative effects for its pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen collection when plant populations become small is of interest when considering plant and bumble bee conservation. © 2012 Mayer et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870272335

Generally, the flower phenology, flower life span, and pollination success are important features for plant species evolution and conservation. Those features in Phaius delavayi were studied detailed in 2005-2007 in Huanglong Valley, Sichuan. The results showed that the plants have 3 or 4 leaves, and the largest leaf were 16.9-17.5 cm long, 4.8 -4.9 cm wide. The inflorescence is sparsely 1-7-flowered (with mean 3), exceeding height of leaves, 18.4-19.5 cm. Flowers widely opening, with 1.9-2.2 cm long, 1.1 cm wide labellum, and 1.0-1.2 cm long spur. Length of the leaf and floral traits were not significant different, as well as flower phenology during three years. Fruits were 20.78 mm long, 8.10 mm wide, and 00424 g weight. The inflorescence growth began in mid May and last about 50 days, continued until early July. Flowering began in mid June and last about 6-7 weeks, continued until late July/early August, with 80%-90% flowers flowered in a peak time (last about 10 days) in early July. Life span of inflorescences showed considerable variation among years, which were 23, 21, and 29 days for 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively. The flower life span was closely correlated with pollination, that with successful pollination was 15-19 days, significantly shorter than that of flowers without pollination (17-22 days). Fruit maturity was in mid-latter September, and the leaves were yellow and withered. The results of pollinia viability and stigma receptivity experiments showed that the flowers are self-compatible, but the reproductive success is strictly dependent on visitation by pollinia vectors (Bombus hypnorum and B. lepidus), and there is no autogamy and apogamy in this speices. The stigma has receptivity at the first day of flowering, and can last about 15 days, and lost receptivity completely 20 days after flowering. The fruit set was higher 1-10 days after flowering than that 15 days after flowering. The pollinia has also viability at the first day of flowering, and can last about 15 days, lost viability completely 20 days after flowering, but there was no differences in pollinia viability during one to 15 days. The lost of stigma receptivity was sharper than that of pollinia viability. The pollinia viability and stigma receptivity can last even to the flower withered. Reproductive success showed considerable variation among years and was decline with year. The pollinia removal and nature fruit set were 18%-51% and 10%-36%, respectively, and spraying of pesticides in Huanglong Valley may play a role for the declination of pollination success.",Breeding system; Conservation; Flower phenology; Fruit set; Phaius delavayi; Pollinia removal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869442900

On 76 flowers, we found 252 specimens belonging to 37 families and 57 species of crustaceans (Classes Maxillopoda, Ostracoda and Malacostraca), of which 15 were new records for the region. Annelids (mainly polychaetes) were less abundant (60 specimens) and less diverse (13 species), and they exhibited no obvious differences in their visits to male flowers with or without pollen. Negative consequences for seagrass reproductive success by the consumption of pollen were most likely insignificant, because the quantities of removed pollen were very small. However, many crustaceans and polychaetes had pollen embedded in mucilage attached to their body parts after visiting a male flower with pollen. Thus, these invertebrates may serve as pollinators of T. testudinum when visiting female flowers. © Inter-Research 2012.",Crustacea; Meso-grazer; Polychaeta; Seagrass,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870168665

The study of insect biogeography became necessary because insects possess numerous evolutionary traits and play an important role as pollinators. Among insects, the euglossine bees, or orchid bees, attract interest because the study of their biology allows us to explain important steps in the evolution of social behavior and many other adaptive tradeoffs. We analyzed the distribution of morphological characteristics in Colombian orchid bees from an ecological perspective. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of these attributes on a regional basis. Data corresponding to Colombian euglossine species were ordered with a correspondence analysis and with subsequent hierarchical clustering. Later, and based on community proprieties, we compared the resulting hierarchical model with the collection localities to seek to identify a biogeographic classification pattern. From this analysis, we derived a model that classifies the territory of Colombia into 11 biogeographic units or natural clusters. Ecological assumptions in concordance with the derived classification levels suggest that species characteristics associated with flight performance, nectar uptake, and social behavior are the factors that served to produce the current geographical structure. © 2012 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.",Beta diversity; biogeography; community ecology; correspondence analysis; euglossine bees; SHE analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869223137

To explain the asymmetrical introgression observed between two bumblebee-pollinated plant species (Rhinanthus angustifolius and R. minor), we focused on post-pollination barriers and ethological isolation of hybrids. • Methods: We studied pollen competition in conspecific and heterospecific crosses on both species and analyzed germination rates of hybrid and pure seeds. We also measured bumblebee visitation rates to hybrids relative to their parents using potted Rhinanthus placed in populations of each parental species. • Key results: In mixed pollinations, there was a conspecific siring advantage in both species, but no difference in pollen tube growth rates in either cross type. F 1 seeds with a R. angustifolius maternal plant germinated poorly, while those with R. minor as the maternal parent germinated better than pure seeds. Interestingly, bumblebees treated hybrids almost as equal to the background species and more often rejected the nonresident Rhinanthus. In a R. angustifolius background, bumblebees preferred R. angustifolius, but visited hybrids more often than R. minor. In contrast, visitation rates were similar on a R. minor background. • Conclusions: Our results suggest that hybridization rates in Rhinanthus remain low because of several leaky barriers that make R. minor the maternal parent of most F 1 offspring.

Despite its importance as a genetic resource in buckwheat breeding, the genetic variation of F. homotropicum is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships of the diploid and tetraploid forms of F. homotropicum based on the nucleotide sequences of a nuclear gene, AGAMOUS (AG). Neighborjoining analysis revealed that representative individuals clustered into three large groups (Group I, II and III). Each group contained diploid and tetraploid forms of F. homotropicum. We identified tetraploid plants that had two diverged AG sequences; one belonging to Group I and the other belonging to Group II, or one belonging to Group II and the other belonging to Group III. These results suggest that the tetraploid form originated from at least two hybridization events between deeply differentiated diploids. The results also imply that the genetic diversity contributed by tetraploidization of differentiated diploids may have allowed the distribution range of F. homotropicum to expand to the northern areas of China.",Buckwheat; Fagopyrum homotropicum; Genetic diversity; Phylogenetic relationship; Plant genetic resources; Tetraploidization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869028111

However, currently there is very little knowledge about whether germination failure acts as a reproductive barrier in hybridizing orchid species. • Methods: In this study, we investigated germination and protocorm development of pure and hybrid seeds of three species of the orchid genus Dactylorhiza. To test the hypothesis that germination failure contributed to total reproductive isolation, reproductive barriers based on germination were combined with already available data on early acting barriers (fruit set and embryo mortality) to calculate the relative and absolute contributions of these barriers to reproductive isolation. • Key Results: Protocorms were formed in all crosses, indicating that both hybrid and pure seeds were able to germinate and grow into protocorms. Also, the number of protocorms per seed packet was not significantly different between hybrid and pure seeds. High fruit set, high seed viability, and substantial seed germination resulted in very low reproductive isolation (average RI = 0.05). In two of six interspecific crosses, hybrids performed even better than the intraspecific crosses. • Conclusions: Very weak postmating reproductive barriers were observed between our study species and may explain the frequent occurrence of first-generation hybrids in mixed Dactylorhiza populations. Germination failure, which is regarded as one of the most important bottlenecks in the orchid life cycle, was not important for reproductive isolation. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Crossing experiment; Dactylorhiza fuchsii; Dactylorhiza incarnata; Dactylorhiza praetermissa; Hybridization; Postzygotic postmating barrier; Prezygotic postmating barrier; Protocorm; Seed baiting,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869061499

Seeds were first germinated on medium containing a leaf-disc from four different Quercus species, previously infected with Mycena osmundicola. Among the four species tested, Q. acutissima was determined to be the best organic resource and the germination rate reached up to 40. 4% when a leaf-disc (2 × 2 cm) was provided. Subsequent infection with Armillaria mellea allowed the protocorms to further develop into immature tubers, which can be directly used for field production.

Dynastid scarab beetles are a speciose group of night-active pollinators, and several plants pollinated by these insects have methoxylated aromatic compounds in their scents. However, there is a large gap in our knowledge regarding the compounds responsible for beetle attraction. We used chemical analytical analyses to determine temporal patterns of scent emission and the composition of scent released from inflorescences of Philodendron selloum. The attractiveness of the main components in the scent to the dynastid scarab beetle Erioscelis emarginata, the exclusive pollinator of this plant, was assessed in field biotests. The amount of scent increased rapidly in the evening, and large amounts of scent were released during the activity time of the beetle pollinators. Inflorescences emitted a high number of compounds of different biosynthetic origin, among them both uncommon and also widespread flower scents. Methoxylated aromatic compounds dominated the scent, and 4-methoxystyrene, the most abundant compound, attracted E. emarginata beetles. Other compounds, such as (Z)-jasmone and possibly also the methoxylated aromatic compound 3,4-dimethoxystyrene increased the attractiveness of 4-methoxystyrene. Methoxylated aromatics, which are known from other dynastid pollinated plants as well, are important signals in many scarab beetles in a different context (e. g., pheromones), thus suggesting that these plants exploit pre-existing preferences of the beetles for attracting this group of insects as pollinators. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Araceae; Dynamic headspace; Electronic sensor and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Flower scent; Plant-pollinator interactions; Scarabaeidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871721489

Paternity analysis and the indirect KinDist and Mixed Effect Mating models were used to assess mating patterns, the pollen dispersal kernel, the effective number of males (Nep) and their relative individual fertility, as well as the existence of fine-scale spatial genetic structure in adult plants. All methods showed extensive pollen movement, with high rates of pollen flow from outside the study site (up to 73-93%), fat-tailed dispersal kernels and large average pollination distances (? = 229-412 m). However, they also agreed in detecting very few pollen donors (Nep = 4.3-10.2) and a large variance in their reproductive success: 70% of males did not sire any offspring among the studied female plants and 5.5% of males were responsible for 50% of pollinations. Although we did not find reduced levels of genetic diversity, the adult population showed high levels of biparental inbreeding (14%) and strong spatial genetic structure (Sp = 0.012), probably due to restricted seed dispersal and scarce safe sites for recruitment.

Using high-throughput sequencing, we assembled the floral transcriptomes of four individuals of Eichhornia (Pontederiaceae); these included one outcrosser and two independently derived selfers of E. paniculata, and E. paradoxa, a selfing outgroup. The dataset included ~8000 loci totalling ~3.5 Mb of coding DNA.Results: Tests of selection were consistent with purifying selection constraining evolution of the transcriptome. However, we found an elevation in the proportion of non-synonymous sites that were potentially deleterious in the E. paniculata selfers relative to the outcrosser. Measurements of codon usage in high versus low expression genes demonstrated reduced bias in both E. paniculata selfers.Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with a small reduction in the efficacy of selection on protein sequences associated with transitions to selfing, and reduced selection in selfers on synonymous changes that influence codon usage. © 2012 Ness et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868647588

Procedures involving the use of molecular markers can reduce this time considerably, by indirect selection of homozygous plants. The objective of this study was to use microsatellite markers in marker-assisted selection (MAS) to develop new papaya inbred lines, and categorize the inbred lines into useful groups based on the molecular profiles and agronomic traits. Thirty-six lines from F 4 (Calimosa×Common papaya) and S 3 derivate from open-population accessions of germplasm, and 6 controls were used for the molecular analysis with 27 microsatellite primers. Twelve polymorphic and 15 monomorphic microsatellite primers were identified, allowing the identification of 59 alleles, with an average of 2.19 alleles per primer. The observed heterozygosity values (Ho) were low for both the markers (0.00-0.24) and the individual lines (0.00-0.19). The inbreeding coefficient (f) ranged from 0.80 to 1.00. Eleven papaya inbred lines and checks (landrace, cultivars, and other pure lines) showed complete inbreeding (f=1). A broad genetic variability for all agronomic traits analyzed, especially for productivity (10.34-86.39tha -1), was observed and was confirmed using agronomic and molecular data simultaneously to group the new papaya inbred lines and checks. Hierarchical and silhouette-width method using Gower's dissimilarity revealed 9 major clusters. Despite the fact that self-pollination and selection lead to reduction of genetic variability, papaya inbred lines are proved to be genetically diverse representing a large proportion of the genetic variation occurring in ""Solo"" and ""Formosa"" groups. This seems to be promising for success in further developments of new hybrids in breeding programs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Breeding; Carica papaya L.; Hybrids; Inbred lines; Microsatellites,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866562047

(Ficus, Moraceae) is a common monoecious tree, which is widely distributed in the fig center area of Asia-Australasia. It is both a main tree species in the tropical forest and a common tree species planted in the courtyard and street. In this study, we investigated the structure, biodiversity and dynamics of fig wasp community in syconia of 19 F. microcarpa plants at two selected sites by observation on and collection from the specific trees at specific time and season all year around. A total of 26,318 fig wasps were collected from 530 syconia in different seasons. Seventeen fig wasp species belonging to Agaonidae, Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoryctinae, Eurytomidae and Ormyridae of Chalcidoidea were collected. Among them, only Eupristina verticillata of Agaonidae served as a pollinator for F. microcarpa through a way of active pollination. The sex ratio in this pollinating fig wasp species was 0. 16, with a very strong female-bias phenomenon. In the non-pollinators, the sex ratio is higher (0. 46-0. 55) in the species with winged male wasps (Odontofroggatia galili, O. quinifuniculus, O. corneri, Sycophila sp. 1, Sycophila sp. 2 and Meselatus bicolor), lower (0. 31-0. 37) in the species with wingless male wasps (Philotrypesis taiwanensis, Sycoscapter gajimaru, Walkerella microcarpae), and medium (0. 47) in the species with both winged and wingless male wasps (Philotrypesis okinavensis). The results suggested that the sex ratio of fig wasps may be related to the strategy of mating behavior. In the structure of fig wasp community in F. microcarpa, the importance index was dominant in the pollinating fig wasps, but was much smaller in non - pollinating species O. galili and Sycophila sp. 2. According to the number and continuity of occurrence, fig wasps could be classified into common species and occasional species. E. verticillata, Odontofroggatia galili, Walkerella microcarpae, Sycophila sp. 1, Sycophila sp. 2 and Philotrypesis okinavensis were common species, while the remaining 11 were occasional species. The composition and structure of wasp community differed greatly across seasons. From February to June, there were fewer (only 3-4) species inside syconia, with 48. 88 pollinating wasps and 13. 64 non-pollinating wasps in a single fig on average, respectively. From July to January of next year, there were more (as many as 6-13) species inside syconia, with 24. 38 pollinating wasps and 18. 89 non-pollinating wasps in a single fig on average, respectively. The results suggested that the number of pollinating wasps in the latter period reduced greatly compared with that in the former period (P < 0. 001); whereas for the non-pollinating wasps, both the number of species and that of wasps were significantly increased (P = 0. 001). The species and the number of fig wasps in the male-flower phase depended on the species and the number of spawning wasps in the female-flower phase. However, the rainfalls, temperature and the number of syconia in the female-flower phase may affect on the number of spawning wasps and the spawning behavior of wasps.

The percentage of styles in which pollen tubes have reached the base ranges from 0 to 36 %, a value determined by culture of styles in vitro, and fruit set ranges from 0. 6 to 15. 2 %. Based on these data, we have assigned a value for the self-incompatibility weakness to each cultivar. Here, we showed that pollen factors control the degree of self-incompatibility. When the pollen-tube growth of 13 cultivars was compared in a completely compatible 'Hougetsu' (S1S7) style, it differed a fair amount among cultivars and showed a significantly positive relation to self-incompatibility weakness (r = 0. 707). The degree of self-incompatibility of pear is, therefore, determined by pollen factor(s) unrelated to the S-locus. Although the fruit set and fruit growth of 'Hougetsu' were not affected by the pollen donor, a positive relationship was also observed between seed number and self-incompatibility weakness (r = 0. 972). However, in a style with no S-RNase production (genotype: S4smS4sm), the relationship disappeared (r = 0. 341) and pollen-tube growth was promoted by 12-36 % except in one cultivar. These results suggest that S-RNase functions as a cytotoxin on compatible pollen in a cultivar-dependent manner, and that the degree of inhibition is determined by pollen factor(s) unrelated to the S-locus. The pollen factor also functions on S-RNase in incompatible styles, resulting in a different degree of self-incompatibility. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Cultivar difference; Moderate fruit setting; Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai; S-RNase; Self-incompatibility weakness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869128979

We conducted a nationwide survey to determine the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens and parasites in Asian honeybees, Apis cerana, in China. Our study provides evidence of infections of A. cerana by pathogenic Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Nosema ceranae, and C. bombi species that have been linked to population declines of European honeybees, A. mellifera, and bumble bees. However, the prevalence of DWV, a virus that causes widespread infection in A. mellifera, was low, arguably a result of the greater ability of A. cerana to resist the ectoprasitic mite Varroa destructor, an efficient vector of DWV. Analyses of microbial communities from the A. cerana digestive tract showed that Nosema infection could have detrimental effects on the gut microbiota. Workers infected by N. ceranae tended to have lower bacterial quantities, with these differences being significant for the Bifidobacterium and Pasteurellaceae bacteria groups. The results of this nationwide screen show that parasites and pathogens that have caused serious problems in European honeybees can be found in native honeybee species kept in Asia. Environmental changes due to new agricultural practices and globalization may facilitate the spread of pathogens into new geographic areas. The foraging behavior of pollinators that are in close geographic proximity likely have played an important role in spreading of parasites and pathogens over to new hosts. Phylogenetic analyses provide insights into the movement and population structure of these parasites, suggesting a bidirectional flow of parasites among pollinators. The presence of these parasites and pathogens may have considerable implications for an observed population decline of Asian honeybees. © 2012 Li et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868682035

The genes are expressed in different tissues and organs during development; however, their exact role in barley is poorly understood. It has already been proven that RNA interference (RNAi)-based silencing of HvCKX1 decreased the CKX level, especially in those organs which showed the highest expression, i.e. developing kernels and roots, leading to higher plant productivity and higher mass of the roots [1]. The same type of RNAi construct was applied to silence HvCKX2 and analyze the function of the gene. Two cultivars of barley were transformed with the same silencing and selection cassettes by two different methods: biolistic and via Agrobacterium. Results: The mean Agrobacterium-mediated transformation efficiency of Golden Promise was 3.47% (±2.82). The transcript level of HvCKX2 in segregating progeny of T1 lines was decreased to 34%. The reduction of the transcript in Agrobacterium-derived plants resulted in decreased CKX activity in the developing and developed leaves as well as in 7 DAP (days after pollination) spikes. The final phenotypic effect was increased productivity of T0 plants and T1 lines. Higher productivity was the result of the higher number of seeds and higher grain yield. It was also correlated with the higher 1000 grain weight, increased (by 7.5%) height of the plants and higher (from 0.5 to 2) numbers of spikes.The transformation efficiency of Golden Promise after biolistic transformation was more than twice as low compared to Agrobacterium. The transcript level in segregating progeny of T1 lines was decreased to 24%. Otherwise, the enzyme activity found in the leaves of the lines after biolistic transformation, especially in cv. Golden Promise, was very high, exceeding the relative level of the control lines. These unbalanced ratios of the transcript level and the activity of the CKX enzyme negatively affected kernel germination or anther development and as a consequence setting the seeds. The final phenotypic effect was the decreased productivity of T0 plants and T1 lines obtained via the biolistic silencing of HvCKX2.Conclusion: The phenotypic result, which was higher productivity of silenced lines obtained via Agrobacterium, confirms the hypothesis that spatial and temporal differences in expression contributed to functional differentiation. The applicability of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for gene silencing of developmentally regulated genes, like HvCKX2, was proven. Otherwise low productivity and disturbances in plant development of biolistic-silenced lines documented the unsuitability of the method.

Although accumulating evidence shows that the PD plays a critical role in the pollination process, the mechanism of PD withdrawal is still unclear. Here, we carefully observed the PD withdrawal process and investigated the underlying mechanism of PD withdrawal, which will aid the understanding of wind-pollination efficiency in gymnosperms. In Ginkgo biloba, PDs were secreted on the micropyle during the pollination period and persisted for about 240 h when not pollinated under laboratory conditions. The withdrawal of an isolated PD required only 1 h for evaporation, much less than a PD on the living ovule, which required 100 h. When pollinated with viable pollen, PDs withdrew rapidly within 4 h. In contrast, nonviable pollen and acetone-treated pollen did not cause PD withdrawal. Although 100% relative humidity significantly inhibited PD withdrawal, pollinated PDs still could withdraw completely within 48 h. Pollen grains of Cycas revoluta, which are similar to those of G. biloba, could induce PD withdrawal more rapidly than those of two distantly related gymnosperms (Pinus thunbergii and Abies firma) or two angiosperms (Paeonia suffruticosa and Orychophragmus violaceus). Furthermore, pollen of G. biloba and C. revoluta submerged immediately when encountering the PD, then sank to the bottom and entered the micropyle. The saccate pollen of P. thunbergii and A. firma submerged into the PD, but remained floating at the top and finally accumulated on the micropyle after PD withdrawal. In contrast, pollen of the angiosperms P. suffruticosa, Salix babylonica, and O. violaceus did not submerge, instead remaining clustered at the edge without entering the PD. We conclude that PD withdrawal is primarily determined by the dynamic balance between evaporation and ovule secretion, of which pollen is a critical stimulator. When conspecific pollen grains were submerged in the PD, ovule secretion was subsequently terminated and active absorption occurred. These processes cooperated to influence PD withdrawal. In addition, pollen grain behavior within PDs varied dramatically among taxa, and PDs played a role in distinguishing and transporting pollen in G. biloba.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862204034

Cross-fertilization between Syrian pear and 'Spadona' was shown to be efficient suggesting that Syrian pear might be a potent pollinator for 'Spadona'. Therefore Syrian pear seedlings, from different sites in north-east Israel were S-genotyped. Eleven out of the 26 were found fully compatible with the four European pear varieties cultivated in Israel. By this screening, ten new S-RNase alleles were identified. In addition from two P. betulifolia and one P. korshinskii seedlings, four S-RNases were cloned, two are new, one had been cloned previously and one was identical to an S-RNase allele cloned from Syrian pear in this work.",Gametophytic self incompatibility (GSI); Pyrus betulifolia; S-allele; S-RNase analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872050495

Generally to avoid this hazard, growers try to change the garden microclimate and use late blooming cultivars. Local apricot genotypes of Iran are early blooming, thus usually fruit set and productivity vary year-to-year. In order to study the main factors relative to frost resistance of flowers and low crop load of different apricot cultivars, this study was carried out at Sahand Horticultural Research Station (East Azerbaijan province, Iran) on 150 local and foreign apricot cultivars during 2002-2010. Results showed that flowers of some apricot cultivars were resistant to spring frost and their crop load is optimum, despite the fact that they had the same blooming time as other cultivars. These differences were related to some biological and physiological characteristics of flower buds like; interior components of flower buds, EPP (Effective pollination period), self-compatibility, frost resistance of pistils and pistil morphology. In this paper the role of each factor on bearing and cold resistance is discussed and some apricot cultivars resistant to spring frost are introduced.",Crop load; Flowering biology; Frost resistance; Prunus armeniaca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872035282

This enzyme is localised in the pollen cytoplasm where it regulates the polymerisation of cytoskeleton proteins. An extracellular form is also necessary for pollen tube growth. In the self-pollinated style of Abbè Fétel (A x A, incompatible system), the activity of TGase increased when the pollen tube stopped its growth inside the style and the enzyme was immuno-localised around the tube tip. On the contrary in Abbé Fétel styles pollinated with Williams pollen (A x W, compatible system), TGase activity decreased during pollen germination. The TGase gene has been cloned and sequenced from Abbé Fétel pollen and style showing that it shares a high homology with a sequence of apple, whose genome has been recently published, which presents the typical TGase catalytic sequence, and with the TGase of Arabidopsis. This enzyme was expressed during pollen germination inside the style to a similar extent in both systems (A x A and A x W) showing that it is only the activity to have been stimulated by some factor dependent on SI. A molecular approach to clone one of the S-RNase alleles of the cv Abbé Fétel has been performed. This protein, supplied to pollen in the germination medium, was able to inhibit the growth of 50% of the tubes of the homologous pollen. This approach will allow us to verify if an interaction between the two enzymes will occur during SI, as TGase, at least in animal cells, is also able to act as disulphide isomerase modifying the RNase structure.",Pollen; Pyrus communis; Reproduction; Rosaceae; Style,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872046198

Detailed molecular and physiological analysis identified 12 lines with a stable, altered SI-phenotype. In all 12 lines complete S3 S-RNase gene silencing, and partial S5 S-RNase silencing significantly modified the self-incompatibility behaviour of the plant, leading to either intermediate or complete self-fertility. Interestingly, the intermediate self-fertile phenotype appeared to be due to a slower growth rate of 'self' pollen tubes and was only observed in a subset of lines that were generated using the 3' end of the S3-cDNA in anti-sense orientation.

Then, the linear regression between these factors and initial fruit set percentage (10 days after pollination) was fitted. Results showed that the pistils were grouped in five and three categories according to the length and ovary diameter, respectively. Normal pistils had 10-14 mm length and 1.5-2.5 mm diameter at the FB stage. In a second step, female sterility was studied by fluorescence microscopic methods that confirmed the results of the first step using pistil dimensions.

The results confirm the importance of long-term experiments in studying plant phenomena, biometrics and behavior. Prickly comfrey produced a green canopy each year and growth started very early in spring. Maximum plant height was less than 160 cm. Annual phenomena (growth initiation, seedling phase, flower phase, seed phase, senescent phase), interannual phenomena (initiation and youth, reproduction, new generation formation, plant death) and two population cycles (colonization and expansion) were measured. The duration of annual development up to canopy death can be expressed as x+2x+3x+2x, where x is initial growth. The genetic structure and activity of prickly comfrey promotes generative development of the species. Its age can be measured over a single and several vegetation generations. The ability to change the angle of vertical stem growth after 9 weeks can be considered a functional behavior of prickly comfrey and part of its life strategy. The differences between the organs in the upper and lower parts are very considerable and should be taken into account in morphological descriptions of this species. The upper and lower stems and leaves showed differential growth. Both stem and leaves were densely setose. Old leaves were 3.8 times longer, 4 times broader and 2.4 times thicker than young leaves.

However, adaptation to the abiotic environment may significantly affect plant interactions with herbivores and pollinators. Local adaptation to the abiotic environment may constrain local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators under contrasting selection pressures, resulting in trade-offs in local adaptation. We studied local adaptation of a perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, in a reciprocal transplant experiment among four populations and measured plant fitness, pollination success and resistance to two specialist herbivores. We also estimated local adaptation of these two herbivores and generalist pollinators to their sympatric plant populations. Local adaptation was compared with within-population genetic variation, genetic and geographical divergence, and with divergence in terms of population size, environmental conditions and plant secondary chemistry. We further compared local adaptation to the environment, to local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators to detect possible trade-offs in local adaptation. The existence and degree of local adaptation varied among the plant populations. Plants from two populations were locally adapted to their sympatric leaf herbivores and plants from two populations were locally adapted to their abiotic environment. Herbivores from one population were locally adapted to their sympatric plant population. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria to the seed predator increased with increasing among-population divergence in precipitation and temperature. Local adaptation to the seed predator and the environment increased with increasing population genetic variation. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria in fitness and in herbivore resistance also correlated positively, suggesting lack of trade-offs in local adaptation. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that species interactions can lead to a mosaic of locally adapted plant, herbivore and pollinator populations. In addition to natural enemies, genetic variation, the abiotic environment and mutualistic interactions contribute to the evolution of local adaptation in long-lived plants. These results provide new insights into the patterns and causes of variation in local adaptation and are among the first to demonstrate that conflicting selection pressures within a population do not constrain local adaptation in multiple traits. © 2012 The Authors.

We studied reproductive ecology of this species to explore the factors that are critical for its survival and conservation. Methods - We conducted breeding system experiments during 2008 and 2009 in two populations located in the Hengduan Mountains. Key results - The flowers are protandrous and herkogamous, and thus insects are necessary for pollination and seed production. Bumblebees were observed to be the most frequent visitors, and their visitation rates were lower at the higher altitude. Seed production in both populations fluctuated annually, possibly due to pollen limitation, which occurred in both populations in the two years. Conclusions - The pollination level is only marginally responsible for the rarity of this alpine species. We suggest that in situ conservation measures should be given the highest priority at present, considering the strong genetic differentiation among populations. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Breeding system; Bumblebee pollination; In situ conservation; Megacodon stylophorus; The Hengduan Mountains,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868380767

The same approach is generally used for plant protection products (PPPs). However, in some cases, suitable procedures for a precise quantification of exposure are not available. The common risk assessment procedure for pollinators based on the hazard quotient, where the agronomic application rate is assumed as an exposure indicator, is an example. In this work, a semi-quantitative index to assess exposure to PPPs for organisms with a large forage area is presented. The proposed index was already applied in a previous work on risk assessment for pollinators, for this reason the validation steps (sampling area, collected samples, samples distribution) were planned bearing in mind the characteristic and the behaviour of these organisms and using Apis mellifera as representative of pollinators. The starting point for the development of the index is the assumption that exposure depends not only on environmental fate of pesticides but also on the feeding behaviour of the target organisms (in this context meant as target of the assessment). The developed index was applied and validated in different experimental areas of 4 9 4 km located in North-East Italy (Veneto region) characterised by a different level of impact.

In this study we assess the genetic diversity and structure and infer the seed/pollen gene-flow patterns among insular populations of Daphne rodriguezii, a shrub pollinated and dispersed by animals that has lost its only disperser (the lizard Podarcis lilfordi) in most of its populations. Location The island of Menorca and the islet of Colom (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean). Methods To assess the contribution of gene flow via pollen and seeds to the genetic structure of D.rodriguezii we used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs; seeds and pollen) and plastid DNA sequences (cpDNA; seeds). We sampled individuals from all population nuclei of the species (12-19 adults per population): one population in Colom, where the plant-lizard interaction persists, and four in Menorca, where the seed dispersal mutualism disappeared with the extinction of the lizard. Results The highest heterozygosity values were found in Colom and in its closest population (Favàritx), whereas values were lower in the smallest Menorcan populations, which also had higher relatedness among individuals. We found distinct genetic signals between AFLP and cpDNA analyses. While AFLP markers showed low differentiation between populations, cpDNA showed a clear differentiation between them. Main conclusions Our results point to negative impacts of the disperser loss on genetic diversity and relatedness in the smaller and more isolated populations. They also suggest an old isolation by seeds, probably occurring well before the extinction of the lizard (c.2000years ago). Gene flow was maintained via pollination; however, the seed disperser loss may ultimately hinder pollinator-mediated gene flow, as a result of reduced probabilities of effective pollination among increasingly distant and scarce individuals. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Amplified fragment length polymorphism; Balearic Islands; CpDNA; Gene flow; Mutualism disruption; Plant-lizard interactions; Seed disperser loss,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867696952

The neighborhood seedling model was used to fit pollen dispersal models for beech at different stages of gap recolonization and to elucidate the effect of saplings as a physical barrier on pollen dispersal at local scale. Phenological overlap of leaf emergence, and pollen release as well as wind directionality patterns were also examined. As a case study, we used a mixed beech-oak forest that was managed as open woodland until 1974. The ban on entry of cattle has led to the recolonization of empty spaces by seedlings and saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and two oak species (Quercuspetraea (Matts.) Liebl. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and, at last, to canopy closure. The average pollen dispersal distance for the first plants that regenerated in the gaps was almost twice those found for recently installed seedlings and seeds collected in traps, supporting the hypothesis that the understory may act as a physical barrier to pollen dispersal. Although a substantial part of effective pollination directionality is at random, horizontal winds and vertical anabatic winds may explain some of this directionality. At the time of beech pollen release, leaves of beech and sessile oak are fully developed, enhancing pollen interception by the saplings. Explicit models of pollen dispersal for wind-pollinated trees should incorporate the effect of canopy closure caused by growth of saplings and account for leaf phenology of co-occurring species in the forest. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Beech; Mating patterns; Microsatellites; Neighborhood seedling model; Phenology; Wind directionality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869079814

To address this, we investigated plant-pollinator interaction networks of the herbaceous rocky outcrop communities in Ozark glades (Missouri, USA) of different areas. We quantified the degree to which the increase in the number of species interactions with area differed from a null model based on sampling, where numbers of individuals increase with area. Although plant-pollinator interactions were expected to increase more steeply with area than species richness as a result of sampling, the observed rate of increase was considerably lower than expected. Two mechanisms could lead to this pattern: a higher proportion of specialist species in larger glades or generalist pollinators becoming more selective in their diets in larger glades. We found support for the former hypothesis, and those changes in species composition were strong enough to outweigh behavioral changes in the opposite direction; generalist pollinators were more selective in smaller glades. If these results are general, larger habitats may be needed to conserve interactions than would be thought based on species accumulation curves. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Connectance; Ecosystem service; Generalization; Habitat fragmentation; Missouri, USA; Ozark glades; Pollination; Specialization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869202402

Wind-pollinated plants are representative of allergenic species because they include species with the highest capability of causing allergy-related diseases in humans. Therefore, changes in wind-pollinated species may reflect impacts of climate change on allergenic plants. In particular, flowering is one of the developmental stages most affected by climate change. This report specifically addresses changes in flowering dates that have occurred during the three decades 1971-2000 as a function of pollination mode and woodiness. The assessment is made using a phenological data set comprising trends of flowering dates of 29 species in 983 locations in Europe. Linear mixed models assessing the statistical significance of trends while adjusting for spatial correlation are used. The main results indicate for the first time that the onset of flowering of wind-pollinated plants advanced more than for insect-pollinated plants, while full flowering phases tended to advance less. These novel findings are contrary to the results of Fitter and Fitter (2002) for Oxfordshire, who reported larger advances of insect-pollinated plants. Onset of flowering and full flowering of insect-pollinated species are more likely to advance for seasons early in the year; instead, wind-pollinated plants showed no dependence of trends on the season (first flowering) or a decreased advance of phases that are early in the year (full flowering). The effect of woodiness could not be unambiguously defined, but seems to be of minor importance. The presented findings suggest a lengthening of the flowering period in general, which might lead to an increasing time of exposure to airborne pollen of allergic subjects, with consequent likely increment in severity and incidence of allergic symptoms. © 2012 The Authors.

Micro-organisms, particularly yeasts, represent one extrinsic factor that inhabit the nectar of animal-pollinated flowers worldwide. In this study a 'microbial imprint hypothesis' is formulated and tested, in which it is proposed that natural community-wide variation in nectar sugar composition will partly depend on the presence of yeasts in flowers.MethodsOccurrence and density of yeasts were studied microscopically in single-flower nectar samples of 22 animal-pollinated species from coastal xeric and sub-humid tropical habitats of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Nectar sugar concentration and composition were concurrently determined on the same samples using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods.Key ResultsMicroscopical examination of nectar samples revealed the presence of yeasts in nearly all plant species (21 out of 22 species) and in about half of the samples examined (51·8 of total, all species combined). Plant species and individuals differed significantly in nectar sugar concentration and composition, and also in the incidence of nectar yeasts. After statistically controlling for differences between plant species and individuals, nectar yeasts still accounted for a significant fraction of community-wide variance in all nectar sugar parameters considered. Significant yeast × species interactions on sugar parameters revealed that plant species differed in the nectar sugar correlates of variation in yeast incidence.ConclusionsThe results support the hypothesis that nectar yeasts impose a detectable imprint on community-wide variation in nectar sugar composition and concentration. Since nectar sugar features influence pollinator attraction and plant reproduction, future nectar studies should control for yeast presence and examine the extent to which microbial signatures on nectar characteristics ultimately have some influence on pollination services in plant communities. © 2012 The Author 2012.

The present study aimed to characterize the transcriptional changes occurring after pollination in the labellum of a sexually deceptive orchid (Ophrys fusca Link) in order to identify genes involved on signals responsible for pollinator attraction, the major goal of floral tissues. Novel information on alterations in the orchid petal labellum gene expression occurring after pollination demonstrates a reduction in the expression of alkene biosynthetic genes using O. fusca Link as the species under study. Petal labellum transcriptional analysis revealed downregulation of transcripts involved in both pigment machinery and scent compounds, acting as visual and olfactory cues, respectively, important in sexual mimicry.

There is a mounting interest in new types of peppers, including those of ornamental relevance. The use of protected cultivation is raising the demand for high-yielding hybrids, with higher commercial value, so as to turn this production system into a profitable investment. Hybrid seeds are obtained by crossing endogamic lines, which, in their turn, result from successive self-pollinations. The objective of this study was to compare two methods of protecting selfed flower buds from contamination with exogenous pollen in ornamental peppers. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, on a laboratory of the Universidade Federal da Paraíba. We took plants of 15 hybrids and their reciprocals to test two methods to protect selfed flower buds: 1= bud covering with aluminum foil; and 2= bud sealing with white glue. We carried out ten self-pollinations per hybrid, in pre-anthesis, for each method. We evaluated the average fruit set rate per method within each hybrid. The general fruit setting average in method 1 (16%) was lower than in method 2 (51%); with not a single hybrid in which fruit set rate of method 1 has exceeded that of method 2. A few hybrids showed up to 90% fruit set after self-pollination when flower buds were sealed with white glue (method 2), in contrast to a maximum of 40% fruit set when using method 1. The direction of the cross, direct or reciprocal, also affected fruit set rate, causing either reduction or increase, but with no effects of the selfed bud protecting method. Considering our results, we indicate the use of white glue to seal selfed flower buds to secure the success of controlled selfing in pepper.",Advanced generations; Breeding; Capsicum annuum; Cross pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872372839

In this paper, we examine the role of two major pre-zygotic barriers in reducing the chance of F 1 hybrid formation between two pairs of Narcissus species. Field experiments were performed over 5 years in eight natural populations to determine whether flowering phenology and pollinator fidelity could act as reproductive isolation barriers in Narcissus. Our results show that reproductive isolation due to flowering phenology is highly variable and asymmetric. In some populations, pollinator fidelity was so strong that the quantification of reproductive isolation was complete and a strong negative correlation was found between the strength of this barrier and the abundance of hybrids. Nevertheless, the degree of pollinator fidelity was quite variable among populations indicating that reproductive isolation varies geographically but very consistent across years indicating that plant-pollinator interactions are well established. In fact, the finding that hybrid formation between these species occurs only in sites where pollinator fidelity is incomplete suggests that hybrid formation also varies geographically and that divergent evolutionary outcomes may occur in different sympatric populations of Narcissus. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Flowering asynchrony; Natural hybridization; Pollinator fidelity; Pre-zygotic barriers; Spatial-temporal patterns,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867683067

We analyzed specificity in terms of factors that may ameliorate risk such as long-term pollinator population stability, abundance and the duration of flowering. Bee population stability indices from seven continuous years of census data, combined with pollinator and flowering phenology data for 37 plant species in Panama, revealed pollinator specificity was not related to pollinator population stability. No relationship existed between the length of a flowering season and population stability of associated pollinators. Further data from 30 years of euglossine monitoring also revealed no relationship between bee abundance and specificity. However, a strong relationship was revealed between length of flowering period and specificity. A longer flowering season was associated with lower specificity and shorter flowering was associated with higher specificity, which is as expected if specificity is the outcome of a sampling problem but not as expected if specificity is accompanied by risk reduction. Plant-pollinator specificity involving euglossine bees is evidently not related to bee population stability, abundance, or length of flowering period, in a manner that we predicted would be associated with reducing the risk of extinction. Variation in population stabilities of euglossines may be insufficient to be a factor in the evolution of plant-pollinator specificity. In the tropics, specificity may be more associated with plant longevity, selection for efficiency or effectiveness, or flowering duration -as a sampling phenomenon, than with reducing dependence on unreliable pollinators. © 2012 The Authors.

However, there is also conflict between mutualists, because their interests are not perfectly aligned. In addition, most mutualisms are exploited by parasites. Here, we study the interplay between cooperation, conflict and parasitism in the mutualism between fig trees and their pollinator wasps. Conflict occurs because each fig ovary can nurture either one seed or one pollinator offspring and, while fig trees benefit directly from seeds and pollinator offspring (pollen vectors), pollinators only benefit directly from pollinator offspring. The mechanism(s) of conflict resolution is debated, but must explain the widespread observation that pollinators develop in inner, and seeds in outer, layers of fig flowers. We recently suggested a role for non-pollinating figs wasps (NPFWs) that are natural enemies or competitors of the pollinators and lay their eggs through the fig wall. Most NPFW offspring develop in outer and middle layer flowers, suggesting that inner flowers provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. Here, we test the hypothesis that NPFWs cannot reach inner flowers, by measuring wasp and fig morphology at the species-specific times of NPFW attack in the field. We found that three species of Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps that parasitise pollinators could reach 34-73%, 75-92% and 82-97% of fig ovaries, respectively. Meanwhile, Eukobelea and Pseudidarnes gall-formers, despite having shorter ovipositors, can access almost all fig flowers (93-99% and 100%), because they attack smaller (younger) fig fruits. Our mechanistic results from ovipositing wasps support spatial patterns of wasp offspring segregation within figs to suggest that inner ovules provide enemy-free-space for pollinators. This may contribute to mutualism stability by helping select for pollinators to avoid laying eggs where they are likely to be parasitised. These outer flowers then remain free to develop as seeds, promoting mutualism persistence. © 2012 The Authors. Oikos © 2012 Nordic Society Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867742945

Temporal variation in floral resources may influence the population dynamics of pollinators. We investigated the relationship between the population dynamics of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and canopy floral resources over 5 years in a cool temperate forest. We predicted that the yearly fluctuation of canopy resources affects colony development and queen production, resulting in the variation of the pollination success of understorey plants the following spring. Flower production of canopy trees showed clear biyearly fluctuations, synchronously among most species. Worker production of Bombus ardens and Bombus hypocrita were positively related to floral resources during colony establishment by overwintered queens, while that of Bombus diversus was positively related to floral resources during the worker-active period. An abundance of overwintered queens was positively related to both worker abundance and floral resources in the previous summer in B. ardens and to only previous-year worker abundance in B. hypocrita but was dependent on neither factor in B. diversus. These differences in causal effects on queen production among species might be a reflection of interspecific differences in the degree of dependence on canopy resources for queen production due to species-specific phenologies and/or foraging preferences of other species of flowers. The extent of pollen limitation in the spring-ephemeral Corydalis ambigua, which is exclusively pollinated by overwintered queens, was negatively correlated with the abundance of B. hypocrita queens. Thus, population dynamics of bumble bees has a crucial effect on seed production of understorey plants. Synthesis. The dynamics of flower production in overstory trees can indirectly affect the pollination efficiency of understorey plants in the next season via the population dynamics of pollinators.

Our objective was to investigate: (1) the distribution pattern of flowers in inflorescences of Rhynchospora ciliata; (2) the dynamics of its anthesis; and (3) whether R. ciliata is pollinated by bees, by wind or by both. Additionally, we tested the hypotheses: (i) the hypsophylls and/or anthers attract pollinators, and (ii) biotic vectors enhance the reproductive success of R. ciliata. We analysed floral biology, dynamics of anthesis, frequency and behaviour of insects visiting flowers; we also carried out experiments on flower attractiveness, pollination by wind and reproductive success. Rhynchospora ciliata has flowers with anemophilous attributes, including anthers exposed during anthesis; however, the anthers (here considered a mixed trait) together with the white hypsophylls can be considered as attributes that favour entomophily. Both wind and four species of bee were considered as pollen vectors of R. ciliata. Through flower attractiveness tests, we observed that the hypsophylls do not affect the frequency of pollinating bees and that the absence of exposed anthers affects the average number of visits, probably because pollen is the only floral resource.

However, many cactus pollination systems are generalized as their flowers are pollinated by a wide spectrum of animals. For example, cactus species with white flowers, nocturnal anthesis and extended floral cycles would present generalized pollination systems in which both nocturnal and diurnal visitors could be effective pollinators. In this article, we tested this hypothesis by studying the pollination biology of Echinopsis schickendantzii, an Andean cactus with sphingophilous flowers. In addition, we evaluated whether the cactus's pollination system is complementary or redundant regarding the relative contributions of nocturnal and diurnal pollinators. Specifically, we studied the floral cycle, the reproductive system and the pollination effectiveness of floral visitors. The flowers of E. schickendantzii are self-incompatible; they opened at crepuscule and have an extended floral cycle. Moths were frequent visitors at night, whereas bees were frequent visitors during the day; both were effective pollinators of the cactus. Our results indicated that the flowers of this species present phenotypic, functional and ecological generalization, and their fruit set is determined by the contributions of both pollinator functional groups, i. e., they have complementary pollination systems. These results support the hypothesis that cacti in the extra-tropical deserts of South America have generalized pollination systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Bee-pollination; Columnar cactus; Echinopsis schickendantzii; Generalization; Moth-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867661799

We investigated the effect of cultivar and different cropping practices on the productivity of strawberry plants growing in tunnels at Huelva (Spain) over three years. In the first experiment, 'Camarosa', 'Ventana', and 'Medina' were planted on 10 or 22 Oct. at standard (30 × 25 cm), wide (35 × 25 cm), or narrow (25 × 25 cm) spacings. In the second experiment, 'Camarosa' was grown in macro- or microtunnels with and without bees. There was no effect of plant density. Planting time resulted in higher early yields in 'Ventana' and higher misshapen fruit in 'Camarosa' with an early compared with a late planting. 'Camarosa' had the lowest yields and the highest incidence of misshapen fruit. More of the early crop was misshaped and this was related to low temperatures in the 7 weeks before harvest. Pollination reduced the incidence of misshapen fruit and increased yield. Plants grown in macrotunnels were only more productive than those grown in microtunnels when they were pollinated by bees. These results demonstrate that the productivity of strawberry plants growing in tunnels can be enhanced by the selection of the appropriate cultivar, planting date, tunnel system, and pollination protocol. The use of macrotunnels with supplementary pollination results in better economic returns by increasing yield and decreasing the incidence of misshapen fruit.

The present study was focused on revealing the quantitative importance of the two pathways for grain Zn loading and how their relative contribution varies with the overall plant Zn status. Methods: The stable isotope 67Zn was used to trace Zn uptake and remobilization fluxes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants growing in hydroponics at 0. 1 ?M (low Zn), 1. 5 ?M (medium Zn) or 5 ?M Zn (high Zn). When grain development reached 15 days after pollination the Zn source was changed to an enriched 67Zn isotope and plants were harvested after 6 to 48 h. Zn concentrations and isotope ratios were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results: Plants with low Zn status absorbed 3-fold more Zn than plants with medium or high Zn status when roots were exposed to an external concentration of 1. 5 ?M 67Zn. Stems and ears were the primary recipients of the de novo incorporated Zn with preferential allocation to the developing grains over time. The leaves received in all cases a very small proportion (&lt;5 %) of the newly absorbed Zn and the proportion did not increase over time. Zn fluxes derived from uptake and remobilization were almost equal in plants with low Zn status, while at high Zn status remobilization delivered 4 times more Zn to the developing grains than did root Zn uptake. Conclusions: Stable isotopes in combination with ICP-MS provided a strong tool for quantification of Zn fluxes in intact plants. The importance of Zn remobilization compared to de novo root absorption of Zn increased with increasing plant Zn status. Very little de novo absorbed Zn was translocated to the leaves during generative growth stages. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Barley; Grain; ICP-MS; Remobilization; Stable isotope labelling; Zinc,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869488583

Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations. Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour and reductions in colony queen production. However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level, it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging, yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated. Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In the field studies, root length was the best indicator of seed yield at the one- to two-leaf and the three- to four-leaf stages of development, and was one of the most consistent parameters among sites and years. Poor ability to recover fine roots from field soils at the cotyledon stage contributed to the relatively poor relationships between root parameters and seed yield compared with shoot parameters at this developmental stage. The growth room study clearly showed that root length is an excellent measure of seedling vigour and an indicator of seed yield as early as 7 d after imbibition.

Linear landscape elements (LLEs) might contribute to such connectivity by increasing pollen transfer. Methods - Pollen dispersal was investigated for the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior in urban forest remnants, using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue, in three study sites comprising population pairs located in fragments connected or not by a wooded LLE. We examined whether the presence of a small patch of plants of P. elatior placed within the LLE (stepping-stone population) might increase pollen dispersal compared to an LLE where P. elatior is absent. Key results - Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with most dye transfer events at short distances (80% at less than 15.4-114.8 m) and a maximal distance of 647.5 m. Populations not connected by an LLE, separated by distances of 249 m or more, did not exchange dye, whereas populations that were connected by LLEs (up to 602 m) did show interpopulation dye transfer, suggesting that LLEs function as biological corridors facilitating dye dispersal. The presence of a stepping-stone population of P. elatior within the LLE increased between-population dye transfers (between 1.8 and 3.3 times the proportion of visited individuals) and deposition distances, compared to an LLE with no stepping stone, at least when pollen flow already existed. Conclusions - These results provide evidence that LLEs may be more effective for pollen dispersal when serving as both movement conduit and habitat. In urban settings, developing a network of core populations connected by LLEs comprising small, even temporary, stepping-stone populations should be encouraged. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Biological corridor; Connectivity; Dispersal kernel; Fluorescent dye; Insect pollination; Linear landscape elements; Pollen dispersal; Primula elatior; Stepping stone; Urban surrounding matrix,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868356235

However, a number of recent studies indicate that resources might also play an important role on shaping masting patterns. Dioecious masting species offer a privileged framework to study the role of resources on masting variation, since male and female plants often experience different reproductive costs and selective pressures. We followed masting and reproductive investment (RI) of the dioecious tree Juniperus thurifera in two populations along 10 years and studied the different response of males and females to experimentally increased water and nutrient availability in a third population. Juniperus thurifera females invested in reproduction three times more resources than males. Such disparity generated different resource-use strategies in male and female trees. Tree-ring growth and water use efficiency (WUE) confirmed that sexes differed in their resource investment temporal pattern, with males using current resources for reproduction and females using resources accumulated during longer periods. Watered and fertilized female trees presented significantly higher flowering reproductive investments than males and experienced an extraordinary mast-flowering event. However, seeding RI and mast seeding were not affected by the treatment. This suggests that although resource availability affects the reproductive output of this species, there are other major forces regulating masting on J. thurifera. During 10 years, J. thurifera male and female trees presented high and low flowering years more or less synchronously. However, not all mast flowering episodes resulted in mast seeding, leading to masting uncoupling between flowering and seeding. Since flowering costs represent only 1% of females' total reproductive investments, masting uncoupling could be a beneficial bet-hedging strategy to maximize reproductive output in spite of unpredictable catastrophic events. © 2012 The Authors.

Some, however, reward pollinators with nectar or pseudopollen, whereas the labella of a relatively small number of taxa produce lipoidal floral rewards that include resins and waxes. To date, the labellar secretory tissues of few species have been examined in detail, and some rewardless species having glossy labella are thought to mimic taxa that produce lipoidal rewards. Here, the labellar anatomy of a range of resin-secreting, wax-secreting and putative resin-mimic species is compared using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and histochemistry, in order to investigate how such secretory tissues may have evolved. Comparisons are also made with other resiniferous and wax-secreting Maxillariinae s.s., and with rewardless control species and the oil-secreting elaiophores of certain Oncidiinae. The labella of all Maxillariinae species investigated displayed similar anatomy, the differences largely being restricted to the adaxial epidermis and subepidermal layer. The labellar secretory epidermis of resiniferous Maxillariella elatior was composed of epithelial palisade cells, whereas that of other resin- and wax-secreting species investigated consisted of secretory papillae or trichomes. Putative resin-mimic species also produced resin, albeit in small quantities, and, here, the epidermal cells were cuboidal or rectangular in section. Secreted material on the labellar surface of control species was probably fragrance residues. Resin was often heterogeneous, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that its composition could change throughout the course of anthesis. Although the resiniferous floral tissues of Maxillariinae s.s. may be epithelial or trichomal, and thus closely resemble the epithelial and trichomal elaiophores of oil-secreting Oncidiinae, they differ in a number of important ways, necessitating the use of more exact descriptive terminology when distinguishing between oil-, resin- and wax-secreting floral structures. Similarity between the resin- or wax-secreting floral structures of Maxillariinae s.s and the oil-secreting elaiophores of Oncidiinae is probably a result of parallelism. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Epidermis; Epithelial elaiophore; Fragrance; Labellum; Oncidiinae; Papillae; Trichomes; Wax,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867882488

Total fruit production was estimated, and fruits were harvested to obtain primary fruit investment, pollination success, predation incidence, seed production, seed weight and germination rates. Ononis tridentata combined spring mass flowering with a steady long flowering period across the summer and fall. The fewer flowers that are produced in fall were successfully pollinated, and produced fruits that were subject to minimal predation pressure relative to spring fruits. Moreover, fall fruits contained a higher number of heavier seeds and showed higher germination rates than those of spring seeds. Fall reproductive output represent 10% of annual viable seeds and thus may act as an important complement to the main spring reproductive investment.

In addition to pollinating wasps, a diverse community of organisms develops within the microcosm of the fig inflorescence and fruit. To better understand the multipartite context of the fig-fig wasp association, we used a culture-free approach to examine fungal communities associated with syconia of six species of Ficus and their pollinating wasps in lowland Panama. Diverse fungi were recovered from surface-sterilized flowers of all Ficus species, including gall- and seed flowers at four developmental stages. Fungal communities in syconia and on pollinating wasps were similar, dominated by diverse and previously unknown Saccharomycotina, and distinct from leaf- and stem endophyte communities in the same region. Before pollination, fungal communities were similar between gall- and seed flowers and among Ficus species. However, fungal communities differed significantly in flowers after pollination vs. before pollination, and between anciently diverged lineages of Ficus with active vs. passive pollination syndromes. Within groups of relatively closely related figs, there was little evidence for strict-sense host specificity between figs and particular fungal species. Instead, mixing of fungal communities among related figs, coupled with evidence for possible transfer by pollinating wasps, is consistent with recent suggestions of pollinator mixing within syconia. In turn, changes in fungal communities during fig development and ripening suggest an unexplored role of yeasts in the context of the fig-pollinator wasp mutualism. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867672807

Consistent with the SlDELLA loss of function, pro plants display a GA-constitutive response phenotype, mimicking wild-type plants treated with GA3. The ovaries from both nonemasculated and emasculated pro flowers had very strong parthenocarpic capacity, associated with enhanced growth of preanthesis ovaries due to more and larger cells. pro parthenocarpy is facultative because seeded fruits were obtained by manual pollination. Most pro pistils had exserted stigmas, thus preventing self-pollination, similar to wild-type pistils treated with GA3 or auxins. However, Style2.1, a gene responsible for long styles in noncultivated tomato, may not control the enhanced style elongation of pro pistils, because its expression was not higher in pro styles and did not increase upon GA3 application. Interestingly, a high percentage of pro flowers had meristic alterations, with one additional petal, sepal, stamen, and carpel at each of the four whorls, respectively, thus unveiling a role of SlDELLA in flower organ development. Microarray analysis showed significant changes in the transcriptome of preanthesis pro ovaries compared with the wild type, indicating that the molecular mechanism underlying the parthenocarpic capacity of pro is complex and that it is mainly associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in GA and auxin pathways.

Yields increased linearly with numbers of beehives, up to ~4 hives/hectare, but at higher stocking rates there was too much variation to adequately determine the effects. Yields also increased linearly with numbers of honey bees, but there was an interaction with other bees that decreased the effects of honey bees, such that at maximum densities of other bees, there was no effect of honey bees on yield.

The avoidance of self-interference is widely accepted as the primary force promoting the separation between sexes within the flowers in time (dichogamy) and/or space (herkogamy) for self-incompatible species, which are already protected from the negative effects of inbreeding depression by the incompatibility system. Different degrees of incompatibility, herkogamy, and dichogamy have been reported for the genus Narcissus. However, the only mechanism for the separation of sexes reported up to date for Narcissus cyclamineus is herkogamy, while the presence of dichogamy and the type of incompatibility in this species remain uncertain. In this study, we analyze the patterns of sexual reproduction in N. cyclamineus to ascertain whether there is any selective pressure favouring sexual segregation or its maintenance and their mechanisms. N. cyclamineus is self-incompatible and dichogamy can be rejected for this species. Even though the species is self-incompatible, when cross-pollination is preceded by self-pollination the number of ovules available for legitimate crosses is diminished (ovule discounting). Pollinators are scarce during the flowering period, resulting in pollen limitation. It is suggested that both the scarcity of pollinators and ovule discounting may be acting synergically to promote herkogamy or its maintenance in this species. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Dichogamy; Herkogamy; Narcissus cyclamineus; Ovule discounting; Self-incompatibility; Self-interference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869082497

Their zygomorphic flowers have been the object of numerous studies in morphology, ecology, and developmental genetics, and new phylogenetic insights make it timely to synthesize knowledge about their evolution. Key features of Delphinieae flowers are unusual nectaries consisting of paired organs of the inner perianth whorl that are completely enclosed by a single dorsal organ of the outer whorl. We investigated the floral development of five annual, unicarpellate species of Delphinium, focusing on perianth organization. The results show that the nectar-storing organ in these species results from the postgenital fusion of two primordia of the internal perianth whorl. Eleven floral traits traced on a phylogeny of Delphinieae reveal only two homoplasies in the perianth, namely, the nightcap shape of the dorsal organ of the external perianth whorl and the reduction of the internal perianth whorl to two organs, traits that each evolved once in Aconitum and once in Delphinium. The length of the inner spur(s), the type of pollinator (bees, hummingbirds, hawkmoths), and species altitudinal ranges are unrelated, but most species are exclusively bumblebee adapted, and bee tongue lengths may match the internal nectar spur lengths. The paired inner spurs present in most Delphinieae require a back-and-forth movement of the tongue while the pollinator is inside the flower or hovering close to it. A new evolutionary scenario reconciles the diversity of perianth organization in Delphinieae with the tribe's conserved pollination mechanism. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Previous efforts at understanding nectar-pollinator-yeast interactions have focused on bee-pollinated plants, while the importance of nectarivorous ants as vectors for yeast dispersal remains unexplored so far. Here we assess the abundance and composition of the nectar fungal microbiota of the ant-pollinated plant Cytinus hypocistis, study whether yeast transmission is coupled with ant visitation, and discern whether ant- transported yeasts promote changes in nectar characteristics. Our results show that a high percentage of flowers (77%) and plants (94%) contained yeasts, with yeast cell density in nectar reaching up to 6.2 × 10 4 cells mm -3, being the highest densities associated with the presence of the nectar-specialist yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii. The establishment of fungal microbiota in nectar required flower visitation by ants, with 70% of yeast species transported by them being also detected in nectar. Ant-vectored yeasts diminished the nutritional quality of nectar, with flowers exposed to pollinators and yeasts containing significantly lower nectar sugar concentration than virgin flowers (13.4% and 22.8%, respectively). Nectar of flowers that harbored M. reukaufii showed the lowest quality, with nectar concentration declining significantly with increasing yeast density. Additionally, yeasts modified patterns of interpopulation variation in nectar traits, homo genizing differences between populations in some nectar attributes. We show for the first time that the outcome of the tripartite pollinator-flower-yeast interaction is highly dependent on the identity and inherent properties of the participants, even to the extent of influencing the species composition of this ternary system, and can be mediated by ecological characteristics of plant populations. Through their influence on plant functional traits, yeasts have the potential to alter nectar consumption, pollinator foraging behavior and ultimately plant reproduction. © 2012 The Authors.

The results on genetic integrity of long-term-stored gene bank accessions of wheat (self-pollinating) and rye (open-pollinating) cereal crops revealed a high degree of identity for wheat. In contrast, the out-pollinating accessions of rye exhibited shifts in allele frequencies. The genetic diversity of wheat and barley germplasm collected at intervals of 40 to 50 years in comparable geographical regions showed qualitative rather than a quantitative change in diversity. The inter- and intraspecific variation of seed longevity was analysed and differences were detected. Genetic studies in barley, wheat and oilseed rape revealed numerous QTL, indicating the complex and quantitative nature of seed longevity. Some of the loci identified were in genomic regions that co-localize with genes determining agronomic traits such as spike architecture or biotic and abiotic stress response. Finally, a genome-wide association mapping analysis of a core collection of wheat for flowering time was performed using diversity array technology (DArT) markers.

Selection on traits related to the mechanical fit with pollinators is expected to vary according to changes in pollinator assemblage. Provided that pollinators do not change over time selection on traits related to attraction, such as floral fragrance, is expected to be mainly affected by environmental conditions because its production is resource limited. We examined selection patterns on osmophore area (as a surrogate of odour production), nectary depth and flower number in the orchid Cyclopogon elatus during four consecutive years, and simultaneously recorded variations in weather conditions and differences in pollinator assemblages. We also studied whether the osmophore area was positively related to pollinator attraction and examined its possible trade-off with phenology. We found that patterns of selection on nectary depth did not vary significantly among years. This lack of temporal variation is consistent with the stability of a single bee species as the predominant pollinator. On the contrary, selection on osmophore area varied markedly and was negative during the driest year. Negative selection indicates that although pollinators visited plants with larger osmophore areas more frequently, it did not translate into higher fitness. Plants with larger osmophore areas begin to flower earlier and might be more affected by weather conditions, not directly due to resource availability but indirectly because of the lack of pollinators at the beginning of the flowering season. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Drought stress; Floral fragrance; Orchidaceae; Osmophores; Phenotypic selection; Temporal variation in selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867676719

Seed dispersal is often strongly spatially restricted, making gene flow primarily dependent on pollen dispersal within and into populations. To understand distance-dependent pollination success, pollen dispersal and gene flow were studied within and into a population of the alpine monocarpic perennial Campanula thyrsoides.MethodsA paternity analysis was performed on sampled seed families using microsatellites, genotyping 22 flowering adults and 331 germinated offspring to estimate gene flow, and pollen analogues were used to estimate pollen dispersal. The focal population was situated among 23 genetically differentiated populations on a subalpine mountain plateau (&lt;10 km2) in central Switzerland.Key ResultsPaternity analysis assigned 110 offspring (33.2 ) to a specific pollen donor (i.e. 'father') in the focal population. Mean pollination distance was 17.4 m for these offspring, and the pollen dispersal curve based on positive LOD scores of all 331 offspring was strongly decreasing with distance. The paternal contribution from 20-35 offspring (6.0-10.5 ) originated outside the population, probably from nearby populations on the plateau. Multiple potential fathers were assigned to each of 186 offspring (56.2 ). The pollination distance to 'mother' plants was negatively affected by the mothers' degree of spatial isolation in the population. Variability in male mating success was not related to the degree of isolation of father plants.ConclusionsPollen dispersal patterns within the C. thyrsoides population are affected by spatial positioning of flowering individuals and pollen dispersal may therefore contribute to the course of evolution of populations of this species. Pollen dispersal into the population was high but apparently not strong enough to prevent the previously described substantial among-population differentiation on the plateau, which may be due to the monocarpic perenniality of this species. © 2012 The Author.

Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of seedlessness in 'Xiangshui' lemon requires detailed data on pollen and embryo sac fertility, embryo development and compatibility mechanisms governing self- and cross-pollination. The results of the current study indicate that the fertility of pollen and mature embryo sac remains normal. When flowers were self- or cross-pollinated, pollen grains of 'Xiangshui' were able to germinate on the stigma. In the case of self-pollination, pollen tubes became twisted, tube tips enlarged and tubes ruptured in the bottom of stigma. Following cross-pollination, tubes were able to grow normally in the style and ovary and enter the embryo sac, where double fertilization took place. Embryonic development resulting from cross-pollination was normal. After cross-pollination, the zygote began to divide at 2 weeks post-pollination, with early globular embryos observed after 3 weeks, globular and heart-shaped embryos at 4 weeks, torpedo-shaped embryos at 5 weeks, cotyledonary embryos at 6 weeks and thereafter germinable seeds. After self-pollination, however, ovules began to abort at 2 weeks post-pollination, with ovules disappearing at 5 weeks, ultimately producing seedless fruits. Emasculated unpollinated flowers also developed into seedless fruits, indicating that seedlessness contributes to parthenocarpy. However, gametophytic self-incompatibility has a major role in seedlessness in 'Xiangshui' lemon by blocking fertilization at the bottom of the stigma. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Citrus limon cv.

Here, we compare queen mating frequency and allelic diversity between colonies sampled in disturbed and undisturbed areas in Thailand. Microsatellite analysis of 18 colonies in 6 aggregations showed no significant difference in paternity frequency at disturbed and undisturbed habitats. Measures of F ST and genetic differentiation between aggregations were not significantly different from zero (P &gt; 0.05); measures of allelic diversity showed no differences between disturbed and undisturbed sites, and there was no evidence of population structuring based on the program STRUCTURE.

However, nonmolecular synapomorphies are unclear, and more comparative data are needed to elucidate deep relationships within the order. In this article, pollen and tapetum characters are reevaluated in relation to recent hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships within clusioids. This is done to shed light on the evolution of pollen and tapetum, particularly the evolution of pollen dyads, and also to assess the potential utility of pollen and tapetal characters in the systematics of the clusioids. The comparative morphology of pollen and tapetum is examined in selected taxa from Bonnetiaceae (Bonnetia), Calophylaceae (Caraipa), Clusiaceae (Clusia, Garcinia), Hypericaceae (Hypericum), and Podostemaceae (Podostemum). Pollen and tapetum characters in clusioids and selected outgroups are tabulated, based on both original observations and an extensive literature search, and then optimized onto a recent molecular phylogeny. The optimizations indicate that unusual pollen dispersed as dyads has evolved from monads in the late-branching Podostemoideae (Podostemaceae) clade. Relatively small-sized pollen (E 1/4 11-30 ?m) is a potential synapomorphy for Hypericaceae and Podostemaceae, supporting the putative sister relationship between these two families, and pollen with circular or elliptic endoapertures is a potential synapomorphy for Bonnetiaceae. Several pollen characters (size, shape, apertures, and sculpture) indicate that Weddellina (Weddellinoideae: Podostemaceae) is more closely related to Hypericaceae than are Tristichoideae. Irregular granular exines have arisen several times independently within clusioids. A high level of polymorphism occurs in pollen characters in Clusiaceae and is probably related to high levels of diversity in floral morphology, pollination mechanisms, and pollinators, particularly in Clusia and Garcinia. By contrast, pollen of Podostemoideae is relatively uniform, despite developmental differences in microsporogenesis type and the presence of dyads. This may reflect evolutionary canalization or convergent evolution in these enigmatic aquatic plants. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

In aquatic systems, typically characterized by low collector Reynolds numbers (Re), the rate of particle capture determines the efficiencies of a range of processes such as seagrass pollination, suspension feeding by corals and larval settlement. In this paper, we use direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a two-dimensional laminar flow to accurately quantify the rate of capture of low-inertia particles by a cylindrical collector for Re ? 47$ (i.e. a range where there is no vortex shedding). We investigate the dependence of both the capture rate and maximum capture angle on both the collector Reynolds number and the ratio of particle size to collector size.

Hybridization followed by introgression and genetic swamping is often mentioned as a potential threat for the conservation of P. nigra. This potential threat is supposed to be higher when the cultivated poplars are reproductively more effective compared to P. nigra. We investigated hybridization events of P. nigra females with cultivated P. × canadensis and P. nigra 'Italica' along the IJzer river in Flanders (Belgium). We also compared the reproductive potential of P. nigra and P. × canadensis. Methods - After first determining the genotypic diversity within P. nigra, we looked for diagnostic microsatellite alleles of P. deltoides in the offspring of open-pollinated P. nigra. We also studied the possible paternity by the cultivar P. nigra 'Italica'. The reproductive potential of P. × canadensis and P. nigra was compared in terms of potential seed set. Key results - This study provides evidence for natural hybridization between P. nigra and P. × canadensis in West Flanders. In 58% of the seedlings from the open pollinated P. nigra trees, at least one diagnostic allele of P. deltoides was detected. P. nigra 'Italica' was likely the father of only one seedling. The exotic P. × canadensis showed a significantly higher potential for seed set compared to native P. nigra. The genotypic diversity of P. nigra was extremely low with only two (female) genets among 209 black poplars. Conclusions - Natural hybridization with P. × canadensis occurs and may pose a significant threat to the conservation of P. nigra in West Flanders. To reduce the risk of introgression and genetic swamping of P. nigra by P. × canadensis, we strongly advise reforestation using multiple genotypes of P. nigra from neighbouring regions taking into account balanced sex-ratios. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Genetic diversity; Hybridization; Introgression; Populus nigra; Populus x canadensis; Potential seed set; Reproductive potential,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868382704

'Chinese Spring' (CS). Hybrid plants (2n = 43, AABBDHch + 2Cc) monosomic for the gametocidal chromosome were crossed with common wheat both CS and Anza. Rearranged 3Hch chromosomes were identified and cytologically characterized by FISH using both pAs1 repetitive sequence and genomic H. chilense DNA as probes. Two deletions on the short and long arm respectively, (del3HchS and del3HchL) and two reciprocal centromeric translocations involving chromosome 3Hch and 3D were identified. The breakpoints (FL) in the deleted chromosomes were determined as 56 % in del3HchS and 42 % in del3HchL, respectively. In order to obtain homozygous plants for rearranged 3Hch chromosomes the derived progenies were self-pollinated for four generations and the following lines were established: (1) disomic substitution DS-del3HchS(3D) (2n = 42) in CS; (2) disomic addition DA-del3HchL (2n = 44) in Anza; (3) homozygous translocation T3HchS·3DL (2n = 42) in CS, and (4) homozygous translocation T3DS·3HchL (2n = 42) in CS. These four lines were morphologically and agronomically characterized under field conditions. All lines were fertile, stable and vigorous. The four lines obtained were used to develop specific DNA markers for chromosome 3Hch in wheat. We studied the applicability of 162 barley chromosome 3H primers (55 genomic-SSRs, 17 genomic-STSs, 66 EST-SSRs and 24 EST-SNPs) to amplify markers showing polymorphism between H. chilense and common wheat. A total of 53 (32.7 %) markers gave reliable amplifications in H. chilense and among them 31 (19.1 %) were polymorphic between H. chilense and CS and Anza. Eighteen of the 31 polymorphic loci were mapped onto different chromosome sub-arm regions of chromosome 3Hch.

Gene duplicates are generated through whole genome duplications (WGD) or small-scale genome duplications (SSD). Although WGD preserves the stoichiometric relationships between duplicates, those arising from SSD are usually unbalanced and are expected to follow different evolutionary dynamics than those formed by WGD. To dissect the role of the mechanism of duplication in these differential dynamics and determine whether this role was shared across species, we performed a genome wide evolutionary analysis of gene duplications arising from the most recent WGD events and contemporary episodes of SSD in four model species representing distinct plant evolutionary lineages. We found an excess of relaxed purifying selection after duplication in SSD paralogs compared with WGD, most of which may have been the result of functional divergence events between gene copies as estimated by measures of genetic distances. These differences were significant in three angiosperm genomes but not in the moss species Physcomitrella patens. Although the comparison of models of evolution does not attribute a relevant role to the mechanism of duplication in the evolution duplicates, distribution of retained genes among Gene Ontology functional categories support the conclusion that evolution of gene duplicates depends on its origin of duplication (WGD and SSD) but, most importantly, on the species. Similar lineage-specific biases were also observed in protein network connectivity, translational efficiency, and selective constraints acting on synonymous codon usage. Although the mechanism of duplication may determine gene retention, our results attribute a dominant role to the species in determining the ultimate pattern of duplicate gene retention and reveal an unanticipated complexity in the evolutionary dynamics and functional specialization of duplicated genes in plants. © 2012 The Author.",functional specialization; gene duplication; small-scale genome duplication; whole genome duplication,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867775180

Box 100281, Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg 3209, South Africa","Acacia mearnsii (black wattle) is a commercially important forestry species in South Africa, grown for its timber and bark. Due to its invasiveness, it is also considered be an alien invader species and for this reason the production of a sterile triploid variety would be highly desirable for South African commercial forestry. Previous research on crosses between diploid and tetraploid parent plants to produce triploid progeny has resulted in poor seed set. One possible barrier preventing seed set could be the effect of temperature and relative humidity, within the isolation bags used during cross-pollination operations. For this reason in 2011 diploid polyads were subjected to various temperature and relative humidity combinations, to simulate conditions recorded within the isolation bags being used in the 2010 flowering season in order to see if the conditions were detrimental to polyad viability. The results showed that when polyads were exposed to extreme temperatures (> 30. °C) and low relative humidities (RH's) (10%), polyad viability and pollen tube development, decreased significantly. In contrast the effect of high RH's in combination with low temperatures for long periods appeared to be beneficial to polyad viability and pollen tube growth. The results also indicated that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) agar germination medium was superior to the Brewbaker and Kwack (BK) 30% agar germination medium for determining polyad viability as it resulted in greater number of pollen tubes per polyad, which were healthier in appearance. The Sigma® DAB peroxidase vital stain test overestimated polyad viability and showed no significant differences between the various treatments, highlighting its unreliability as a test. Polyad viability and pollen tube development were compared across three flowering seasons (2009, 2010 and 2011) and similar trends were apparent with some seasonal differences. © 2012 South African Association of Botanists.",Isolation bags; Polyads; Relative humidity; Temperature,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866529561

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Fagus sylvatica (Beech) is a large usually single-stemmed deciduous tree native to south-east England but now growing over almost the whole of the British Isles, often planted as a forestry tree on all but the wettest soils. It forms extensive woodlands, where it is dominant over a large altitudinal range, competing primarily with Quercus robur. The outcome of this competition is determined by local soil and climatic conditions leading to a gradation into oak woodlands. It is monoecious, wind-pollinated and notable for its periodic large seed numbers (mast years); seed is dispersed by birds and mammals but mostly drops below the parent tree. Fagus sylvatica is hardy, very shade tolerant, casts a deep shade and is fairly resistant to browsing but susceptible to spring frosts. Due to its shallow rooting and intensive rather than extensive mode of soil water exploitation, it is also susceptible to drought, and this is likely to be the main factor controlling its expected response to climate change. Fagus sylvatica is facing few conservation problems, and indeed, its range is currently expanding into central Europe. However, in the face of climate change, its range is likely to contract from its extremes in all but the north, and Phytophthora diseases may become more serious. © 2012 The Authors.

Since any knowledge gained from Arabidopsis on plant virus susceptibility factors is likely to be transferable to crop species, Arabidopsis's natural variation was searched for host factors essential for PPV infection. To locate regions of the genome associated with susceptibility to PPV, linkage analysis was performed on six biparental populations as well as on multiparental lines. To refine quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, a genome-wide association analysis was carried out using 147 Arabidopsis accessions. Evidence was found for linkage on chromosomes 1, 3 and 5 with restriction of PPV long-distance movement. The most relevant signals occurred within a region at the bottom of chromosome 3, which comprises seven RTM3-like TRAF domain-containing genes. Since the resistance mechanism analyzed here is recessive and the rtm3 knockout mutant is susceptible to PPV infection, it suggests that other gene(s) present in the small identified region encompassing RTM3 are necessary for PPV long-distance movement. In consequence, we report here the occurrence of host factor(s) that are indispensable for virus long-distance movement. © 2012 New Phytologist Trust.",Arabidopsis thaliana; Association mapping; Plum pox virus; PPV; QTL mapping; TRAF domain-containing proteins; Virus movement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867402680

In the Brassicaceae, the self-incompatibility system is mediated by the pollen S-locus Cys-Rich/S-locus Protein11 (SCR/SP11) ligand and the pistil S Receptor Kinase (SRK). While the SCR/SP11-SRK recognition system has been identified in several species across the Brassicaceae, less is known about the conservation of the SRK-activated cellular responses in the stigma, following self-pollen contact. The ARM Repeat Containing1 (ARC1) E3 ubiquitin ligase functions downstream of SRK for the self-incompatibility response in Brassica, but it has been suggested that ARC1 is not required in Arabidopsis species. Here, we surveyed the presence of ARC1 orthologs in several recently sequenced genomes from Brassicaceae species that had diversified;20 to 40 million years ago. Surprisingly, the ARC1 gene was deleted in several species that had lost the self-incompatibility trait, suggesting that ARC1 may lose functionality in the transition to self-mating. To test the requirement of ARC1 in a self-incompatible Arabidopsis species, transgenic ARC1 RNA interference Arabidopsis lyrata plants were generated, and they exhibited reduced self-incompatibility responses resulting in successful fertilization. Thus, this study demonstrates a conserved role for ARC1 in the self-pollen rejection response within the Brassicaceae. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871859886

Moench is the world's fifth-most important arable crop. Although primarily cultivated in warmer regions, the area devoted to this crop in Europe has increased over the past few years - among other things because sorghum produces attractive yields even when little water is available. In order to increase the sparse information on cultivating grain sorghum currently available in Switzerland, trials were conducted from 2009 to 2011 in various Swiss regions with several varieties. In favourable environmental conditions, the earliest maturing varieties achieved yields of up to 110 dt ha-1 with 16 % humidity at the day of the harvest in small-plot trials. Because of sorghum's greater need for warmth than maize, planting in cold-air zones or in basins, or early sowing should be avoided. This will ensure a relatively quick juvenile development and good pollination. A piglet feeding trial showed that Swiss-produced sorghum is of comparable quality to the imported grain, and meets feeding requirements. Preliminary infection trials with Fusarium species resulted in low infection rates and low deoxynivalenol (DON) contents. As evidenced by the successful cultivation of Sorghum bicolor in favourable maize-growing areas of Switzerland, changing climatic conditions make it essential for Swiss farmers to have access to more detailed information of different types of millet and sorghum grown in Switzerland.",Climate change; Feeding trial; Field trials; Fusarium; Pig; Sorghum bicolor (L.) moench; Switzerland; Variety,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880054943

Cross progeny with normal wild-type (WT) plants successfully characterized the mechanism of pistil abortion, and the mutant was designated 'tpa' (turnip pistil abortion). Further morphological investigations showed that the tpa mutant included two phenotypes, pistil abortion partially (PAP) and pistil abortion completely (PAC), and our recent result showed that the tpa trait was controlled by two recessive genes (Wu et al. 2011). In this study, comparisons of the floral organs indicated that corolla size and petal, sepal, filament, and anther length measurements did not significantly differ between the tpa and WT plants. Subsequently, the activities of enzymes (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase) related to the metabolism of reactive oxygen, the O 2 - production rate, as well as the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde were tested and found to be generally higher in tpa floral organs than in the WT. The reverse was true for the flower stems, however. Quantitative differences in peroxidase, cytochrome oxidase, and esterase isoenzyme patterns were also detected among these different organs. These findings suggest that pistil abortion is probably correlated with the unbalanced homeostasis of ROS antioxidant enzymes. Moreover, a specific band was recognized exclusively in the tpa plants using random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Sequencing and blasting results indicated that the 878-bp DNA fragment was located in the D1/D2/D3 region, near the 5? end of the 26S rDNA. This study valuably adds to the current knowledge of and will help further elucidate the biological mechanism of female sterility induction. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",26S rDNA; Antioxidant enzyme; Brassica rapa ssp. rapifera Sinsk; Isoenzyme; Pistil abortion; RAPD; ROS; Turnip,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867664704

Understanding how patterns of spatial isolation influence pollen dispersal and interact with background patterns of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) is critical for evaluating the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. In the endangered tropical timber tree Dysoxylum malabaricum (Meliaceae), we apply eleven microsatellite markers with paternity and parentage analysis to directly estimate historic gene flow and contemporary pollen dispersal across a large area (216 km2) in a highly fragmented agro-forest landscape. A comparison of genetic diversity and genetic structure in adult and juvenile life stages indicates an increase in differentiation and FSGS over time. Paternity analysis and parentage analysis demonstrate high genetic connectivity across the landscape by pollen dispersal. A comparison between mother trees in forest patches with low and high densities of adult trees shows that the frequency of short-distance mating increases, as does average kinship among mates in low-density stands. This indicates that there are potentially negative genetic consequences of low population density associated with forest fragmentation. Single isolated trees, in contrast, frequently receive heterogeneous pollen from distances exceeding 5 km. We discuss the processes leading to the observed patterns of pollen dispersal and the implications of this for conservation management of D. malabaricum and tropical trees more generally. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",gene flow; microsatellites; spatial genetic structure; tropical forest restoration; Western Ghats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868211033

More effort has gone into developing this species for improved growth, tree form and wood properties than with any other species. This substantial investment has been threatened in the last 10 years by the pitch canker fungus, Fusarium circinatum. The fungus infects and contaminates nursery plants and, once transferred to the field, causes severe mortality of young trees in the first year after establishment. Although nurserymen have some control of the disease, it is recognised that the best long-term solution to mitigate damage because of F. circinatum infection is to identify tolerant species, clones and hybrids for deployment in plantations in the future. Research has shown that alternative species such as P. tecunumanii, P. maximinoi and P. elliottii are suitable for warm sites. Pine hybrids, particularly between P. patula and the high-elevation sources of P. tecunumanii, appear to be a suitable replacement on subtemperate and temperate sites. Although these alternative species and hybrids are more sensitive to subfreezing temperatures than P. patula, their planting range can be increased by including cold tolerance as a selection criterion. Future breeding efforts will most certainly focus on improving the tolerance of pure P. patula to F. circinatum, which can be achieved by identifying specific family crosses and tolerant clones. The commercial deployment of disease-tolerant control-pollinated P. patula and hybrid families will most likely be established as rooted cuttings, which requires more advanced propagation technology. In the long term, new seed orchards comprised of P. patula clones tolerant to F. circinatum could be used to produce seed for seedling production. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.",Camcore; Fusarium circinatum; Pinus patula; Pinus patula × Pinus tecunumanii; site-species matching,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869988230

Using the standard barcoding sequence, we were able to identify 51 of 55 species. Potential problems included a suite of species in the genus Andrena, which were recalcitrant to sequencing, mitochondrial heteroplasmy and parasitic flies, which led to the production of erroneous sequences from DNA extracts. DNA barcoding enabled the assignment of morphologically unidentifiable females of the parasitic genus Sphecodes to their nominal taxa. It also enabled correction of the Irish bee list for morphologically inaccurately identified specimens. However, the standard COI barcode was unable to differentiate the recently diverged taxa Sphecodes ferruginatus and S. hyalinatus.

Diseased seedlings have been inadvertently carried to the field, which in turn have died and has reduced stocking below an acceptable level. Tree breeders have suggested that the only long-term solution to limit infection by this pathogen is to identify and deploy tolerant P. patula families. A commonly used technique to identify tolerant clones is to artificially inoculate open-pollinated progeny from orchard clones with F. circinatum under greenhouse conditions. In these trials, large variation in tolerance to the pathogen among seedlings within open-pollinated families was observed and this could be influenced by the pollen parent. Therefore, identifying individual full-sib families, where both parents are known, should improve the identification of tolerant families, which can then be repeated. In this study, cuttings from control-pollinated P. patula seedling hedges were inoculated with F. circinatum in a greenhouse. The results showed large family variation where some of the full-sib families were similar in tolerance to P. elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii seedlings.

Seed dormancy, which determines the resistance or susceptibility to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), is a complex trait. It is largely controlled by the antagonistic action of the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellic acid, but also has a large component of genotype × environment interaction. Recent studies have revealed a role for epigenetic changes through histone modification in controlling seed dormancy. However, the role of DNA methylation in seed development and dormancy is not known. In this study, we explored the role of ARGONAUTE4_9 class genes of the DNA methylation pathway in seed development and dormancy in barley. Our results show that the two AGO4_9 class genes in barley, i. e. AGO1002 and AGO1003, are preferentially expressed in ovaries at meiosis and in embryos 25 days after pollination (DAP). The expression of AGO1003 is two to fivefold higher than that of AGO1002 in these tissues, demonstrating differential expression of these genes. We also analysed the expression of AGO1003 in embryos of PHS-resistant and -susceptible varieties at 25 DAP and found a significant variation in the expression of this gene in seeds of dormant and non-dormant lines. The observed expression pattern of AGO1002 and AGO1003 suggests a possible role in sporogenesis and post-fertilization seed development. Indirectly these results imply a potential role of DNA methylation in seed development and seed dormancy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",ARGONAUTE; DNA methylation; Pre-harvest sprouting; Seed development; Seed dormancy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867741613

In the present study, crosses resembling a commercial breeding strategy were made to determine if the improved ornamental quality observed in the T1 generation was inherited to the offspring. F1 lines were produced by crossing the commercial Kalanchoë cultivar 'Sarah' with a selected T1 line. Subsequently, F2 populations were produced by self-pollination of individual selected lines. The rol-genes were inherited to the progeny and the presence of rol-genes was confirmed in all F1 and many F2 plant lines exhibiting dwarfism. Screening of F1 and F2 plants showed that the rol-genes were inherited together. Besides decreased plant height, several F1 and F2 lines containing rol-genes exhibited changes in plant diameter, number of branches, flower diameter and time to first open flower and duration of flowering compared to the WT 'Molly'. Furthermore, increased ethylene tolerance was observed in several lines containing rol-genes compared to the WT 'Sarah'. Screening of three selected F2 populations derived from self-pollination of F1 lines containing rol-genes indicated a shift in distribution towards a lower mean plant height within the entire plant population compared to a control population of plants without rol-genes.

For this purpose, 'Uzunoglu' peach [Prunus persica L. (Batsch)] has been used extensively for long years. The fruits of 'Uzunoglu' peach are having no commercial value except good rootstock characteristics. The objectives of this study were to compare the isozyme polymorphism and nuclear DNA content variation in free-pollinated peach seedling populations. During the study, isozyme variation was surveyed for five enzymes including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, EC 1.1.1.42), malate dehydrogenase (MDH, EC 1.11.1.37), peroxidase (PRX, EC 1.11.1.7) and phosphogluco mutase (PGM, EC 2.7.5.1) in the seedlings. Moreover, genome size (Cvalue) was measured in peach seedling rootstocks. Cell nuclei were isolated from leaf tissues of the seedlings and then fluorescence intensities were measured on propidium iodide stained nuclei by using 'Tahiti' lime [Citrus latifolia Tan.] and mungbean [Vigna radiata 'Berken'] as internal reference standard by flow cytometry. According to the obtained results, isozyme variation was detected in 5 isozyme systems resulting 7 loci and 13 alleles. Isozyme polymorphism has only been observed in malate dehydrogenase profiles. Results obtained from flow cytometric analysis indicated that all analyzed seedlings were found to be diploid genomes with 0.574 pg/2C value in average. The study demonstrates the value of clonal rootstocks for eliminating of genetic variability within seedling rootstocks. © ISHS 2012.",C-value; Flow cytometry; Isozyme; Peach; Rootstock; Seedling; Variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872072535

Seedlings are difficult to distinguish morphologically, and once grafted, no above ground material is available for visual identification. To avoid misidentification and to protect plant cultivars and patents, DNA fingerprinting was investigated as a robust rootstock identification tool. The objective was to identify peach seedling rootstocks of Bailey, Guardian® 'BY520-9' selection 3-17-7, Halford, Kakamas, Lovell, Nemaguard, Nemared and S-37. Twenty-eight SSR markers were screened on the eight rootstocks, and 23 exhibited polymorphism. Ten SSR markers were found to amplify at least four patterns among the eight rootstocks. Each rootstock clone could be discriminated by as few as a single SSR marker (e.g., Lovell) or at most, nine markers (e.g., S-37). No single perfect marker was found that could differentiate all rootstocks from each other. Marker BPPCT008 had the highest identification potential because it amplified seven patterns and was capable of uniquely distinguishing six of the eight rootstocks directly. Seedling identification was conducted by screening seedlings of open-pollinated rootstock clones. It was more difficult than parent genotype identification because a heterozygous pattern for a rootstock clone segregated in its seedlings. However, unique segregated patterns were found in the rootstock seedlings. Seedlings of several rootstocks such as Bailey, Kakamas, Nemaguard and Nemared could be identified by single SSR markers. Seedlings of 3-17-7 and S-37 could be identified by marker combinations. Seedlings of Lovell and Halford were differentiated from the other rootstocks by single markers. However, there were no SSRs or marker combinations to differentiate Lovell seedlings from Halford seedlings. The SSR markers presented in this study could be used as a practical fingerprinting system for rootstock seedling identification. This technology will be useful to test rootstocks for trueness to type for nurseries and commercial peach growers, and also will be helpful in protecting seed propagated proprietary rights (i.e., PVP) for fruit tree breeders. © ISHS 2012.",3-17-7; Bailey; Halford; Kakamas; Lovell; Nemaguard; Nemared; S-37,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872080858

In the first step during 1995-1999, research studies on the breeding of early cultivars adapted for subtropical conditions and late cultivars for highland areas were carried out. 8991 flowers were pollinated both in Pozanti (highlands) and in Adana (subtropics). The obtained seedlings were planted in Adana to obtain high growing performance and early fruiting. This paper contains the results of the late cultivar studies. One of the main aims of this research was to improve the quality characteristics of 'Ustun' local very late peach cultivar by cross breeding with 'J.H. Hale', 'Monroe' and 'Rio-Oso-Gem'. In addition, the seedlings coming from open pollination between them and 'Suncrest' peach cultivar were obtained. In the second step of this research, the best considered twenty seedlings were selected and planted in Pozanti Research and Application Center in 2000.

It would be interesting to combine the compact growth of H. niger with the flower colour and patterns of H. × hybridus. As a prerequisite for interspecific hybridisations, the Helleborus plant material of different genotypes within these two groups was characterised via DNA fingerprinting. Based on genome-wide distributed AFLP markers, genetic distances after Nei and Li (1979) were calculated between genotypes within H. niger (0.009-0.064), within H. × hybridus (0.020-0.070) and between genotypes of H. niger and H. × hybridus (0.222-0.294). Crossing barriers between H. × hybridus and H. niger were localised by observations of pollen tube growth in situ. They were found to be predominantly postzygotic. In order to overcome these barriers embryo rescue techniques via ovule culture were successfully applied. Ovules were isolated from the maternal plants five to seven weeks after pollination in most cases and then cultured in vitro. Overall, 13 hybrids of H. × hybridus × H. niger were obtained from 11,284 cultured ovules and verified by molecular DNA markers.",Genetic relationship; Helleborus; Helleborus orientalis; Hybrids; Interspecific hybrids; Ovule culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872015416

The physiological bases of peach seed dormancy and bud break chilling requirement are considered strongly related, and this relationship could be used for early selection of low chilling genotypes. Peach seeds germinated more quickly under alternating than under constant temperatures. We studied the effect of the embryo genotype on the chilling requirement for seed germination. The seeds evaluated were obtained from the low chilling peach 'Campinas-1', which was either open-pollinated or crossed with the high chilling cultivar 'Miraflores'. The open pollinated 'Campinas-1' trees were surrounded by low or very low chill cultivars. The seeds (without the endocarp) were conditioned in sealed, transparent, polyethylene bags containing moist germination paper. The bags were placed in the dark in a growth chamber that alternated between 5 and 10°C every two days. Germination percentages were grouped into four-day classes. Seeds of open-pollinated 'Campinas-1' began to germinate twenty days after stratification and reached about 80% germination in the following two days. The germination of 'Campinas-1' × 'Miraflores' seeds began after 25 days of stratification, reaching 80% after 40 days of stratification. The seeds of the open-pollinated 'Campinas-1' germinated over a short period of time (from the 20th to the 27th day), whereas the hybrid seeds had a wider interval of germination time (24th to 47th day), showing the quantitative effect of the seed dormancy trait. The results indicate a strong effect of embryo genotype on the chilling requirement of the seeds, encouraging the selection of low chilling requirement genotypes based on seed dormancy. The alternation of temperatures favourable for overcoming dormancy with temperatures favourable for seed germination can be useful to screen genotypes with fewer differences in chilling requirement. © ISHS 2012.",Prunus persica; Selection; Stratification,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872061995

Development of new seedless mandarin cultivars has a high priority for many citrus industries worldwide. The recovery of triploid hybrids is the most promising approach to achieve this goal, since triploids have a very low pollen and ovule fertility and usually are seedless or produce very low numbers of seeds, and do not induce the formation of seeds in other cultivars by cross pollination. The objective of our breeding program is to produce new high quality easy peeling and seedless mandarin cultivars. Citrus triploid plants can be recovered by 2x×4x sexual hybridizations. Triploid embryos are found in normal and undeveloped seeds that do not germinate under greenhouse conditions. Extensive breeding programs based on this type of hybridization require very effective methodologies for recovery of new tetraploid parents, embryo rescue and ploidy evaluation. Different approaches have been implemented to obtain new tetraploid parents. Spontaneous autotetraploid plants of apomictic genotypes have been selected from seedbeds by flow cytometry and autotetraploid plants of non apomictic genotypes have been obtained by chromosome duplication with treatments of micrografted shoot tips with colchicine or oryzalin. Symmetric protoplast fusion is also used to produce tetraploid genotypes. So far, we have obtained more than 4,400 triploid hybrids from 77 parental combinations.

We investigated the fitness of progeny from experimental self- and cross-pollinations in eight populations of different size of Echium wildpretii, a rare endemic plant of the arid subalpine zone of the Canarian island of Tenerife. As control treatments we used open pollination and autonomous selfing. The seed set of open-pollinated flowers was 55% higher than that of autonomously selfed flowers, showing the importance of animal pollination for reproductive success. The seed set, seed mass and germination rate of seedlings of hand-selfed flowers was similar to that of hand-crossed flowers, indicating weak inbreeding depression (seed set -4.4%, seed mass -4.1%, germination -7.3%). Similarly, under normal watering there were no significant effects of inbreeding on seedling survival (-3.0%). However, under low watering of seedlings inbreeding depression was high (survival -50.2%). Seed set of open- and hand-outcrossed-pollinated flowers was higher in large than in small populations, possibly due to more frequent biparental inbreeding in the latter. However, later measures of progeny fitness were not significantly influenced by population size. We predict that increasing drought duration and frequency due to climate change and reductions of population sizes may increase inbreeding depression in this charismatic plant species and thus threaten its future survival in the longer term. © 2012 Sedlacek et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868130706

Several studies have reported increasing biotic specialization toward the tropics [4-7], whereas others have not found latitudinal trends once accounting for sampling bias [8, 9] or differences in plant diversity [10, 11]. Thus, the direction of the latitudinal specialization gradient remains contentious. With an unprecedented global data set, we investigated how biotic specialization between plants and animal pollinators or seed dispersers is associated with latitude, past and contemporary climate, and plant diversity. We show that in contrast to expectation, biotic specialization of mutualistic networks is significantly lower at tropical than at temperate latitudes. Specialization was more closely related to contemporary climate than to past climate stability, suggesting that current conditions have a stronger effect on biotic specialization than historical community stability. Biotic specialization decreased with increasing local and regional plant diversity. This suggests that high specialization of mutualistic interactions is a response of pollinators and seed dispersers to low plant diversity. This could explain why the latitudinal specialization gradient is reversed relative to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Low mutualistic network specialization in the tropics suggests higher tolerance against extinctions in tropical than in temperate communities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867849844

Imprinting, referring to preferential expression of maternal or paternal alleles, plays an important role in reproduction development of both mammals and plants. DNA methylation is critical for determining whether the maternal or paternal alleles of an imprinted gene is expressed or silenced. In flowering plants, there is a double fertilization event in reproduction: one sperm fertilizes the egg cell to form embryo and a second sperm fuses with the central cell to give rise to endosperm. Endosperm is the tissue where imprinting occurs in plants. MEDEA (MEA), a SET domain Polycomb group gene, was the first plant gene shown to be imprinted in endosperm, and its maternal expression is controlled by DNA methylation and demethylation. Recently there has been significant progress in identifying imprinted genes as well as understanding molecular mechanisms of imprinting in plants. Up to date, approximately 350 genes were found to have differential parent-of-origin expression in plant endosperm (Arabidopsis, corn, and rice). In Arabidopsis, many imprinted genes are regulated by the DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) and the DNA-demethylating glycosylase DEMETER (DME), and/or their chromatin states regulated by Polycomb group proteins (PRC2). There are also maternally expressed genes regulated by unknown mechanisms in endosperm. In this protocol, we describe in detail how to perform a genetic cross, isolate the endosperm tissue from seed, determine the imprinting status of a gene, and analyze DNA methylation of imprinted genes by bisulfite sequencing in Arabidopsis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Arabidopsis; Bisulfite sequencing; DNA methylation; Endosperm; Epigenetics; Imprinting; Parent-of-origin; Plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867549889

It is grown under subsistence farming and its yields are low (1.0-1.7tha -1), with production insufficient to meet national needs. The "" Seeds of Life"" project, operating since 2001, has introduced open-pollinated maize varieties from other countries via the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and evaluated them for their suitability in local farming systems. Firstly, introductions were screened for yield potential and farmer-acceptable traits in replicated trials on research stations. Then, best selections were provided to farmers for evaluation against their local varieties under their own cultivation practices. More than 1000 on-farm trials were conducted across all of the agro-ecological zones of East Timor from the 2005/06 to the 2008/09 season. Mean annual yield advantage of the test varieties Suwan 5 and Sele over "" local"" varieties ranged from 36 to 54% and considerable initial adoption and diffusion to non-participating households was recorded. The large number of trials conducted over a wide range of agro-ecological and management conditions provided the opportunity to use analysis of variance to test the significance of factors contributing to yield. Major yield determinants were variety, agro-ecological zone, soil pH, plant density at harvest, frequency of project staff visits and wealth status of farmer. This combination of varietal testing with agronomic assessment has provided a basis for refinement of recommended cultivation practices for maize in East Timor. The project has demonstrated the feasibility of raising national maize production so as to approach national consumption needs. However, major constraints to realizing this potential are production of quality seed of improved varieties and its widespread distribution and effective extension of improved cultivation and grain storage practices. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Adoption; Food security; Maize varieties; Management factors; Multilocation; On-farm trials; Participatory varietal selection; Seed systems; Timor-Leste,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867127595

A vast majority of deceptive syndromes occur within the orchid family. While many cheating flowers have been described and are well known, there are still many curious cases that need further investigation. One prime example of such a case is Cypripedium calceolus, known as European lady's slipper orchid. While the flower has been of interest to many prominent scientists for over a century, its pollination is still not fully understood. Both visual and olfactory cues seem to play an important role in pollinator attraction. In this study we focussed on the olfactory cues in order to explore their relationship (in future experiments) with floral visual cues, including the unique asymmetry of these flowers. Some of the plants' floral fragrances were used in Electroantennography experiments. Eleven chemical compounds were applied to the antennae of Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera. Even though these species are not regular visitors of C. calceolus, we were interested to see whether there were common principles in their responses to the flowers' scent that might justify extrapolating to other pollinator species such as sand bees that get trapped in these orchids and fly out of the flowers afterwards with pollen smeared on their body. The results show that while both species react similarly to most of the odours, some of the tested acetates induced a significantly greater reaction in B. terrestris antennae. These acetates play an important role in bumblebee pheromones, but their relevance for the natural pollinators of C. calceolus remains to be confirmed to see whether chemical mimicry by these flowers is deliberately employed to attract pollinators.",Bees; Behaviour; Chemical mimicry; Deception; Eag; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867423609

However, the effects of soil quality on the interactions of plants with beneficial arthropods, such as pollinators, have not been extensively examined. We studied the effects of vermicompost (earthworm compost, VC) soil amendment on behavioral and physiological responses of pollinators to flowers and floral resources, using cucumbers, Cucumis sativus, as our model system. Results from experiments conducted over three field seasons demonstrated that, in at least two out of three years, VC amendment significantly increased visit length, while reducing the time to first discovery. Bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) workers that fed on flowers from VC-amended plants had significantly larger and more active ovaries, a measure of nutritional quality. Pollen fractions of flowers from VC-grown plants had higher protein compared to those of plants grown in chemically fertilized potting soil. Nectar sugar content also tended to be higher in flowers from VC-grown plants, but differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, soil quality enhancement, as achieved with VC amendment in this study, can significantly affect plant-pollinator interactions and directly influences pollinator nutrition and overall performance.

It is cross-pollinated and polygamodioecious plant. Polygamodioecious is a condition in which trees have both bisexual and purely male flowers on certain branches of same tree. In G. indica there is no morphological or biochemical difference exists between male and female plants; other than flower characteristics. Distinction between male and female plants can not be done until it flowers i.e., about after 10-12 years. Determination of gender of a seedling at an early stage of development will enable the commercial cultivars to maintain the required ratio of male plants in the orchard for fruit production on large scale. Therefore, it is essential to differentiate the plants at seedling stage by molecular markers. Identified male and female plants collected from Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Agricultural University, Dapoli, Maharashtra. The genomic DNA was extracted from leaves and subjected to PCR amplification using RAPD and ISSR primers. Out of 92 RAPD and 28 ISSR primers screened only two RAPD (OPW-05, OPW-08) polymorphic bands in female plants of G. indica. There was only one ISSR primer (UBC-881) which produced polymorphic band only in male plants. Thus in conclusion, it can be stated that these three DNA markers are completely linked with specific sex in G. indica and can be used for screening of seedlings to determine their gender while plantation. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Apomixis; Endemic plant; Garcinia indica; Polygamodioecious; RAPD and ISSR markers; Sexual dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867380715

To ensure food security, access to locally adapted genetic resources and varieties is an important adaptation measure. Most of the maize grown in Africa is a genetic mix of varieties introduced at different historic times following the birth of the trans-Atlantic economy, and knowledge about geographic structure and local adaptations is limited. Methodology: A panel of 48 accessions of maize representing various introduction routes and sources of historic and recent germplasm introductions in Africa was genotyped with the MaizeSNP50 array. Spatial genetic structure and genetic relationships in the African panel were analysed separately and in the context of a panel of 265 inbred lines representing global breeding material (based on 26,900 SNPs) and a panel of 1127 landraces from the Americas (270 SNPs). Environmental association analysis was used to detect SNPs associated with three climatic variables based on the full 43,963 SNP dataset. Conclusions: The genetic structure is consistent between subsets of the data and the markers are well suited for resolving relationships and admixture among the accessions. The African accessions are structured in three clusters reflecting historical and current patterns of gene flow from the New World and within Africa. The Sahelian cluster reflects original introductions of Meso-American landraces via Europe and a modern introduction of temperate breeding material. The Western cluster reflects introduction of Coastal Brazilian landraces, as well as a Northeast-West spread of maize through Arabic trade routes across the continent. The Eastern cluster most strongly reflects gene flow from modern introduced tropical varieties. Controlling for population history in a linear model, we identify 79 SNPs associated with maximum temperature during the growing season. The associations located in genes of known importance for abiotic stress tolerance are interesting candidates for local adaptations. © 2012 Westengen et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867598682

Apiculturists outside the native range of the honey bee, in the Americas, Australia and eastern Asia, have used only a few of the 27 described subspecies of honey bees (Apis mellifera) for beekeeping purposes. Within the endemic ranges of a particular subspecies, hybridisation can threaten native subspecies when local beekeepers import and propagate non-native honey bees. For many threatened species, cryopreserved germplasm can provide aresource for the preservation ofdiversity and recovery of endangered populations. However, although instrumental insemination ofqueen honey beesiswell established, the absence of aneffective means to cryopreserve honey bee semen has limited the success of efforts to preserve genetic diversity within the species or to develop repositories of honey bee germplasm for breeding purposes. Herein we report that some queens inseminated with cryopreserved semen were capable of producing a substantial number of fertilised offspring. These diploid female larvae were usedtoproduce two additional sequential generations ofnew queens, which were then back-crossed to the same stock of frozen semen. Our results demonstrate the ability to produce queens using cryopreserved honey bee spermatozoa and the potential for the establishment of a honey bee genetic repository. © CSIRO 2012.",Conservation; Instrumental insemination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867310143

As intensive farming practices require similarly intensive manual pollination, this study sought answer the following questions: (a) is there a difference in the efficiency of fruit production when one or more stigmas are pollinated manually, by natural pollinators (or both)? and (b) does manual or natural pollination (or both) affect the physical and chemical characteristics of the fruits?Flowers were pollinated manually, naturally by native bees or by using both methods. Fruit production was evaluated seven days after anthesis, as well as some selected physico-chemical characteristics of harvested fruits. It was demonstrated that the pollination of yellow passion fruit is satisfactory only with visitation by native bees, especially carpenter bees. There is no difference in fruit production efficiency when one or more stigmas are pollinated manually and then left free for visits by natural pollinators. Manual pollination in one stigma produced less seeds and lower biomass of fruit juice of yellow passion fruits. When there is the presence of natural pollinators (notably carpenter bees), manual services can be reduced but not completely dismissed. Therefore, yellow passion fruit farmers can potentially reduce production costs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Carpenter bees; Cross-pollination; Mass flowering plant; Self-incompatible plant; Tropical fruit; Wild pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865984354

The RILs were evaluated for seed color under three conditions: field plot, greenhouse, and controlled growth chambers. Variation for seed color in the RILs ranged from yellow, like yellow sarson, to dark brown/black even though neither parent had shown brown/black colored seeds. One major QTL (SCA9-2) and one minor QTL (SCA9-1) on linkage group (LG) A9 and two minor QTL (SCA3-1, SCA5-1) on LG A3 and LG A5, respectively, were detected. These collectively explained about 67% of the total phenotypic variance. SCA9-2 mapped in the middle of LG A9, explained about 55% phenotypic variance, and consistently expressed in all environments. The second QTL on LG A9 was ?70 cM away from SCA9-2, suggesting that independent assortment of these QTLs is possible. A digenic epistatic interaction was found between the two main effect QTL on LG A9; and the epistasis × environment interaction was nonsignificant, suggesting stability of the interaction across the environments. The QTL effect on LG A9 was validated using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from the two QTL regions of this LG on a B 1S1 population (F1 backcrossed to Sampad followed by self-pollination) segregating for brown and yellow seed color, and on their self-pollinated progenies (B1S2). The SSR markers from the QTL region SCA9-2 showed a stronger linkage association with seed color as compared with the marker from SCA9-1. This suggests that the QTL SCA9-2 is the major determinant of seed color in the A genome of B. rapa. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press.",Brassica rapa; Linkage map; QTL mapping; Seed color; Yellow sarson,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870883560

However, before causes for declines can be assessed, it is essential that the geographical and chronological patterns of decline be discovered. Hitherto a lack of assessment of historical data has hindered our efforts to determine which species are most at risk. Here, the status of 21 North American bumble bee species (Hymenoptera: Apidae) occurring in the eastern nearctic biogeographic region is assessed using a specimen-level database from compiled museum and survey records dating back to the late nineteenth century from various institutional collections. Using a combination of measures, bumble bee declines were assessed over their entire native ranges. We report here that half of the selected fauna is in varying levels of decline (especially Bombus ashtoni, B. fervidus, and B. variabilis), with the remaining species exhibiting stable or increasing trends (e. g., B. bimaculatus, B. impatiens, and B. rufocinctus).

Here we report development of a genetic linkage map of Lens using 114 F2 plants derived from the intersubspecific cross between L 830 and ILWL 77. RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) primers revealed more polymorphism than ISSR (intersimple sequence repeat) and SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers. The highest proportion (30. 72%) of segregation distortion was observed in RAPD markers. Of the 235 markers (34 SSR, 9 ISSR and 192 RAPD) used in the mapping study, 199 (28 SSRs, 9 ISSRs and 162 RAPDs) were mapped into 11 linkage groups (LGs), varying between 17. 3 and 433. 8 cM and covering 3843. 4 cM, with an average marker spacing of 19. 3 cM.

Global changes such as habitat losses, invasions of exotic species and climate change have been suggested as the main causes of the decline of pollinators. In this study, the influence of climate change on the distribution of 10 species of Brazilian bees was estimated with species distribution modelling. We used Maxent algorithm (maximum entropy) and two different scenarios, an optimistic and a pessimistic, to the years 2050 and 2080. We also evaluated the percentage reduction of species habitat based on the future scenarios of climate change through Geographic Information System (GIS). Results showed that the total area of suitable habitats decreased for all species but one under the different future scenarios. The greatest reductions in habitat area were found for Melipona bicolor bicolor and Melipona scutellaris, which occur predominantly in areas related originally to Atlantic Moist Forest. The species analysed have been reported to be pollinators of some regional crops and the consequence of their decrease for these crops needs further clarification. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture; Apidae; Pollinators; Regional crops; Species distribution modelling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864398876

Pierre is a tree from the rainforests of tropical South America and includes two recognised and one informal subspecies. The species has a wide geographic distribution from Central America, northern and western South America to Amazonia and Bolivia, and is morphologically variable. All subspecies occur in the Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke just outside Manaus, Amazonas State in Brazil, and it can be questioned how they can grow in sympatry and retain their identity. We have studied vegetative variation, flower morphology and, to some degree, reproductive barriers. The species is dioecious, has five-merous, cream to greenish flowers that produce pollen, nectar and scent to attract pollinators. The flowering period is between June and October, and the plants set fruits, one seed in each, between November and April. There was no overlap in flowering period in the study area between two of the presumed subspecies, but both have similar floral morphology and are pollinated by the same species of butterflies and bees. We are not able to find any clear distributional or morphological discontinuities between the subspecies and we, therefore, suggest that M. guyanensis should be considered a variable species without formally recognised subspecies. Flowers of M. guyanensis are highly ephemeral and persist only for 1 day (?27h) before falling to the ground. We predict that this is typical for many species of Sapotaceae, which can explain why the corolla is missing from the majority of herbarium specimens that at first sight have flowers. © 2012 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867298896

The main objective of this study was to differentiate these processes in Aconitum kusnezoffii, a plant lacking stigmatic or stylar inhibition of self-pollination. We performed a hand-pollination experiment in a natural population of A. kusnezoffii, compared seed set among five pollination treatments, and evaluated the distribution of seed size and seed set. Embryonic development suggested fertilization following self-pollination. A partial pre-zygotic LSI was suggested to account for the reduced seed set by two lines of evidence. The seed set of chase-pollination treatment significantly exceeded that of self-pollination treatment, and the proportion of unfertilized ovules was the highest following self-pollination. Meanwhile, early-acting ID, rather than post-zygotic LSI, was suggested by the findings that the size of aborted selfed seeds varied continuously and widely; and the selfed seed set both exhibited a continuous distribution and positively correlated with the crossed seed set. These results indicated that the embryos were aborted at different stages due to the expression of many deleterious alleles throughout the genome during seed maturation. No signature of post-zygotic LSI was found. Both partial pre-zygotic LSI and early-acting ID contribute to the reduction in selfed seed set in A. kusnezoffii, with pre-zygotic LSI rejecting part of the self-pollen and early-acting ID aborting part of the self-fertilized seeds. © 2012 Hao et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867320526

Phylogenetic studies suggest that Erythrina dominguezii belongs to a basal clade characterised as pollinated by both passerines and hummingbirds. Here, we characterise the pollination system of E. dominguezii. Floral morphology, nectar traits, breeding system, visitation rates and pollen deposition by its floral visitors were studied. Floral morphology of E. dominguezii showed traits associated with both passerine and hummingbird pollination. Nectar sugar concentration showed an intermediate value but closer to the hummingbird type; however, it was rich in hexose, which is typical of the passerine type. Approximately 5% of the flowers set fruits under free pollination. Almost 80% of recorded flowers were visited by birds, with the rest visited by hymenopterans (bumblebees and honeybees). Among avian pollinators, five species of hummingbirds and three passerine species were identified as pollinators. The hummingbird Chlorostilbon lucidus was the most efficient visitor in terms of pollen deposition and was second in frequency of visits. The passerine Icterus cayanensis was second in efficiency at depositing pollen and was the most frequent pollinator. Our results show that E. dominguezii has a generalised pollination system. In addition, we report a new case of closed flowers and secondary nectar presentation.

As switchgrass is a naturally outcrossing species, accurate identification of selfed progeny is important to producing inbreds, which can be used in the production of heterotic hybrids. Development of a technically reliable, time-saving and easily used marker system is needed to quantify and characterize breeding origin of progeny plants of targeted parents.Results: Genome-wide screening of 915 mapped microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) markers was conducted, and 842 (92.0%) produced clear and scorable bands on a pooled DNA sample of eight switchgrass varieties. A total of 166 primer pairs were selected on the basis of their relatively even distribution in switchgrass genome and PCR amplification quality on 16 tetraploid genotypes. Mean polymorphic information content value for the 166 markers was 0.810 ranging from 0.116 to 0.959. From them, a core set of 48 loci, which had been mapped on 17 linkage groups, was further tested and optimized to develop 24 sets of duplex markers. Most of (up to 87.5%) targeted, but non-allelic amplicons within each duplex were separated by more than 10-bp. Using the established duplex PCR protocol, selfing ratio (i.e., selfed/all progeny x100%) was identified as 0% for a randomly selected open-pollinated 'Kanlow' genotype grown in the field, 15.4% for 22 field-grown plants of bagged inflorescences, and 77.3% for a selected plant grown in a growth chamber.Conclusions: The study developed a duplex SSR-based PCR protocol consisting of 48 markers, providing ample choices of non-tightly-linked loci in switchgrass whole genome, and representing a powerful, time-saving and easily used method for the identification of selfed progeny in switchgrass. The protocol should be a valuable tool in switchgrass breeding efforts. © 2012 Liu and Wu; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Duplex PCR; Polymorphic information content; Selfing ratio; SSR marker; Switchgrass,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866871343

In this study we combined morphological analysis with 454 pyrosequencing to study transcript level changes occurring in young cucumber fruit at five ages from anthesis through the end of exponential growth.Results: The fruit samples produced 1.13 million ESTs which were assembled into 27,859 contigs with a mean length of 834 base pairs and a mean of 67 reads per contig. All contigs were mapped to the cucumber genome. Principal component analysis separated the fruit ages into three groups corresponding with cell division/pre-exponential growth (0 and 4 days post pollination (dpp)), peak exponential expansion (8dpp), and late/post-exponential expansion stages of growth (12 and 16 dpp). Transcripts predominantly expressed at 0 and 4 dpp included homologs of histones, cyclins, and plastid and photosynthesis related genes. The group of genes with peak transcript levels at 8dpp included cytoskeleton, cell wall, lipid metabolism and phloem related proteins. This group was also dominated by genes with unknown function or without known homologs outside of cucurbits. A second shift in transcript profile was observed at 12-16dpp, which was characterized by abiotic and biotic stress related genes and significant enrichment for transcription factor gene homologs, including many associated with stress response and development.Conclusions: The transcriptome data coupled with morphological analyses provide an informative picture of early fruit development. Progressive waves of transcript abundance were associated with cell division, development of photosynthetic capacity, cell expansion and fruit growth, phloem activity, protection of the fruit surface, and finally transition away from fruit growth toward a stage of enhanced stress responses. These results suggest that the interval between expansive growth and ripening includes further developmental differentiation with an emphasis on defense. The increased transcript levels of cucurbit-specific genes during the exponential growth stage may indicate unique factors contributing to rapid growth in cucurbits. © 2012 Ando et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Cucumis sativus; Exponential fruit growth; Fruit maturation; Fruit set; Fruit surface; Gene expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866792774

However, few delayed selfing mechanisms have been documented. This research aims to explore a new delayed selfing mechanism induced by stigmatic fluid in Roscoea debilis, a small perennial ginger. MethodsFloral biology and flower visitors were surveyed. The capacity of autonomous selfing was evaluated by pollinator exclusion. The timing of autonomous selng was estimated by emasculation at different flowering stages. The number of seeds produced from insect-pollination was assessed by emasculation and exposure to pollinators in the natural population. The breeding system was also tested by pollination manipulations. Key ResultsAutonomous self-pollination occurred after flowers wilted. The stigmatic fluid formed a globule on the stigma on the third day of flowering. The enlarged globule seeped into the nearby pollen grains on the fourth flowering day, thus inducing pollen germination. Pollen tubes then elongated and penetrated the stigma. Hand-selfed flowers produced as many seeds as hand-crossed flowers. There was no significant difference in seed production between pollinator-excluded flowers and hand-selfed flowers. When emasculated flowers were exposed to pollinators, they produced significantly fewer seeds than intact flowers. Visits by effective pollinators were rare. ConclusionsThis study describes a new form of delayed autonomous self-pollination. As the predominant mechanism of sexual reproduction in R. debilis, delayed self-pollination ensures reproduction when pollinators are scarce. © 2012 The Author.",autonomous selfing; ginger; pollinator failure; reproductive assurance; Roecoea debilis; stigmatic fluid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866664282

In the present study I monitored greater butterfly-orchids (Platanthera chlorantha), by using a event triggered video monitoring system. A total of 23 nights of monitoring were conducted, whereas only 6 nights had visits by one moth species, namely the pine hawk-moth (Hyloicus pinastri). The total numbers of pine hawk-moths registered were 18. In addition to species identification, the video recordings also enabled detection of pollinaria on the pine hawk-moths. Most of the pine hawk-moth visits took place around midnight. The visit lasted on average for 38.0 sec and the average number of flowers visited was 9.6.

Rhizophora mangle exhibited ambophilous pollination, a fruit set of 7.2%, and a highly effective pollinator, the hoverfly Copestylum sp. 1. Laguncularia racemosa had three highly effective pollinators, a fruit set of 7.9%, and the most specialized pollination system among the three species. Avicennia germinans showed the least specialized pollination, with four highly effective pollinators. This species showed the highest recruitment potential, with a fruit set of 29%. Although R. mangle is considered to be predominantly wind pollinated, our results indicate that the role of insect pollination has been underestimated. Likewise, our findings show that A. germinans has effective pollinators and vectors in several taxonomic groups. On small islands, where low insect diversity is expected, the level of pollination generalization found in R. mangle and A. germinans is higher than previously suggested.

Suburban sprawl is one of the fastest growing types of land use change in North America, and it has certain characteristics, such as abundant floral resources, that may be beneficial for many pollinators. We examined the effects of sprawl on the wild bee assemblage of the shortgrass steppe on the Front Range of Colorado, USA. Diversity, abundance, and community composition of bees in remnant grassland fragments surrounded by suburban residential land use were compared with those in extensive, continuous grassland. No overall effect of suburbanization on bee abundance was observed, and abundance was extremely variable even within study sites. Bee species richness was positively but nonlinearly related to grassland habitat area. Bee species density was higher and more variable in suburban sites. Suburban sites and smaller habitat area were both related to relative increases in the proportions of small bee species, social bees, and solitary cavity-nesting bees in the assemblage; small suburban habitat areas also favored species of the family Halictidae over Apidae, and individuals of the genus Halictus over those of the genus Lasioglossum. In this landscape, large native habitat areas surrounded by suburban sprawl may actually increase species richness and species density over that of continuous grassland, probably by means of habitat complementation or supplementation between grassland remnants and the surrounding suburban matrix. However, at habitat areas <20 ha, species richness became quite variable; sites <8 ha contained less than half the species of controls. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Ecosystem service; Fragmentation; Front Range, Colorado, USA; Matrix habitat; Pollinators; Shortgrass steppe; Species abundance; Species richness; Species-area relationships; Suburban sprawl; Wild bee assemblage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868586578

In some species pollination by rain splashes, a condition known as ombrophily, has been proposed as a floral strategy. However, evidence for this type of abiotic pollination has remained controversial and many reported cases have subsequently been shown to be false. This study investigates ombrophily in the deceptive orchid Acampe rigida to determine the mechanism by which this species is able to maintain high fecundity, despite flowering during the rainy season in south-west China when pollinators are scarce. MethodsThe floral mechanisms promoting rain pollination in A. rigida were observed and described in detail. Controlled pollination experiments and observations of floral visitors were conducted. A field experiment using rain shelters at 14 sites in Guangxi, south-west China, evaluated the contribution of rain pollination to fruit-set. Key ResultsDuring rainfall, raindrops physically flicked away the anther cap exposing the pollinarium. Raindrops then caused pollinia to be ejected upwards with the strap-like stipe pulling them back and causing them to fall into the stigmatic cavity, resulting in self-pollination. Neither flower nor pollen function were damaged by water. Although A. rigida is self-compatible, it is incapable of autonomous self-pollination without the assistance of rain splashes. The results of the rain-sheltering experiment indicated that rain pollination contributed substantially to increasing fruit-set, although there was variation among sites in the intensity of this effect. ConclusionsA. rigida flowers during the rainy season, when pollinators are scarce, and ombrophily functions to provide reproductive assurance without compromising opportunities for outcrossing. © 2012 The Author.",Abiotic pollination; Acampe rigida; deceptive orchid; floral adaptation; ombrophily; rain-mediated self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866708566

The effects of airflow acting position on the distribution of the pollen were evaluated from three aspects of the distribution density, horizontal distribution, and the vertical distribution of pollen. The results showed that the effects of airflow position on the amount of pollen, horizontal distribution, and vertical distribution were significantly different. When airflow center action in the midst position of tassel (under tassel top 100/200 mm), pollen diffusion quantity was more, the horizontal and vertical distribution quantity of pollen were significantly increased, which benefit the distribution of pollen along airflow direction.

However, pollinating species can exhibit substantial intraspecific variation, particularly between genders, in key morphological and behavioural traits determining their interactions with flowers. This potential mechanism of floral diversification remains largely unexplored. The bee fly, Megapalpus capensis, is the predominant pollinator of the remarkable array of floral forms of the sexually deceptive daisy Gorteria diffusa. Flies exhibit strong gender-specific interactions with the variable insect-like spots which characterize G. diffusa inflorescences. In order to explore variation in the preferences of male and female pollinators for the visual, tactile and olfactory components of these spots, and its implications for floral diversification, we used a sequence of binary choice tests where we manipulated individual spot components. Male and female flies exhibited contrasting preferences for spot components with females preferring simplistic spots and avoiding UV highlights, whilst males prefer any additional visual and tactile phenotypic complexity. Floral odour alone elicited significant preference in females only, indicating that, in contrast to orchids, sexual deception in G. diffusa is achieved largely through visual mimicry of female pollinators. Our results clearly show that elaboration of the insect-like spots has evolved in response to male preferences and suggest that a trade-off exists between the attraction of male and female flies, which may have contributed to the divergence in floral phenotype between morphotypes of G. diffusa Pollinators exhibit gender differences in floral preferences and behaviour which is another potential source of divergent selection contributing to angiosperm floral diversification. © 2012 The Authors.

Fig trees (Moraceae: Ficus) are keystone species, whose ecosystem function relies on an obligate mutualism with wasps (Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae) that enter fig syconia to pollinate. Each female flower produces one seed (fig female reproductive function), unless it also receives a wasp egg, in which case it supports a wasp. Fig male reproductive function requires both male flowers and pollinator offspring, which are the only vectors of fig pollen. 2. The mutualism is exploited by other wasps that lay eggs but provide no pollination service. Most of these non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs) do not enter syconia, but lay eggs through the wall with long ovipositors. Some are gall-makers, while others are parasitoids or lethal inquilines of other wasps. 3. Ficus is pan-tropical and contains >750 fig species. However, NPFW communities vary across fig lineages and continents and their effects on the mutualism may also vary. This provides a series of natural experiments to investigate how the costs to a keystone mutualism vary geographically. 4. We made the first detailed study of the costs of NPFWs in a fig (Ficus obliqua G. Forst) from the endemic Australasian section Malvanthera. In contrast to the communities associated with section Americana in the New World, wasps from the subfamily Sycoryctinae (Chalcidoidea: Pteromalidae) dominated this community. 5. These sycoryctine wasps have a negative impact on pollinator offspring numbers, but not on seed production. Consequently, while the NPFW fauna varies greatly at high taxonomic levels across continents, we show that the consistent main effect of locally dominant exploiters of the mutualism is to reduce fig male reproductive function. © 2012 The Authors Ecological Entomology © 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.",Conflict; Costs; Ficus; Mutualism; Pollination; Stability; Wasps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866168056

In vitro pollination with dry pollen grains appeared to be more efficient and this method was applied in three subsequent years. Additionally, pollination was performed with selected pollen grains in order to obtain triploid plants. Diploid pollen was induced by heat-treatment of pollen mother cells, but the enrichment of unreduced pollen from natural pollen mixtures was also successful. The selection of diploid pollen, which is larger in diameter than haploid pollen, was performed by sieving using micro sieves. Five triploid plants from different poplar combinations were obtained from 1,227 zygotic embryos cultured after in vitro pollination of 2,676 ovaries with dry pollen over 3 years.

Knowledge on genetic variation of the leading-edge populations provides critical information to understand responses and adaptation of plants to projected climate warming. To date, the research into genetic variation of leading-edge populations has been limited, particularly in the role of wind-mediated pollen flow in maintaining high genetic variation. Castanopsis sclerophylla (Fagaceae) is a wind-pollinated and gravity-dispersed tree. In the present study, we used seven polymorphic microsatellites to genotype 482 samples from five leading-edge and 12 non-edge populations. Significant effects of recent population bottleneck events were found in three of the five leading-edge populations, indicating that the leading-edge populations might have been recolonized after the Last Glacial Maximum. Genetic diversity was higher, though not significantly, in leading-edge than in non-edge populations. Relationship between genetic diversity and latitude indicated an increasing trend of genetic diversity towards leading-edge populations. No significant difference in genetic differentiation was found between leading-edge and non-edge populations. The inconsistence with the general predictions by leading-edge colonization model could be explained by high gene flow via pollen grains. Pollen-mediated gene flow could maintain high genetic diversity within and low differentiation among leading-edge populations. In response to climate warming, high genetic variation may provide leading-edge populations raw materials for evolutionary adaptation to future environmental conditions. © 2012 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.",Bottleneck; Castanopsis sclerophylla; Gene flow; Genetic variation; Wind-direction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866738932

The aims of the study were to estimate: (1) how relative resource abundance influences flower selectivity; (2) the degree of phenotypic matching; and (3) whether different plant resource assessment methods give different answers to this question. The results showed that, although sunbirds frequently feed on both morphologically adapted and nonadapted plants, food selectivity data are consistent with the hypothesis of phenotypic complementarity. Moreover, we found that the type of plant abundance measurement can change conclusions in some cases, as individual plants differ in their growth habits and nectar production. This effect was most obvious for the assessment of selectivity of the northern double-collared sunbird (Cinnyris reichenowi) and for Hypoestes aristata, a plant producing inflorescences composed of a large number of small flowers possessing small amounts of nectar per flower (a high abundance of flowers, but a low abundance of nectar relative to the remaining plant community). © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Cameroon; Diet composition; Food selectivity; Pollination; Specialization; Sunbird,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866328860

Natural hybridization between Fragaria species has repeatedly been reported, and the potential future cultivation of genetically modified strawberries has made the study of hybridization potential between F× ananassa and its wild relatives increasingly important. In Europe, F× ananassa is the only octoploid species present, and the most likely candidate for hybridization is the common diploid woodland strawberry (F. vesca). To date, it is unknown whether pollinator spectra of the two Fragaria species overlap and thus might promote interspecific gene flow. We carried out a survey of flower visitors in northwestern Switzerland to identify major flower visitors of F. vesca and F× ananassa. This survey indicated that wild bees are the most important shared flower visitors of F× ananassa and F. vesca. Therefore, we studied flower choice behavior of the common wild bee Osmia bicornis in a greenhouse experiment. Osmia bicornis did not discriminate between F× ananassa and F. vesca flowers. We conclude that wild bees are important shared flower visitors of both F× ananassa and F. vesca and are potential vectors for gene flow between cultivated and wild strawberries. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Flower choice; Fragaria vesca; Fragaria×ananassa; Genetically modified plants; Hybridization; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868698662

(Boraginaceae). Corolla tube length in the genus is quite variable, ranging from 1mm to 75mm, and the length of the corolla tube has implications for pollination biology, such as longer corolla tubes (>25mm in length) being pollinated by hummingbirds or moths. In general, the various methods resolve similar ancestral character states; however, different states are reconstructed at nodes in which the descendants greatly differ in corolla tube length. Additionally, it is suggested that all of the variation of a continuous character should be included in analyses, and this may necessitate multiple analyses with different partitions of the data. The various analyses provide evidence that two maximum parsimony methods, linear parsimony and the TNT method, minimize the number of different rates of evolution. In Lithospermum, six origins of corolla tubes >20mm in length are resolved, and these origins occurred at two different times periods: (1) in the shadow of hummingbird diversification in North America (approximately 6-8Mya) and (2) more recently (approximately 1-1.5MyA). Four substantial decreases in corolla tube length also are reconstructed, and these may be associated with the origin of self-pollination. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Ancestral character state reconstruction; Evolution; Molecular dating; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866315878

However, the implications of such movements in terms of pollination are not well understood. Recently, complex patterns of stamen movements have been identified in Loasaceae, Parnassiaceae, Rutaceae and Tropaeolaceae. In this study the stamen movements in Ruta graveolens (Rutaceae) and their impact on pollination are determined. MethodsPollination effects of stamen movements were studied in Ruta graveolens, in which one-by-one uplifting and falling back is followed by simultaneous movement of all stamens in some flowers. Using 30 flowers, one stamen was manipulated either to be immobilized or to be allowed to move freely towards the centre of the flower but be prevented from falling back. Pollen loads on stigmas and ovule fertilization in flowers with or without simultaneous stamen movement were determined. ResultsPollen removal decreased dramatically (P < 0·001) when the stamen was stopped from uplifting because its anther was seldom contacted by pollinators. When a stamen stayed at the flower's centre, pollen removal of the next freely moved anther decreased significantly (P < 0·005) because of fewer touches by pollinators and quick leaving of pollinators that were discouraged by the empty anther. Simultaneous stamen movement occurred only in flowers with low pollen load on the stigma and the remaining pollen in anthers dropped onto stigma surfaces after stamens moved to the flower's centre. ConclusionsIn R. graveolens pollen removal is promoted through one-by-one movement of the stamen, which presents pollen in doses to pollinators by successive uplifting of the stamen and avoids interference of two consecutively dehisced anthers by falling back of the former stamen before the next one moves into the flower's centre. Simultaneous stamen movement at the end of anthesis probably reflects an adaptation for late-acting self-pollination. © 2012 The Author.",Dichogamy; experimental manipulation; pollen presentation; pollen removal; pollination; reproductive assurance; Ruta graveolens; stamen movement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866660724

In modern agriculture health problems affecting honey bee populations have resulted in an increased exploitation of alternative pollinators such as bumblebees. When Bt products are used, either as sprays or transgenic crops, non-target organisms such as pollinators may be exposed to the Cry proteins via contact or through ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar. The cultivation of transgenic crops, e.g. maize, raises concerns among different social groups. Even in scientific bee journals there have appeared articles saying that bees might avoid collecting pollen and/or nectar from such plants. Therefore, the aim of our research was to assess the potential negative influence of the genetically modified maize MON810 expressing Cry1Ab - a protein toxic to the most serious lepidopteran pest, the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) [Hübner] (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) - on the behavior of the honey bee in conditions of the limited possible choice of a host plant. The insect material was one honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) family in a hive, which included a queen and approximately 800 worker bees. The honey bees were from the Apiculture Division, Faculty of Animal Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences. The plant material consisted of transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) plants DKC3421 Yield Gard (event MON810) from the Monsanto Company (St. Louis, MO, USA), expressing a gene encoding a truncated form of the CrylAb protein derived from B. thuringiensis Berliner, and the corresponding near-isogenic hybrid (DKC 3420).

The frequent occurrence of these same noxious compounds in floral nectar, which functions primarily to attract pollinators, has been seen as paradoxical. Although these compounds may have an adaptive purpose in nectar, they may also occur as a nonadaptive consequence of chemical defence in other plant parts. If nectar chemistry reflects physiological constraints or passive leakage from other tissues, we expect that the identity and relative concentration of nectar cardenolides to be correlated with those of other plant parts; in contrast, discordant distributions of compounds in nectar and other tissues may suggest adaptive roles in nectar. We compared the concentrations and identities of cardenolides in the nectar, leaves and flowers of 12 species from a monophyletic clade of Asclepias. To measure putative toxicity of nectar cardenolides, we then examined the effects of a standard cardenolide (digoxin) on the behaviour of bumblebees, a common generalist pollinator of Asclepias. We found that the average cardenolide concentrations in nectar, leaves and flowers of the 12 Asclepias species were positively correlated as predicted by nonadaptive hypotheses. However, significant differences in the identities and concentrations of individual cardenolides between nectar and leaves suggest that the production or allocation of cardenolides may be independently regulated at each plant part. In addition, cardenolide concentrations in leaves and nectar exhibited no phylogenetic signal. Surprisingly, bumblebees did not demonstrate an aversion to digoxin-rich nectar, which may indicate that nectar cardenolides have little effect on pollination. Although the idea that discordant patterns of secondary metabolites across tissue types may signal adaptive functions is attractive, there is evidence to suggest constraint contributes to nectar secondary chemistry. Further work testing the ecological impacts of such patterns will be critical in determining the functional significance of nectar cardenolides. © 2012 The Authors.

As the use of Bt corn hybrids continues to increase in the United States, and new insect resistance management (IRM) plans are implemented, it is necessary to measure the efficacy of these IRM plans. In Minnesota, the primary lepidopteran pests of corn include the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hbner) and corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). The primary IRM plan in transgenic corn is the use of hybrids expressing a high dose of insecticidal proteins and an insect refuge containing hybrids not expressing insecticidal proteins that produce susceptible insects. Wind-assisted pollen movement in corn occurs readily, and is the primary method of pollination for corn. The combination of pollen movement and viability determines the potential for cross pollination of refuge corn. In 2009 and 2010, cross pollination occurred with the highest frequency on the north and east sides of Bt corn fields, but was found at some level in all directions. Highest levels of cross pollination (75%) were found within the first four rows (3 m) of non-Bt corn adjacent to Bt corn, and in general decreasing levels of cross pollination were found the further the non-Bt corn was planted from the Bt corn. A mosaic of Bt cross-pollinated kernels was found throughout the ear, but in both years the ear tip had the highest percentage of cross-pollinated kernels; this pattern may be linked to the synchrony of pollen shed and silking between Bt and non-Bt corn hybrids. The dominant wind direction in both years was from WNW. However, in both years, there were also prevailing winds from SSW and WSW. Further studies are needed to quantify Bt levels in cross-pollinated kernels, measure the Bt dose of such kernels and associated lepidopteran pest survival, and measure the impact of Bt pollen on lepidopteran pests, particularly when considering the seed mixture refuge configuration. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.",Bacillus thuringiensis; Helicoverpa zea; Ostrinia nubilalis; Refuge,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868094770

Food-deceptive species sire a progeny of F 1 unfertile plants, which work as a late post-zygotic barrier. Conversely, when pre-zygotic barriers of sexually deceptive (Ophrys) species are absent, the hybrids are fertile and an extensive introgression may occur. Here, we have performed molecular analysis and hand pollination treatments to characterize a hybrid zone of two food-deceptive species, O. mascula and O pauciflora. Hybrids (called O.×colemanii) have shown different amounts of parental nrDNA, strongly supporting that they are F 2 and/or successive hybrid generations. Comparable high levels of reproductive success have been detected in natural conditions and in experimental crosses suggesting the absence of effective reproductive barriers either between hybrids, either between hybrids and parental species. In light of ecological and distributional features of O.×colemanii across its distribution range, we hypothesize that these populations have originated by secondary contact in the periglacial belt of Apennines. Moreover, the rare and localized O. pauciflora could benefit a genetic enrichment by hybridizing with a widespread related species. O.×colemanii is not a dead end population, but may have a role as potential reserve of adaptive variability and is an unusual stage along the speciation process. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Food-deceptive orchids; Homoploid hybrid speciation; Hybrid zones; Reproductive barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868674066

Yet few studies have investigated how different intensities of livestock grazing impact one important provider of these ecosystem services-native bees. We conducted the first large-scale manipulative study on the effect of a gradient of livestock grazing intensities on native bees in 16 40-ha pastures in the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie. Each pasture was exposed to one of four cattle stocking rates for two years and grazing intensity was quantified by measuring utilization. We measured soil and vegetation characteristics related to floral and nesting resources as well as several metrics of the bee community. Increased grazing intensity significantly reduced vegetation structure, soil stability, and herbaceous litter and significantly increased soil compaction and bare ground. Native bees responded with changes in abundance, richness, diversity, and community composition. Responses varied with taxa and time of season. Bumble bees were sensitive to grazing intensity early in the season, showing reduced abundance, diversity, and/or richness with increased intensity, potentially because of altered foraging behavior. In contrast, sweat bees appeared unaffected by grazing. These results show that native bee taxa vary in their sensitivity to livestock grazing practices and suggest that grazing may potentially be a useful tool for managing pollination services in mosaic agroecosystems that include rangelands. © 2012 Kimoto et al.",Bumble bees; Floral resources; Grazing intensity; Livestock grazing; Native bees; Nesting resources; Pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie; Pollinators; Soil characteristics; Sweat bees; Vegetation characteristics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901004756

We find strong support for a large Old World clade that contains eight of the eleven genera, in the tribes Sycoryctini and Philotrypesini. The sister taxon is tribe Apocryptini, comprising the genera Apocrypta and Bouceka. Finally, a new tribe, Critogastrini, is raised for the genus Critogaster, sister to all other sycoryctines. At the genus level, we found a general pattern of strong host conservatism, in which closely related wasps associate with closely related figs. Despite this, there is also evidence for multiple host shifts between more distantly related figs in some wasp genera (especially Philotrypesis). We estimate Sycoryctinae to have originated 49-64. Ma, after the initial co-radiation of the host figs and pollinators. Further, conservative assumptions in our analyses probably overestimate the age of the sycoryctines. Together, patterns of host association, evidence for a mix of host constraints and host shifting, and molecular dating suggest that sycoryctine parasites radiated through delayed phylogenetic tracking of their hosts. This contributes to the growing body of literature suggesting that coevolving parasites often radiate after their hosts. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Biogeography; Chalcidoidea; Ficus; Host shift; Parasitoid; Wasp,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864533419

In Arabidopsis, the pollen grain lands on a dry stigma, where it hydrates, germinates and grows a pollen tube that delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte to effect double fertilization. Various studies have emphasized that a mature, dehydrated pollen grain contains all the transcripts and proteins required for germination and initial pollen tube growth. Therefore, it is important to explore the role of post-translational modifications (here phosphorylation), through which many processes induced by pollination are probably controlled. We report here a phosphoproteomic study conducted on mature Arabidopsis pollen grains with the aim of identifying potential targets of phosphorylation. Using three enrichment chromatographies, a broad coverage of pollen phosphoproteins with 962 phosphorylated peptides corresponding to 598 phosphoproteins was obtained. Additionally, 609 confirmed phosphorylation sites were successfully mapped. Two hundred and seven of 240 phosphoproteins that were absent from the PhosPhAt database containing the empirical Arabidopsis phosphoproteome showed highly enriched expression in pollen. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these 240 phosphoproteins shows an over-representation of GO categories crucial for pollen tube growth, suggesting that phosphorylation regulates later processes of pollen development. Moreover, motif analyses of pollen phosphopeptides showed an over-representation of motifs specific for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and binding motifs for 14-3-3 proteins. Lastly, one tyrosine phosphorylation site was identified, validating the TDY dual phosphorylation motif of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPK8/MPK15). This study provides a solid basis to further explore the role of phosphorylation during pollen development. © 2012 The Authors.

These flies represent important pollinators of the South African flora and feature adaptations to particularly long-tubed flowers. The present study examined the morphology of the extremely long and slender mouthparts of Nemestrinidae for the first time. The heavily sclerotized tubular proboscis of flies from the genus Prosoeca is highly variable in length. It measures 20-47mm in length and may exceed double the body length in some individuals. Proximally, the proboscis consists of the labrum-epipharynx unit, the laciniae, the hypopharynx, and the labium. The distal half is composed of the prementum of the labium, which solely forms the food tube. In adaptation to long-tubed and narrow flowers, the prementum is extremely elongated, bearing the short apical labella that appear only to be able to spread apart slightly during nectar uptake. Moving the proboscis from resting position under the body to a vertical feeding position is accomplished in particular by the movements of the laciniae, which function as a lever arm. Comparisons with the mouthparts of other flower visiting flies provide insights into adaptations to nectar-feeding from long-tubed flowers. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Co-evolution; Diptera; Flower-visiting; Functional morphology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866320009

However, genebanks and breeding collections have poor representation from Saharan germplasm and, particularly, from Algeria. This is a preliminary approach to investigate the adaptation and agronomic performance of a representative sample of Saharan maize. We evaluated open-pollinated Saharan populations along with European and American cultivars during 2 years in humid and dry Spanish locations and in Algiers (Algeria). Saharan populations were able to grow in temperate environments, although results were not consistent over years and the genotype-by- environment interactions were very important. Some of the Algerian populations evaluated in 2010 showed promising yield and anthesis silking interval over environments, but none of the Algerian populations evaluated in 2009 were adequately adapted to Spanish conditions. These results suggest that there are wide ranges of variability within Saharan maize for adaptation to temperate conditions, and further evaluations of Saharan maize should identify potential base populations for breeding maize in either side of the Mediterranean Sea. However, this germplasm requires prebreeding for adaptation to temperate conditions in order to be adequate for breeding programs in temperate areas. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adaptation; Germplasm; Stress; Zea mays L,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866440364

However, studies combining long-term demographic data with population level analyses of site conditions, genetic variation, and reproduction as well as with climatic data are still rare. Here we studied the endangered orchid Anacamptis morio, representative for species with a sub-mediterranean distribution. For populations at the northern range edge, we combined long-term monitoring data (1977-2010) with climatic data and analyzed reproductive fitness components, genetic variation, and abiotic site conditions. Reproduction was generally low as expected from the deceptive pollination system, and was positively influenced by population size and xerothermic site quality. The majority of populations showed a positive population trend, which was paralleled by an increase in spring temperature and positively affected by site quality. High levels of genetic variation were found in the populations which were at gene flow-drift equilibrium. A. morio may profit from increasing spring temperatures because of increased reproductive output. Nevertheless, whether climate change results in fitness increase or not may depend on the maintenance and provision of optimal site quality, i. e., xerothermic and nutrient poor conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Climate change; Fitness; Genetic variation; Reproduction; Site quality; Weather,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870356094

In this present study, the data from the crop-field study was used together with simulation modelling to identify possible genetics of the herbicide resistance that was selected for. This analysis clearly indicated that the herbicide resistance was polygenic. Subsequently, the estimated genetic possibilities were used to parameterise a model of herbicide resistance evolution in a simulated crop-field situation, and the potential of different rates of diclofop-methyl (ACCase herbicide) to cause herbicide-resistance evolution in L. rigidum was explored and compared using the calibrated model. The calibrated model outputs indicated that the evolution of diclofop-methyl resistance would generally be faster at low herbicide rates than at higher rates due to the rapid selection of minor gene herbicide resistance traits at low rates and their subsequent recombination by cross-pollination. The results of the study therefore indicate potential risks in herbicide rate cutting and highlight the need for careful scientific evaluation of any herbicide use rate for its potential to select for minor gene herbicide resistance from a weed population. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Herbicide resistance; Lolium rigidum; Polygenes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863520287

However, predicting the spread of resistance is difficult due to limited information about gene flow. We conducted research to determine the potential for movement of resistance alleles in common lambsquarters under field conditions. Chenopodium giganteum (a member of the C. album aggregate) that has a dominant magenta phenotypic marker was used as a pollen parent in gene flow experiments. A wild-type accession of common lambsquarters was used as a seed parent. Seed parents were grown in a soybean field and arranged in concentric circles 2 to 15 m from a center which contained 24 pollen parents. The concentric circles were divided into eight directions. Pollen movement was estimated by determining the percentage of progeny with the magenta phenotype from seed parents. Average cross-pollination across directions was greatest (3.0) at 2 m and decreased to low levels (0.16) 15 m from the center, consistent with observations of other primarily self-pollinated species. Cross-pollination was greatest (P<0.10) in the south-southwest, west-southwest, and west-northwest directions, approximately 180° from the prevailing wind direction during the time of pollen shed. Since common lambsquarters does not have an active dispersal mechanism for seeds, pollen-mediated gene flow may play an important role in the transfer and frequency of resistance alleles within and between populations.

We aim to determine the evolutionary history of morphological traits that facilitate trap pollination and to elucidate the impact of pollinators on the evolution of inflorescence traps in the family Araceae. • Methods: Inflorescence morphology was investigated to determine the presence of trapping devices and to classify functional types of traps. We inferred phylogenetic relationships in the family using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Character evolution of trapping devices, trap types, and pollinator types was then assessed with maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods. We also tested for an association of trap pollination with specific pollinator types. • Key results: Inflorescence traps have evolved independently at least 10 times within the Araceae. Trapping devices were found in 27 genera. On the basis of different combinations of trapping devices, six functional types of traps were identified. Trap pollination in Araceae is correlated with pollination by flies. • Conclusions: Trap pollination in the Araceae is more common than was previously thought. Preadaptations such as papillate cells or elongated sterile flowers facilitated the evolution of inflorescence traps. In some clades, imperfect traps served as a precursor for the evolution of more elaborate traps. Traps that evolved in association with fly pollination were most probably derived from mutualistic ancestors, offering a brood-site to their pollinators. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Araceae; Character evolution; Deception; Epicuticular wax; Flies; Floral traits; Insect attachment; Morphology; Pollination; Trap,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867619360

We found an increase in seed set on maternal S-morph plants in the presence of L-morph donors and patterns of trait variation that may contribute to enhanced reciprocity with increasing frequency of the S-morph.

Both species show the same pollination syndrome and are pollinated by Lepidoptera. Lantana camara flowers had a higher nectar volume than L. peduncularis flowers at every elevation and higher total sugar content. However, nectar in L. peduncularis flowers was much more concentrated than in L. camara flowers at lower elevations. The differences in nectar production between Lantana species seemed to be intrinsic and related to contrasting strategies to cope with drought. Nectar volume of unbagged flowers of L. camara was lower than that of bagged flowers at sunrise, which was probably related to consumption of nectar by nocturnal Lepidoptera. Nectar removal by floral visitors had a pronounced effect on total amount of nectar secreted by L. camara flowers but sugar concentration did not vary significantly. Our results suggest that L. camara may compete with L. peduncularis for pollinators. © 2012 by University of Hawai'i Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866658592

Marathrum rubrum Novelo & Philbrick and . Marathrum schiedeanum Cham. represent a clear example: are these distinct species or morphological variants determined by the environment? Three populations were analyzed where we carried out intra-population manual cross-pollinations and compared these to heterospecific pollinations and open-pollinations (control) to test for the presence of reproductive barriers between species. Pollen tube development, seed production, seed size, and germination were observed in legitimate and heterospecific crosses. Our results indicate that there are no reproductive barriers between these species, since we did not find differences in abundance and/or distribution of pollen tubes among pollination treatments. Significant differences among populations in the average number of ovules were found. Similarly, seed number differed among pollination treatments. In general, heterospecific crosses produced less seeds than manual cross-pollinations and open-pollinated flowers. Average seed size was larger for heterospecific crosses than manual cross-pollinations and open-pollinations, whereas no differences in seed germination among populations or pollination treatments were detected. The results support the hypothesis that these 'species' constitute morphological variants of the same species. These results are consistent with the proposal that . M. rubrum and .

Seven cocklebur densities (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 plants m-2) in maize planted at four densities (5, 7.5, 10, and 12.5 plants m-2) were evaluated in a split plot experiment. Statistical analysis for both years indicated significant main effects and interactions for leaf area, LAI, plant height and biological yield of maize. The leaf area of maize was decreased with increase in maize density because of the intra-specific competition within the maize plants. Maize leaf area plant-1 at all the maize densities was decreased by the density of cocklebur; however, the magnitude of reduction in leaf area was dependent on maize density; the lower the maize density the higher was the magnitude of reduction in maize leaf area. Similarly, the maize LAI at alternating maize densities was linearly affected by steadily increasing the cocklebur density. Increasing cocklebur density and/or maize density increased maize plant height but at very high densities of either species the average maize plant height was decreased as a result of increased intra as well as interspecific competition period. The statistical analysis also showed that maize biomass declined linearly as weed density increased from 0 to 12 plants m-2, with an increasing rate of decline for high maize densities and low maize densities. Results decide that the effect of common cocklebur interference on maize biomass and other parameters was associated with a change in distribution of resources, resulting in increased crop height at the expense of a reduction in LAI by the crop as weed density increased.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871705395

They are essential components of cellular membranes and cellular signal or hormone molecules. Although TRANSPARENT TESTA2 (TT2) is well studied for its function in regulating proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in the seed coat, little attention has been given to its role in affecting seed FA accumulation and tolerance to environmental stresses. We demonstrate that the tt2 mutation remarkably increased the seed FA content, decreased seed weight, and altered the FA composition. The increase in FA content in the tt2 seeds was due to the relative decrease of seed coat proportion as well as the more efficient FA synthesis in the tt2 embryo. Microarray analysis revealed that tt2 mutation up-regulated a group of genes critical to FA biosynthesis and embryonic development. The mutation also altered the gene expressions that respond to stress. The microarray analysis discovered that the increase in FA accumulation of the tt2 seeds were accompanied by the significant up-regulation of FUSCA3, a transcriptional factor for embryonic development and FATTY ACID ELONGASE1, which catalyzes the elongation of FA chains. Moreover, lower seed protein accumulation during seed maturation also contributed to the increased seed FA accumulation in tt2 mutants. This study advances the understanding of the TT2 gene in seed FA accumulation and abiotic stresses during seed germination and seedling establishment. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Here, we test if later generation hybrids are indeed absent in a larger sample, using morphological and molecular markers. We further test if unidirectional hybridization is due to reproductive barriers. Intermediate plants were all F1 hybrids from P. minor mother plants. Our analyses indicate that hybrids originated from few hybridization events and have been maintained by clonal reproduction since then. Barriers to pollen flow between the species result from a combination of few pollinators, different flower morphology and phenology, high proportions of abnormal pollen in hybrids, and reduced pollen tube growth of heterospecific and hybrid pollen. In general, pollen from P. grandiflora grew better than pollen from P. minor, which may explain the unidirectional hybridization.

We examined whether silica (S), the main antiherbivore defence in grasses (in both fertilized nitrogen-rich (F+) and nitrogen-poor (F-) Festuca rubra host plants) affects larval development and accordingly adult feeding behaviour in the small heath butterfly, Coenonympha pamphilus. High silica levels in nitrogen-poor host plants (F-/S+) negatively affected larval performance, and, as a consequence, female and even male butterflies preferred to consume amino acid-rich nectar. Our findings show for the first time that plant defence in larval host plants affects feeding behaviour in adult butterflies, and that even male butterflies, which have so far been thought to be indifferent to nectar amino acids, preferred to consume amino acid-rich nectar.

The fitness and genetic effects of maize mutant su1 were monitored through five successive selfing generations in two separated mean-generation designs. The first involved two inbreds with similar genetic backgrounds, while unrelated inbreds were used for the second design. Parents, F1s, F2s, and backcrosses were crossed to P39 as the donor of su1 and the 12 crosses were successively self-pollinated for 5 years. The su1 frequency decreased linearly across selfing generations in both designs. Additive effects were significant for su1 seed viability. However, dominance effects were of higher magnitude than additive effects, even though the dominance effects were not significant. Genetic effects depended on genotypes and environments. Therefore, the fitness of su1 is under genetic control, with significant additive effects due to minor contributions of multiple genes.

Regression results for the study area indicate that specific attributes of different maize varieties are an important influence on their use. The benefits to growing hybrid maize appear to be yield and drought tolerance. Open pollinated varieties are selected by farmers who value early maturity. Local maize varieties are popular among farm households owing to a number of favourable processing and consumption characteristics: storability, poundability, flour-to-grain ratio, and taste. Further research using nationally representative data is needed to assess whether findings for Mulanje District can be generalized to Malawi as a whole. If future studies agree with the results herein then maize breeding research programs in Malawi should consider a diversity of traits beyond grain yield to encompass the range of production, processing, and consumption attributes that are valued by farmers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Africa; Agriculture; Maize adoption; Malawi; Variety characteristics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862684887

However, not all crops have valuable male sterile lines due to instability of male sterility and absence of a restorer system. In this study, male sterile lines have been induced using a two-component system. The extracellular ribonuclease Barnase was cleaves into two inactive yet complementary fragments, designated as 'Bn-5' and 'Bn-3'. Both components were controlled by a TA29 promoter. They were transferred into the tomato inbred line 'Yellow tomato' by Agrobacterium method. Southern blotting identified that 11 transgenic Bn-5 plants (T 0) and 10 transgenic Bn-3 plants (T 0) were obtained. The vegetative phenotypes of all T 0 plants were similar to wild-type, and they were capable of producing viable pollen grains and normal fruit with seeds, indicating that Barnase had lost its function after it being split two partial fragments. After self-pollination, homozygous progenies (T 1) of transgenic Bn-5 and Bn-3 plants were chosen to cross each other, Barnase could be reconstituted and co-expressed in the same cell, which caused the hybrid plants to produce collapsed pollen grains with no viability and thus100 % male sterile plants were obtained. Stamens of male sterile plants were shorter than those of the wild type plants. PCR detection demonstrated that all male sterile plants contained Barnase, but male fertile plants did not. The male sterile plants were crossed with the male fertile inbred lines, and the result showed that hybrid (F 1) plants were capable of producing normal fruit with seeds, and their pollen grain fertility was restored. The co-segregation ratio of Bn-5 and Bn-3 fragments showed 1:1 among hybrid plants. In conclusion, the results verified that the male sterility could be generated by two component system and be used in hybrid seed production. The F 1 between the male sterile plant and the inbred line showed heterotic comparing to both parents.

Although such trade-offs have been demonstrated at the level of individual shoots (ramets), there is little evidence that they scale up to affect genet fitness. For hermaphrodites, reproductive investment is further divided between female and male sexual functions. Female function should generally incur greater carbon costs than male function, which might involve greater nitrogen (N) costs. • Using a common garden experiment with diclinous, clonal Sagittaria latifolia we manipulated investment in reproduction through female and male sex functions of 412 plants from monoecious and dioecious populations. • We detected a 1:1 trade-off between biomass investment in female function and clonal reproduction. For male function, there was no apparent trade-off between clonal and sexual reproduction in terms of biomass investment. Instead, male function incurred a substantially higher N cost. • Our results indicate that: trade-offs between investment in clonal propagation and sexual reproduction occur at the genet level in S. latifolia; and sexual reproduction interferes with clonal expansion, with investment in female function limiting the quantity of clonal propagules produced, and investment in male function limiting the nutrient content of clonal propagules. © 2012 New Phytologist Trust.",Clonal reproduction; Common currency; Cost of reproduction; Dioecy; Genet; Life history trade-offs; Monoecy; Ramet,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866380018

Heynh. In apple there are two TFL1 homologs, MdTFL1-1 and MdTFL1-2. The MdTFL1-1 gene was silenced in transgenic clones expressing a hairpin gene construct of a 323bp fragment of MdTFL1-1. The hairpin gene construct was transferred to three different apple genotypes. Of 22 transgenic clones, 21 showed a significant reduction in MdTFL1-1 mRNA expression. Precocious flowering was obtained for 20 clones, which flowered already during in vitro cultivation. Nineteen clones could successfully be transferred to the greenhouse where 18 of them flowered within a few weeks followed by the death or at least a strongly inhibited vegetative growth of the plant. Most of the transgenic flowers developed abnormally. Results obtained on greenhouse-grown plants of the transgenic clones and transgenic seedlings clearly demonstrated the major role of MdTFL1 genes in maintaining the vegetative growth as prerequisite for a perennial lifecycle. It was shown that MdTFL1 dsRNAi promotes a life history similar to annual plants. Preliminary results obtained from grafting experiments with non-transgenic scions grafted onto MdTFL1 dsRNAi transgenic rootstocks indicated that the flower-inducing signal obtained after silencing of MdTFL1 genes seems not to be graft-transmissible. © 2012 The Author 2012.

Our understanding of its other physiological roles, however, is limited. In this study, the physiological and developmental roles of TT16 in an important oil crop, canola (Brassica napus), were dissected by a loss-of-function approach. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated down-regulation of tt16 in canola caused dwarf phenotypes with a decrease in the number of inflorescences, flowers, siliques, and seeds. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tt16 deficiency affects pollen tube guidance, resulting in reduced fertility and negatively impacting embryo and seed development. Moreover, Bntt16 RNAi plants had reduced oil content and altered fatty acid composition. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the seeds of the RNAi plants had fewer oil bodies than the nontransgenic plants. In addition, tt16 RNAi transgenic lines were more sensitive to auxin. Further analysis by microarray showed that tt16 downregulation alters the expression of genes involved in gynoecium and embryo development, lipid metabolism, auxin transport, and signal transduction. The broad regulatory function of TT16 at the transcriptional level may explain the altered phenotypes observed in the transgenic lines. Overall, the results uncovered important biological roles of TT16 in plant development, especially in fatty acid synthesis and embryo development. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Therefore, it is surprising that little is known about whether ploidy variation, both within and among species, influences spatial patterns of interspecific hybridization. The role that polyploidy plays in structuring gene flow patterns between three co-occurring Indian paintbrush (Castilleja) species is investigated. • Methods: Reciprocal hand pollinations were performed in populations where the three species co-occur with and without variable plants (previous data tested the ancestral ""hybrid"" history of these variable plants). I measured fruit set, seed production, seed germination, and the DNA content of parent plants and 26 synthesized F1 hybrids. Data were combined with pollinator fidelity data to estimate the contribution of individual barriers to reproductive isolation. • Key results: Interspecific gene flow could occur in all directions, but barriers were weaker for conspecific vs. heterospecific crosses. Species were nearly fixed for different ploidy levels, but some deviations occurred, primarily in populations with variable plants. Interspecific gene flow could occur across ploidy levels, but it was more likely when species had the same number of chromosomes or when resulting F1 hybrids had even numbers of chromosomes. Postzygotic reproductive barriers were generally weaker than pollinator fidelity. • Conclusions: Polyploidy likely plays a large role in shaping contemporary and historical patterns of gene flow among these species. This study suggests that differences in chromosome numbers among closely related, compatible species might help structure spatial patterns of hybridization. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Castilleja; DNA content; F1hybrid; Gene flow; Hybridization; Indian paintbrush; Interploidy mating; Orobanchaceae; Polyploidy; Reproductive barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867592259

The maize (Zea mays) drought transcriptome was studied using RNA-Seq analysis to compare drought-treated and well-watered fertilized ovary and basal leaf meristem tissue. More drought-responsive genes responded in the ovary compared with the leaf meristem. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed a massive decrease in transcript abundance of cell division and cell cycle genes in the drought-stressed ovary only. Among Gene Ontology categories related to carbohydrate metabolism, changes in starch and Suc metabolism-related genes occurred in the ovary, consistent with a decrease in starch levels, and in Suc transporter function, with no comparable changes occurring in the leaf meristem. Abscisic acid (ABA)-related processes responded positively, but only in the ovaries. Related responses suggested the operation of low glucose sensing in drought-stressed ovaries. The data are discussed in the context of the susceptibility of maize kernel to drought stress leading to embryo abortion and the relative robustness of dividing vegetative tissue taken at the same time from the same plant subjected to the same conditions. Our working hypothesis involves signaling events associated with increased ABA levels, decreased glucose levels, disruption of ABA/sugar signaling, activation of programmed cell death/senescence through repression of a phospholipase C-mediated signaling pathway, and arrest of the cell cycle in the stressed ovary at 1 d after pollination. Increased invertase levels in the stressed leaf meristem, on the other hand, resulted in that tissue maintaining hexose levels at an ""unstressed"" level, and at lower ABA levels, which was correlated with successful resistance to drought stress. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Their pollen productivity and spatio-temporal pattern are largely unknown. Long-term data (17 years) collected at 22 sites across Austria were presented and the pollen production of 12 tree genera was analysed. We ranked the tree genera according to their pollen productivity taking actual tree abundances of the Austrian Forestry Inventory into account. The productivity varied strongly among tree genera with a maximum for Betula. Pollen production in Larix, Abies and Picea amounted to approximately 1/20, while in increasing order Salix, Quercus, Alnus, Populus and Fraxinus produced approximately 1/3 to 1/4 of the respective Betula estimate. In general, pollen quantity in broadleaves was higher than in conifers. We analysed the temporal pollen production pattern by means of hierarchical cluster analysis and identified three major groups: [(Fagus, Larix, Picea, Abies), (Alnus, Betula, Fraxinus)], [Carpinus],[Populus, Salix, Pinus, Quercus]. Distance matrices based on life-history traits as well as molecular phylogeny were also constructed; they correlated significantly with each other by means of Mantel-tests. However, there was no significant relationship between the distances on temporal pollen production with the other matrices. Intermittent or idiosyncratic pollen production was studied by means of deviation from expected means, skewness and spindle diagrams. We proposed that Fagus, Carpinus, Larix, Picea and Abies belong to 'masting pollen producers', while the remaining genera idiosyncratically produced pollen over the monitored period. Moreover we correlated the distance matrix of pollen production for each tree genus at each sampling site with respective 'ecological distance matrices' based on aerial and altitudinal distance among sites. Significant correlations were detected for tree genera (Fagus, Larix, Picea) which were also prone to pollen masting, thus indicating a Moran effect. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866173059

The well-known pattern in olive fruit was confirmed by the high percentage of drupes (71.8%, on average) containing one seed with a closed endocarp, as the dispersal unit, optimizing the plant's investment in seedling survival. Based on the results of the x2 test of independence, there was a significant maternal and paternal effect on the number of normal seeds per drupe in some years and combinations. Particularly, in 2007, Picholine and Leccino cultivars (as mother) had drupes with two normal seeds (23.7% and 3.1%, respectively, with respect to 10.8% observed in a normal seed pattern), confirming that double-seeding in olive could be cultivar-dependent. Also the specific crosspollination between 'Carolea', as a pollenizer, and 'Ascolana Tenera' gave rise to a higher proportion of double-seeded drupes in 2007 (39% with respect to 14.3% expected to be in this category). In 2008, although 'Ascolana Tenera' produced more drupes with undeveloped seeds (31.9% with respect to 19.7% expected to be in that category), 'Leccino' and 'Carolea' had drupes with a lower number of undeveloped seed (14.2% and 11.5%, respectively). 'Maurino' and 'Ascolana Tenera' pollen produced significant effects on 'Leccino' drupes by increasing the number of drupes with undeveloped seeds in both experimental years. Double-seeded drupes outweighed those with only one normal seed in 'Leccino' and 'Picholine'. Instead, drupes with undeveloped seeds affected fruit weight, being generally lighter than those with normal seeds. Although the Leccino cultivar, combined with 'Maurino' and 'Ascolana Tenera', greatly increased the proportion of drupes without normal seed, such condition did not affect their final weight, which was not different from those with one normal seed, suggesting that this variety caused late seed death.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868033302

Allelic diversity was threefold higher than in an endangered self-pollinating congener. Most populations showed heterozygote deficiency indicating past bottlenecks, inbreeding or genetic drift.

Interactions between bees and flowers are historically a key topic of research in biology. Apis mellifera is known to forage on a wide variety of flowers to collect nectar and/or pollen. Until now, resource collection strategies were investigated focusing on the influence of single factors on foraging decisions, such as hive requirements, surrounding vegetation, resource availability, seasonality and interactions with other bees. Despite the vast amount of literature on A. mellifera, we lack a comprehensive view of its flower selection. 2. Our aim was to go beyond specific circumstances in order to identify general criteria for flower selection at species level. Applying data mining techniques (Market Basket Analysis), we found that bees exert a precise flower selection choice mainly driven by their pollen requirements. The bees foraged all over the study area with no obvious preference for the close surrounding vegetation. They selected a restricted number of all the available sources, for nectar as well as for pollen. Apis mellifera chose some floral sources more regularly than others. The most recurrent sources changed in time according to subsequent flowering peaks and often corresponded to anemophilous species. The compelling need for pollen revealed the constant demand of a few distinct floral sources. Plants providing huge quantities of pollen, such as wind-pollinated species, were preferred. When the pollen source also provided a good quantity of nectar, foragers collected both resources on the same species. 3. This work on A. mellifera helps to clarify some of the complex aspects of its floral selection processes, which emerge from studies on single colonies, areas or environmental factors influencing individual foraging behaviours. It also suggests that some established theories on pollinator-flower interactions, such as the role of wind-pollinated species, need revision. © 2012 The Authors.

Tracing the nomenclature within successive editions of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), I consider the reification of the term 'FSD', and the activism and scholarship that the rise of the category has occasioned. I suggest that analysis of FSD benefits from scrutiny of a wider range of sources (especially since the popular and scientific cross-pollinate). I explore the multiplicity of FSD that emerges when one examines this wider range, but I also underscore a reinscribing of anxieties about psychogenic aetiologies. I then argue that what makes the FSD case additionally interesting, over and above other conditions with a contested status, is the historically complex relationship between psychiatry and feminism that is at work in contemporary debates. I suggest that existing literature on FSD has not yet posed some of the most important and salient questions at stake in writing about women's sexual problems in this period, and can only do this when the relationship between 'second-wave' feminism, 'post-feminism', psychiatry and psychoanalysis becomes part of the terrain to be analysed, rather than the medium through which analysis is conducted. © The Author(s) 2012.",American Psychiatric Association; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; Female Sexual Dysfunction; feminism and post-feminism; psychiatric ontologies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867391841

The molecular genetic diversity was characterized in 195 C. mucunoides accessions from a germplasm collection using 17 microsatellite markers. Outcrossing rate was estimated after the evaluation of six microsatellite loci in 200 genotypes originated from 10 open-pollinated progenies (20 genotypes per progeny). Six genetic clusters were identified in the germplasm collection by the STRUCTURE software analysis, neighbor-joining tree comparisons and principal component analysis, which highly correlated with the geographic locations where these accessions were originated or collected. These results were confirmed using AMOVA. The largest portion of the genetic variation was observed among clusters (64.38%). The results indicated that: multilocus outcrossing rate (t m) was 16.3%, suggesting a mixed mating system with a predominance of autogamy; single locus outcrossing rate (t s) was 11%; difference (t m-t s) was 0.054, indicating that only 5.4% of outcrossing occurred among related individuals; paternity correlation (r p) was 33% suggesting a low probability of finding full sibs among the progeny; parental coefficient of inbreeding (F m) was 5.0%, indicating a low degree of inbreeding in each parent. A core collection for C. mucunoides was assembled to capture the allelic diversity found in this study. The complete allelic diversity was represented by only 15 accessions.

However, components of fitness also depend on environmental factors which can vary strongly between years. The dry grassland species Muscari tenuiflorum experiences long term habitat isolation and small population sizes. We analyzed seed production of M. tenuiflorum in four years and its dependence on population size and genetic variation. Genetic diversity within populations was high (AFLP: H e=0.245; allozymes: H e=0.348). An analysis of molecular variance revealed considerable population differentiation (AFLP: 26%; allozyme: 17%). An overall pattern of isolation by distance was found, which, however was not present at distances below 20km, indicating stronger effects of genetic drift. Genetic diversity was positively correlated to population size. Self pollination reduced seed set by 24%, indicating inbreeding depression. Reproductive fitness was not correlated to genetic diversity and a positive correlation with population size was present in two of four study years. The absence of a general pattern stresses the importance for multi-year studies. Overall, the results show that despite long term habitat isolation M. tenuiflorum maintains seed production in many years independent of population size. The long term persistence of populations is thus expected to depend less on intrinsic genetic or demographic properties affecting seed production but on successful plant establishment and persistence, which latter are based on conservation and protection of suitable habitats. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Genetic diversity; Habitat fragmentation; Plant fitness; Population size; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868708240

However, Allee effects and other population-level processes may constrain reproductive success. This study identified variation in seed quality resulting from different genetic diversity levels in parental populations of an invasive grass. Using the outcrossing and wind-pollinated annual grass Lolium multiflorum, experimental populations were created with independently varying size and genetic diversity. Seeds from parental populations with lower diversity germinated and emerged from the soil at significantly lower rates than seeds from populations with the highest diversity. This effect was not detected in later-occurring fitness components such as flower production per planted seed. Reductions in seed germination and seedling numbers can affect future generations by reducing the size and/or genetic diversity of the resulting populations. The reduced offspring quality seen here suggests that fecundity and invasiveness vary not only among invasive species or potential invasive species, but also among populations of the same invasive species and highlights an advantage of genetic diversity within invasions. © Torrey Botanical Club.",Allee effects; bottleneck; exotic species; inbreeding depression; ryegrass,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873378103

Methods Three chloroplast genes, one mitochondrial gene and one nuclear DNA region were sequenced for 153 accessions representing 125 of the 200 species of Alstroemeriaceae from throughout the distribution range; 25 outgroup taxa were included to securely infer evolutionary directions and be able to use both ingroup and outgroup fossil constraints. A relaxed-clock model relied on up to three fossil calibrations, and ancestral ranges were inferred using statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis (S-DIVA). Southern Hemisphere disjunctions in the flowering plants were reviewed for key biological traits, divergence times, migration directions and habitats occupied. Results The obtained chronogram and ancestral area reconstruction imply that the most recent common ancestor of Colchicaceae and Alstroemeriaceae lived in the Late Cretaceous in southern South America/Australasia, the ancestral region of Alstroemeriaceae may have been South America/Antarctica, and a single New Zealand species is due to recent dispersal from South America. Chilean Alstroemeria diversified with the uplift of the Patagonian Andes c.18Ma, and a hummingbird-pollinated clade (Bomarea) reached the northern Andes at 11-13Ma. The South American Arid Diagonal (SAAD), a belt of arid vegetation caused by the onset of the Andean rain shadow 14-15Ma, isolated a Brazilian clade of Alstroemeria from a basal Chilean/Argentinean grade. Main conclusions Only Alstroemeriaceae, Calceolariaceae, Cunoniaceae, Escalloniaceae and Proteaceae have expanded and diversified from Patagonia far into tropical latitudes. All migrated northwards along the Andes, but also reached south-eastern Brazil, in most cases after the origin of the SAAD. Our results from Alstroemeria now suggest that the SAAD may have been a major ecological barrier in southern South America. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Ancestral area reconstruction; Andean uplift; Austral-Antarctic families; Australia; East Gondwana; Molecular clock; New Zealand; South America,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866313605

It is a small, perennial herb that inhabits rocky environments, together with other endemic plants with creeping life-forms. In the present study, for the first time the reproductive biology of the species was investigated in terms of its floral phenology (floral stages and times of formation), pollen/ovule (P/O) ratios, and fruit and seed setting under natural and pollen manipulation experiments, assessing the breeding system, pollination vectors and pollen limitations. Cross-pollinations among populations were performed to evaluate the levels of compatibility between populations. In addition, the floral displays and the reproductive outputs of four wild populations were determined. The observed high P/O ratios, results of the hand-pollination experiments, and flower traits indicate that this species is predominantly allogamous. Combinations of both insects (belonging to Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera) and wind (ambophily) constitute the main pollination vectors, and pollen limitation was observed. Interpopulation crossing was effective, and exogamic depression was not present, as evidenced by the fecundity levels. The predation of the floral stems by herbivores (mainly goats) severely limits the reproductive success of this endemic species in wild populations. Finally, several ways of action are proposed for R. weyleri conservation. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Ambophily; Breeding system; Conservation; Floral biology; Interpopulation crossings; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868704428

Of 180 primary transgenics, 48 were potential launch pads, 72 were multiple insertions or chimaeras, and 60 exhibited somatic transposition. T1 progeny of 32 putative launch pads were screened by multiplex PCR for transposition. Evidence of germ-line transposition occurred in 13 putative launch pads; however, the transposition frequency was too low in three for efficient recovery of transposants. The transposition frequency in the remaining launch pads ranged from 16% to 40%. After self-pollination of the T0 launch pads, putative transposants in the T1 generation were identified by multiplex PCR. Sequencing of hiTAIL-PCR products derived from nested primers within the Ds end sequences (either P35S at the left border or the inverted repeat at the right border) of T1 plants revealed transposition of the Ds element to distant sites in the strawberry genome. From more than 2400 T1 plants screened, 103 unique transposants have been identified, among which 17 were somatic transpositions observed in the T0 generation. Ds insertion sites were dispersed among various gene elements [exons (15%), introns (23%), promoters (30%), 3? UTRs (17%) as well as intergenically (15%)].

For this, the culture was observed in March 2010, the first ten minutes in each hour, from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, with three replicates (different days). The insects found in cotton flowers were Africanized honey bees Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae; 36.7%), followed by stingless bees Exomalopsis sp.

Bee behaviour when visiting flowers is mediated by diverse chemical cues and signals, from the flower itself and from previous visitors to the flower. Flowers recently visited by bees and hoverflies may be rejected for a period of time by subsequent bee visitors. 2. Nectar-thieving ants also commonly visit flowers and could potentially influence the foraging decisions of bees, through the detection of ant trail pheromones or footprint hydrocarbons. 3. Here we demonstrate that, while naÏve bumblebees in laboratory trials are not inherently repelled by ant scent marks, they can learn to use them as informative signals while foraging on artificial flowers. 4. To test for similar activity in the wild, visitor behaviours at the flowers of Digitalis purpurea Linnaeus, Bupleurum fruticosum Linnaeus, and Brassica juncea (Linnaeus) Czernajew were compared between flowers that had been in contact with ants and those that had not. No differences were found between the two treatments. 5.

To date, most research on green roofs has focused on minimizing environmental impacts of buildings and little is known about the ecological services they may provide. Previous research has found a deficiency of pollinating bees on green roofs, which could result in pollen limitation, poor seed production and reproductive failure of many plant species requiring bee pollination. This study aims to determine whether pollination services on modern green roofs are sufficient for these novel habitats to function sustainably. Nine native Illinois prairie plant species and their pollinator communities were studied on green roofs and ground-level locations in the Chicago area. Pan traps were used to assess pollinator communities and supplemental pollination treatments were used to evaluate pollen limitation. All species showed significantly reduced seed set when pollinators were excluded but few significant differences were observed between supplemental and open pollination treatments. Seed set differed by habitat type in that green roofs had a higher overall mean percent maximum seed set compared to ground-level sites. Our results support previous studies, showing lower numbers and diversity of bees on green roofs compared to the ground level. Together, these data suggest that although green roofs contain a smaller and less diverse community of pollinators, the insects that are present provide sufficient pollinator services for many native plants. This study therefore supports the use of biotically pollinated native forbs in future green roof design. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Green roofs; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Pollinator diversity; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865305967

Ciências Vegetais - Fitotecnia, Mossoró, RN, Brazil","Guava is one of the most important fruits in a large number of countries of the world. In most countries where guava is important, genetic studies and breeding is done in different degrees and ways. Germplasm conservation and studies are practiced in places such as Colombia, Venezuela, USA, Malaysia and Nigeria. In these and other cases, objectives are to collect, introduce, characterize and select guava genotypes with defined and appropriate characteristics to production. Artificial pollination is mostly used. Conversely, countries such as Israel, Thailand, Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, Pakistan and India, especially the latter one, present active and productive guava breeding programs. On the other hand, this fact resulted in a very high variability in seedling populations from which promising genotypes have been selected, such as 'Paluma', the main Brazilian cultivar and many others, like 'Kumagai', 'Pedro Sato', 'Cortibel'. In India there are more than 150 cultivars, but only a few with commercial importance such as 'Allahabad Safeda', 'L-49' ('Sardar'), 'Hisar Surkha', 'Lucknow Safeda', 'Arka Amulya', which have been identified for commercial planting particularly in northern India, the main guava growing region. However, in the last 10-15 years crop improvement work carried out resulted in release of several superior selections and or hybrids, such as 'Safed Jam', 'Kohir Safeda' and 'Arka Amulya' in India, 'Século XXI' in Brazil, and others. Breeding programs also use techniques such as interspecific crosses and induced mutation, contributing to bring variability in different senses and characteristics. Molecular techniques and other new biotechnological tools are very helpful to study the extent of genetic variation among cultivars as well as to find out genetic markers for wilt resistance to improve efficiency in developing wilt resistant clones and rootstocks. Development studies still have to be done in aneuploidy breeding, development of autotetraploids and in vitro genetic manipulation of somatic cells. © ISHS.",Cultivars; Fruit quality; Improvement; Myrtaceae; Psidium guajava; Variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872083775

We characterized and compared the lower development threshold temperature, bloom phenology, and flower viability of five common cultivars of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) to enable prediction of when flowers would be available for pollination. Threshold temperatures of all cultivars were found to be very similar and range between 7 and 8 8C. Logistic regression was used to characterize bloom phenology for all cultivars under field and greenhouse conditions. Bloom phenology under greenhouse conditions was delayed '100 growing degree-days when compared with field conditions. Average flower viability was determined daily from first flower opening until 5 days after flower opening for each cultivar. Results indicated declining flower viability with increasing flower age with most flowers unsuitable for pollination more than 4 days after opening.

This concept of coexistence implies the necessity of developing coexistence strategies which curb the risk of mixing GM and non-GM material along agricultural supply chains. Among many things, this requires understanding and predicting the process of cross-pollination between the different varieties cultivated on a given landscape. In order to provide a prediction accurate enough to cope with legal thresholds, it is necessary to be able to rank varieties according to their pollen production. However, this parameter is rarely known, partly because it is difficult and expensive to measure. We investigated how easy-to-measure tassel morphological characteristics can be used to predict the quantity of pollen produced by hybrid maize varieties. Thirteen varieties were grown in France on experimental plots during three years with two varieties added the last year. For each variety, we measured the pollen production and variables that describe the tassel architecture. We found that the number of ramifications, the length of the tassel, the length of the emitting section, the number of spikelets and the TAI (the Tassel Area Index which aims at estimating the pollen emitting area) were correlated with pollen production. Using linear models, we identified the number of spikelets as the best architectural variable related to pollen production. In order to evaluate the ability of tassel characteristics to predict pollen production, we analysed how the relationships established in the case of any two years made it possible to predict the pollen production of the third year. The model that combined the total length of the tassel and the total number of spikelets was found to be the best predictive model of the relative pollen production between varieties. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Coexistence; Cross-pollination; Gene flow; GMO; Hybrid; Mixed model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865085483

Recent data suggest that microarthropods can disperse sperm in mosses. However, little is known about the chemical communication, if any, that is involved in this interaction or the relative importance of microarthropod dispersal compared to abiotic dispersal agents in mosses. Here we show that tissues of the cosmopolitan moss Ceratodon purpureus emit complex volatile scents, similar in chemical diversity to those described in pollination mutualisms between flowering plants and insects, that the chemical composition of C. purpureus volatiles are sex-specific, and that moss-dwelling microarthropods are differentially attracted to these sex-specific moss volatile cues. Furthermore, using experimental microcosms, we show that microarthropods significantly increase moss fertilization rates, even in the presence of water spray, highlighting the important role of microarthropod dispersal in contributing to moss mating success. Taken together, our results indicate the presence of a scent-based plant pollinator-like relationship that has evolved between two of Earths most ancient terrestrial lineages, mosses and microarthropods. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Although land-use changes have been advanced as the major causes, the affinities of most wild pollinators with the main land-use types remain unknown. Filling this gap in our knowledge is a prerequisite to improving conservation and management programmes. Methodology/Principal Findings: We estimated the affinity of flower visitors with urban, agricultural and natural land-uses using data from a country-wide scale monitoring scheme based on citizen science (Spipoll). We tested whether the affinities differed among insect orders and according to insect frequency (frequent or infrequent). Our results indicate that the affinities with the three land-use types differed among insect orders. Apart from Hymenopterans, which appeared tolerant to the different land-uses, all flower visitors presented a negative affinity with urban areas and a positive affinity with agricultural and natural areas. Additionally, infrequent taxa displayed a lower affinity with urban areas and a higher affinity with natural areas than did frequent taxa. Within frequent taxa, Hymenoptera and Coleoptera included specialists of the three land-use types whereas Diptera and Lepidoptera contained specialists of all but urban areas. Conclusions/Significance: Our approach allowed the first standardised evaluation of the affinity of flower visitors with the main land-use types across a broad taxonomical range and a wide geographic scope. Our results suggest that the most detrimental land-use change for flower visitor communities is urbanisation. Moreover, our findings highlight the fact that agricultural areas have the potential to host highly diverse pollinator communities. We suggest that policy makers should, therefore, focus on the implementation of pollinator-friendly practices in agricultural lands. This may be a win-win strategy, as both biodiversity and crop production may benefit from healthier communities of flower visitors in these areas. © 2012 Deguines et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866529554

Data were collected for one year (2006) using fruit-bait traps, line transect walk-and-counts, and hand nets. A total of 56,315 individuals belonging to 331 species, 95 genera, and 6 families were sampled. The most abundant species was Bicyclus safitza (14.5) followed by Acraea acerata (6.3), Catopsilia florella (6.5) and Junonia sophia (6.1). Significant differences in abundance, species richness, and diversity of butterflies occurred between the 26 study sites. Farmland butterflies visited a variety of habitats within and around sites, but important habitats included woodlands, fallows, hedgerows, swampy habitats, abandoned gardens, and home gardens. The highest diversity and abundance of butterflies occurred in sites that contained forest remnants. Thus, forest reserves in the surrounding of fields increased the conservation values of coffee-banana agroforestry systems for butterflies. Their protection from degradation should be a priority for policy makers since they support a species-rich community of butterflies pollinating cultivated plants. Farmers are encouraged to protect and increase on-farm areas covered by complex traditional agroforests, linear, and nonlinear seminatural habitats to provide sufficient breeding sites and nectar resources for butterflies. © 2012 M.

The prey-attraction hypothesis suggests that stabilimenta are visually attractive to prey and thus may increase the spiders' foraging success. However, previous studies on the function of stabilimenta have produced conflicting results in Argiope species. Using a combination of field and laboratory studies, we examined whether the linear stabilimentum of Argiope bruennichi contributes to prey interception. We recorded prey interceptions in 53 webs with stabilimenta and 37 equally-sized webs without stabilimenta, classifying captured prey according to their taxonomical group and size. On average, 6. 2 ± 4. 7 prey items were intercepted in webs with stabilimenta, while 3. 2 ± 2. 9 items were intercepted in webs without stabilimenta. The effects of stabilimenta on foraging success appear to be due to increased interception of UV-sensitive insect pollinators, including 20 families of Diptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The mean number of UV-sensitive prey was 4. 4 ± 3. 6 in webs with stabilimenta compared with 1. 8 ± 2. 1 in webs without stabilimenta. Webs with and without stabilimenta did not differ in the mean number of UV-nonsensitive prey captured. The linear stabilimentum showed strong positive effects on the interception of large prey: webs with stabilimenta captured more than twice as many large prey (?5 mm) than webs without stabilimenta, whereas there was only a slight difference in the interception rates for small prey (<5 mm). Comparisons among different Argiope species suggest that the stabilimentum may have different adaptive functions in different species or ecological contexts. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Argiope bruennichi; Prey-attraction hypothesis; Stabilimentum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869159507

To infer past tropical vegetation dynamics, understanding modern pollen-vegetation relationships is required, but understanding effects of different sampling media between calibration datasets and palaeorecords is also needed. This is especially true when palaeorecords are derived from bogs or lakes with boggy shores and common wetland plants share the same pollen taxon with important upland plants that distinguish tropical vegetation types (e.g., Poaceae and Plantago). We assessed modern pollen-vegetation relationships around an upper cloud forest line in the Hawaiian Islands and tested the utility of a modern pollen calibration dataset derived from 88 surface soil samples when applied in 10 test wetland sites more typical of palaeorecords. We assessed over- and under-representation of pollen/spore taxa with a direct comparison to plant abundance and derived several metrics from the pollen/spore assemblages - analogs, ordinations, relative abundance of life forms, and ratios of life forms. We used the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) to (1) compare metric performance at distinguishing vegetation around the upper forest line, (2) assess whether excluding wetland taxa significantly affected metric performance, and (3) test the accuracy of vegetation inference. Pollen-vegetation relationships were influenced by great ecological breadth and over- or under-representation of pollen and spores, which could be explained by pollination syndrome (wind vs. animal), grain/spore mass and upslope transport in winds. However, we found no evidence that upslope transport significantly blurred the upper-forest-line signal here, likely because winds are predominantly perpendicular to slope, and vertically constrained by the trade-wind inversion. Pollen from Poaceae and Plantago characterizes vegetation around this Hawaiian upper forest line and dominates wetland assemblages. Removing wetland taxa from the modern pollen calibration dataset levied no cost on a metric's performance, and greatly reduced the incidence of inaccurate vegetation inference in test sites. Minor error rates remained when rare, over-represented, or ecologically broad types were used in isolation. Overall, this study demonstrates that inferring forest line position from fossil pollen/spore assemblages requires careful consideration because (1) differences in sampling media between the modern calibration dataset and palaeorecords create opportunity for inaccurate vegetation inference and (2) some metrics perform better than others. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",Modern pollen rain; Pollen-vegetation relationship; ROC analysis; Surface soils; Tropical montane cloud forest; Upper forest line,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865964646

Only in a few species hybridization extends beyond the F1 generation, giving rise to hybrid swarms. However, little is known about the abundance of later-generation hybrids and what factors drive their occurrence in hybrid populations. In this study, molecular analyses were combined with detailed morphological measurements in a hybrid population of two closely related Orchis species (Orchis militaris and O. purpurea) to investigate the hypothesis that the abundance of later-generation hybrids is driven by changes in floral characters after hybridization that exert selective pressures that in turn affect hybridization. Results: Both the molecular and morphological data point to extensive genetic and morphological homogenization and asymmetric introgression. Estimating genomic clines from the multi-locus genotype data and testing for deviation from neutrality revealed that 30 out of 113 (27%) AFLP markers significantly deviated from neutral expectations. Plants with large floral displays or plant with flowers that resembled more O. purpurea had higher female fitness than plants with small floral displays or plants with flowers resembling more O. militaris, suggesting that directional selection may have contributed to the observed patterns of introgression. Conclusions: These results indicate that in closely related orchid species hybridization and gene introgression may be partly driven by selection for floral traits of one of the parental types. However, because some pure individuals were still present in the studied population, the parental species appeared to be sufficiently isolated to survive the challenge of sympatry. © 2012 Jacquemyn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Admixture; Hybrid swarm; Orchidaceae; Orchis; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866007561

Embryo rescue techniques and molecular cytogenetic methods have successfully been used to produce and characterize interspecific hybrids in various genera. In this paper, recent advances in interspecific hybridization are described based on the results obtained in Primula, Cosmos, and Kalanchoe with special references to the use of embryo culture techniques for rescuing the abortive hybrid embryos. The methods for production and characterization of interspecific hybrids are categorized into three steps, i.e., (1) pollination, (2) rescue culture of immature embryo, and (3) confirmation of hybridity and ploidy level of the plants obtained. For interspecific crosses, emasculation step is usually needed to avoid self-pollination even in the genera with self-incompatibility system, such as Primula and Cosmos, since self-incompatibility is not always complete. Since interspecific crosses are usually hindered by various cross-incompatibility mechanisms, successful production of interspecific hybrids could be achieved only from limited crosses among those using many cultivars/strains of both parents, suggesting the importance of the selection of the compatible genotypes. Unilateral cross incompatibility is commonly observed in interspecific cross combinations, so reciprocal crosses should be conducted as an indispensable step. At the rescue culture step, addition of plant hormones, e.g., auxin cytokinin and gibberellin, to the culture medium at the appropriate concentrations is proved to be effective and necessary. The hybridity of the plants is efficiently confirmed at the seedling stage by DNA analysis in addition to the observation of morphological characters. The analysis of relative DNA contents by flow cytometry is an easy and rapid means to confirm hybridity and to estimate ploidy level and genomic combination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865960697

In this study, we profiled the proteome in soybean mature pistils before and after pollination. Comparative analyses of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps from un-pollinated and pollinated pistils were conducted. The results showed that 22 proteins were increased and 36 proteins decreased after pollination. Functional categorization showed that most of them were metabolism- and redox-related proteins. The enhancement of primary metabolism, biosynthesis of pollen tube guidance compounds, and adjustment of redox homeostasis system might be helpful for a successful pollination. Quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction analysis implied that the regulation of gene expression might happen at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels during pollination.

One example is the dioecious herb Borderea chouardii (Dioscoreaceae), which is a Tertiary, tropical relict, occurring only on two adjacent vertical cliffs in the world. We studied its reproductive biology, which in some aspects is extreme, especially the unusual double mutualistic role of ants as both pollinators and dispersers. We made a 2-year pollination census and four years of seed-dispersal experiments, recording flower visitors and dispersal rates. Fruit and seed set, self-sowing of seeds, seedling recruitment, and fate of seedlings from seeds sowed by different agents were scored over a period of 17 years. The ants Lasius grandis and L. cinereus were the main pollinators, whereas another ant Pheidole pallidula dispersed seeds. Thus ants functioned as double mutualists. Two thirds of all new seedlings came from self-sown seeds, and 1/3 was dispersed by ants, which gathered the seeds with their oil-rich elaiosome. Gravity played a minor role to dispersal. Both ant dispersal and self-sowing resulted in the same survival rate of seedlings. A double mutualism is a risky reproductive strategy, but B. chouardii buffers that by an unusual long-term demographic stability (some individuals exceed 300 years in lifespan) and its presence in a climatically very stable habitat, inaccessible to large herbivores. Such a combination of traits and habitat properties may explain the persistence of this relict species. © 2012 García et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866327600

The costs and benefits of nectar production remain poorly understood [3-5]. Here, we developed a crossing design to introgress a low-nectar-volume locus of Petunia integrifolia into the genetic background of P. axillaris. The resulting introgression line resembled P. axillaris but produced only one-third of the nectar volume. When exposed simultaneously to low-nectar and wild-type P. axillaris plants, hawkmoth pollinators reduced their probing duration on low-nectar plants but otherwise did not show any signs of discrimination against these plants. However, reduced probing duration resulted in reduced seed production in the low-nectar plants despite their higher reproductive potential as evidenced by hand pollination. In line with this interpretation, we found a positive correlation between probing duration and seed set, and hawkmoth pollination of low-nectar plants that were manually supplemented with nectar to parental levels yielded seed sets similar to hand pollination. Thus, a simple self-serving pollinator behavior - the adjustment of probing time in response to nectar volume - may select against reducing nectar and protect many plant-pollinator mutualisms against a drift toward parasitism.

However, ecological processes underpinning their evolutionary diversification in association with other trophic groups are still unclear. Specialisation and interdependencies among chalcid wasps that reproduce on Ficus presents an opportunity to investigate the ecology of a multi-trophic system that includes parasitoids. Here we estimate the host-plant species specificity of a parasitoid fig wasp genus that attacks the galls of nonpollinating pteromalid and pollinating agaonid fig wasps. We discuss the interactions between parasitoids and the Ficus species present in a forest patch of Uganda in context with populations in Southern Africa. Haplotype networks are inferred to examine intraspecific mitochondrial DNA divergences and phylogenetic approaches used to infer putative species relationships. Taxonomic appraisal and putative species delimitation by molecular and morphological techniques are compared. Results demonstrate that a parasitoid fig wasp population is able to reproduce on at least four Ficus species present in a patch. This suggests that parasitoid fig wasps have relatively broad host- Ficus species ranges compared to fig wasps that oviposit internally. Parasitoid fig wasps did not recruit on all available host plants present in the forest census area and suggests an important ecological consequence in mitigating fitness trade-offs between pollinator and Ficus reproduction. The extent to which parasitoid fig wasps exert influence on the pollination mutualism must consider the fitness consequences imposed by the ability to interact with phenotypes of multiple Ficus and fig wasps species, but not equally across space and time. ©2012 McLeish et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874751606

However, the production of pine hybrid seeds can be difficult and is dependent on the presence of an adequate number of male and female strobili, timely application of the pollination bag, good pollination techniques and reasonable weather conditions. After pollination, a wait of two or more years is required for cones to mature and for seeds to be collected. The seeds collected from artificial hybrid crosses in an orchard are assumed to be true hybrids, but might also be the (female) pure species if pollen contamination has occurred prior to or during bagging of the male strobili. Confirming hybridity in pines is often very difficult in the seedling stage when only needle morphological characteristics are used. In this study, we examined ground oven-dried needle samples of 16 pine species from different geographic regions using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to determine if this method is effective in distinguishing between pine species. We also created three ""simulated hybrids"" by manually mixing needles from three sets of parental pure species. The raw near infrared reflectance spectroscopy data were transformed using standard normal variate and de-trending techniques and a model was developed to distinguish between pure pine species and their ""hybrids"" using discriminant analysis. A total of 120 paired-species models were developed (one for each potential hybrid of the 16 species). For each of the 120 paired-species models, there were 20 independent observations in a validation data set and the 2400 observations were classified with 94% accuracy. Models were also developed for each of six species-simulated hybrid data sets. A total of 120 independent validation observations were classified as either parental species or simulated hybrid with 90% accuracy. The results indicate that NIR spectroscopy can be used as an effective tool to distinguish between pure pine species and suggest that it will also distinguish hybrids from their parents. Using NIR spectroscopy to verify hybridity in pines might be quicker and less expensive and, in some cases, as accurate as using molecular techniques. © IM Publications LLP 2012 All rights reserved.",Hybrid verification; Hybridisation; Introgression; Pine needles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865682325

Despite being taxonomically widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease by 80% (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more distant one, bees engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and tested an iterative improvement heuristic to capture how bees could learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found. Our findings suggest that complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by small-brained animals using simple learning heuristics, without the need for a cognitive map. © 2012 Lihoreau et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866724846

Pollinator communities are critical to maintenance of plant diversity and, in light of recent pollinator loss, we tested whether removal of invasive glossy buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) from portions of a prairie fen wetland altered plant and pollinator communities. We compared herbaceous plant, bee, and butterfly abundance, diversity, and species composition in buckthorn invaded, buckthorn removal, and uninvaded reference plots. Following restoration, we found striking differences in plant and pollinator abundance and species composition between restored, unrestored, and reference plots. Within 2 years of F. alnus removal, plant species diversity and composition in restored plots were significantly different than invaded plots, but also remained significantly lower than reference plots. In contrast, in the first growing season following restoration, bee and butterfly abundance, diversity, and composition were similar in restored and reference plots and distinct from invaded plots. Our findings indicate that a diverse community of mobile generalist pollinators rapidly re-colonizes restored areas of prairie fen, while the plant community may take longer to fully recover. This work implies that, in areas with intact pollinator metapopulations, restoration efforts will likely prevent further loss of mobile generalist pollinators and maintain pollination services. On the other hand, targeted restoration efforts will likely be required to restore populations of rare plants and specialist pollinators for which local and regional species pools may be lacking. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",Conservation; Plant community; Pollination; Prairie fen; Restoration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865863545

Here we describe the findings of an experiment designed to investigate how pollinator-mediated interactions between invasive Lythrum salicaria (Purple loosestrife) and a closely related native North American species, Decodonverticillatus (Swamp loosestrife) are influenced by the stage of invasion (i. e., early or late). By comparing pollinator preference and constancy to plants in experimentally introduced arrays of L. salicaria and D. verticillatus in invaded and uninvaded communities, we were able to simulate the ecological implications of two different stages of L. salicaria invasion. Invasion status had no significant effect on pollinator visitation to L. salicaria and D. verticillatus when all pollinator taxa were considered together. However, when bumblebees, the dominant pollinator at all sites, were considered alone, we found a significant interaction between pollinator preference and the invasion status of the site, with D. verticillatus preferred at uninvaded sites only, and no preference exhibited at invaded sites. In addition, for all pollinator taxa, we found that interspecific pollinator movements were overrepresented at uninvaded sites and underrepresented at invaded sites, suggesting that heterospecific pollen deposition could be a significant impediment to pollinator-mediated reproduction for both species in the early stages of an invasion. We discuss the potential consequences of our findings to the establishment of animal-pollinated invasive plants and the persistence of native species in the face of invasion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Invasive species; Pollination; Pollinator constancy; Pollinator preference; Purple loosestrife,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865439784

We examined the hypothesis that active pollen ejection and flowering patterns within an inflorescence influence the reproductive success (i.e. fruit formation) of individual flowers within or among inflorescences of S.stenoloba in a pollinator-excluded environment. Our results showed that: (1) no pollen grains were observed deposited on the stigma of their own flower after the pollen ejection system was manually activated, indicating self-pollination within an individual flower is improbable in S.stenoloba; (2) fruit set in the indoor open pollination treatment and the inflorescence-closed pollination treatment indicated that S.stenoloba is self-compatible and pollen ejection can potentially result in inter-floral pollination success; (3) fruit set in the inflorescence-closed pollination treatment was significantly lower than that of indoor open pollination, indicating within- and between-flower pollination events in an inflorescence are most likely limited, with pollination between inflorescences providing the highest reproductive opportunity; and (4) analysis of the spatial distribution of cumulative fruit set on inflorescences showed that pollen could reach any flower within an inflorescence and there was no functional limitation on seed set among flowers located at various positions within the inflorescence.

In this paper, we analyse the relationships between change in flowering dates and life-history traits within a phylogenetic framework. The study is based on an extensive data set of herbarium specimens of orchids collected in Hungary between 1837 and 2009, supplemented by recent field observations (1980-2011). Of the 39 taxa investigated, 31 (79%) showed apparent advancement in mean flowering time. Among these, advancement was statistically significant in nine taxa. The rest (eight taxa) showed non-significant delays in flowering. Averaging across all taxa, flowering time advanced by 3 days (3.8% of flowering period) during the last 50 years compared with the period before 1960. In taxa showing significant advancement, flowering times advanced by 7.7 days (8.6% of the flowering period). The most extreme advancement was 13.9 days. Multivariate models were used to evaluate ways in which life history may affect phenological responses to climate change. Pollination mode (i.e. deceptive vs. rewarding vs. autogamous), life span (i.e. short-lived vs. long-lived), biogeographical distribution type (i.e. Mediterranean vs. non-Mediterranean) and flowering time (i.e. mean date of blooming) emerged as important factors that influence changes in flowering through time. Phylogenetic relatedness did not predict phenological response. The strongest response was observed in orchids that flower relatively early in spring, exhibit an autogamous or deceptive pollination mechanism, have a long life span and possess a Mediterranean centre of distribution. Synthesis. Our investigation demonstrates that the majority of Hungarian orchids have shifted their yearly mean flowering to earlier dates during the past 50 years. Certain life-history traits, but not phylogenetic relatedness, were found to be important in predicting climatic responsiveness in European terrestrial orchids.

We conducted detailed investigations on PD secretion in Ginkgo biloba, and found that PDs could not form when the micropyle was removed, but were able to form after removal of the shoot, leaves, ovular stalk, or ovular collar. The duration and volume of the PD increased under high relative humidity, but addition of salt or sugar did not affect PD secretion, its size, or its duration. Morphological and anatomical observations showed that many secretion cells at the nucellus tip contributed to secreting the PD after the formation of pollen chamber. Under laboratory conditions, the PD persisted for approximately 10 d if not pollinated, and re-formed five times after it was removed, with the total volume of PDs reaching approximately 0.4 ?L. These results suggested that PDs can be continuously secreted by the tip of the nucellus cells during the pollination stage to increase the chance of capturing pollen from the air. Importantly, PD secretion is an independent behavior of the ovule and PDs were produced apoplastically. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Behavior; Ginkgo biloba L.; Nucellus cell; Ovule; Pollination drop; Primitive gymnosperm; Secretion; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866379799

S-RNase activity has been previously shown to be essential for the SI reaction, leading to the hypothesis that pollen rejection in incompatible crosses is due to degradation of pollen RNA. We used pollen expressing the fluorescent marker GFP, driven by the LAT52 promoter, to monitor the accumulation of mRNA and protein in pollen after compatible and incompatible pollinations. We find that GFP mRNA and protein gradually accumulate in pollen tubes until at least 18-h post-pollination and, up to this time, are only slightly more abundant in compatible compared with incompatible crosses. However, between 18- and 24-h post-pollination, pollen tube GFP mRNA and protein levels show a dramatic increase in compatible crosses and either remain constant or decrease in incompatible crosses. In contrast to these molecular correlates, the growth rates of compatible and incompatible pollen tubes begin to differ after 6-h post-pollination. We interpret the changes in growth rate at 6-h post-pollination as the previously described transition from autotrophic to heterotrophic growth. Thus, while pollen rejection is generally considered to result from the cytotoxic effects of S-RNase activity, this time course reveals that a difference in the growth rate of compatible and incompatible pollen appears prior to any marked effects on at least some types of pollen RNA. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Gametophytic self-incompatibility; GFP; Solanaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865660323

Germination of heterospecific pollen in ovulo was reduced in post-pollination prefertilization drops. This provides evidence of selection against foreign pollen by open-pollinated exposed ovules in these two sister taxa, which share the same type of pollination mechanism. Of the other prezygotic stages in pollen-ovule interactions, uptake of pollen by stigmatic hairs did not show any selection. Pollen tube penetration of the nucellus was similar for hetero- and homospecific pollen tubes, but heterospecific tubes only delivered gametes in one cross. To test for differences in the post-pollination prefertilization drops of each species, drops were gathered and analysed. Glucose and fructose were present in similar amounts in Douglas-fir and larch, while sucrose was found in larch only. Other carbohydrates such as xylose and melezitose were species-specific. In P. menziesii, sucrose is absent due to its conversion to glucose and fructose by apoplastic invertases. In contrast, Larix × marschlinsii drops have sucrose because they lack apoplastic invertases. The presence of invertase activity shows that the composition of gymnosperm post-pollination prefertilization drops is not static but dynamic. Drops of these two species also differed in their calcium concentrations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Gymnosperm; Invertase; Larix; Pollen selection; Post-pollination prefertilization drop; Pseudotsuga,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865615835

Insufficient pollination can reduce fruit and seed set by directly reducing pollen deposition, and can also affect offspring quality, such as growth rate and resistance to herbivores, by limiting outcrossing opportunities. Both effects are important in fruit agroecosystems where fruit size and the quality of seeds for re-planting are dependent on sufficient pollination. We experimentally manipulated pollination of the cape gooseberry, Physalis peruviana L. (Solanaceae), to test the effects of honey and bumble bee pollination compared to manual outcrossing and autonomous self-pollination on fruit and offspring characteristics. Compared to manual and self-pollination, bee pollination increased fruit size, seed set and germination rates, supporting the hypothesis that sufficient pollination increases plant fitness. Interestingly, plant growth rate and herbivore resistance were significantly and marginally greater in manually outcrossed plants compared to self-pollinated offspring, suggesting that inbreeding reduces offspring quality. Herbivore resistance and plant growth did not differ between one honeybee visit and self-pollination suggesting that multiple pollinator visits are needed to prevent inbreeding events. Our data suggest that the quantity and quality of pollen deposited by bee visitation can significantly alter ecologically and economically relevant traits in this agroecosystem. © 2012 Gesellschaft far kologie.",Herbivore resistance; Outcrossing; Physalis peruviana; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867733786

If two species possess similar floral traits that determine shared flower visitors, floral traits can be said to mediate plant-plant interactions. Such indirect interactions are important for understanding fundamental relationships of plant communities, such as competition and facilitation but thus far have only been tested within a native community context. We test whether floral-trait similarity can be used to predict interactions between an invasive plant and co-occurring native species in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We surveyed flower visitation at invaded and uninvaded plots across four sites and correlated floral-trait similarity between invasive and native species with both invasion impact on native flower visitation and flower visitor overlap of natives and the invasive species. Similarity of all traits (categorical and continuous) and categorical traits alone explained invasion impact (flower visitor overlap) between the native and invasive species. The majority of flower visitor overlap was attributed to the native honeybee Apis mellifera subsp. capensis. This study is the first to show that floral traits can be used to predict novel plant-plant interactions, even amongst ecologically generalized flower visitors and plants and to predict potential impacts of an invasive species on native flowering communities. However, floral traits were not useful for predicting changes in visitation to plant species. Synthesis. Results advance our understanding of the role of plant traits in ecological communities and reveal that they are important in mediating not only plant-pollinator interactions but also plant-plant interactions. Our findings also shed light on invasive-native plant interactions via pollinators and have the potential to predict certain invasion impacts.

However, myiophilous traits are found in some species, especially in sections Trigonopedia and Sinopedilum. Here we chose C.micranthum and C.sichuanense, two sympatric species endemic to Sichuan, China, to test whether these orchids are fly pollinated. Artificial pollination showed that both flowers are self-compatible but need pollen vectors for successful reproduction. Field observation showed that C.micranthum was pollinated by fruit flies and C.sichuanense by dung flies, both novel pollinators of Cypripedium orchids. These sympatric Cypripedium spp. are also cross-compatible, but hybrids were not found in nature. The pollination syndromes of C.sichuanense and C.micranthum fit into the complex sapromyiophily pattern. It appears that pollinator specificity is responsible for their reproductive isolation. The discovery of fly pollination in C.sichuanense and C.micranthum, which belong to the related sections Trigonopedia and Sinopedilum, suggests a shift from bee to fly pollination in the genus Cypripedium. Unlike most Cypripedium spp., the anthers of C.micranthum release discrete pollinia with narrow stalks instead of the usual amorphous pollen smears. This 'proto-pollinarium' is described, probably for the first time. These pollinia are most likely an adaptation for pollination by microdiptera, so the fly can carry the contents of both chambers in the same anther. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Floral syndrome; Pollinium evolution; Reproductive isolation; Sapromyiophily; Slipper orchid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865171884

We recorded 27 bee species on passion fruit flowers in commercial orchards in the region, from 2004 to 2007. Some 17 species were classified as pollinators (12 as effective and 5 as occasional pollinators). Species richness and frequency of pollinators were positively correlated with reproductive efficacy. Hand pollination substantially increased average fruit set (from 23.3% to 69.8%).

Night-blooming flowers pollinated by these beetles are thermogenic and release intense fragrances synchronized to pollinator activity. However, data on floral scent composition within such mutualistic interactions are scarce, and the identity of behaviorally active compounds involved is largely unknown. We performed GC-MS analyses of floral scents of four species of Annona (magnoliids, Annonaceae) and Caladium bicolor (monocots, Araceae), and demonstrated the chemical basis for the attraction of their effective pollinators. 4-Methyl-5-vinylthiazole, a nitrogen and sulphur-containing heterocyclic compound previously unreported in flowers, was found as a prominent constituent in all studied species. Field biotests confirmed that it is highly attractive to both male and female beetles of three species of the genus Cyclocephala, pollinators of the studied plant taxa. The origin of 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole in plants might be associated with the metabolism of thiamine (vitamin B1), and we hypothesize that the presence of this compound in unrelated lineages of angiosperms is either linked to selective expression of a plesiomorphic biosynthetic pathway or to parallel evolution. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Beetle pollination; Floral scent; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); Olfactory-mediated attraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867666309

To assess how pollinators respond to spatial heterogeneity of plant distributions and whether honeybees affect visitation by other pollinators we used an extensive data set comprising ten plant species and their flower visitors from five European countries. In particular we tested the hypothesis that the composition of the flower visitor community in terms of visitation frequencies by different pollinator groups were affected by the spatial plant population structure, viz. area and density measures, at a within-population ('patch') and among-population ('population') scale. We found that patch area and population density were the spatial variables that best explained the variation in visitation frequencies within the pollinator community. Honeybees had higher visitation frequencies in larger patches, while bumblebees and hoverflies had higher visitation frequencies in sparser populations. Solitary bees had higher visitation frequencies in sparser populations and smaller patches. We also tested the hypothesis that honeybees affect the composition of the pollinator community by altering the visitation frequencies of other groups of pollinators. There was a positive relationship between visitation frequencies of honeybees and bumblebees, while the relationship with hoverflies and solitary bees varied (positive, negative and no relationship) depending on the plant species under study. The overall conclusion is that the spatial structure of plant populations affects different groups of pollinators in contrasting ways at both the local ('patch') and the larger ('population') scales and, that honeybees affect the flower visitation by other pollinator groups in various ways, depending on the plant species under study. These contrasting responses emphasize the need to investigate the entire pollinator community when the effects of landscape change on plant-pollinator interactions are studied. © 2012 Gesellschaft far kologie.",Bayesian inference; Bees; Fragmentation; Hierarchical modelling; Hoverflies; Mutualistic interactions; Pollinator assemblages; Spatial distribution; Spatial scale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867735864

Pollinators tend to concentrate their efforts on patches of flowers offering higher rewards. The spatial relationship of an individual plant to those around it (its spatial context) is also important for its reproductive output. This study examines the effect of patch size and spatial context on the reproductive output of Puya hamata, a hummingbird-pollinated, semelparous, giant rosette plant in the Andes. Hummingbird behavioural response to Puya patch size and the effect of plant density on flowering plant size were assessed. The reproductive output (flower, fruit and seed production, seed viability, germination rates) of plants in relation to patch size and spatial context was determined. Isolated Puya inflorescences were visited by a higher diversity of mostly trap-lining hummingbirds, while plants in aggregations were almost exclusively visited by one territorial species. Spatial context did not affect Puya size at flowering, or the numbers of flowers, fruits and seeds produced. However, with respect to seed viability and germination rates, reproductive output was highest in isolated plants, and plants on the edges of patches, but lowest in plants at the centre of large patches. The effect of spatial context on reproductive output in P. hamata depends on several key conditions being met: the patches are normally made up of closely related plants and the pollinators, by switching to territoriality, restrict gene flow into patches and lower the effective reproductive output of the plants within those patches. Other plant-pollinator relationships meeting these conditions are likely to produce similar outcomes. Such situations are worthy of attention, not just for their ecological interest, but also for their implications for the management of species and genetic diversity. © 2012 Gesellschaft far kologie.",Andes; Ecuador; Germination; Hummingbirds; Pollination; Seed viability; Spatial pattern,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867694785

Insights into the way species interact as well as prediction accuracy can be gained when thresholds for trait value combinations that make interactions possible are optimized through model selection. I present novel data of two subalpine plant-pollinator communities and build several stochastic models integrating flower abundance and morphological threshold rules that allow or restrict interactions between species. The number of correctly predicted interactions was highest when thresholds were set so that the insect's proboscis was not shorter than the nectar-holder depth minus 1-1. 6 mm, and not wider than the nectar-holder width minus 0. 5 mm. In comparison with models based solely on plant abundance effects, the model incorporating optimized size thresholds better predicted the distribution of the trait differences between plants and insects. This indicates that a mechanistic approach of interaction webs based on optimized size thresholds provides valuable information on community structure.

We compared using a common garden experiment, the flowering phenology, the interaction with pollinators, and the colonization by ericoid mycorrhiza of mature C. vulgaris on three types of soils namely: (1) natural rhizospheric soil collected in a natural heath, (2) soil from an arable land recently restored into a heathland, and (3) soil of C. vulgaris from an area in which a high degree of heterospecific competition with perennial grasses occurred. The results of the experiment showed a strong effect of soil on flower phenology and synchrony. There was also an interaction with pollinators because not only did visitation rates depend on soil provenance but also the choice of plant by the pollinator, at least for honeybees, was affected by soil provenance. An a posteriori correlation analysis suggests that ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and not abiotic conditions across the different soil provenances may be involved in the interaction between plants and pollinators.

For the vast majority of crops it is unknown whether managed honey bees or wild bees are the most efficient pollinators, and how the pollination service provided by wild bees can be ensured. We assessed in a landscape-scale study how sweet cherry production is influenced (1) by high-diversity bee habitats, and (2) by flowering ground vegetation which might compete with cherry for pollinators or might facilitate cherry pollination. Cherry was highly dependent on insect pollination with bagged flowers producing only 3% of the fruits produced by open-pollinated flowers. Although two thirds of all flower visitors were honey bees, fruit set was related to wild bee visitation only, presumably due to their higher pollination efficiency. Initial fruit set and final cherry yield were closely correlated. Wild bee visitation increased with the proportion of high-diversity bee habitats in the surrounding landscape (1. km radius). An increase of high-diversity bee habitats in the landscape from 20% to 50% enhanced fruit set by 150%, which was experimentally shown to be due to pollen limitation. Neither flower cover of ground vegetation nor bee densities on ground transects were related to flower visitation in trees or fruit set. Our results show that pollination services by wild bees in cherry surpassed pollination by honey bees. Hence, farmers need to protect semi-natural habitats in their landscapes to guarantee pollination and high yields. The conservation of semi-natural habitats, which provide nesting sites and additional food resources before and after cherry flowering enhances gratis ecosystem services, and thereby, the farmer's yield. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Bees; Cherry; Fruit set; Landscape; Pollination; Semi-natural habitats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862748217

Honeybees are the most important managed pollinators of crop plants and responsible for estimated billions of dollars worth of food production annually. Although these insects make excellent subjects for basic research, understanding their biology often has immediate practical implications. Honeybees, and beekeeping, around the world appear to be facing serious problems to such a grave extent that the popular media are full of stories about their demise and the potential consequences to human food security. How honeybees perceive their world, especially the flowers they pollinate, and how they react to stresses in their environments (management, pathogens, parasites, pesticides, pollutants and landscape changes) are closely interlinked. Therefore, the relationships between basic and applied research become of immediate importance and may lead to a better handling of the ecological conditions under which honeybees perform their economically important contribution to the balance of nature. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Apoidea; Bees; Conservation; Flower relations; Food security; Foraging; Hymenoptera; Learning; Memory; Navigation; Neurobiology; Perception; Pollination; Sensory physiology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864825019

Here, we examine the potential impact of climate change on bees' geographic range in a global biodiversity hotspot. Location South Africa with a focus on the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) diversity hotspot. Methods Geographic ranges of 12 South African bee species representing dominant distribution types were studied, and the climate change impacts upon bees were examined with A2 and B2 climate scenarios of HadCM3 model, using MaxEnt for species distribution modelling. Results The predicted levels of climate change-induced impacts on species ranges varied from little shifts and range expansion of 5-50% for two species to substantial range contractions between 32% and 99% in another six species. Four species show considerable range shifts. Bees of the winter rainfall area in the west of South Africa generally have smaller range sizes than in the summer rainfall area and generally show eastward range contractions toward the dry interior. Bee species prevalent in summer rainfall regions show a tendency for a south-easterly shift in geographic range. Main conclusions The bee fauna of the CFR is identified as the most vulnerable to climate change due to the high level of endemism, the small range sizes and the island-like isolation of the Mediterranean-type climate region at the SW tip of Africa. For monitoring climate change impact on bees, we suggest to establish observatories in the coastal plains of the west coast that are predicted to be worst affected and areas where persistence of populations is most likely. Likely impacts of climate change on life history traits of bees (phenology, sociality, bee-host plant synchronization) are discussed but require further investigation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Bees; Climate sensitivity; Future climate scenario; Geographic range shift; Pollination; South Africa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864937961

We surveyed its entire distribution area in SE Spain, and located 31 populations, 16 within Nature Parks (Category V of the IUCN) and 15 in non protected areas. In each population we measured several variables related to habitat composition, pollinator community, herbivory damage and population viability. Our results show that populations in protected areas inhabit localities at higher altitudes and with more shrub cover. Most important, the abundance of a very effective pollinator type, beeflies, was significantly higher in protected populations. Curiously, damage by ungulates was also more intense in protected areas. The negative effect of herbivory offsets any positive effect played by pollinators in protected areas, and consequently there were not differences in population size or reproductive output inside and outside protected areas.

Therefore, variation in both habitat quality and reproductive traits should be considered when assessing reproductive costs. We investigated the effect of habitat quality and floral display on the costs of reproduction in the perennial herb Primula farinosa. In the study area, P. farinosa occurs in habitats that differ in water availability, which strongly influences plant performance. Furthermore, it displays a scape length dimorphism, with two distinct scape morphs differing in attractiveness to pollinators and reproductive success. To test the hypothesis that the cost of fruit production is higher in the long-scaped than in the short-scaped morph, and depends on water availability, we manipulated reproductive investment in eight P. farinosa populations along a gradient of soil moisture. Fruit set was higher in long-scaped individuals, and prevention of fruit set increased flower production in the following year among long-scaped, but not among short-scaped plants. Furthermore, costs of fruit production were evident at low and high moisture levels but not at intermediate levels. The results demonstrate an association between a genetically determined difference in floral display and cost of reproduction, and suggest that costs of reproduction are non-linearly related to water availability. They thus indicate links between the evolution of plant reproductive traits and plant life histories, and between habitat quality and optimal life history. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865577013

This mimicry has been shown to attract solitary male bees or wasps, which are their species-specific pollinators. The visual and chemical signals are considered to be a type of deceptive pollination mechanism based on mimicry for the exploitation of perceptual biases of animals. We propose that in addition to this unique pollination mechanism, these plants exhibit another, rarely mentioned and practically forgotten, non-exclusive function of bee or wasp mimicry (Batesian mimicry). This mimicry may deter large mammalian herbivores, and possibly also insects from the plants and especially from their flowers by a type of visual and olfactory deceptive aposematism. While visiting the flowers, bees and wasps may add a Müllerian effect to this defense. We extend this hypothesis to many other rewarding flowers that are bee or wasp pollinated and propose that abundance of pollinating bees or wasps may deter herbivorous mammals and insects from the plants during their peak flowering season. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Batesian mimicry; Bees; Defense; Herbivory; Ophrys; Wasps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865770595

Southern analysis revealed that type-I V-PPase genes form a multigene family, whereas there is only one type-II V-PPase gene in the tomato genome. Although SlVP1 and SlVP2 were differentially expressed in leaves and mature fruit, the highest levels of both SlVP1 and SlVP2 mRNA were observed in fruit at 24 days after anthesis. The expression pattern of type-II SlVP3 was similar to that of SlVP2, and the highest levels of SlVP3 mRNA were also observed in fruit at 24 days after anthesis, thus suggesting that SlVP3 plays a role in early fruit development. Because SlVP1 and SlVP2 mRNA was more abundant than SlVP3 mRNA, expression of type-I V-PPases was analysed further. Type-I V-PPase mRNA was localized in ovules and their vicinities and in vascular tissue at an early stage of fruit development. Tomato RNAi lines in which the expression of type-I V-PPase genes was repressed using the fruit-specific promoter TPRP-F1 exhibited fruit growth retardation at an early stage of development. Although the major function of V-PPases in fruit has been believed to be the accumulation of materials such as sugars and organic acids in the vacuole during cell expansion and ripening, these results show that specific localization of V-PPase mRNA induced by pollination has a novel role in the cell division stage. © 2012 The Author.",Fruit development; tomato; V-PPase; vacuolar H+-inorganic pyrophosphatase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866690586

Here, we used high-resolution confocal microscopy to define fine level changes to the embryo sac of the strongly self-incompatible cocoa genotype SCA 24 in the absence of pollination, and following compatible and incompatible pollination. All sperm nuclei had fused with the female nuclei by 48 h following compatible pollinations. However, following incompatible pollinations, we observed divergence in the behaviour of sperm nuclei following release into the embryo sac. Incomplete sperm nucleus migration occurred in approximately half of the embryo sacs, where the sperm nuclei had so far failed to reach the female gamete nuclei. Sperm nuclei reached but did not fuse with the female gamete nuclei in the residual cases. We argue that the cellular mechanisms governing sperm nucleus migration to the egg nucleus and those controlling subsequent nuclear fusion are likely to differ and should be considered independently. Accordingly, we recommend that future efforts to characterise the genetic basis of LSI in cocoa should take care to differentiate between these two events, both of which contribute to failed karyogamy. Implications of these results for continuing efforts to gain better understanding of the genetic control of LSI in cocoa are discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Cocoa; Confocal microscopy; Gametic non-fusion; Late-acting SI; Self-incompatibility; Theobroma cacao,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865615164

R. Brown s.l. (Fragrant Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Most available information was published before recent revisions in taxonomy split what had been known as Gymnadenia conopsea into three separate species, now designated G. borealis (Druce) R.M. Bateman, Pridgeon & M.W. Chase, G. conopsea (L.) R. Brown and G. densiflora (Wahlenb.) Dietrich. Although the three newly accepted species have at least partial reproductive isolation, they have numerous morphological and ecological similarities. Some recent work still refers to G. conopsea s.l. because of difficulties in distinguishing between the species, and inertia in adoption of the new taxonomy. Wherever possible, differences between G. borealis, G. conopsea s.s. and G. densiflora are highlighted. Gymnadenia conopsea s.l. is a perennial, terrestrial orchid that is widely distributed across Eurasia. The three segregate species are all considered native. G. conopsea s.s. (Chalk Fragrant Orchid) occurs mainly in the southern half of Britain, where it is most commonly observed in dry calcareous grasslands and pastures. G. densiflora (Marsh Fragrant Orchid) occurs in damp calcareous marshes, fens and dune slacks in England and Wales; it is rare in Scotland but frequent in Ireland. G. borealis (Heath Fragrant Orchid) is mainly found on hill pastures in Wales, northern England and Scotland. The three species all avoid shade, being most abundant in open habitats. Although the three segregate species cannot always be reliably distinguished on the basis of morphological characteristics, diagnostic features include plant height, leaf width and disposition, density of flowers in the inflorescence, shape of the labellum, spur width, and odour and colour of the flowers. Additionally, several cytotypes within G. conopsea s.s. have been observed in Central Europe. These often grow in mixed-ploidy populations; in contrast, the species appears to be predominantly diploid in Britain. Gymnadenia conopsea s.l. is a non-bulbous geophyte. Leaves emerge in spring, and flowering takes place between the end of June and the beginning of August. Vegetative adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent years - has been observed. Such dormancy rarely lasts longer than 1 year. The flowers of G. conopsea s.l. are arranged in a spike. The species is self-compatible but dependent on pollinators for successful pollination and fruit set. The most frequent pollinators are diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera. Pollinators are rewarded with abundant nectar produced within the long floral spur. In many populations, fruit set is > 90%. Although G. conopsea s.l. is widely distributed and can be locally abundant, the number of populations and size of populations in Britain have declined markedly during recent decades, mostly due to habitat destruction, ploughing of old fields and drainage. Because the distribution of the segregate species has been poorly documented, their conservation status is not well known. Conservation of remaining populations and restoration of degraded populations require reinstatement of appropriate management regimes (late summer/autumn mowing or grazing), combined with more detailed inventories of the three species. Gymnadenia conopsea s.l. is a nectar-rewarding, insect-pollinated, terrestrial orchid that avoids shade; it is widely distributed in well-drained calcareous grasslands, and calcareous fens and fen-meadows with short vegetation, but is also occasionally found on heaths. It comprises three recently-recognized segregate species: G. conopsea s.s., G. densiflora and G. borealis, whose individual distributions in the British Isles and ecological properties are still rather poorly known. © 2012 British Ecological Society.",Calcareous grassland; Conservation; Germination; Mycorrhiza; Orchids; Phenology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865277843

In this study, we evaluated the effects of local density and sexual expression on the reproductive success of the rare palm species Geonoma epetiolata in Costa Rica. We classified individuals in two density categories based on distances to the two nearest neighbors and recorded the occurrence of sexual overlap on each individual. Overlap between pistillate and staminate flowers in monoecious plants allows geitonogamous pollination, potentially reducing dependence on mates for reproduction. We measured plant size and light availability, and evaluated the influence of these variables on pollination success, fruit production, fruit abortion and seed mass. Pollination success significantly increased with density but there was no effect of sexual overlap. In contrast, there was no effect of density on the probability of initiated fruit, and a negative effect on fruit set. Fruit abortion was lowest in isolated plants with no sexual overlap. Plant size and light did not contribute to variation in reproductive success. In conclusion, the pollination advantage of plants in dense neighborhoods does not compensate reproductive losses incurred by fruit abortion, possibly due to mating among genetically related individuals. Geonoma epetiolata is threatened by habitat loss and poaching of seeds for the horticultural market. High fruit abortion rates associated with density in G. epetiolata suggest that seed collections from the remnant wild populations of this palm species may cause bottlenecks that further threaten population viability. © 2012 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Costa Rica; Density; Dichogamy; Fruit abortion; Geonoma epetiolata; Palm; Pollination; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865797997

The results show that C. castaneus features a striking system of mimicry, quite different from those studied previously in other dioecious plants. The population of C. castaneus was not significantly male biased and no intersexual difference in number of inflorescences per plant was detected. However, male plants began their blossoming earlier and flowered longer than female plants. There was thus an excess of male floral display. This excess should increase the frequency of insect-mediated transport of pollen from male to female plants. Further- more, on female plants each pistillate flower is accompanied by a sterile staminate flower that appears to contribute to insect attraction. Quite similar in morphology and function to fertile staminate flowers, they produce similar visual and olfactory cues, but less rewards (nectar but no pollen).

Knowledge of genetic adaptation to environmental factors can help develop strategies for successful reforestation in arid terrain. In this study, Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) seedlings grown from seed collected from 40 open-pollinated families from five Balkan Peninsula provenances were evaluated for survival and growth under imposed drought. Within each provenance, seed was collected from an extremely harsh habitat and from a favorable habitat. One-year-old seedlings, from each provenance, habitat type and open pollinated family were transplanted into three ""stressbeds"", each designed to simulate different levels of water availability by filling with varying ratios of crushed stone and soil. Seedling height growth and survival were recorded every 20-30 days from April-September. In all provenances, seedlings grown from seed originating from the harsh habitats had lower survival regardless of stressbed treatment compared to those grown from seed collected from favorable habitats, with the exception of one population from the Višegrad provenance which had high survival rates throughout. Overall height growth was very low and did not follow consistent patterns among treatment groups. Cluster analyses of survival data showed that populations from a similar habitat generally grouped together, regardless of provenance. The lowest and highest survival values were found in seedlings from harsh habitats, while those from the favorable habitats clustered in the mid-range. These results suggest that higher seed quality from productive stands may be the most influential factor determining seedling vigor under drought stress and that genetic adaptation to drought was not detected in adjacent populations having different habitat conditions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Austrian pine; Seedlings; Survival; Water deficit,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865440474

Three pollen volumetric samplers distributed in olive groves all over the altitudinal cliseries of the province of Jaén (south-east Spain) were used. Pollen emission data were recorded during a 3-year period (2007-2009). This research has revealed the effect of altitude on consecutive olive pollen season in the province of Jaén. The first pollen grains were detected in the olive growing areas located within the area of the Guadalquivir River, where are found the lowest levels of altitude into the province. A notable delay in the pollination season of the olive groves located at higher altitudes was observed. Geographical fluctuations on both daily pollen concentrations and number of critical days were also detected. Accumulated variables of temperature and precipitation since the start of the pre-flowering period have been shown to be two of the main factors affecting olive pollen levels.

There is also the concern that GM crops may affect pollinators and the pollination services they provide. Despite the growing commercial interest of GM tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), gene flow has been assessed only sparsely in tomato. To evaluate the likelihood of gene flow from GM tomato plants to sexually compatible plants, and to assess whether bumblebee activity is affected by GM tomato, three experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions, using a Bt-tomato expressing the insecticidal Cry3Bb1 protein as model system: (a) artificial crosses between a GM tomato line, two wild tomato relatives (Solanum hirsutum and Solanum nigrum) and a non-GM tomato variety; (b) bumblebee-mediated crosses between GM and non-GM tomato plants and (c) visual observations of bumblebees' feeding behaviour. No hybrids were obtained between the GM tomato line and S. hirsutum and S. nigrum. In an experimental design where non-GM receptor plants outnumbered GM plants by approximately 3:1, the bumblebee-mediated cross-fertilisation rate between GM and non-GM tomato plants was measured at 4.3 Â± 5.47%. No significant differences in feeding behaviour of bumblebees foraging on GM and non-GM tomato plants were observed. Therefore, we conclude that: (a) the probability of transgene introgression between the GM tomato line used in this study and its wild relatives S. hirsutum and S. nigrum is negligible; (b) bumblebee activity can mediate cross-fertilisation between GM and non-GM tomato and (3) the Cry3Bb1-expressing tomato line tested does not adversely affect the feeding behaviour of bumblebees. © 2012 The Authors.

Here, we investigate phenotypic and genetic differentiation in one of the few flowering plants that thrives in both geothermal and non-thermal soils in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Yellow monkeyflowers (Mimulus guttatus) growing at two geothermal (""thermal"") sites in YNP were distinct in growth form and phenology from paired populations growing nearby (&lt;500 m distant) in non-thermal soils. In simulated thermal and non-thermal environments, thermal plants remained significantly divergent from non-thermal plants in vegetative, floral, mating system, and phenological traits. Plants from both thermal populations flowered closer to the ground, allocated relatively more to sexual reproduction, were more likely to initiate flowering under short daylengths, and made smaller flowers that could efficiently self-fertilize without pollinators. These shared differences are consistent with local adaptation to life in the ephemeral window for growth and reproduction created by winter and spring snowmelt on hot soils. In contrast, habitat type (thermal vs. non-thermal) explained little of the genetic variation at neutral markers. Instead, we found that one thermal population (Agrostis Headquarters; AHQ-T) was strongly differentiated from all other populations (all FST &gt; 0. 34), which were only weakly differentiated from each other (all FST &lt; 0. 07). Phenotypic differentiation of thermal M. guttatus, but little population genetic evidence of long-term ecotypic divergence, encourages further investigations of the potential for fine-scale adaptation and reproductive isolation across the geothermal gradient in Yellowstone. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Ecotype; Life-history evolution; Mating system evolution; Mimulus guttatus; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865610315

The latter may be glabrous (epithelial elaiophores) or hirsute (trichomal elaiophores). Although the detailed anatomy and ultrastructure of epithelial elaiophores have been studied for a number of genera, such as Oncidium Sw., Gomesa R. Br. and Trichocentrum Poepp. & Endl., hitherto, trichomal elaiophores have been investigated only for a single species of Oncidiinae, Ornithocephalus ciliatus Lindl. Furthermore, this is the only representative of the Ornithocephalus clade to be investigated to date. Here, an examination is made of the elaiophore anatomy and ultrastructure of a further four species currently assigned to this clade (Ornithocephalus gladiatus Hook., Phymatidium falcifolium Lindl., Zygostates grandiflora (Lindl.) Mansf. and Zygostates lunata Lindl.) and the results compared with those obtained for other Oncidiinae.MethodsElaiophore structure was examined for all species at three stages of flower development: closed bud, first day of anthesis and final stage of anthesis, using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and histochemistry.Key ResultsElaiophores of O. gladiatus occur upon the lateral lobes of the labellum and display characters intermediate between those of typical epithelial and trichomal elaiophores, in that they are largely glabrous, consisting mainly of cuboidal epidermal cells, but bear short, unicellular hairs proximally. By contrast, the elaiophores of all the other species investigated occur on the callus and are of the trichomal type. In P. falcifolium, these unicellular hairs are capitate. In all species, oil secretion commenced at the closed floral bud stage. Ultrastructurally, the mainly trichomal elaiophores of the four representatives of the Ornithocephalus clade closely resembled the epithelial elaiophores of other Oncidiinae, in that their cells displayed an organelle complement typical of lipid-secreting cells. However, in some taxa, a number of noteworthy characters were present. For example, the elaiophore cuticle of O. gladiatus and P. falcifolium was bi-layered, the outer layer being lamellate, the inner reticulate. The cuticle of Z. grandiflora and Z. lunata was also lamellate, but here, a reticulate layer was absent. Accumulation of secreted oil resulted in the localized distension of the cuticle. Cuticular cracks and pores, however, were absent from all species. The walls of the secretory cells of Z. grandiflora were also atypical in that they had short protuberances or ingrowths, and contained cavities which are thought to be involved in the secretory process.ConclusionsOf the species investigated, most displayed similar anatomical organization, their trichomal elaiophores occurring on the labellar callus. They, thus, differ from many other members of the Oncidiinae, where epithelial elaiophores are found either on the callus, or on the lateral lobes of the labellum. However, ultrastructurally, all elaiophores, whether those of representatives of the Ornithocephalus clade, or those of other oil-secreting Oncidiinae, possessed a similar complement of organelles, regardless of whether the elaiophores were trichomal or epithelial. In view of the latter, and the similar chemical composition of oils derived from all Oncidiinae investigated to date, it is probable that position and type of elaiophore, and possibly the structure of the overlying cuticle, play an important role in pollinator selection in these oil-secreting orchids. © 2012 The Author.",Anatomy; elaiophore; histochemistry; lipid secretion; micromorphology; oil glands; Oncidiinae; trichome; ultrastructure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865452180

In S-RNase-based self-incompatibility (SI), incompatible pollen tubes are inhibited in the style. Consequently, research efforts have focused on the alterations of pollen F-actin cytoskeleton during the SI response. However, so far, these studies were carried out in in vitro-grown pollen tubes. This study aimed to assess the timing of in vivo changes of pollen F-actin cytoskeleton taking place after compatible and incompatible pollinations in Nicotiana alata. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the in vivo F-actin alterations occurring during pollen rejection in the S-RNase-based SI system.MethodsThe F-actin cytoskeleton and the vacuolar endomembrane system were fluorescently labelled in compatibly and incompatibly pollinated pistils at different times after pollination. The alterations induced by the SI reaction in pollen tubes were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy.Key ResultsEarly after pollination, about 70 of both compatible and incompatible pollen tubes showed an organized pattern of F-actin cables along the main axis of the cell. While in compatible pollinations this percentage was unchanged until pollen tubes reached the ovary, pollen tubes of incompatible pollinations underwent gradual and progressive F-actin disorganization. Colocalization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and the vacuolar endomembrane system, where S-RNases are compartmentalized, revealed that by day 6 after incompatible pollination, when the pollen-tube growth was already arrested, about 80 of pollen tubes showed disrupted F-actin but a similar percentage had intact vacuolar compartments.ConclusionsThe results indicate that during the SI response in Nicotiana, disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton precedes vacuolar membrane breakdown. Thus, incompatible pollen tubes undergo a sequential disorganization process of major subcellular structures. Results also suggest that the large pool of S-RNases released from vacuoles acts late in pollen rejection, after significant subcellular changes in incompatible pollen tubes. © 2012 The Author.",Confocal microscopy; F-actin cytoskeleton; Nicotiana alata; pollen tube; S-RNase; self-incompatibility; vacuolar system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865458285

Selection path analysis showed that both optical and fragrance traits influenced total seed production, and effects occurred both via fruit and seed set and via predator avoidance. In one case the same trait, inflorescence height, influenced total seed production both positively and negatively through effects on different components of fitness.

In the laboratory setting, florivores also preferred unmanipulated hermaphrodites versus unmanipulated females. Systematic evaluation of hermaphrodite traits, such as corolla size, anther presence, and corolla color, revealed that corolla diameter was the main determinant of florivore preference in this system.

Although many plants can compensate for herbivore damage, and some even overcompensate, we cannot yet generalize about the conditions that promote a positive response to damage. Here, we asked how abiotic resources (i.e. plant nutrient status) coupled with biotic interactions - i.e. subsequent interactions with pollinators, seed predators and nectar robbing bumble bees - affect the compensatory ability of Ipomopsis aggregata, a monocarpic herb that has been the subject of much previous debate. We hypothesized that compensation to herbivore damage in I. aggregata (Polemoniaceae) would depend first on plants having an ample supply of resources and, second, on the outcome of subsequent interactions with mutualist pollinators and enemy pre-dispersal seed predators and nectar robbing bumble bees. We used a fully-factorial experiment in which plants were watered, fertilized or left as unmanipulated controls, crossed with clipping to simulate herbivore damage to the apical meristem. Resource addition enhanced both male and female components of fitness, but resource enhancement did not provide the means for plants to fully compensate for simulated herbivory. Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences, but at the expense of a delay in flowering and fewer total flowers. Clipping significantly reduced losses to dipteran pre-dispersal seed predators by delaying flowering time, but early flowering plants produced higher numbers of seeds despite incurring higher rates of predation. Clipped plants incurred a higher risk to nectar robbers in one of two years. Overall, clipped plants suffered severe reductions (a nearly 50% reduction in total seed set) in female success, but clipping combined with nutrient addition enhanced male function through increases in per-flower pollen production. However, because clipped plants produced significantly fewer flowers than unclipped plants, whole-plant pollen production was significantly reduced by clipping. Pollinator visitation and nectar robbing were variable between clipping treatments and between years and (nectar robbing) among sites. Our results demonstrate that the variability in plant response to herbivory can, at least in part, be driven by plant interactions with mutualists and enemies. Thus, accounting for such interactions and their variability is important to fully understanding plant compensation for herbivore damage and will likely go far to explain variation in plant response that appears to be independent of resources. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865557455

However, the mechanisms and regulation of CK activity have not been well investigated. This study analysed CK concentrations and expression of genes involved in CK metabolism in developing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ovaries. The concentrations of CK ribosides and isopentenyladenine and the transcript levels of the CK biosynthetic genes SlIPT3, SlIPT4, SlLOG6, and SlLOG8 were high at anthesis and decreased immediately afterward. In contrast, trans-zeatin concentration and the transcript levels of the CK biosynthetic genes SlIPT1, SlIPT2, SlCYP735A1, SlCYP735A2, and SlLOG2 increased after anthesis. The expression of type-A response regulator genes was high in tomato ovaries from pre-anthesis to early post-anthesis stages. These results suggest that the CK signal transduction pathway is active in the cell division phase of fruit development. This study also investigated the effect of CK application on fruit set and development. Application of a synthetic CK, N-(2-chloro-pyridin-4-yl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU), to unpollinated tomato ovaries induced parthenocarpic fruit development. The CPPU-induced parthenocarpic fruits were smaller than pollinated fruits, because of reduction of pericarp cell size rather than reduced cell number. Thus, CPPU-induced parthenocarpy was attributable to the promotion of cell division, not cell expansion. Overall, the results provide evidence that CKs are involved in cell division during development of tomato fruit. © 2012 The Author.",CPPU; cytokinin; fruit development; Micro-Tom; parthenocarpy; tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866704917

When Orii's flying-fox fed on flowers of M. macrocarpa, it pushed its nose to the basal portion of the flowers to feed on nectar. This caused the hard petals of flowers to explode and consequently opened the carina. When a flying-fox's face pointed in the same direction as a flower, there was a significantly higher explosive opening rate compared with approaches from the side or the opposite direction (X 2 test; P &lt; 0.001). In total, in the captive setting, 32.2% of the flowers exhibited explosive opening. During such events, stamens with pollen and pistils emerged and attached to the throat and forehead of the flying-fox.

These observations demonstrate that the Orii's flying-fox is the only explosive opener and the primary pollinator of this flower. On the other hand, flying-foxes sometimes damaged flowers.

The status of species of Strelitzia were evaluated in terms of the phylogenetic species concept. Relationships among the genera remain equivocal with two hypotheses emerging: (i) Strelitzia sister to a clade comprising Ravenala and Phenakospermum when indels are included, or (ii) Ravenala sister to the remainder of the Strelitziaceae when indels are excluded in/from the combined molecular and 'total evidence' analyses. Within Strelitzia, S. nicolai is sister to the rest of the genus, with S. alba sister to S. caudata. Strelitzia reginae is shown to be paraphyletic as S. juncea is nested within it, but more sampling at the population level is needed to confirm the taxonomic status of S. juncea. The highly localized and endangered Strelitzia alba is confirmed as a distinct species, as are S. caudata and S. nicolai, despite few morphological differences. Evolutionary trends are linked to changes in habitat and coevolution with pollinators. Climate change in southern Africa is thought to have restricted Strelitzia nicolai (or its ancestor) to the eastern coastal region, with subsequent allopatric speciation of S. alba and S. caudata, and relatively recent parapatric divergence of S. juncea from S. reginae. © Copyright 2012 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.",Biogeography; molecular phylogenetics; morphology; pollination; Strelitzia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863915940

Various containment levels are requested by national regulations to minimize GM pollen escape. We tested the amount of pollen escaping from a standard greenhouse, which can be used for EU containment classes 1 and 2. More specifically, we investigated the hypothesis whether pollen escape could be minimized by insect-proof netting in front of the roof windows, since the turbulent airflow around the mesh wiring could avoid pollen from escaping. We studied the pollen flow out of greenhouses with and without insect netting of two non-transgenic crops, Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and Corn (Zea Mays). Pollen flow was assessed with Rotorod® pollen samplers positioned inside and outside the greenhouse' roof windows. A significant proportion of airborne pollen inside the greenhouse leaves through roof windows. Moreover, the lighter pollen of Lolium escaped more readily than the heavier pollen of Maize. In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify any reduction in pollen flow with insect netting in front of open windows, even under induced airflow conditions. We conclude that insect netting, often present by default in greenhouses, is not effective in preventing pollen escape from greenhouses of wind-pollinated plants for containment classes 1 or 2. Further research would be needed to investigate whether other alternative strategies, including biotic ones, are more effective. © 2011 The Author(s).",Genetically modified plants; Greenhouse; Hybridization; Pollen escape; Regulation; Turbulence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867726386

We monitored monthly the flowering and fruiting of Avicennia schaueriana, Conocarpus erectus, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle, the only species composing this mangrove community. We applied circular statistics to detect seasonal trends, null models to test for aggregated, staggered or random flowering patterns, performed correlations between phenophases and climate, and calculated intra-specific phenological synchrony. Each species presented a different flowering pattern, from brief annual to continuous and from regular to irregular, resulting in a bimodal pattern at community level. Fruiting was annual or continuous and seasonally unimodal at community level. Precipitation showed the strongest correlation with reproduction for all species, except L. racemosa. Flowering was randomly distributed among species sharing pollinators and each species presented high intra-specific synchrony. The studied mangrove showed a diversity of flowering patterns despite the low number of species. Annual to sub-annual sequential flowering were prevalent, sustaining the pollinators of species all the year long, while the wind-pollinated species flowered continuously. We provide strong evidence that daylength, rainfall and temperature are driving the flowering and fruiting rhythm of these mangrove species. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Avicennia schaueriana; Conocarpus erectus; Flowering and fruiting pattern; Laguncularia racemosa; Pollination; Rhizophora mangle,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865990733

Microsporophylls are scale leaves (smaller leaves with morphology similar to that of Glossopteris leaves) that bear clusters of sporangia at the end of stalks attached to the petiole of the sporophyll. Late Permian permineralized specimens of Eretmonia from the central Transantarctic Mountains in Antarctica reveal the first anatomical information of the genus. Numerous veins run the length of the petiole and alternate with large canals/air spaces; the veins and canals are separated by increasing amounts of parenchyma. The ground tissue of the leaves is composed of isodiametric parenchyma of varying diameters. Beneath the epidermis is a hypodermis two to three layers thick. Pollen sac walls are a single layer thick with a tapered apex and bulbous base. The simplicity of the bisaccate pollen grains does not suggest a specialized form of pollination but rather that the glossopterids were wind pollinated. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

The biologic mechanisms that generate fine-scale spatial genetic structure are not fully understood. We studied fine-scale spatial genetic structure in ten coexisting dipterocarp tree species in a Bornean rain forest using microsatellite markers. Six of the ten species showed statistically significant fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was stronger at smaller spatial scales (? 100 m) than at larger spatial scales (> 100 m) for each species. Multiple regression analysis suggested that seed dispersal distance was important at the smaller spatial scale. At the larger scale (> 100 m) and over the entire sample range (0-1000 m), pollinators and spatial distribution of adult trees were more important determinants of fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Fine-scale spatial genetic structure was stronger in species pollinated by less mobile small beetles than in species pollinated by the more mobile giant honeybee (Apis dorsata). It was also stronger in species where adult tree distributions were more clumped. The hypothesized mechanisms underlying the negative correlation between clump size and fine-scale spatial genetic structure were a large overlap among seed shadows and genetic drift within clumped species. © 2011 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2011 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Dipterocarpaceae; Genetic diversity; Microsatellite; Pollinator; Seed dispersal; Spatial distribution pattern; Tropical rain forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860520116

For this reason, a 7-day recording volumetric spore trap of the Hirst design was used for pollen monitoring between January 2006 and December 2007 in Kastamonu, Turkey. A total of 293,427 pollen grains belonging to 51 taxa were recorded during the study period. In the 2 years of study, the period March-August was identified as the main pollination season for Kastamonu. The highest monthly pollen counts were observed in May in both years. Six taxa made up 86.5% of the total amount of pollen recorded in the atmosphere of Kastamonu. These were as follows: Pinaceae (42.9%), Cupressaceae (20.6%), Poaceae (9.7%), Quercus (5.5%) Betula (5.3%) and Carpinus (2.6%). Four of these are considered to be highly allergenic (Betula, Carpinus, Cupressaceae and Poaceae). There were also a greater percentage of highly allergenic taxa found within the city, including Betula pendula that is not part of the local flora. This shows that through urban planting, the public and municipalities can unconsciously create a high risk for allergy sufferers. Daily average pollen counts from the six most frequently recorded pollen types were entered into Spearman's correlation analysis with meteorological data. Mean daily temperature, relative humidity, daily rainfall and wind speed were found to significantly (p < 0.05) affect atmospheric pollen concentrations, but the relationships between pollen concentrations and meteorological variables can vary and so there is a need for more local studies of this nature. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aerobiology; Allergy; Correlation analysis; Pollen calendar; Vegetation survey,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871035749

Modules are distinct subsets of species interacting strongly with each other, but sparsely with species outside the subset. Using a series of temporal cumulative networks, we investigated the stability of modular organization of pollination networks to temporal scaling. To test for modularity, we used the method 'functional cartography by simulated annealing' (Guimerà and Amaral, 2005a,b), a stochastic optimization technique. Modules are detected, and species classified into three types of topological roles in a network, based on patterns of within and between-module links: Hubs are highly connected species; peripherals interact with few species, mainly within their own module; and connectors have few interactions, too, but link across modules. We observed interactions between all flowering plants and flower-visiting insect species throughout the flowering season at three dry heathland sites in Denmark. For each site, we constructed cumulative networks every 0.5 months, resulting in series of 10-12 networks per site. Numbers of interactions, and plant and insect species accumulated throughout the period, while level of modularity (M) and number of modules (N M) was largely invariant to temporal scaling. The proportions of hub, peripheral and connector species were unaffected by scaling of the network. The networks had a multi-star structure, consisting of modules each formed around one or two hubs. These hub species encompassed a small number of plant species, many of which acted as hubs at several study sites and throughout most of their flowering season. Thus, these plants become of key importance in maintaining the structure of their pollination network. We conclude that the modular structure of heathland pollination networks is stable to temporal scaling, a pattern repeatedly found at three sites of similar habitat. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Compartmentalization; Ecological modules; Mutualistic webs; Pollination network; Robustness of network structural properties,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864313261

The use of an appropriate 'link weight' is especially important if we want to move toward a more functional perspective in ecological network studies. Here, we evaluated how the use of five different link weights, starting with the simplest one - the number of visits - and including progressively information on total census time, number of flowers observed, number of flowers visited and total flower abundance of each species in a plant community, influences widely used descriptors of network structure. We analyzed different network-level properties: weighted nestedness, flower-visitor generality, plant generality, complementary specialization H 2', interaction evenness and interaction diversity, as well as species-level parameters: specialization index d' and strength. We built two quantitative flower-visitation networks from two different communities sampled during two consecutive years, in which we also measured independently flower abundance of each plant species. Results showed that the type of link weight used can significantly alter network structure. A clear trend toward more specialized interactions (decreased flower-visitor generality, increased H 2' and d'), higher heterogeneity in the frequency of interactions (lower evenness and diversity of interactions) and higher weighted nestedness was found as interaction weight gained in complexity. However, standardizing only for total censusing time had only weak effects on network parameters. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the most appropriate link weight for each ecological network study, emphasizing that comparisons across networks that use different weights might lead to flawed results and thus to ecological misinterpretations of network structures. © 2012 Gesellschaft far kologie.",Flower abundance; Interaction strength; Network parameters; Plant-pollinator interactions; Quantitative networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867692695

A major complication of investigating ethylene-induced regulation of developmental processes is ethylene's biphasic mode of action. To investigate ethylene's actions and interactions we used a 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase transgenic canola line. This line evolves significantly less ethylene from its siliques and seeds, relative to plants from a wild type (WT) background. Plants of the transgenic line also had smaller siliques which were associated with reductions in both seed size and seed number. Application of ethephon, a compound that produces ethylene, to plants of the transgenic line restored the WT phenotype for both siliques and seeds. Application of the same dose of ethephon to WT plants diminished both silique and seed development, showing ethylene's biphasic effect and effectively producing the ACC deaminase transgenic phenotype. There were significant decreases in endogenous concentrations of GA1 and GA4 and also of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), between WT seeds and seedless siliques and seeds and siliques from the transgenic line plants. These differences were emphasized during early stages (10-20 days after pollination) of seed and silique development. The above results strongly suggest that ethylene interacts with other endogenous plant hormones in regulating silique and seed development and growth in WT lines of canola. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Abscisic acid; Auxin; Canola; Ethylene; Gibberellins; Seed; Silique,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863833266

An important genus in the greenhouse and nursery industry, Phlox has a long history of cultivation in gardens because of showy flowers and variable habit. Although numerous cultivars are available in the trade, the potential for improvement of existing forms as well as for novel traits and habits is enormous. Because of its economic importance and potential for improvement, Phlox has been designated as a priority genus for the Ornamental Plant Germplasm Center in Columbus, Ohio, USA. A germplasm collection has been developed that now consists of more than 200 accessions and that is continuing to expand; this collection includes wild species as well as cultivated forms and is being characterized and evaluated for various traits, but of particular interest is the potential for genetic exchange between the various species of Phlox. Studies in the 1960s that focused on ecological adaptation and speciation in the genus suggest that barriers to interspecific exchange of genes may be weak, but the boundaries have not been delineated. We have been examining the potential for improvement of horticultural traits by interspecific hybridization and have been attempting a series of crosses mainly between the 20 or so species native to the eastern USA. Over 5000 pollinations comprising more than 300 parental combinations have been completed thus far. We have noted that crosses between long- and short-styled taxa fail to produce seeds; that crosses between species within subsections produce equivalent numbers of capsules and seeds as pollinations within species; and that some crosses are only possible in one direction. In crosses between Phlox paniculata and P. carolina, only the former can function as the female parent. Attempts at recreating the putative naturally occurring hybrids Phlox ×rugelii and Phlox ×glutinosa suggest that these may indeed be true hybrids as we have been able to produce seeds on both parental taxa.

Zygotic and somatic embryos at different developmental stages were sampled for morphological and hormonal analysis. Both embryo types showed substantial asymmetry in hormone levels. Zygotic embryos displayed a conspicuous peak of IAA in early developmental stages. The results outlined the hormonal variations occurring during zygotic and somatic embryogenesis regarding the timing, nature and hormonal status involved in both processes. The short transient pulse of IAA observed on the 3rd day in culture was suggested to be involved with the signaling for the induction of somatic embryogenesis. Fertilized ovule development was associated with increased IAA levels 21-24 days after pollination, followed by a sharp decrease in the cotyledonary stage, both in zygotic and somatic embryos. There was a prominent increase in ABA levels in cultures which generated ISE 24-30 days after pollination, a period that corresponds to the heart and torpedo stages. The levels of total CKs (Z, [9R]Z, iP and [9R]iP) were also always higher in zygotic than in somatic embryogenesis. While zygotic embryogenesis was dominated by the presence of zeatin, the somatic process, contrarily, was characterized by a large variation of the other cytokinin forms and amounts studied. The above results, when taken together, could be related to the previously observed high frequency formation of anomalous somatic embryos formed in A. sellowiana, as well as to their low germination ability. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Acca sellowiana; Hormone; Somatic embryogenesis; Zygotic embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865435197

Autònoma de Barcelona, ES-08193 Bellaterra, Spain","Pollinators, like most other animals, often face a tradeoff between increasing food uptake and minimising predation. An earlier model suggests that social bees should be more likely than solitary bees to adopt riskier foraging strategies in order to increase food uptake. In this paper, we extend this model by studying the effect of body size, in addition to sociality, on the predation-intake rate tradeoff. When, following standard practice, we express the foraging strategies in terms of mortality probability and net food uptake, we find that body size should have no effect on the foraging strategies of solitary bees. Social bees, on the other hand, should change their foraging preferences according to their size. Small social bees should tend to maximise food uptake, and large social bees to minimise mortality rate. Mortality, however, is the product of two terms: the probability of suffering an attack and the probability of succumbing to it. Noting that larger bees are less susceptible to succumb to a predation attempt than smaller bees, model predictions change when foraging strategies are expressed in terms of exposure to predators. Following this second approach, exposure to predators should increase monotonically with body size in solitary bees. In social bees it should reach a minimum for medium-sized bees. We conclude that both bee body size and sociality should be considered when studying the effect of predators on resource use. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865558244

Here we propose that increased herkogamy may also influence another important aspect of plant mating: the diversity of pollen donors siring seeds within fruits. We test this hypothesis in Narcissus longispathus, a wild daffodil species with extensive variation in anther-stigma separation. To study the morphological basis of variation in herkogamy, floral measurements were undertaken in 16 populations of N. longispathus. We then quantified multilocus outcrossing rates and the correlation of outcrossed paternity in three of these populations sampled over several years. Mating system estimates were calculated for each population and year, and also separately for groups of plants that differed markedly in herkogamy within each population and year. In N.longispathus herkogamy was much more variable than other floral traits, and was more closely related to style length than to anther position. Averaged across populations and years, plants with high herkogamy had similar outcrossing rates (0.683) to plants with intermediate (0.648) or low herkogamy (0.590). However, a significant linear trend was found for correlation of outcrossed paternity, which increased monotonically from high herkogamy (0.221), through intermediate herkogamy (0.303) to low herkogamy (0.463) plants. The diversity of pollen donors siring seeds of high herkogamy Narcissus flowers was thus consistently greater than the diversity of pollen donors siring seeds of low herkogamy flowers. Results of this study contribute to the emerging consensus that floral traits can simultaneously influence several aspects of plant mating system in complex ways, thus extending the traditional focus centred exclusively on patterns and relative importance of self- and cross-fertilisation. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Amaryllidaceae; Anther-stigma separation; Correlated paternity; Mixed-mating system; Multiple paternity; Outcrossing rate; Style length,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864781033

To extend our understanding of the multiple functions of Aux/IAAs further, the present study describes the functional characterization of Sl-IAA27, a member of the tomato Aux/IAA gene family. Sl-IAA27 displays a distinct behavior compared with most Aux/IAA genes regarding the regulation of its expression by auxin, and the Sl-IAA27-encoded protein harbors a unique motif of unknown function also present in Sl-IAA9 and remarkably conserved in monocot and dicot species. Tomato transgenic plants underexpressing the Sl-IAA27 gene revealed multiple phenotypes related to vegetative and reproductive growth. Silencing of Sl-IAA27 results in higher auxin sensitivity, altered root development and reduced Chl content in leaves. Both ovule and pollen display a dramatic loss of fertility in Sl-IAA27 down-regulated lines, and the internal anatomy of the flower and the fruit are modified, with an enlarged placenta in smaller fruits. In line with the reduced Chl content in Sl-IAA27 RNA interference (RNAi) leaves, genes involved in Chl synthesis display lower expression at the level of transcript accumulation. Even though Sl-IAA27 is closely related to Sl-IAA9 in terms of sequence homology and the encoded proteins share common structural features, the data indicate that the two genes regulate tomato fruit initiation and development in a distinct manner. © The Author 2012.

Our hypothesis is that high expression of pectin methylesterases (PMEs) increases Ca2+ bound to the cell wall, subsequently decreasing Ca2+ available for other cellular functions and thereby increasing fruit susceptibility to BER. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of PME expression, and amount of esterified pectins and Ca2+ bound to the cell wall on BER development in tomato fruit. Wild-type and PME-silenced tomato plants were grown in a greenhouse. At full bloom, flowers were pollinated and Ca2+ was no longer provided to the plants to induce BER. Our results show that suppressing expression of PMEs in tomato fruit reduced the amount of Ca 2+ bound to the cell wall, and also reduced fruit susceptibility to BER. Both the wild-type and PME-silenced fruit had similar total tissue, cytosolic and vacuolar Ca2+ concentrations, but wild-type fruit had lower water-soluble apoplastic Ca2+ content and higher membrane leakage, one of the first symptoms of BER.

As the second largest hybrid crop in the world, hybrid sunflowers are developed by using the PET1 cytoplasmic male sterility system that contributes to a 20 % yield advantage over the open-pollinated varieties. However, sunflower production in North America has recently been threatened by the evolution of new virulent pathotypes of sunflower rust caused by the fungus Puccinia helianthi Schwein. Rf ANN-1742, an 'HA 89' backcross restorer line derived from wild annual sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), was identified as resistant to the newly emerged rust races. The aim of this study was to elucidate the inheritance of rust resistance and male fertility restoration and identify the chromosome location of the underlying genes in Rf ANN-1742. Chi-squared analysis of the segregation of rust response and male fertility in F2 and F3 populations revealed that both traits are controlled by single dominant genes, and that the rust resistance gene is closely linked to the restorer gene in the coupling phase. The two genes were designated as R11 and Rf5, respectively. A set of 723 mapped SSR markers of sunflower was used to screen the polymorphism between HA 89 and the resistant plant. Bulked segregant analysis subsequently located R11 on linkage group (LG) 13 of sunflower. Based on the SSR analyses of 192 F2 individuals, R11 and Rf5 both mapped to the lower end of LG13 at a genetic distance of 1. 6 cM, and shared a common marker, ORS728, which was mapped 1. 3 cM proximal to Rf5 and 0. 3 cM distal to R11 (Rf5/ORS728/R11). Two additional SSRs were linked to Rf5 and R11: ORS995 was 4. 5 cM distal to Rf5 and ORS45 was 1. 0 cM proximal to R11. The advantage of such an introduced alien segment harboring two genes is its large phenotypic effect and simple inheritance, thereby facilitating their rapid deployment in sunflower breeding programs. Suppressed recombination was observed in LGs 2, 9, and 11 as it was evident that no recombination occurred in the introgressed regions of LGs 2, 9, and 11 detected by 5, 9, and 22 SSR markers, respectively. R11 is genetically independent from the rust R-genes R1, R2, and R5, but may be closely linked to the rust R-gene Radv derived from wild Helianthus argophyllus, forming a large rust R-gene cluster of Radv/R11/R4 in the lower end of LG13. The relationship of Rf5 with Rf1 is discussed based on the marker association analysis. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865609065

To explore this possibility, we compared dates of first arrival of Broad-tailed Hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus) to dates of flowering of plants they visit for nectar. Near the southern limit of the breeding range, neither hummingbird arrival nor first flowering dates have changed significantly over the past few decades. At a nearby migration stopover site, first flowering of a major food plant has advanced, but peak flowering has not. Near the northern limit of the breeding range, first and peak flowering of early-season food plants have shifted to earlier dates, resulting in a shorter interval between appearance of first hummingbirds and first flowers. If phenological shifts continue at current rates, hummingbirds will eventually arrive at northern breeding grounds after flowering begins, which could reduce their nesting success. These results support the prediction that migratory species may experience the greatest phenological mismatches at the poleward limits of their migration. A novel hypothesis based on these results posits that the poleward limit for some species may contract toward lower latitudes under continued warming. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Broad-tailed Hummingbird; Climate change; Ecological interactions; Flowering time; Latitude; Migration; Phenological shifts; Pollination; Reproductive success; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, Colorado (USA); Selasphorus platycercus; Synchrony",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866943422

A number of 14 maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines and 91 related crosses were evaluated over two years, 2008 and 2009, in a temperate-zone of Iran. The objectives of the study were to identify the best general and specific combiners, heterosis and type of gene actions responsible for agronomic traits. Except for grain yield and growing degree day to milky, significant general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability were observed for all traits. The Baker ratio for plant height (0.15), ear height (0.26), growing degree day to milky stage (0.04), and grain yield (0.002) showed the predominance of non-additive gene effects in the expression of these traits. The heterosis observed for grain yield, grain number, pollination period, ear and plant height was considerably higher than that observed for other traits. The correlations (r) of F1 means and SCA effects were positive and significantly higher than that of r (F1, mid-parents) and r (F1, heterosis) for all the traits except cob percent, growing degree days to silking, and physiological maturity.

Interspecific hybridisation is an approach to obtain new plants with desired features. However, hybridization between plant species is associated with many challenges to enable survival of the developing embryo. Here we present an optimised technique for embryo rescue via ovule isolation in selected intra- and interspecific Campanula hybrids. A frequent problem in embryo rescue is the malformation of the endosperm. To circumvent this, embryos were isolated and the optimal ovule isolation time and growth conditions were determined to increase embryo survival. Ovules were isolated one to four weeks after pollination and cultivated on a modified MS medium. When ovules were allowed to stay inside the ovary for 2-3 weeks the number of germinating embryos increased as compared to ovules isolated one week after pollination. Additionally, ovules isolated 2-3 weeks after pollination showed an increased embryo germination rate. Among the Campanula hybrids, produced here from both the intraspecific crosses within C. carpatica 'White' and the interspecific crosses between C. medium and C. formanekiana, the timing of ovule isolation time was critical. This study in Campanula supports that ovule isolation time is an important parameter in embryo rescue techniques affecting both the number of germinating embryos and the rate of their germination.",Embryo rescue; Interspecific hybridisation; Ovule culture; Regeneration; Tissue culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869993817

The recovery of triploid plants has proven to be the most promising approach to achieve this goal, since triploids have very low fertility, are generally seedless and do not induce seeds in other cultivars by cross pollination. Triploid plants can be recovered by 2x × 4x sexual hybridization. In this work, we present an effective methodology to recover triploid plants from 2x × 4x hybridizations based on in vitro embryo rescue, ploidy level analysis by flow cytometry and genetic origin of triploid plants. The pollen viability of diploid and tetraploid citrus genotypes was analyzed by comparing the pollen germination rate in vitro. The pollen viability of tetraploid (doubled-diploid) genotypes is generally reduced but sufficient for successful pollination. Triploid embryos were identified in normal and undeveloped seeds that did not germinate under greenhouse conditions. The influence of parents and environmental conditions on obtaining triploid plants was analyzed and a strong interaction was noted between the parents and environmental conditions. The parental effect on the length of the juvenile phase was also demonstrated through observations of a large number of progeny over the last 15 years. The juvenile phase length of the triploid hybrids obtained with 'Fortune' mandarin as female parent and tetraploid 'Orlando' tangelo as male parent was shorter than the juvenile phase obtained with a clementine as female parent and tetraploids of 'Nova', 'W. Leaf' and 'Pineapple' male parents.

Where there is a risk of hightemperature stress, then the choice of female parent may be important. This issue is particularly relevant to the production of full-sib families frommass-supplementary pollination where there may be opportunities for seed producers to manipulate the directionality of the crossing done in seed orchards. • Aims This study aimed to quantify the maternal versus paternal influence of seed sensitivity to high temperature stress during germination. • Methods A diallel crossing scheme involving four genotypes was used to test the relative importance of male and female genetic influences on the germination and development of E. globulus seed and their response to high temperature stress. Seed was germinated at optimum (25°C) and supra-optimal (32°C and 37°C) temperatures, and six traits describing the proportion and rate of seed germination and early seedling development were assessed. • Results Both paternal and maternal effects affected the germination response, arguing for at least some influence of the nuclear genotype of the embryo. However, the response to high temperature stress was more influenced by the maternal than paternal parent. • Conclusion Both the male and female genotype may affect various aspects of seed germination and early seedling development independent of seed size; however, some facets of the germination response will be mainly affected by the female parent. © INRA/Springer-Verlag France 2012.",Eucalyptus globulus; Forest tree; Genetic; Maternal; Paternal; Seed germination; Temperature stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865974366

Loss of PPR8522 from maize (Zea mays) confers an embryo-specific (emb) phenotype. The emb8522 mutation was isolated in an active Mutator (Mu) population and co-segregation analysis revealed that it was tightly linked to a MuDR insertion in the first exon of PPR8522. Independent evidence that disruption of PPR8522 caused the emb phenotype was provided by fine mapping to a region of 116kb containing no other gene than PPR8522 and complementation of the emb8522 mutant by a PPR8522 cDNA. The deduced PPR8522 amino acid sequence of 832 amino acids contains 10 PPR repeats and a chloroplast target peptide, the function of which was experimentally demonstrated by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Whereas mutant endosperm is apparently normal, mutant embryos deviate from normal development as early as 3 days after pollination, are reduced in size, exhibit more or less severe morphological aberrations depending on the genetic background, and generally do not germinate. The emb8522 mutation is the first to associate the loss of a PPR gene with an embryo-lethal phenotype in maize. Analyses of mutant plantlets generated by embryo-rescue experiments indicate that emb8522 also affects vegetative plant growth and chloroplast development. The loss of chloroplast transcription dependent on plastid-encoded RNA polymerase is the likely cause for the lack of an organized thylakoid network and an albino, seedling-lethal phenotype. © 2012 The Author(s).",chloroplast; embryogenesis; Mutator; pentatricopeptide repeat; plastid-encoded RNA polymerase; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867569533

This study examined the visitation rates and foraging patterns of eight taxonomic groups of bees that are common to California poppies, Eschscholzia californica, in both landscape types. Bee occurrence was documented in relation to floral resource characteristics (patch area, poppy coverage, and poppy density), local landscape characteristics (distance to the wildland-urban interface, distance to riparian areas, distance to green space, and land use), and regional landscape context (urban versus wildland). Similar abundance and richness measures were recorded at both urban and wildland poppy patches, but community composition varied in each landscape. Bumble bees were more abundant at poppies in the wildland whereas species in the family Halictidae (sweat bees) were more abundant at poppies within the urban landscape. Resource patch size and density consistently correlated with increased bee presence for all bee types foraging in the wildland. Individual patterns of occurrence in the urban landscape were somewhat divergent; the foraging dynamics of larger bodied-bees (Bombus vosnesenskii and Megachile species) correlated significantly with resource patch size and density, whereas smaller-bodied bees (family Halictidae and Andrena species) were influenced by landscape characteristics such as distance to the wildland-urban interface and distance to riparian areas. In summary, the surrounding landscape had an influence on community composition, but the magnitude of the floral resource present at a site and factors relating to foraging energetics were dominant drivers of local occurrence. These results suggest that management strategies that provide dense and abundant floral resources should be successful in attracting bees, irrespective of their location within the urban matrix. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Bees; California poppy; Food resource usage; Foraging patterns; Pollinators; Wildland-urban landscape comparison,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865592787

There are a number of advantages in using haploidy technology in both practical application (varietal development, mutagenesis, transformation) and basic research (genomics, biochemical, and physiological studies). Haploid plants are commonly produced using one of four methods: culture of anthers or microspores (androgenesis), culture of unfertilized ovules (gynogenesis), interspecific or intergeneric crosses followed by chromosome elimination, and by pollination with irradiated pollen. The most efficient method depends on the species. In many species, the culture of isolated microspores or anthers is the most frequently used method of haploid production. With this method, every microspore is potentially capable of regenerating into a viable embryo and each plant would therefore represent the variation which exists in the population of microspores. Plant regeneration occurs either by direct embryogenesis or through callus formation followed by embryogenesis or organogenesis. There are a number of factors influencing embryogenesis from anther/microspores or ovaries/ovules including genotype, donor plant growth conditions, stage of explant development, composition of the culture medium, and environmental conditions during culture. The frequency of embryo production will depend on whether or not these conditions are optimal and varies depending on the species. Compared to some agronomic species, there has been very little work on doubled haploidy in ornamental species despite the potential benefits.",Androgenesis; Gynogenesis; Microspore embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870011563

Nypa comprises its own monotypic subfamily in Arecaceae, with high or moderate support of its sister position to other palms excluding Calamoideae or even sister to all other palms including Calamoideae. Apocarpous Nypa fruits develop from a spherical female partial inflorescence into large, tightly packed capitate infructescences. Important anatomical features of Nypa fruits (drupes of the Rhapis type) are the single-layered exocarp and endocarp, while the mesocarp is thick and multilayered; its differentiation into a hypodermis and three topographic layers is initiated in the gynoecium shortly after pollination. The outer mesocarp layer transforms into complex aerenchyma at late developmental stages, the massive stone constitutes the second mesocarp layer, and the innermost multilayered parenchymatous mesocarp layer is highly compressed and partly obliterated in mature fruit as a result of seed growth. The mode of pericarp development in Nypa is nearly identical in most aspects to those described for paracarpous fruits of Eugeissona (Calamoideae) and syncarpous fruits of all genera of Borasseae (Coryphoideae). Carpological features support the close relationship of Nypoideae, Calamoideae (Eugeissona), and Coryphoideae (Borasseae).

To evaluate the role of the GA biosynthetic enzyme GA 20-oxidase (GA20ox) in that process, the citrus gene CcGA20ox1 was overexpressed in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv Micro-Tom. The transformed plants were taller, had non-serrated leaves, and some flowers displayed a protruding stigma due to a longer style, thus preventing self-pollination, similar to GA 3-treated plants. Flowering was delayed compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Both yield and number of fruits per plant, some of them seedless, were higher in the transgenic plants. The Brix index value of fruit juice was also higher due to elevated citric acid content, but not glucose or fructose content. When emasculated, 14-30% of ovaries from transgenic flowers developed parthenocarpically, whereas no parthenocarpy was found in emasculated WT flowers. The presence of early-13-hydroxylation and non-13-hydroxylation GA pathways was demonstrated in the shoot and fruit of Micro-Tom, as well as in two tall tomato cultivars (Ailsa Craig and UC-82). The transgenic plants had altered GA profiles containing higher concentrations of GA4, from the non-13-hydroxylation pathway, which is generally a minor active GA in tomato. The effect of GA4 application in enhancing stem growth and parthenocarpic fruit development was proportional to dose, with the same activity as GA1. The results support the contention that GA20ox overexpression diverts GA metabolism from the early-13-hydroxylation pathway to the non-13-hydroxylation pathway. This led to enhanced GA4 synthesis and higher yield, although the increase in GA4 content in the ovary was not sufficient to induce full parthenocarpy. © 2012 The Authors.",Fruit set; gibberellin (GA); gibberellin 20-oxidase; Micro-Tom; parthenocarpy; tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867515499

The atmospheric pollen season of Echium was observed in late spring (May and June), showing also high levels in midday hours. However, an anomalous flowering period was detected in late autumn and early winter between years 2006 and 2007 and it could be connected with high daily temperature registered in October 2006 in comparison with the 2000-2005 period and its particular increasing tendency similar to those detected in the preceding month of the late spring flowering period. Statistical analysis by means of the Spearman's non-parametrical test and linear regression analysis reflected a positive correlation with temperature and a trend to increase in daily temperature during late October 2006 and April in 2000-2005 with similar indexes (R 2 = 0.50, R 2 = 0.58, respectively).

Several studies have shown the importance of nectar sugars for female butterfly fecundity, whereas to date little attention has been paid to the effect of nectar sugars on male butterfly reproduction. Clear evidence for an effect of nectar sugars on male realized reproductive success is still missing. In this study, we fed male Coenonympha pamphilus butterflies nectar mimics with low (5%), medium (20%) or high (30%) total sugar concentrations with a sucrose:glucose:fructose ratio of 2.7:1.1:1. Sugar solutions were made mimicking Knautia arvensis, an essential nectar plant for C. pamphilus and many other European butterflies. Realized male reproductive success for each treatment was measured indirectly via nuptial gifts, by recording reproductive parameters and by characterizing time patterns over the oviposition period of their female partner. Male butterflies fed high-concentrated nectar sugars had a longer lifespan than males fed low-concentrated nectar sugars. In contrast, offspring of males fed medium-concentrated nectar sugars had a higher hatching mass than progeny of males fed low-concentrated nectar sugars, indicating a tradeoff between somatic maintenance and reproduction in the use of nectar sugars. Thus, allocation patterns of nectar sugars differed according to sugar concentrations in adult food. The method used in this experiment took into account the indispensable role of female butterflies in passing male nutrients to offspring. With this comprehensive approach, we can show the general importance of nectar sugars for male butterfly fitness and support previous findings suggesting a coevolutionary process between butterflies and flowers dependent on butterfly pollination. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865555975

The species is considered allogamous due to wind facilitated cross-pollination and strong genetic self-incompatibility. Plants typically produce few or no seed when self-fertilized. No attempt has been made to identify selfing-compatible plants that would potentially enable developing inbred lines. Here, using a set of 12 simple sequence repeat-based molecular markers, we identified one lowland plant, 'NL94 LYE 16 × 13' (NL94), demonstrating high self-compatibility. A large potted plant of NL94 and a similar size plant of 'SL93 7 × 15' were grown in a growth chamber for the purpose of producing a hybrid full-sib mapping population. Marker analyses of 456 progeny from the NL94 plant indicated that 279 (61. 2%) and 177 (38. 8%) resulted from self- and cross-fertilization, respectively. SSR marker segregation analyses in both the selfed and hybrid progeny populations conclusively indicated disomic inheritance in the two switchgrass parents. Disomic inheritance of switchgrass is significant to the development of switchgrass inbreds as homozygosity is approached much faster via inbreeding under disomic vs. tetrasomic inheritance. Self-compatibility in switchgrass potentially enables the development of inbred lines for use in producing heterotic F1 hybrid cultivars. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Biomass; Disomic inheritance; Inbred line; Self-compatibility; Simple sequence repeat (SSR); Switchgrass,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865562555

The objective of this study was to determine heterotic orientation of 18 advanced maize inbred lines towards popular open pollinated synthetic populations ZM523 and Suwan-1 under the prevalence of DM. The 36 top crosses, four hybrid check varieties and two testers, ZM523 (Z) and Suwan-1 (S) were evaluated in a 6 × 7 ?-lattice design with two replications across three environments. General combining ability effects were significant (P ? 0. 05) for DM resistance and grain yield, suggesting that genes with additive effects were important in controlling the traits. Specific combining ability (SCA) effects were not significant for DM suggesting small influence of DM resistance by the genes with non-additive effects; but SCA effects were significant for grain yield, indicating that non-additive gene effects played a significant role in governing the grain yield. Based on the SCA data, ten lines were grouped with Suwan-1 and eight lines with ZM523. Using the heterosis data, the lines were fitted into three groups that were designated as S, Z and SZ orientation. The lines ML2, ML30 and ML42, which displayed positive heterosis with both testers for grain yield, were allocated to the SZ-group. The lines ML8, ML10, ML25, ML45, and ML48 exhibited positive heterosis with Suwan-1 and were therefore, classified in the Z-group, and line ML19 that showed positive heterosis with ZM523 was fitted in the S-group. The remaining eight lines did not show any significant and positive heterosis with both testers hence they could not be classified based on heterosis data, suggesting that hybrid breeding efficiency could be improved by expanding the number of testers. Line ML42 displayed the highest level of heterosis with both Suwan-1 (32 %) and ZM523 (29 %) and outperformed all the standard check varieties qualifying it as a potential candidate for further testing. Generally, there was consistency of heterotic grouping of the lines using SCA and heterosis data. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Combining ability; Downy mildew resistance; Heterotic groups; Heterotic orientation; Lowland tropical maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866062855

Enzyme electrophoresis resulted in clear staining for five enzyme systems including acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-esterase, ?-esterase and peroxidase. Eighteen putative isozyme loci were scored. Only one locus (Alp2) was found to be monomorphic for all accessions, whereas all other loci were polymorphic. A total of 40 alleles were recognised across all loci. Frequencies of 14 loci were found to discriminate significantly among the 24 studied accessions (p &lt; 0.05). The mean number of polymorphic alleles per locus A = 1.47 and percentage of polymorphic loci P = 38.195% were found to be lower than that reported ones for herbaceous forage plants (A = 1.93 and P = 53.3%). This reduction could be due to geographical isolation, which terminates the gene flow among the studied accessions. The estimates of accessions genetic structure using Nei genetic diversity statistics were calculated. The averages of total heterozygosity (HT) and intra-accessional genetic diversity (HS) were 0.44 and 0.14, respectively. Moreover, the inter-accessional genetic diversity DST has an average of 0.301. These results indicated that inter-accession genetic diversity is higher than intra-accession one. The high levels of genetic differentiation among accessions GST = 0.692, x2 = 48.318, p &lt; 0.05; and the inter-accessional genetic diversity (DST) = 0.301 were probably indicative of low gene flow.

The increasing availability of micro-level data and the growing methodological sophistication of researchers have led to a proliferation of high quality studies on different types of political violence, such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, inter-state war, insurgency, civil war, and repression. However, the cost of this increased sophistication has been fragmentation of the field into highly specialized studies of types of political violence, themselves often divided by theoretical assumptions and methodological approaches. As a way of encouraging the cross-pollination of ideas across the study of political violence, this special edition has asked leading scholars in the field to produce ""state of the field"" survey pieces on each type of political violence and to identify directions for future research.

A recent, sudden, re-emerging wave of this disease has occurred, almost contemporaneously, in all of the main areas of kiwifruit production in the world, suggesting that it can be considered as a pandemic disease. Recent in-depth genetic studies performed on P.syringae pv. actinidiae strains have revealed that this pathovar is composed of four genetically different populations which, to different extents, can infect crops of the genus Actinidia worldwide. Genome comparisons of these strains have revealed that this pathovar can gain and lose the phaseolotoxin gene cluster, as well as mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids and putative prophages, and that it can modify the repertoire of the effector gene arrays. In addition, the strains currently causing worldwide severe economic losses display an extensive set of genes related to the ecological fitness of the bacterium inplanta, such as copper and antibiotic resistance genes, multiple siderophore genes and genes involved in the degradation of lignin derivatives and other phenolics. This pathogen can therefore easily colonize hosts throughout the year. Taxonomy: Bacteria; Proteobacteria, gamma subdivision; Order Pseudomonadales; Family Pseudomonadaceae; Genus Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas syringae species complex, genomospecies 8; Pathovar actinidiae. Microbiological properties: Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, polar flagella, oxidase-negative, arginine dihydrolase-negative, DNA 58.5-58.8mol.% GC, elicits the hypersensitive response on tobacco leaves. Host range: Primarily studied as the causal agent of bacterial canker of green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), it has also been isolated from yellow-fleshed kiwifruit (A.chinensis). In both species, it causes severe economic losses worldwide. It has also been isolated from wild A.arguta and A.kolomikta. Disease symptoms: In green-fleshed and yellow-fleshed kiwifruits, the symptoms include brown-black leaf spots often surrounded by a chlorotic margin, blossom necrosis, extensive twig die-back, reddening of the lenticels, extensive cankers along the main trunk and leader, and bleeding cankers on the trunk and the leader with a whitish to orange ooze. Epidemiology: Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae can effectively colonize its host plants throughout the year. Bacterial exudates can disperse a large amount of inoculum within and between orchards. In the spring, temperatures ranging from 12 to 18°C, together with humid conditions, can greatly favour the multiplication of the bacterium, allowing it to systemically move from the leaf to the young shoots. During the summer, very high temperatures can reduce the multiplication and dispersal of the bacterium. Some agronomical techniques, as well as frost, wind, rain and hail storms, can contribute to further spreading. Disease control: An integrated approach that takes into consideration precise scheduled spray treatments with effective and environmentally friendly bactericides and equilibrated plant nutrition, coupled with preventive measures aimed at drastically reducing the bacterial inoculum, currently seems to be the possible best solution for coexistence with the disease. The development of resistant cultivars and pollinators, effective biocontrol agents, including bacteriophages, and compounds that induce the systemic activation of plant defence mechanisms is in progress.

No. CV-264, PI 652949) centipedegrass [Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack] was developed at the Everglades Research and Education Center, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida, Belle Glade, FL and initially approved for release in 2006. A plant patent was filed in 2008, and U.S. Patent PP20,812 was issued in 2010. Hammock was tested in Florida under the experimental designation of BA-417 and also patented under this name. The purpose of this breeding program was to identify, select, and develop a centipedegrass that would be acceptable as a regional cultivar in the subtropical and tropical climates of Florida. This cultivar originated as an open-pollinated progeny selected and identified as a unique and distinctly different vegetative phenotype growing in a planting of an unimproved population of centipedegrasses typically known throughout the southern U.S. turf industry as common centipedegrass. Hammock was selected for a more compact leaf structure with consistent canopy structure, uniformity, and quality and for its faster rate of crop establishment and ground coverage. Hammock produced leaves that were 13.9% shorter than Centennial and 22.2% shorter than the common centipedegrass standards.

Introgression of wild species is valuable for widening the gene pool and to increase diversity in plant characteristics. Pelargonium tongaense Vorster was discovered in 1983 in the northeast region of Natal, South Africa. This species belongs to the section Ciconium like the two main ancestors of the P. zonale hybrids P. zonale (L.) L'Hérit. and P. inquinans (L.) L'Hérit. In our experiments, the chromosome number of P. tongaense was doubled by mutagenesis (colchicine) from 2n=2x=18 to 2n=4x=36. Subsequent cross-combination with Pelargonium zonale hybrids resulted in fertile F1 plants. Self-pollination and backcrosses with cultivars up to the F3 are reached so far. Strong root growth enables these clone selections to grow very efficient and drought tolerant as plants in the open planting in urban areas. The trailing character perfectly suits with requirements for baskets. Parallel cross-combination on the species levels showed heterosis effects.

Despite the important role of floral scent in ensuring reproductive success in S. latifolia, the molecular basis of scent biosynthesis in this species has not yet been investigated.Results: We isolated two full-length cDNAs from S. latifolia that show similarity to rose orcinol O-methyltransferase. Biochemical analysis showed that both S. latifolia guaiacol O-methyltransferase1 (SlGOMT1) &amp; S. latifolia guaiacol O-methyltransferase2 (SlGOMT2) encode proteins that catalyze the methylation of guaiacol to form veratrole. A large K m value difference between SlGOMT1 (~10 ?M) and SlGOMT2 (~501 ?M) resulted that SlGOMT1 is 31-fold more catalytically efficient than SlGOMT2. qRT-PCR expression analysis showed that the SlGOMT genes are specifically expressed in flowers and male S. latifolia flowers had 3- to 4-folds higher level of GOMT gene transcripts than female flower tissues. Two related cDNAs, S. dioica O-methyltransferase1 (SdOMT1) and S. dioica O-methyltransferase2 (SdOMT2), were also obtained from the sister species Silene dioica, but the proteins they encode did not methylate guaiacol, consistent with the lack of veratrole emission in the flowers of this species. Our evolutionary analysis uncovered that SlGOMT1 and SlGOMT2 genes evolved under positive selection, whereas SdOMT1 and SdOMT2 genes show no evidence for selection.Conclusions: Altogether, we report the identification and functional characterization of the gene, SlGOMT1 that efficiently catalyzes veratrole formation, whereas another copy of this gene with only one amino acid difference, SlGOMT2 was found to be less efficient for veratrole synthesis in S. latifolia. © 2012 Gupta et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","1, 2-dimethoxybenzene; Floral scent; Hadena bicruris; Pollination; VOC",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865540477

Here, we use a recently developed dynamic Boolean network-based model of mutualistic plant-pollinator community formation to investigate the stability of simulated ecological communities in the face of sequential species extinctions. We assess communities in terms of the relative change in biodiversity after species loss, and find that communities that experience a significant loss of biodiversity differ from more robust communities according to a number of topological characteristics. Notably, we show that high nestedness, a property commonly believed to promote community stability, may in extreme circumstances promote a critical over-reliance on individual species. Furthermore, the species important to the survival of the rest of the ecosystem occupy different positions in the network than less important species.

One-third of the world's crops require pollination to improve the quality of seeds and fruits, the great majority being pollinated by some of the ca. 25,000 species of bees. In this context, our study has recorded nine plant species that belong to six plant families. The Asteraceae family is the most favoured; its flowers are visited by 40 species. Next comes the Labiateae family with 23 species and then the Cistaceae family with 11 species. The Asteraceae and the Cistaceae families were preferred by both Megachilidae and Halictidae, the Brassicaceae were preferred by Andrenidae. The main plants that are favoured by social and solitary wild bees are Anacyclus clavatus, Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus albidus and Leontodon hispidus. In terms of species richness our analyses show that the wild bee communities are very diverse. This is due to the mild climate and rich flora of the region. The fauna of wild bees we recorded is divided in four families and seven genera. A significant diversity is noted for the Halictidae family. Three species and one subspecies are new records for Algeria: Anthophora fulvitarsis, Andrena haemorrhoa, Lasioglossum arabs and Osmia latreillei subsp. iberoafricana.

The great climatic variations in Israel, in a relatively small area, create a wide range of natural habitats and high biodiversity of wild plants. The increased demand by industry for uniform and high quality raw material, together with the modern developments that fewer and fewer people still collect plants from the wild, and that some of the wild species plants are protected, has necessitated the cultivation of various species. This shortage of raw material has encouraged seed companies, researchers and farmers to select cultivars that could substitute for the raw material that once came from the wild. The first step in the domestication and breeding of wild plants is a survey of their dispersion according to existing distribution databases. Seed or vegetative propagation material of the target crops are systematically collected as representative of their natural diversity, and are grown in experimental fields in the Newe Ya'ar Research Center under intensive conditions - irrigation, fertilization and several harvests per year. Selection of new cultivars is somewhat different if the plant is annual or perennial and depends on the propagation methods as well. With annual species, propagation is usually done by seeds but with perennial species it could be done also by cuttings. Some of the most important annual aromatic species come from the Umbelliferae family (caraway, coriander, dill, etc.) but also from other families such as the - Labiatae (basil), Fabaceae (fenugreek), Brassicaceae (mustard) and Compositae (chamomile). In breeding a new cultivar, single plants with high performance (yield and quality) are selected from as many sources as possible. These single plants are tested in the same soil and climate conditions that later on will be the place of commercial production. The next step is to produce ""families"", by self-pollination, from each one of the selected plants, and again to choose only the best ones during 4 to 7 generations until a uniform line is obtained. Thus a new cultivar is ""born"". In perennial species, if there is a possibility of using vegetative propagation, the selection time could be shorter. The selected plants can be tested in plots after they are propagated by cuttings, as is necessary - before commercialization. This method has been used for oregano, thyme, onion, artemisia and others. Hybridization can be conducted through artificial crossing when the selection process alone does not produce a cultivar that has all the characteristics that are needed for commercial production. The next areas of study are physiology, the effects of environmental factors, and optimization of agro-technical methods of the selected cultivars. © WIETE 2012.",Breeding; Conservation; Domestication; Germplasm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870606930

Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess post-pollination phenomena, we investigated pollen germination on the stigma and embryo development, using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy and paraffin-embedded sections, respectively. We selected eight putative trigeneric hybrid lines that showed the greatest morphological differences from the parents from among the progeny derived via embryo rescue. The hybridity of one trigeneric hybrid was further confirmed by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization; in addition, the aphid resistance and salt tolerance of this hybrid were higher than those of the chrysanthemum parent and the C. grandiflorum × A. vulgaris F1 hybrid, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: The enhanced aphid resistance of the hybrid line reflects the inheritance of chromosomes from A. vulgaris, which carries genes that encode bioactive components. The enhanced salt tolerance of the trigeneric hybrid is attributable to inheritance of genetic materials from Chrysanthemum crassum and Crossostephium chinense, which act to maintain the compartmentation of Na+ and K+ ions and their selective transportation among different organs to avert deleterious effects and protect the photosynthetic apparatus. The results indicate that trigeneric hybridization between different bigeneric hybrids is a promising method for combination of multiple stress-resistance traits for improvement of chrysanthemum. © 2012 Deng et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865576678

A second, minor source of weed beet are crop roots lost during harvest. These roots (""groundkeepers"" ) can reproduce in the year after sugar beet and potentially contribute to weed beet dynamics and gene flow. Bolting, flowering and seed production timing and potential of groundkeepers were measured in field experiments. Bolting and flowering were faster in groundkeepers vs. weed beet; flower and seed production was lower in groundkeepers but the latter were less sensitive to competitive crops. The measured parameters were used to introduce a ground-keeper life-cycle into the G. eneS. ys-B. eet model which quantifies the effects of cropping systems on weed beet in landscapes. Simulations over several years showed weed beet dynamics to be more sensitive to groundkeeper parameter values than to root loss at sugar beet harvest. Groundkeepers were identified as a key source of weed beet populations and of gene escape from novel sugar beet varieties (e.g. genetically-modified herbicide-tolerant varieties) in the absence of crop bolters. The control of the latter, either by manual weeding or by genetic improvement of sugar beet varieties, was shown to be essential for controlling weed beet populations and avoid the advent of herbicide-tolerant weed beet. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Beta vulgaris; Cropping system; Gene flow; Genetically-modified; Harvest loss; Model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864070730

They are poor pollinators, and can also disrupt pollination by deterring other flower visitors, or by stealing nectar. Some plant species therefore possess floral ant-repelling traits. But why do particular species have such traits when others do not? In a dry forest in Costa Rica, of 49 plant species around a third were ant-repellent at very close proximity to a common generalist ant species, usually via repellent pollen. Repellence was positively correlated with the presence of large nectar volumes. Repellent traits affected ant species differently, some influencing the behaviour of just a few species and others producing more generalised ant-repellence. Our results suggest that ant-repellent floral traits may often not be pleiotropic, but instead could have been selected for as a defence against ant thieves in plant species that invest in large volumes of nectar.

Germination rate andgermination energy of triploid seeds of Q65 were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in triploidseed s of Q10. Triploidfamilies with Q65 as female parent hada large quantity of saplings, whereas triploidfamilies with Q10 as female parent hada small quantity of saplings. Triploidfamilies with Q65 as female parent were generally superior in base diameter and height to base diameter ratio when compared to a diploid family.

In this study we experimentally analyzed the factors regulating autonomous and thigmonastic (triggered by flower visitors) stamen movements in eight species of Loasaceae. Both types of stamen movements are positively influenced by light and temperature and come to a virtual standstill in the dark and at low temperatures (12°C). Pollen presentation is thus discontinued during periods where pollinators are not active. Overall stamen presentation increases with increasing flower age. Contrary to expectation, no geometrical correlation between the floral scale stimulated and the stamen fascicle reacting exists, indicating that the stimulus is transmitted over the receptacle and stamen maturation dictates which and how many stamens react. Thigmonastic stamen presentation is dramatically accelerated compared to autonomous movement (3-37 times), indicating that the rate of stamen maturation can be adjusted to different visitation schedules. Flowers can react relatively uniformly down to stimulation intervals of 10-15 min., consistently presenting comparable numbers of stamens in the flower c. 5 min. after the stimulus and can thus keep the amount of pollen presented relatively constant even under very high visitation frequencies of 4-6 visits/h. Thigmonastic pollen presentation dramatically reduces the overall duration of the staminate phase (to 1/3rd in Nasa macrothyrsa). Similarly, the carpellate phase is dramatically reduced after pollination, down to 1 d from 4 d. Overall flower longevity is reduced by more than 2/3rds under high visitation rates (&amp;3 d versus 10 d under visitor exclusion) and depleted and pollinated flowers are rapidly removed from the pool. Complex floral behaviour in Loasaceae thus permits a near-total control over pollen dispensation schedules and floral longevity of the individual flower by an extraordinary fine-tuning to both biotic and abiotic factors. © 2012 Henning, Weigend.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865161284

Such a trend may be enforced by environmental changes in species with narrow ecological niches because inbred populations are more prone to become maladapted as compared to outcrossed populations. Here, we studied differences in offspring fitness and inbreeding levels between core and peripheral populations of Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra). We collected open-pollinated progenies of P. cembra in large, contiguous and in small, isolated populations (core vs. periphery). Seeds were germinated and grown in a common garden to test for differences in fitness parameters, whereas subsamples of seed lots were genotyped at seven nuclear microsatellites to calculate selfing rates. We found significantly lower seed production, higher embryo abortion rates and lower germination success in small peripheral compared to large core populations of P. cembra. In contrast, winter survival and first-year growth of seedlings did not significantly differ between the two population types. These results indicate higher inbreeding depression at the earliest life stages in small and fragmented populations compared to populations from the contiguous range of P. cembra. However, we found no correlation between any fitness parameters and progeny-derived selfing rates. We explain this discrepancy by the fact that inbreeding depression mostly affects embryo abortion rates in Pinaceae. This cannot be genetically quantified because non-developed embryos cannot be genotyped. We infer that population fragmentation in the long term negatively affects natural regeneration in this long-lived, wind-pollinated conifer species. © 2012 Swiss Botanical Society.",Common garden experiment; Core/periphery; Germination; Offspring fitness; Selfing rate; Small population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869097920

Three trials in three different states (CA, GA, and MI) were conducted to study the effects of long distance transportation on honey bee physiology. Newly emerged bees from one colony were split into two groups and introduced into a transported (T) colony or a stationary (S) colony in each trial. Volumes of hypopharyngeal gland acini in T colonies were significantly smaller than S colonies in all three trials. There were no significant differences between S and T colonies in juvenile hormone titers. Protein content in head showed no significant differences between S and T either in 7-day-old or 17-day-old bees of MI trial, but GA trial showed a significant reduction in bees experiencing transportation. Protein content in thorax was only measured in GA trial and was not significantly different between the two groups. Lipid content in abdomen was not significantly different between the S and T colonies in all three trials.

In this paper we investigated the effect of the reduced auxin sensitivity exhibited by the diageotropica (dgt) tomato mutant on ovary growth during early stage of fruit development. Here we show that in hand-pollinated ovaries fruit-set was not affected by the dgt lesion while fruit growth was reduced. This reduction was associated with a smaller cell size of mesocarp cells, with a lower mean C values and with a lower gene expression of the expansin gene LeExp2. When a synthetic auxin (4-CPA, chlorophenoxyacetic acid) was applied to the flowers of wild type plants, parthenocarpic ovary growth was induced. On the contrary, auxin application to the flowers of dgt plants failed to induce parthenocarpy. Hand-pollinated ovaries of dgt contained higher levels of IAA compared to wild type and this was not associated with high transcript levels of genes encoding a key regulatory enzyme of IAA biosynthesis (ToFZYs) but with lower expression levels of GH3, a gene involved in the conjugation of IAA to amino acids. The expression of diverse Aux/IAA genes and SAUR (small auxin up-regulated RNA) was also altered in the dgt ovaries. The dgt lesion does not seem to affect specific Aux/IAA genes in terms of transcript occurrence but rather in terms of relative levels of expression. Transcript levels of Aux/IAA genes were up regulated in auxin-treated ovaries of wild-type but not in dgt. Together, our results suggest that dgt ovary cells are not able to sense and/or transduce the external auxin signal, whereas pollinated dgt ovary cells are able to detect the IAA present in fertilized ovules promoting fruit development. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Auxin signalling; Diageotropica mutant; Fruit development; Indole-3 acetic-acid; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863874708

Self-pollinated mating system, being an introduced species and experiencing a bottleneck as well as over exploitation cause such a consequence. Inter and intra-specific hybridizations have been suggested as essential techniques for generating genetic diversity. To test the effect of intra-specific hybridization on diversification and heterosis of AP, seven accessions were outcrossed manually in all 21 possible combinations. Three types of markers including morphological, phytochemical and RAPD markers were employed to evaluate the mentioned hypothesis. The results revealed that hybridization acted as a powerful engine for diversification of AP as it caused heterotic expression of the studied traits, simultaneously. Initially, it seems that additive and non-additive gene effects both can be considered as the genetic basis of heterosis in AP for the investigated traits. Agronomic and morphological traits were differentiated from each other, while positive heterosis was recorded mainly for agronomic traits but not for the morphological traits. Intra-specific hybridization increased the genetic diversity in AP population. Nevertheless, a part of this variation could also be attributed to the negative heterosis. The current exploration demonstrated the first ever conducted manual intra-specific hybridization among AP accessions in a mass scale. However, the 17 RAPD primers produced a monomorph pattern, but perhaps increasing the number of markers can feature a new genetic profile in this plant. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Additive and non-additive gene effects; Andrographis paniculata (AP); Biodiversity conservation; Heterosis; Hybridization; Phytochemical and Agro-morphological markers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863875498

However, the precise delimitation of species depends on the criteria used to identify lineages and the specific species concept that is applied. Recently, multidisciplinary studies using different data sources have significantly improved the delimitation of species within complex taxonomic groups, leading to an integrative taxonomy. To investigate the species delimitation within the Atlantic clade of Epidendrum (subg. Amphyglottium), four different species criteria were examined (phenetic differentiation, monophyly, diagnosability, absence of genetic intermediates). Morphometrics, plastid DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite markers were used to explore the agreement between patterns recovered and species criteria tested. The conflicts among species criteria are discussed in light of pollination ecology, patterns of gene flow, reproductive isolation mechanisms and selective pressures currently acting in deceptive orchid species. Four currently recognized species from the Atlantic clade could be delimitated, including one newly described species, Epidendrum flammeus. Three out of five species satisfied the monophyly criterion, and few diagnostic flower characters were found among species. In contrast, nuclear microsatellite data correctly assigned individuals to their respective species, even in the presence of weak reproductive isolation and extensive hybridization events reported in the literature. One important implication of this finding is that phylogenetic studies in Epidendrum spp. should make use of single- or low-copy nuclear loci instead of plastid markers, which may be true for other plant groups. The results also indicate that the generalized pollination syndrome found among species of the Atlantic clade, the different levels of gene flow observed between nuclear and plastid markers, and hybridization events are commonly observed as the main evolutionary forces within this orchid group. Finally, we discuss evolutionary processes and taxonomic limits among these species, and we highlight the need to increase the inter-disciplinary approach to investigate species limits in complex plant groups.",Hybridization; Orchid evolution; Reproductive barriers; Speciation; Species complex; Species delimitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865549655

Our study analyzed interactions of coexisting wild and managed populations of the pitaya Stenocereus pruinosus, a columnar cactus used for its edible fruit occurring in natural forests, silviculturally managed in milpa agroforestry systems, and agriculturally managed in homegardens of the Tehuacán Valley, Mexico. We aimed at analyzing criteria of artificial selection and their consequences on phenotypic diversity and differentiation, as well as documenting management of propagules at landscape level and their possible contribution to gene flow among populations.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted to 83 households of the region to document perception of variation, criteria of artificial selection, and patterns of moving propagules among wild and managed populations. Morphological variation of trees from nine wild, silviculturally and agriculturally managed populations was analyzed for 37 characters through univariate and multivariate statistical methods. In addition, indexes of morphological diversity (MD) per population and phenotypic differentiation (PD) among populations were calculated using character states and frequencies.Results: People recognized 15 pitaya varieties based on their pulp color, fruit size, form, flavor, and thorniness. On average, in wild populations we recorded one variety per population, in silviculturally managed populations 1.58 ± 0.77 varieties per parcel, and in agriculturally managed populations 2.19 ± 1.12 varieties per homegarden. Farmers select in favor of sweet flavor (71% of households interviewed) and pulp color (46%) mainly red, orange and yellow. Artificial selection is practiced in homegardens and 65% of people interviewed also do it in agroforestry systems. People obtain fruit and branches from different population types and move propagules from one another. Multivariate analyses showed morphological differentiation of wild and agriculturally managed populations, mainly due to differences in reproductive characters; however, the phenotypic differentiation indexes were relatively low among all populations studied. Morphological diversity of S. pruinosus (average MD = 0.600) is higher than in other columnar cacti species previously analyzed.Conclusions: Artificial selection in favor of high quality fruit promotes morphological variation and divergence because of the continual replacement of plant material propagated and introduction of propagules from other villages and regions.

Modification in regulatory elements has been invoked to explain expression divergence after duplication for several MADS-box genes, however, verification of reciprocal loss of cis-regulatory elements is lacking in plants. Here, we report that the evolution of MPF2-like genes has entailed degenerative mutations in a core promoter CArG-box and an auxin response factor (ARF) binding element in the large 1st intron in the coding region. Previously, MPF2-like genes were duplicated into MPF2-like-A and -B through genome duplication in Withania and Tubocapsicum (Withaninae). The calyx of Withania grows exorbitantly after pollination unlike Tubocapsicum, where it degenerates. Besides inflated calyx syndrome formation, MPF2-like transcription factors are implicated in functions both during the vegetative and reproductive development as well as in phase transition. MPF2-like-A of Withania (WSA206) is strongly expressed in sepals, while MPF2-like-B (WSB206) is not. Interestingly, their combined expression patterns seem to replicate the pattern of their closely related hypothetical progenitors from Vassobia and Physalis. Using phylogenetic shadowing, site-directed mutagenesis and motif swapping, we could show that the loss of a conserved CArG-box in MPF2-like-B of Withania is responsible for impeding its expression in sepals. Conversely, loss of an ARE in MPF2-like-A relaxed the constraint on expression in sepals. Thus, the ARE is an active suppressor of MPF2-like gene expression in sepals, which in contrast is activated via the CArG-box. The observed expression divergence in MPF2-like genes due to reciprocal loss of cis-regulatory elements has added to genetic and phenotypic variations in the Withaninae and enhanced the potential of natural selection for the adaptive evolution of ICS. Moreover, these results provide insight into the interplay of floral developmental and hormonal pathways during ICS development and add to the understanding of the importance of polyploidy in plants. © 2012 Khan et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866631989

However, understanding how environmental heterogeneity influences genetic variation is difficult because the effects of gene flow, drift and selection are confounded. We investigated the genetic variation and its ecological correlates in a wind-pollinated Mediterranean tree species, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl, within a recognised glacial refugium in Croatia. We sampled 11 populations from environmentally divergent habitats within the Continental and Mediterranean biogeographical regions. We combined genetic data analyses based on nuclear microsatellite loci, multivariate statistics on environmental data and ecological niche modelling (ENM). We identified a geographic structure with a high genetic diversity and low differentiation in the Continental region, which contrasted with the significantly lower genetic diversity and higher population divergence in the Mediterranean region. The positive and significant correlation between environmental and genetic distances after controlling for geographic distance suggests an important influence of ecological divergence of the sites in shaping genetic variation. The ENM provided support for niche differentiation between the populations from the Continental and Mediterranean regions, suggesting that contemporary populations may represent two divergent ecotypes. Ecotype differentiation was also supported by multivariate environmental and genetic distance analyses. Our results suggest that despite extensive gene flow in continental areas, long-term stability of heterogeneous environments have likely promoted genetic divergence of ashes in this region and can explain the present-day genetic variation patterns of these ancient populations. © 2012 Temunovi? et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864693245

In the model legume Medicago truncatula, the organisation of protein storage vacuoles (PSV) in maturing seeds remains unknown. Findings: The sub-cellular events accompanying the accumulation of vicilin (globulin7S) were analysed during seed mid-maturation. Immuno-detection of vicilin in light microscopy, allowed a semi-quantitative assessment of the protein body complement. The identified populations of vicilin-containing protein bodies are distinguished by their number and size which allowed to propose a model of their biogenesis. Two distributions were detected, enabling a separation of their processing at early and mid maturation stages. The largest protein bodies, at 16 and 20 days after pollination (DAP), were formed by the fusion of small bodies. They have probably attained their final size and correspond to mature vicilin aggregations. Electron microscopic observations revealed the association of the dense protein bodies with rough endoplasmic reticulum. The presence of a ribosome layer surrounding protein bodies, would support an endoplasmic reticulum vacuole trafficking pathway. Conclusions: The stastistic analysis may be useful for screening mutations of candidate genes governing protein content. The definitive evidence for an ER-storage vacuole pathway corresponds to a challenge, for the storage of post-translationally unstable proteins. It was proposed for the accumulation of one class of storage protein, the vicilins. This alternative pathway is a matter of controversy in dicotyledonous seeds. © 2012 Abirached-Darmency et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864518857

Following good general flowering, open-pollinated seed was collected from trees of both cytotypes and microsatellite markers were used to determine the breeding system as characterised by the proportion of outcrosses in young seedling progeny. As predicted from the literature, the progeny of diploid clones were predominantly outcrossed (tm = 0. 97). In contrast, the progeny of the tetraploid clones were almost entirely selfs (tm = 0. 02; 3 of 161 seedlings assayed were tetraploid outcrosses and there were no triploids). Segregation at loci heterozygous in the tetraploid mothers followed expected ratios, indicating sexual reproduction rather than apomixis. Post-zygotic factors are primarily responsible for divergence of the breeding systems. Commonly, less than 1 % of Acacia flowers mature as a pod, and after mixed pollination, diploid outcrossed seed normally develops at the expense of selfs. Selfs of the tetraploid trees appear to express less genetic load and have a higher probability of maturing. However, this does not fully explain the observed deficiency of outcross tetraploid progeny. Presumably, there are cytogenetic reasons which remain to be investigated. In nature, selfing would increase the probability of establishment of neotetraploids irrespective of cytotype frequency in the population. Breeders need to review their open-pollinated breeding and seed production strategies. It remains to be seen whether this is an ephemeral problem, with strong fertility selection restoring potential for outcrossing over generations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Acacia; Breeding systems; Polyploidy; Self-fertility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869145528

Much of this research has been invigorated by demonstration of the 'robust, yet fragile' nature of cellular and large-scale systems transcending biology, sociology, and ecology, through application of the network theory to diverse interactions observed in nature such as plant-pollinator, seed-dispersal agent and host-parasite relationships. In this work, we report the development of NEXCADE, an automated and interactive program for inducing disturbances into complex systems defined by networks, focusing on the changes in global network topology and connectivity as a function of the perturbation. NEXCADE uses a graph theoretical approach to simulate perturbations in a user-defined manner, singly, in clusters, or sequentially. To demonstrate the promise it holds for broader adoption by the research community, we provide pre-simulated examples from diverse real-world networks including eukaryotic protein-protein interaction networks, fungal biochemical networks, a variety of ecological food webs in nature as well as social networks. NEXCADE not only enables network visualization at every step of the targeted attacks, but also allows risk assessment, i.e. identification of nodes critical for the robustness of the system of interest, in order to devise and implement context-based strategies for restructuring a network, or to achieve resilience against link or node failures.

In Collinsia heterophylla, delayed stigma receptivity is beneficial as it enhances pollen competition. A sexual conflict over timing of stigma receptivity has been proposed in this species as early pollination, following one-time pollinations, is advantageous to pollen donors at a cost of reduced maternal seed set (measured as seed number). In this study, we explored whether the maternal cost was still present following an additional pollination. We hypothesized that the cost is caused either by harm related to early pollen presence or by factors unrelated to harm. We performed pollinations at different stages of floral development, either one or two pollinations (24-h time lag), and varied the size of the first pollen load in the latter category. Early pollination reduced seed biomass also after two-time pollinations, suggesting a persistent maternal cost of early pollen presence. Further, pollen load size modified seed production, possibly indicating that dose-dependent harm influences the maternal cost of early fertilization. Our results strongly suggest negative effects of pollen competition on maternal fitness following early pollination, which is consistent with the existence of a sexual conflict over timing of stigma receptivity. In conclusion, we propose that much could be gained if more plant studies considered the potential for fitness costs in relation to sexual conflict, particularly those investigating pollen-pistil interactions. © 2012 The Authors.

This may influence pollinator co-existence and plant reproductive success. This study, conducted at the Estação Biológica de Santa Lúcia (EBSL), a remnant of the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil, investigated the effect of small-scale spatial variations on the interactions between bromeliads and their pollinators. Overall, hummingbirds pollinated 19 of 23 bromeliad species, of which 11 were also pollinated by bees and/or butterflies. However, spatial heterogeneity unrelated to the spatial location of plots or bromeliad species abundance influenced the presence of pollinators. Hummingbirds were the most ubiquitous pollinators at the high-elevation transect, with insect participation clearly declining as transect elevation increased. In the redundancy analysis, the presence of the hummingbird species Phaethornis eurynome, Phaethornis squalidus, Ramphodon naevius, and Thalurania glaucopis, and the butterfly species Heliconius erato and Heliconius nattereri in each plot was correlated with environmental factors such as bromeliad and tree abundance, and was also correlated with horizontal diversity. Since plant-pollinator interactions varied within the environmental mosaics at the study site, this small-scale environmental heterogeneity may relax competition among pollinators, and may explain the high diversity of bromeliads and pollinators generally found in the Atlantic Forest. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Butterflies; Elevational gradient; Hummingbirds; Pollination; Southeastern brazil; Temporal/spatial heterogeneity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863449225

However, the genetic basis of pollinator adaptation is poorly understood. The orchid genus Ophrys mimics its pollinators' mating signals and is pollinated by male insects during mating attempts. In many species of this genus, chemical mimicry of the pollinators' pheromones, especially of alkenes with different double-bond positions, plays a key role for specific pollinator attraction. Thus, different alkenes produced in different species are probably a consequence of pollinator adaptation. In this study, we identify genes that are likely involved in alkene biosynthesis, encoding stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturases (SAD), in three closely related Ophrys species, O. garganica, O. sphegodes, and O. exaltata. Combining floral odor and gene expression analyses, two SAD homologs (SAD1/2) showed significant association with the production of (Z)-9- and (Z)-12-alkenes that were abundant in O. garganica and O. sphegodes, supporting previous biochemical data. In contrast, two other newly identified homologs (SAD5/6) were significantly associated with (Z)-7-alkenes that were highly abundant only in O. exaltata. Both molecular evolutionary analyses and pollinator preference tests suggest that the alkenes associated with SAD1/2 and SAD5/6 are under pollinator-mediated divergent selection among species. The expression patterns of these genes in F1 hybrids indicate that species-specific expression differences in SAD1/2 are likely due to cis-regulation, while changes in SAD5/6 are likely due to trans-regulation. Taken together, we report a genetic mechanism for pollinator-mediated divergent selection that drives adaptive changes in floral alkene biosynthesis involved in reproductive isolation among Ophrys species. © 2012 Xu et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866174661

We assessed competitive and facilitative interactions for pollinator visitation among co-flowering species in a plant community, investigated the subsequent consequences for plant reproduction, and investigated whether effects could be trait-based. We removed the flowers of two species attractive to pollinators, in two separate experiments and assessed the effects on pollinator visitation rates and components of reproductive success in 11 co-flowering focal herb species. Overall, most focal species appear not to interact with the removal species with respect to pollinator visitation and subsequent reproduction (neutral interactions). Three focal species in the community had significantly higher reproductive responses (fruit production and seed weight) in the presence of the attractive removal species (facilitative interactions), but species interaction effects were less pronounced in species' flower visitation rates. A community-wide meta-analysis demonstrated that the two experiments did not have a significant effect on either facilitation or competition, and that there was no overall correlation between effect sizes for visitation and reproduction. Based on species-specific responses, it seems likely that floral traits such as similar flower colors contribute to interspecific facilitation of pollinator visitation and, in particular, that high pollinator dependence for plant reproduction, and associated pollen limitation, may contribute to subsequent interaction effects on reproduction in the focal species. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Competition; Facilitation; Floral traits; Pollen limitation; Pollinator visitation; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863211872

In particular, a decline in pollinator visitation at low density can cause an Allee effect (a positive relation of fitness to density) in the plant population, which heightens that population's vulnerability to extinction. Empiricists have reported a variety of relations between flower or plant density and pollinator visitation rates. Here I develop and test a model that provides explanations for this diversity. The model assumes that pollinators distribute themselves between a focal patch of flowers and the surrounding environment so as to maximize foraging success. The resulting relation of per-flower visitation rate to focal-patch floral density is nonlinear, with positive effects at low floral densities and weaker or negative effects at higher densities. The relation is influenced by floral density in the surrounding environment and traits of both the plants and their pollinators. In a field experiment, floral density of Holocarpha virgata ssp. virgata had a nonlinear effect on per-flower visitation that was largely consistent with the model's predictions. By producing testable hypotheses based on biologically reasonable assumptions, this model serves as a starting point for explaining an important facet of plant-pollinator mutualisms. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",Allee effects; Density; Ideal free distribution; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863637989

Accumulation of free glucose and starch and loss of chlorophyll in leaf was manifested early at 12 d after anthesis (DAA), while global transcriptional and phenotypic changes were evident only at 24 DAA. Internodes exhibited major transcriptomic changes only at 30 DAA. Overlaying expression data onto metabolic pathways revealed involvement of many novel pathways, including those involved in cell wall biosynthesis. To investigate the overlap between induced and natural senescence, transcriptional data from induced senescence in maize was compared with that reported for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) undergoing natural and sugar-induced senescence. Notable similarities with natural senescence in Arabidopsis included up-regulation of senescence-associated genes (SAGs), ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthetic genes, APETALA2, ethylene-responsive element binding protein, and no apical meristem transcription factors. However, differences from natural senescence were highlighted by unaltered expression of a subset of the SAGs, and cytokinin, abscisic acid, and salicylic acid biosynthesis genes. Key genes up-regulated during sugar-induced senescence in Arabidopsis, including a cysteine protease (SAG12) and three flavonoid biosynthesis genes (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1 (PAP1), PAP2, and LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN DIOXYGENASE), were also induced, suggesting similarities in senescence induced by pollination prevention and sugar application. Coexpression analysis revealed networks involving known senescence-related genes and novel candidates; 82 of these were shared between leaf and internode networks, highlighting similarities in induced senescence in these tissues. Insights from this study will be valuable in systems biology of senescence in maize and other grasses. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Abundance and species richness of pollinating insects were estimated in ten fields of spring oilseed rape, Brassica napus var. SW Stratos™, located along a gradient of landscape compositions ranging from simple landscapes dominated by arable land to heterogeneous landscapes with extensive cover of semi-natural habitats. In each field, we assessed the contribution of wind and insect pollination to seed yield, seed quality (individual seed weight and oil and chlorophyll contents), and market value in a block experiment with four replicates and two treatments: (1) all flowers were accessible to insects, self and wind pollination, and (2) flowers enclosed in tulle net bags (mesh: 1 × 1 mm) were accessible only to wind and self pollination. Complex landscapes enhanced the overall abundance of wild insects as well as the abundance and species richness of hoverflies. This did not translate to a higher yield, probably due to consistent pollination by honey bees across all fields. However, the pollination experiment showed that insects increased seed weight per plant by 18% and market value by 20%. Seed quality was enhanced by insect pollination, rendering heavier seeds as well as higher oil and lower chlorophyll contents, clearly showing that insect pollination is required to reach high seed yield and quality in oilseed rape. Our study demonstrates considerable and previously underestimated contributions from pollinating insects to both the yield and the market value of oilseed rape. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica napus; Crop pollination; Honey bee; Hoverflies; Landscape heterogeneity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864287060

Specifically, effects of forest fragmentation on reproduction of plants with beetle-pollinated flowers are poorly understood, and there are no data on the impact of fragmentation on reproduction in the structurally important tropical family Annonaceae. We examined the relationship between fragment size, pollinator abundance and seed set of beetle-pollinated Anaxagorea dolichocarpa (Annonaceae) in a disturbed Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Flower and fruit production and abundance of pollinators were quantified over ten months in three large (306-388 ha) and three small (6-14 ha) forest fragments. We recorded per flower pollinator abundance, resulting fruit set (fruits per flower) and seed set (monocarps per fruit) for a total of 209 individually marked flowers, and compared pollinator abundance in 186 flowers across all fragments. Flower and fruit production differed among fragments, but were similar for the combined large and small fragments. Between 64.8% (large fragments) and 66.3% (small fragments) of flowers received at least one pollinator. We found no significant difference in pollinator numbers between large and small fragments, and no correlation between pollinator abundance and fruit and seed set. A single visitor had a high probability of pollinating a flower. We conclude that 1) fragment size had no influence on pollinator number and plant reproductive success, and 2) generalist behavior of the pollinating beetles mitigate the risk of pollination failure for the reproductively specialized plant.

Inadequate pollination by bumble bees has been a problem for growers at certain times of year; however, its cause has yet to be determined. Bumble bees have been shown to exit tomato greenhouses to forage on flowers of other plants. This study investigates tomato's floral characteristics and their affect on bumble bee pollination by 1) observing foraging preferences for bumble bees on greenhouse tomato, 2) determining if the plant's floral advertisements could be used by the bees to estimate pollen availability, and 3) identifying temporal changes in floral display which correspond to peak bumble bee activity. Flower size (petal length, anther cone width, and anther cone length) and floral scent (release of ?-phellandrene, 2-carene, ?-pinene, and p-cymene) were evaluated to identify the pollinator-important characteristics of tomato flowers. Our results indicate that 1) bumble bees preferred to pollinate flowers which produce less ?-phellandrene and 2-carene in comparison to flowers producing more of these volatiles, 2) flower size and floral scent are not likely used by the bees to estimate pollen availability, and 3) cultivars are inconsistent in their production of floral volatiles during peak bumble bee activity, ?-phellandrene and 2-carene may be antiherbivory volatiles and reduced production during peak bee activity may help to facilitate pollination of tomato. Pollinator-repellent volatiles may help to protect flowers from damage caused by over-pollination. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.",bumble bee; floral volatile; greenhouse; repellent; tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865403141

We characterized floral scent composition and emission in a common garden of Penstemon digitalis from three nearby source populations. We measured phenotypic selection on scent as well as floral traits more frequently examined, such as floral phenology, display size, corolla pigment, and inflorescence height. Scent differed among populations in a common garden, underscoring the potential for scent to be shaped by differential selection pressures. Phenotypic selection on flower number and display size was strong. However, selection favoured scent rather than flower size or colour, suggesting that smelling stronger benefits reproductive success in P. digitalis. Linalool was a direct target of selection and its high frequency in floral-scent bouquets suggests that further studies of both pollinator- and antagonist-mediated selection on this compound would further our understanding of scent evolution. Our results indicate that chemical dimensions of floral display are just as likely as other components to experience selective pressure in a nonspecialized flowering herb.

Until now, flowering and pollination of Eurya plants have not been reported. Plants of this genus are described as dioecy in most of the literatures. Hermaphrodite flowers had only been reported in Eurya japonica Thunb. In our recent study, gender variation was found in Eurya obtusifolia H. T. Chang, as well as hermaphrodite flowers. After primary investigation of its floral structure and function gender, floral morphology and pollination characteristics were studied in detail through field and lab. observation. We set four plots in Beibei District, Chongqing (one plot at Xishanpin, three others at Jinyun Mountain). Indicators related to floral morphology and pollination, such as size of flower structures, flower orientation, pollen viability, stigma receptivity, pollen resistance to water, pollen amount and nectar volume of a single flower, as well as flowering dynamics, the pollinator species, and the pollination behavior were observed or determined. The bagging experiments were also carried out at the same time. The findings were as below. E. obtusifolia is a species with short florescence, small but massive blossoms and highly-synchronous flowering, the color and the smell of both sexes of which are the same. The pollination of this species is mainly entomophilous, which depend on two Apidae insects. Insect pollination is relatively dominating compared to wind pollination(anemophilous), which plays a tiny role. The male and the female of E. obtusifolia have some similar characteristics, but also have many obvious differences in respect of the floral morphology and the pollination character. The main differences are as follows: 1) The male flower is lantern-like with non-reflexed petals, while the female flower is radial with reflexed petals. 2) The male possesses significantly bigger flowers compared to the male. 3) The flower apex of the males tends to vertically downwards, while which of the female tends to obliquely downward to the terminal of the branch. 4) The female flower lives longer than the male one. Accordingly, the pollinators behave differently on two sexes. The gender variant individuals present some transitional traits between the male and the female. For E. obtusifolia, many features on the flowering and the pollination reflect its adaptibility to the dioecy sexual system to some extent. Morphological differences between the male and the female of E. obtusifolia have been resulted from various biotic and abiotic factors in surrounding, of which, pollinator and rain selection might play important roles.",Ecological adaptability; Eurya obtusifolia H.

In both populations, the exclusion of diurnal pollinators significantly reduced seed production compared to open pollination, whereas the exclusion of nocturnal pollinators did not. There was significant selection on traits expected to influence pollinator attraction and pollination efficiency in both the diurnal and nocturnal pollination treatment. The relative strength of selection among plants exposed to diurnal and nocturnal visitors varied among traits and populations, but the direction of selection was consistent. The results suggest that diurnal pollinators are more important than nocturnal pollinators for seed production in the study populations, but that both categories contribute to selection on floral morphology. The study illustrates how experimental manipulations can link specific categories of pollinators to observed selection on floral traits, and thus improve our understanding of how species interactions shape patterns of selection. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Floral evolution; Generalized pollination; Gymnadenia conopsea; Pollen limitation; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator attraction; Pollinator importance; Pollinator-mediated selection; Spatial variation; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864692872

To determine whether and when post-pollination non-random mate selection occurs among self and non-self pollen, seed paternity and semi-in vivo pollen tube growth were determined in controlled single/mixed pollinations. Despite all pollen sources being equally proficient in siring seeds in single-genotype pollinations, self pollen was consistently selected in mixed pollinations, irrespective of maternal genotype. However, clear patterns of mate discrimination occurred amongst non-self pollen when mixed pollinations were performed soon after corollas open, including selection against hygromycin B resistance (transformation selectable marker) in wild-type styles and for it in transformed styles. However, mate choice among pollen genotypes was completely shut down in plants transformed to be unable to produce (irACO) or perceive (ETR1) ethylene. The post-pollination ethylene burst, which originates primarily from the stigma and upper style, was strongly correlated with mate selection in single and mixed hand-pollinations using eight pollen donors in two maternal ecotypes. The post-pollination ethylene burst was also negatively correlated with the continuation of emission of benzylacetone, the most abundant pollinator-attracting corolla-derived floral volatile. We conclude that ethylene signaling plays a pivotal role in mate choice, and the post-pollination ethylene burst and the termination of benzylacetone release are accurate predictors, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of pre-zygotic mate selection and seed paternity. © 2012 The Authors.

Here it is shown that a functional stigma has evolved secondarily from modified tepals in some Albuca species (Hyacinthaceae). Deposition of pollen on Albuca floral organs by bees was recorded. Pollen germination and fruit set was measured in flowers that had pollen deposited solely on their tepals or had their tepal tips experimentally isolated or removed after pollination. Key Leafcutter bees deposit pollen onto the papillate apices of the inner tepals of Albuca flowers. Pollen germinates in tepal-derived fluid secreted 2 or 3 d after anthesis and pollen tubes subsequently penetrate the style during flower wilting. Application of cross-pollen to the inner tepal apices of A. setosa flowers led to high fruit set. No fruits were produced in pollinated flowers in which the inner tepals were mechanically isolated or removed. Pollen capture by tepals in the Albuca clade probably evolved in response to selection for floral morphology that maximizes the accuracy of pollen transfer.

However, this does not explain the prevalence of conical cells amongst other, simpler, flowers. 2.The movement of objects is an integral part of the world and is of particular importance to bees because the relative motion of objects is essential to a bee's 3D vision. The motion of flowers can increase pollinator attraction; however, it also makes flowers more difficult for a bee to handle. This makes foraging more metabolically expensive. To explore whether conical petal cells make handling moving flowers easier, we tested bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) preference for conical- or flat-celled Petunia (Petunia hybrida) flowers under different conditions of motion. We also used differently coloured Petunia flowers to test how colour and visibility interact with tactile cues to form a pollinator's preferences. 3.Bees preferred to visit conical-celled Petunia flowers except when the conical-celled flowers were harder to detect visually. The bees then favoured flowers that were easier to detect. But when flowers were moving and more difficult to handle, bees always learned to favour conical-celled flowers, irrespective of visual difficulty. 4.By providing easier handling through better grip from conical cells, the plant can benefit from the natural visual attractant of flowers moving in the wind without losing pollinator preference for easier-to-handle flowers. Bee preference for conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving shows how plants can use conical petal cells to take advantage of an attractant that would otherwise decrease pollinator preference by making handling difficult (movement). The selective pressure from pollinators choosing conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving in the wind provides an explanation for the persistence of conical cells in so many diverse angiosperm species across evolutionary time. © 2012 The Authors.

This diversity and an absence of correlated characters have resulted in numerous attempts to subdivide Echinopsis into more homogeneous subgroups. To infer natural species groups in this alliance, we here provide a plastid phylogeny and use it to infer changes in growth form, pollination mode, and ploidy level. Methods: We sequenced 3800 nucleotides of chloroplast DNA from 162 plants representing 144 species and subspecies. The sample includes the type species of all genera close to, or included in, Echinopsis as well as a dense sample of other genera of the Trichocereeae and further outgroups. New and published chromosome counts were compiled and traced on the phylogeny, as were pollination modes and growth habits. Key results: A maximum likelihood phylogeny confirms that Echinopsis s.l. is not monophyletic nor are any of the previously recognized genera that have more than one species. Pollination mode and, to a lesser extent, growth habit are evolutionarily labile, and diploidy is the rule in Echinopsis s.l., with the few polyploids clustered in just a few clades. Conclusions: The use of evolutionary labile floral traits and growth habit has led to nonnatural classifications. Taxonomic realignments are required, but further study of less evolutionary labile traits suitable for circumscribing genera are needed. Surprisingly, polyploidy seems infrequent in the Echinopsis alliance and hybridization may thus be of minor relevance in the evolution of this clade. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Cactaceae; Chromosome counts; Echinopsis; Growth form evolution; Phylogenetics; Pollination modes; Polyploidy; Trichocereeae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865027065

To comprehensively analyse ETC differentiation, laser microdissection-based transcript and metabolite profiles were obtained from laser microdissected tissues and cell morphology was analysed. Flange-like secondary-wall ingrowths appeared between 5 and 7 days after pollination within the three outermost cell layers. Gene expression analysis indicated that ethylene-signalling pathways initiate ETC morphology. This is accompanied by gene activity related to cell shape control and vesicle transport, with abundant mitochondria and endomembrane structures. Gene expression analyses indicate predominant formation of hemicelluloses, glucuronoxylans and arabinoxylans, and transient formation of callose, together with proline and 4-hydroxyproline biosynthesis. Activation of the methylation cycle is probably required for biosynthesis of phospholipids, pectins and ethylene. Membrane microdomains involving sterols/sphingolipids and remorins are potentially involved in ETC development. The transcriptional activity of assimilate and micronutrient transporters suggests ETCs as the main uptake organs of solutes into the endosperm. Accordingly, the endosperm grows maximally after ETCs are fully developed. Up-regulated gene expression related to amino acid catabolism, C:N balances, carbohydrate oxidation, mitochondrial activity and starch degradation meets high demands for respiratory energy and carbohydrates, required for cell proliferation and wall synthesis. At 10 days after pollination, ETCs undergo further differentiation, potentially initiated by abscisic acid, and metabolism is reprogrammed as shown by activated storage and stress-related processes. Overall, the data provide a comprehensive view of barley ETC differentiation and development, and identify candidate genes and associated pathways. © 2012 The Authors.

In this study, the breeding system of some Campo Rupestre Melastomataceae was evaluated, and breeding system studies for New World species were surveyed to test the hypothesis that apomixis is associated with wide distributions, whilst sexual species have more restricted areas. The breeding systems of 20 Campo Rupestre Melastomataceae were studied using hand pollinations and pollen-tube growth analysis. In addition, breeding system information was compiled for 124 New World species of Melastomataceae with either wide (>1000 km) or restricted distributions. Most (80 %) of the Campo Rupestre species studied were self-compatible. Self-incompatibility in Microlicia viminalis was associated with pollen-tube arrest in the style, as described for other Melastomataceae, but most self-incompatible species analysed showed pollen-tube growth to the ovary irrespective of pollination treatment. Apomictic species showed lower pollen viability and were less frequent among the Campo Rupestre plants. Among the New World species compiled, 43 were apomictic and 77 sexual (24 self-incompatible and 53 self-compatible). Most apomictic (86 %) and self-incompatible species (71 %) presented wide distributions, whilst restricted distributions predominate only among the self-compatible ones (53 %).

In this study, the model was applied to white clover (Trifolium repens) and its most frequent pollinator, the honeybee (Apis mellifera). One of the three parameters in the portion-dilution model is the mean number of flowers a pollinator visits in one foraging bout. An alternative method to estimate this parameter was developed that was not depending on pollinator hive-seeking behaviour. The new estimation method, based on nectar collection, seems to be a good alternative, when reliable observation on visiting behaviour of pollinators is not possible. The gene flow in white clover was modelled. Where fields were assumed to be well separated, and only a low fraction of bees travelled between fields, the gene flow was estimated to be 0. 7%, but subjected to large uncertainty. In a worst case scenario with adjacent fields-one with a genetically modified (GM) T. repens cultivar and the other with a conventional T. repens cultivar-and where all arriving bees were expected to transfer GM pollen, the median gene flow was modelled to be 7% with an estimated 95% percentile of 70%. The results show that the European Union threshold limit of 0. 9% GM admixture for food and feed will likely be exceeded at times and especially organic farmers that do not accept GM admixture and often have clover and clover-grass fields might face challenges with admixture of GM. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Apis mellifera; Co-existence; Gene flow; Pollination; Portion-dilution model; Trifolium repens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864291046

However, for over 30 years, there has been an ongoing discussion about whether nectar amino acids benefit butterfly fitness. A clear positive effect was only shown for the nectar-feeding Araschnia levana, and females of the fruit-feeding Bicyclus anynana also increased offspring quality when they were fed amino acids as adults. Thus, severe doubts remain about the general significance of these single positive results. We therefore tested a further species from a phylogenetically different butterfly subfamily, the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus L., Satyrinae), taking into account feeding conditions over the whole life cycle of this species. C. pamphilus females receiving nectar amino acids as adults, irrespective of larval food quality, produced heavier larvae and also increased the hatching success of their eggs over the oviposition period. Furthermore, females raised under nitrogen-poor larval conditions tended to use nectar amino acids to increase the number of eggs laid. Thus, C. pamphilus females used nectar amino acids primarily to increase their offspring quality, and secondly tended to increase offspring quantity, if larval resources were scarce, showing a resource allocation pattern differing from both B. anynana and A. levana. Our study supports the old postulate that nectar amino acids generally enhance butterfly fitness. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Butterfly reproduction; Coenonympha pamphilus; Larval feeding; Lepidoptera pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864274973

In this study, we analyzed the impact of hydrological heterogeneity on the spatial genetic structure of the wind-pollinated black sedge Carex nigra in an alpine fen. We performed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) with 111 samples collected along a grid covering the whole area of the fen and studied fine-scale genetic structure using spatial autocorrelation and Bayesian cluster analyses. We observed a significant spatial genetic structure indicating isolation-by-distance, which can be ascribed to restricted seed dispersal. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed four groups of genetically related and patchy distributed samples within the fen. Two of these groups were distributed in the deeper and moister regions of the fen, while the two other groups were spatially restricted to the higher and drier regions of the fen. We think that the observed pattern of spatial genetic variation reflects hydrological heterogeneity within the fen and conclude that the four groups represent cohorts of individuals originating from different recruitment events in different parts of the fen. Genetic variation was much lower in the groups from the drier regions of the fen. Since Carex species require moist conditions for germination and establishment, the low level of genetic variation can most likely be ascribed to restricted seedling recruitment in the drier regions of the fen. Habitat heterogeneity affects, therefore, both spatial genetic structure and levels of genetic variation. This study clearly demonstrates that integrating fine-scale genetic analyses with complementary biological data can markedly improve the identification of processes that shape fine-scale genetic structure within plant populations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870697401

The results show that C. castaneus features a striking system of mimicry, quite different from those studied previously in other dioecious plants. The population of C. castaneus was not significantly male biased and no intersexual difference in number of inflorescences per plant was detected. However, male plants began their blossoming earlier and flowered longer than female plants. There was thus an excess of male floral display. This excess should increase the frequency of insect-mediated transport of pollen from male to female plants. Furthermore, on female plants each pistillate flower is accompanied by a sterile staminate flower that appears to contribute to insect attraction. Quite similar in morphology and function to fertile staminate flowers, they produce similar visual and olfactory cues, but less rewards (nectar but no pollen).

Caldén woodlands within Córdoba province currently remain as a highly fragmented mosaic with a single continuous area of forest left. Here, we assess reproduction, seed predation, and progeny performance of trees growing in continuous forest, small forest fragments and isolation. By assessing both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions we aim to determine net fragmentation effects on the quantity and quality of the surviving progeny. Contrary to expectations, the probability of setting fruits and seeds as well as the levels of seed predation were similar among trees growing across the three contrasting landscape conditions. However, trees growing in isolation produced significantly larger numbers of flowers than trees growing in continuous forest. Thus, the absolute quantity of progeny left for potential recruitment was higher in isolated trees, despite their lower pollination efficiency. However, progeny generated in continuous forest significantly outperformed the progeny from forest fragments and isolated trees, which also suffered higher levels of mortality. Finally, the cumulative performance across all measured life stages was also significantly greater in continuous forest. Therefore, it is within the last continuous forest tract that progeny produced may successfully grow and survive in natural conditions. Assurance of long-term persistence of remaining caldén populations should involve the incorporation of propagules from the continuous forest together with effective restoration efforts to enable gene flow via pollen and seeds among populations through forest corridors. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Central Argentina; Habitat fragmentation; Offspring performance; Plant reproductive success; Relative growth rate in height; Seed predation; Seedling biomass; Seedling growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862660951

Flowers lacking energetic rewards possess a more elaborate morphology to ensure co-specific pollination. Despite the prevalence of deceptive species among Euro-Mediterranean orchids, the study of their floral micromorphology is still in its infancy. In this work, we examine the floral micromorphology of four sympatric species of the widespread Mediterranean genus Serapias. Electron microscopy (scanning, transmission) was performed on flowers of four sympatric species of the deceptive genus Serapias, the widespread S.cordigera, S.lingua, S.parviflora and S.vomeracea. Each species has a characteristic combination of specialized, secretory epidermal cells and trichomes on the labellum and, to a lesser extent, the petals. Serapias lingua is highly specialized in that it produces olfactory signals and has two types of trichome with secretory apical cells, one of which is also present in S.parviflora. In addition to striated, conical secretory cells, S.cordigera and S.vomeracea also have characteristic, atypical secretory trichomes with bilobulate or dome-like protuberances. The labellar micromorphology of S.lingua and S.parviflora is adapted for scent production, whereas S.vomeracea and S.cordigera possess trichomes that may also provide visual and/or tactile cues. Owing to the combined effect of the specific floral fragrance and labellar micromorphology in pollinator selection, the pollination ecology of Serapias spp. is even more specialized than previously thought. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Deceptive pollination strategy; Orchids; Osmophores; Serapias cordigera; Serapias lingua; Serapias parviflora; Serapias vomeracea; Trichomes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863995932

One of several honeybee senses that is both exceptional and intriguing is magnetoreception-the ability to perceive the omnipresent magnetic field (MF) of the Earth. The mechanism by which animals sense MFs has remained fascinating as well as elusive because of the intricacies involved, which makes it one of the grand challenges for neural and sensory biology. However, investigations in recent years have brought substantial progress to our understanding of how such magneto-receptor(s) may work. Some terrestrial animals (birds) are reported to be equipped even with a dual perception system: one based on diminutive magnetic particles-in line with the original model which has also always been hypothesized for bees-and the other one, as the more recent model describes, based on a sensitivity of some photochemical reactions to MF (radical-pair or chemical mechanism). The latter model postulates a close link to vision and supposes that the animals can see the position of the geomagnetic North as a visible pattern superimposed on the picture of the environment. In recent years, a growing body of evidence has shown that radical-pair magnetoreception might also be used by insects. It is realistic to expect that such evidence will inspire a re-examination and extension or confirmation of established views on the honeybee magnetic-compass mechanism. However, the problem of bee magnetoreception will not be solved at the moment that a receptor is discovered. On the contrary, the meaning of magnetoreception in insect life and its involvement in the orchestration of other senses is yet to be fully understood. The crucial question to be addressed in the near future is whether the compass abilities of the honeybee could suffer from radio frequency (RF) smog accompanying modern civilization and whether the fitness of this dominant pollinator might be affected by RF fields. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of the path that the behavioral research on honeybee magnetoreception has taken and to discuss it in the context of contemporary data obtained on other insects. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.",compass; honeybee; magnetite; magnetoreception; radical-pair; radio-smog,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863635740

The oil-collecting bee Centris nitida, which has recently naturalized in southern Florida, has been identified as a novel participant in an endemic specialized mutualism between Byrsonima lucida, a threatened native oil plant, and Centris errans, its sole native pollinator. In this study, we determined the impacts of this novel pollinator on B. lucida by assessing the degree of its pollen limitations in sites with and without the introduced oil bee, as well as in natural and garden settings. We also compared the key processes of pollination for both of the Centris bee species. The degrees of pollen limitation sustained by B. lucida were similar among sites with or without the introduced oil bee, and among natural or garden sites. The native oil bee's visitation rates (no. of visits/minute/flower) to B. lucida plants were not significantly reduced at sites where the introduced oil bees were present. The native oil bee had a lower foraging rate (no. of flowers visited/minute) and was a less efficient pollinator than the introduced oil bee. There has been no observed negative impact to either the native oil plant or bee, the introduced bee is absent in most natural areas, and it is also possible that the bee may arrive naturally given the trend in global warming. In light of these facts, we do not recommend any management action towards this introduced oil bee. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Byrsonima lucida; Introduced specialist pollinator; Oil-collecting bees; Pine rockland forests; Plant animal interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865740262

Human activities responsible for forest fragmentation tend also to change the internal characteristics of remnant patches, for example, through the creation of gaps by selective logging. While edges and gaps can be expected to cause comparable changes in the micro-environmental conditions of the forest, their effects on forest-dwelling species and their interactions are not necessarily comparable. This study compares the effect of forest edges and anthropogenic gaps on the reproductive success of a self-incompatible epiphytic plant (Mitraria coccinea), mediated by changes in its relationship with mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (flower larcenists). Mitraria coccinea's flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds and robbed by the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii. Edges and gaps had comparable positive effects on flower production and fruit set; however, nectar robbing was up to sevenfold higher in patches with numerous gaps and resulted in lower reproductive success (fruit set and total fruit crop). Forest fragmentation studies should therefore avoid treating forest remnants as homogeneous units (i.e. focusing exclusively on their characteristics and connectivity), without taking into account the internal heterogeneity caused by anthropogenic pressures (e.g. gaps and edge effects). © 2011 The Authors.

Phylogenetic analyses based on seven molecular markers obtained from 97 species were conducted to produce the first extensive phylogeny of the New World tribes of subfamily Iridoideae. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis was used to trace the evolutionary history of glandular structures present in the flowers of numerous species in each tribe. Hypotheses of differential diversification rates among lineages were also investigated using both topological and Binary-State Speciation and Extinction methods. Floral glandular structures and especially trichomal elaiophores evolved multiple times independently in the American tribes of Iridoideae.

Since this reproductive behavior is mostly observed in anemophilous plants, pollination efficiency is suggested as one hypothesis to explain it, although resource-based hypotheses are also suggested as alternatives. We analyzed the effect of flowering phenology, airborne pollen presence and meteorological conditions in the pattern of acorn production in mixed evergreen-deciduous oak forests (Quercus ilex and Quercus pubescens) in NE Spain for twelve years (1998-2009). In both oaks, higher temperatures advanced the onset of flowering and increased the amount of airborne pollen. Nevertheless, inter-annual differences in pollen production did not influence acorn crop size. Acorn production was enhanced by a delay in flowering onset in Q. ilex but not in Q. pubescens. This suggests that in perennial oaks a larger number of photosynthates produced before flowering could benefit reproduction while the lack of effects on deciduous oaks could be because these species flush new leaves and flowers at the same time. Notwithstanding this effect, spring water deficit was the most relevant factor in explaining inter-annual variability in acorn production in both species. Considering that future climate scenarios predict progressive warmer and dryer spring seasons in the Mediterranean Basin, this might result in earlier onsets of flowering and higher water deficits that would constrain acorn production. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Acorns; Drought; Mediterranean; Pollination efficiency hypothesis; Quercus spp.; Resource-based hypotheses,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861866601

Nicotiana attenuata flowers produce nectar with nicotine at concentrations that are repellent to hummingbirds, increasing the number of flowers visited per plant. In choice tests using native hummingbirds, we show that these important pollinators learn to tolerate high-nicotine nectar but prefer low-nicotine nectar, and show no signs of nicotine addiction. Nectar nicotine concentrations, unlike those of other vegetative tissues, are unpredictably variable among flowers, not only among populations, but also within populations, and even among flowers within an inflorescence. To evaluate whether variations in nectar nicotine concentrations increase outcrossing, polymorphic microsatellite markers, optimized to evaluate paternity in native N. attenuata populations, were used to compare outcrossing in plants silenced for expression of a biosynthetic gene for nicotine production (Napmt1/2) and in control empty vector plants, which were antherectomized and transplanted into native populations. When only exposed to hummingbird pollinators, seeds produced by flowers with nicotine in their nectar had a greater number of genetically different sires, compared to seeds from nicotine-free flowers. As the variation in nectar nicotine levels among flowers in an inflorescence decreased in N. attenuata plants silenced in various combinations of three Dicer-like (DCL) proteins, small RNAs are probably involved in the unpredictable variation in nectar nicotine levels within a plant. © 2012 The Authors.

Tibouchina pulchra is a common tree species that occurs at high and low sites of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. This study focussed on the pollination biology and breeding system of this species, describing the pollinators and the reproductive success at the two sites of an elevational gradient. Observations were made to determine extent of flowering and fruiting, to identify the richness and abundance of pollinators, and to record data on the floral and reproductive biology at these two sites. Despite more dense flowering at the high site, five visits of bees (two species) were recorded during the observation time (60 h), whereas at the low site there were 948 visits (seven species) during the same period. In contrast with the low site, the flowers of the high site released and received few pollen grains on the stigma. At the high site less fruit was set with fewer seeds as a result of open pollination than at the low site; at that site, however, more seeds were obtained from cross-pollination than at the low site. Tibouchina pulchra is self-compatible; however it is not apomictic and needs pollinators for seed set at both sites. Life-history traits other than the breeding system, for example more dense flowering, advantage of greater fertility in cross-pollination, and multiple reproductive events during the lifetime of the tree may reduce inbreeding depression, increase the hybrid vigour, and balance the lack of pollinators at the high site. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus morio; Buzz pollination; High and low sites; Reproductive assurance; Southeastern Brazil,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864378210

In this work, a developmental approach is used to evaluate the acquisition of stigmatic receptivity and its relationship with a possible change in arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs). Flowers of the domestic apple, Malus × domestica, were assessed for their capacity to support pollen germination at different developmental stages. Stigmas from these same stages were characterized morphologically and different AGP epitopes detected by immunocytochemistry. Acquisition of stigmatic receptivity and the secretion of classical AGPs from stigmatic cells occurred concurrently and following the same spatial distribution. While in unpollinated stigmas AGPs appeared unaltered, in cross-pollinated stigmas AGPs epitopes vanished as pollen tubes passed by. The concurrent secretion of AGPs with the acquisition of stigmatic receptivity, together with the differential response in unpollinated and cross-pollinated pistils point out a role of AGPs in supporting pollen tube germination and strongly suggest that secretion of AGPs is associated with the acquisition of stigma receptivity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867887836

A. thaliana reproduces sexually but some Boechera accessions reproduce by apomixis (asexual reproduction by seed). The two species are reproductively isolated, preventing introgression of the trait(s) controlling apomixis from Boechera into A. thaliana and their molecular characterisation. To identify if ""escapers"" from such hybridisation barriers exist, we crossed diploid or tetraploid A. thaliana mothers carrying a conditional male sterile mutation with a triploid Boechera apomict. These cross-pollinations generated zygotes and embryos. Most aborted or suffered multiple developmental defects at all stages of growth, but some seed matured and germinated. Seedlings grew slowly but eventually some developed into mature plants that were novel synthetic allopolyploid hybrids. With one exception, intertribal hybrids contained three Boechera plus either one or two A. thaliana genomes (depending on maternal ploidy) and were male and female sterile. The exception was a semi-fertile, sexual partial hybrid with one Boechera plus two A. thaliana genomes. The synthesis of ""escapers"" that survive rigorous early developmental challenges in crosses between A. thaliana and Boechera demonstrates that the inviability form of postzygotic reproductive isolation separating these distantly related species is not impenetrable. The recovery of a single semi-fertile partial hybrid also demonstrates that hybrid sterility, another form of postzygotic reproductive isolation, can be overcome between these species. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Allopolyploid; Apomixis; Hybrid sterility; Hybridisation barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864362716

Crosses between populations may restore heterozygosity, resulting in increased performance (heterosis), but may also lead to the disruption of coadapted gene complexes and to decreased performance (outbreeding depression). Methods: We investigated the effects of selfing and of within and between population crosses on reproduction and the performance of two generations of offspring of the declining grassland plant Saxifraga granulata (Saxifragaceae). We also subjected the first generation of offspring to a fertilization and two stress treatments (competition and defoliation) to investigate whether the effects of inbreeding and interpopulation gene flow depend on environmental conditions. Key results: Inbreeding depression affected all traits in the F1 generation (? = 0.07-0.55), but was stronger for traits expressed late during development and varied among families. The adaptive plasticity of offspring from selfing and from interpopulation crosses in response to nutrient addition was reduced. Outbreeding depression was also observed in response to stress. Multiplicative fitness of the F2 generation after serial inbreeding was extremely low (? &gt; 0.99), but there was heterosis after crossing inbred lines. Outbreeding depression was not observed in the F2. Conclusions: Continuous inbreeding may drastically reduce the fitness of plants, but effects may be environment-dependent. When assessing the genetic effects of fragmentation and interpopulation crosses, the possible effects on the mean performance of offspring and on its adaptive plasticity should be considered. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Competition; Defoliation; Habitat fragmentation; Heterosis; Inbreeding depression; Nutrient effects; Outbreeding depression; Saxifragaceae; Stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865005838

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of spatial variation in flooding on litterfall. Four plots of 400m 2 were staked out in three stands distributed along a flooding gradient in a 100-ha forest track located in Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles). The structure of the vegetation was characterized in each plot (basal area, density, stand height). Fine litterfall was monitored fortnightly during 24 months using forty-eight 0.5-m 2 litter traps. Water-table level, groundwater salinity and climatic conditions were measured at every collection. Coarse litterfall (fallen trunks and branches, Ø&gt;3cm) was measured every six months on four 100-m 2 subplots in each stand. Regarding fine litterfall (from 10.5 to 14.2Mgha -1y -1 on the study site), the P. officinalis swamp forest appeared to be the most productive forest ecosystem in Guadeloupe and probably also in the whole of the Lesser Antilles. Coarse litterfall ranged from 12 to 20% of total litterfall. Litter production was highest in the most flooded stand which was a tall, almost pure P. officinalis stand. Despite episodic disturbances caused by violent climatic events such as hurricanes, the phenology of the canopy was characterized by the alternation of higher leaf fall during the dry season and massive blooming and fruiting during the rainy season. The phenology of the hemi-parasitic species Psittacanthus martinicensis contrasted with that of the canopy trees making the flowers of this species more visible to pollinators. The relative litter production and the fructification success rate of P. officinalis were lowest in the least flooded stand, suggesting a lower competitiveness of this species on higher grounds. Despite the presence of water at root level, P. officinalis seems to be very sensitive to parching atmospheric conditions. Conversely, its outstanding capacity to cope with high water levels and to store organic carbon in swamp sediments may lend these swamps a promising role in carbon sequestration. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Flooding; Litterfall; Phenology; Primary production; Pterocarpus officinalis; Swamp forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861479243

Although pollination was not controlled, cotyledons from mother trees of old Japanese cultivars and Chinese pears tended to be more regenerable than those from other pear species. Since the rooting ability of the adventitious shoots was very low, micro-grafting was applied to obtain regenerated potted plants from adventitious shoots. Grafted regenerated plants were recovered at a rate of more than 60 %, regardless of cultivar. To our knowledge, this is the first report to evaluate shoot regeneration from cotyledons of major Pyrus species. © 2012 The Society for In Vitro Biology.",Adventitious shoot; Cotyledon; Pyrus; Regeneration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865708905

The results showed that 5 styles with stigmas, free at base, inserted on the upper surface of the ovary. The ovary consisted of 5 fused carpels; the septums, originating from the carpellary margins, divided the ovary into 5 locules, with each locule containing a placenta to which the 2 ovules attached; the locules were lined by a thick cuticle. In the hand-pollination to the only one stigma left (4 styles were removed), seeds were produced only in one locule (fertile locule), while in other 4 locules all the 8 ovules were unfertilized and wilt. 76.67% fertile locules produced two normal seeds and 23.33% fertile locules produced only one normal seed and the other degenerated.

While much attention has focused on the mechanisms that promote the shift to autogamy, there is still a paucity of information on the factors that underlie the reduction of flower size so prevalent in selfing lineages. In this study of Crepis tectorum, I examine the role of inbreeding, acting alone or together with selection, in promoting evolutionary reduction of flower size. Methods: Experimental crosses were performed to produce progeny populations that differed in inbreeding and (or) selection history. Progenies were grown in two different environments and scored for flower size and other characters. Key results: Inbreeding depressed flower and fruit size, but also caused changes in flowering time and the number of heads produced. Despite some inconsistencies in the results for the last progeny generation, the decline in flower size was persistent over generations, consistent across environments, and similar in magnitude to the effects of selection for small flower size and the floral reduction inferred to have taken place during the shift toward autogamy within the study species. The floral size reduction was largely independent of changes in overall vigor, and there was considerable adaptive potential in flower size (measured by sib analyses and parent-offspring comparisons) after inbreeding. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that inbreeding can promote evolutionary reduction of flower size and highlight the close, persistent association between flower and fruit size in the study species. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Adaptive potential; Asteraceae; Crepis tectorum; Floral evolution; Inbreeding depression; Pollination; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865013251

Flowers either possess a relatively long style and short anthers, called a ""pin,"" or a short style and long anthers, called a ""thrum."" This placement of reproductive organs is considered herkogamous and distylous, as it encourages outcrossing by restricting pollination to individuals of the alternate morph. Numerous species have been described as distylous without quantitative data establishing stigma-anther reciprocity. Here we assess those assumptions in H. caerulea by measuring stigma height, anther height and a suite of additional floral traits across multiple localities. All populations surveyed were isoplethic, although variation among them was present in all floral traits measured as well as for pollen diameter, pollen count, flower dry weight, and seed set. Pins produced smaller pollen than thrums, but made more of them. Thus, the total volume of pollen was similar for pins and thrums, and seed set was similar, suggesting that each morph has equal male and female fitness with no movement towards dioecy. Given a significant degree of variation found in the morphometric analysis, and that two of the three measures used to assess reciprocity were not consistent with predictions of precise symmetry, extensive change is possible where selection is acting on these traits. Even so, the distylous mating system in H. caerulea appears to be stable. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Bluets; Distyly; Floral morphology; Flowers; Houstonia; Isoplethy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864389153

Location Southern Africa, defined for this study as South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Methods Climate response surfaces were fitted to model relationships between recorded distributions and reporting rates of 94 species and current bioclimatic variables. These models were used to project species' potential ranges and reporting rates for future climatic scenarios derived from three general circulation models for 30-year periods centred on 2025, 2055 and 2085. Results were summarized for species associated with each biome and examined in detail for 12 species of conservation concern. Results Species richness of fynbos and grassland bird assemblages will potentially decrease by an average of 30-40% by 2085 as a result of projected climatic changes. The areas of greatest richness are projected to decrease in extent and to shift in both cases. Attainment of projected shifts is likely to be limited by extent of untransformed habitat. Most species of conservation concern are projected to decrease in range extent, some by >60%, and to decrease in reporting rate even where they persist, impacts upon their populations thus being greater than might be inferred from decreases in range extent alone. Two species may no longer have any areas of suitable climatic space by 2055; both already appear to be declining rapidly. Main conclusions Species losses are likely to be widespread with most species projected to decrease in range extent. Loss of key species, such as pollinators, may have far-reaching implications for ecosystem function and composition. Conservation strategies, and identification of species of conservation concern, need to be informed by such results, notwithstanding the many uncertainties, because the certainties of climatic change make it essential that likely impacts not to be ignored. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Conservation strategy; Fynbos biome; Grassland biome; Red list species; Southern africa; Species' distribution models,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863582043

In particular, information on worker flight distances to crops blooming several months after nests have been established is invaluable. Here, we examined foraging patterns of Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski in late-season blooming clover in the agriculturaldominated Willamette Valley in Oregon. Workers from 10 fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from 433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year. Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11.6 km, half the distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies. Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to 163. Overall, 165 (50%) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and thus used common resources within the landscape. Estimates of average nest densities in the landscape each year ranged from 0.76/km 2 to 22.16/km 2, and highlighted the influences of various study parameters incorporated into the calculation including sample size, distances between sites, and analytical tools used to estimate unsampled individuals. Based on the results, bumble bees can fly long distances, and this could facilitate their survival in fragmented agricultural landscapes.

Design/methodology/approach: Theorists such as Bransford et al. argue that twenty-first century educators need to teach students to do more than simply remember and repeat information. Engineering educators Prince and Felder critique traditional methods of teaching in which instructors focus on mathematics and theory, but fail to convey practical applications of that knowledge. They advocate moving students to a higher level of learning - past the stage of memorizing and reciting data - to more sophisticated methods of analysis, synthesis, and application of knowledge. To enact such transformations, Prince and Felder recommend ""inductive teaching methods,"" including ""inquiry-based learning,"" in which students learn through engaging with challenges and a series of questions. The paper provides examples of inquiry-based learning activities from each of the authors. The paper then discusses the cross-pollination of ideas and describes how the authors have shared inquiry-based teaching strategies and collaborated to develop new and relevant assignments and approaches to teaching. Findings: The willingness of learners to discuss a range of pedagogical topics, from specific practices to shared experiences and readings, led to an exchange of ideas, and also to deeper reflections on current practices. The cross-pollination of assignments and techniques resulted in well-structured, stimulating, and relevant research projects that engage engineering students from Texas to Portugal, and from communication to technical classes. Research limitations/implications: The use of inquiry-based learning activities and the sharing of resources across continents aimed at improving learning and teaching requires expanding upon and further development.

In view of expected climatic changes, the responses of trees at their xeric limits may largely be determined by their capacity to cope with augmented environmental variance. We assess the heritability of early survival of Patagonian cypress in two common-garden field tests with contrasting summer water deficits, comprising 140 and 163 open-pollinated families from 10 marginal xeric populations. The first experiment underwent less rigorous conditions than the average mesic, Mediterranean climatic conditions, which were sufficient to reveal additive genetic effects of summer drought on seedling survival. The second trial suffered strong summer water-deficit stress and a winter extreme cold event. In this harsher environment, the heritabilities of survival under summer water-deficit stress were high in all the populations (h 2 = 0. 84 on average), while the heritabilities of seasonal, extreme cold survival were moderate or even nil (h 2 = 0. 28 on average). We did not find evidence of genetic differentiation among populations in their capabilities to survive droughts and cold extremes. Our results indicate that even when climatic changes were strong enough to cause the extinction of the most threatened populations, heritable variation for traits underlying drought and cold tolerances may allow the marginal xeric edge of cypress to persist under augmented environmental variance, without losing overall genetic diversity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Fitness components; Mediterranean climate; Southern conifers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865535341

We investigated this question in the context of closely related, bumble bee-pollinated plants (Pedicularis spp.) in the Hengduan Mountains of south-central China, where they exhibit spectacular levels of richness, endemism, and floral diversity. Because these species co-occur frequently, flower synchronously, and share pollinators during the brief reproductive season, we predict that pollinator-mediated interactions may influence their community assembly and evolutionary diversification. If disparity in floral traits reduces competitive interactions between species, as would happen if floral isolation mitigates reproductive interference caused by heterospecific pollen flow, then species with dissimilar flowers should co-occur more often, yielding greater floral diversity at local scales than expected by chance. Moreover, if such interactions have repeatedly driven character displacement, then floral traits should exhibit homoplasy, the phylogenetic signature of labile evolution. We present evidence supporting these predictions, and find that local species richness is best explained by a model including both floral diversity and phylogenetic distance. Our results suggest that a dynamic mosaic of pollinator-mediated interactions among Pedicularis in the Hengduan region promotes ecological sorting through recurrent selection against reproductive interference, causing rapid species turnover at local scales, and accelerating the rate of floral divergence among species. Together these processes may have contributed to the remarkable accumulation of florally diverse species of Pedicularis endemic to the Hengduan Mountains biodiversity hotspot. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Biodiversity hotspot; Coexistence; Floral isolation; Hengduan Mountains; Phylogenetic ecology; Reproductive character displacement; Reproductive interference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875735219

However, the emergence of polyploid individuals does not guarantee the establishment of a new lineage, and the relationship between polyploidy and reproductive biology is therefore relevant. Libidibia ferrea is a legume tree that has diploid and tetraploid populations. In this work we analyse the reproductive biology of the species to verify the degree of reproductive isolation between the two cytotypes. Observations on phenology, floral morphology, biology, and visitors, breeding system, reproductive success and reproductive isolation were made for both cytotypes in two municipalities of northeastern Brazil. Cytotypes differed for all morphometric parameters analysed, with tetraploids exhibiting higher mean values than diploids. Both cytotypes had the same effective pollinators (native bees from the genera Centris and Xylocopa, and the introduced Apis mellifera). However, since stamens of diploids and tetraploids were of different size, it is possible that spatial separation occurs when pollen of each cytotype is deposited on a bee's body. Diploids were self-incompatible (ISI = 0) and exhibited high fruit-set after intraploidy crossing (20%), whereas tetraploids were self-compatible (ISI = 0.47) and set only 3.9% of fruits after intraploidy crossing. Both cytotypes showed low fruit- and seed-set under natural conditions, and there was no fruit-set after crosses between them. Data are discussed in relation to the establishment of polyploids, to the pattern of distribution of the species and to the taxonomic implications. The cytotypes of L. ferrea should be considered as distinct species, since they are reproductively isolated from each other. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Autopolyploidy; Biosystematics; Caatinga; Fabaceae; Polyploidy; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864381295

There are a number of anonymisation techniques which have been proposed for privacy preservation in social network data. Not all the anonymisation techniques have been able to provide the desired privacy as they ignore one or more critical parameters. The purpose of this paper is to propose the parameters for anonymisation of released social network data based on the cross-pollination of information related to anonymisation of social network data. Analysing the anonymisation techniques on these parameters would provide a clear understanding in a more realist dimension. These parameters would help the service provider of the social network for choosing the suitable anonymisation technique. These parameters would also help the future researchers to design or improve the anonymisation technique for privacy preservation in social network.

Recent evidence indicates that PIN proteins may play a role in fruit set and early fruit development in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), but functional analyses of PIN-silenced plants failed to corroborate this hypothesis. Here it is demonstrated that silencing specifically the tomato SlPIN4 gene, which is predominantly expressed in tomato flower bud and young developing fruit, leads to parthenocarpic fruits due to precocious fruit development before fertilization. This phenotype was associated with only slight modifications of auxin homeostasis at early stages of flower bud development and with minor alterations of ARF and Aux/IAA gene expression. However, microarray transcriptome analysis and large-scale quantitative RT-PCR profiling of transcription factors in developing flower bud and fruit highlighted differentially expressed regulatory genes, which are potential targets for auxin control of fruit set and development in tomato. In conclusion, this work provides clear evidence that the tomato PIN protein SlPIN4 plays a major role in auxin regulation of tomato fruit set, possibly by preventing precocious fruit development in the absence of pollination, and further gives new insights into the target genes involved in fruit set. © 2012 The Author.",Auxin efflux transport protein (PIN); CRABS-CLAW; fruit set; MADS-BOX; parthenocarpy; tomato (Solanum lycopersicum); transcription factor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865486286

The quality of its pulp makes it the most important hardwood species in the world. The importance of E. globulus prompted the establishment of common gardens from seed collected across its geographic range. This enabled us to study the genetic structure of the species, its population boundaries, and gene flow using 444 trees from different open-pollinated families that were genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci. A Bayesian clustering method was used to resolve five genetically distinct groups across the geographical range. These groups were identified as regions, which varied in diameter from 38 to 294 km and contain 4 to 16 putative populations. For two of these regional groups, we used spatial autocorrelation analysis based on assignment of trees to their natural stands to examine gene flow within each region. Consistent significant local-scale spatial structure occurred in both regions. Pairs of individuals within a region showed significant genetic similarity that extended beyond 40 km, suggesting distant movement of pollen. This suggests that breeding populations in E. globulus are much bigger than traditionally accepted in eucalypts. Our results are important for the management of genetic diversity and breeding populations in E. globulus. Similar studies of a variety of eucalypts pollinated by insects and birds will determine whether the local-scale genetic structure of E. globulus is unusual. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Eucalyptus globulus; Genetic structure; Microsatellite; Population genetics; Simple sequence repeats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865532897

Resistance to head smut has been proven to be a quantitative inherited trait. In our previous study, a major resistance quantitative trait locus (named qHSR1) was detected on maize chromosome 2 (bin 2. 09), and a number of molecular markers have been developed in the qHSR1 region. Here, we report the marker-assisted introgression of qHSR1 to improve maize resistance to head smut. The 10 maize inbred lines, namely Ji853, 444, 98107, 99094, Chang7-2, V022, V4, 982, 8903, and 8902, which have high yield potential but are susceptible to head smut, were selected for resistance improvement. Each of the 10 high-yielding lines was crossed with a donor parent Ji1037 that is completely resistant to head smut, followed by five generations of backcrossing to the respective recurrent parent. Marker-assisted foreground selection was conducted to identify qHSR1. Recombinant selection was carried out in the fourth backcross (BC4) generation by using the flanking markers to reduce the size of the Ji1037 donor segment carrying qHSR1. Background selection was performed in the BC5 generation with genome-wide SSR markers to select the line with the highest recovery rate of the recurrent parent genome. Self-pollination was conducted twice for the BC5 plant with both the shortest qHSR1 region and the highest recovery rate to obtain converted inbred lines harboring qHSR1. The 10 converted inbred lines all showed substantial improvement in resistance to head smut. Furthermore, the hybrids prepared from the converted lines also showed significant increase in resistance to head smut, while remaining mostly unchanged for other agronomic traits. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Head smut; Maize; Marker-assisted selection; qHSR1; Resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865409673

The prevailing hypothesis concerning their decline is the transmission of the intracellular fungal pathogen. Nosema bombi (Microsporida), and other pathogen species from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations. While N. bombi incidence has been investigated in the contiguous U.S.A. and Canada, virtually nothing is known about the status of Alaskan bumble bees. This study presents the distribution and relative abundance of B. occidentalis and B. moderatus, two co-occurring species in the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto, in Alaska and the prevalence of N. bombi detected in these species. Bombus occidentalis and B. moderatus accounted for 28% and 4% of the 942 bumble bees surveyed, respectively. Bombus occidentalis was the most abundant species collected in the survey and prevalence of N. bombi infections (44% infected) was also highest in this species. The proportion of infected B. moderatus did not differ significantly from other co-occurring bumble bees. Despite the presence of N. bombi infections, both Bombus s. str. species were commonly detected in Alaska with our survey method.

Inclusion of floral resources may be particularly useful in conserving many beneficial insects, where groups including pollinators and pest natural enemies often rely on nectar and pollen during (at least part of) their life-cycle. As not all flowers are equally suited to all beneficial insects, selection of appropriate flowering plants is key to ensuring that conservation targets are met and benefits to ecosystems services realised as a result. This short paper describes an experiment conducted to assess the 'total temporal attractiveness' of a range of British wildflowers to selected functional insect groups. The results obtained demonstrate that flowering period alone is a poor indicator of plant suitability to insects, where no relationship existed between this and attraction to insects overall. Data also suggest that, based on attraction over a season, certain flowering plants are more likely to be of general insect conservation value and/or benefit to functional insect groups than others. Attraction to pest insects was also considered, with relatively high catches of thrips and pollen beetles observed in flowering stands of some plants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ecosystem services; Floral attraction; Functional biodiversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864278484

However, many species exhibit a delayed response to environmental changes because of the slow intrinsic dynamics of populations, resulting in extinction debt. We assess directly the changes in habitat characteristic species composition by comparing historical (1923) and current inventories in highly fragmented grasslands. We aim to characterize the species that constitute extinction debt in European calcareous grasslands. Location Europe, Estonia, 59-60°N, 24-25°E. Methods We related eleven life-history traits and selected habitat preferences to local extinctions of populations in grasslands where extinction debt has been largely paid. Traits were chosen to describe species dispersal and persistence abilities and were quantified from databases. Results The studied grasslands have lost 90% of their area and 30% of their characteristic plant populations in 90years. Species more prone to local population extinction were characterized by shorter life span, self-pollination, a lack of clonal growth, fewer seeds per shoot, lower average height, lower soil nitrogen preference and higher requirements for light, indicating a limited ability to tolerate the range of changes in biotic and abiotic conditions of the sites. Locally extinct populations were also characterized by wind-dispersed seeds, lower seed weight and lower terminal velocity of seeds, suggesting that species strategies for long-distance dispersal are not favoured in highly fragmented landscapes. Thus, both increased habitat isolation and decreased habitat quality are important in determining local population extinction. Main conclusions Populations more prone to local extinction were characterized by a number of life-history traits, demonstrating a greater extinction risk for species with poorer abilities for local persistence and competition. Our results can be applied to less degraded grasslands where the extinction debt is not yet paid to determine those species most susceptible to future extinction. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Dispersal; Habitat degradation; Habitat loss; Life-history traits; Metacommunity; Persistence; Phylogenetic analyses,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863589620

The recurrent evolution of self-compatible homostyly from obligately outcrossing heterostylous species has been regarded as a classic example of evolutionary response to lack of pollinators or mates, as homostyly frequently occurs in pollinator-limited or marginal environments. However, male and female sexual organs of homostylous species may display spatial separation (herkogamy), an arrangement presumed to promote outcrossing. It is largely unknown to what extent variation in herkogamy affects opportunities for autonomous selfing and reproductive assurance in self-compatible, homostylous species. 2. Using the homostylous Primula halleri, restricted to alpine environments, we investigated whether herkogamy occurs and varies during anthesis, among individuals, and populations, and compared the effects of herkogamy on seed set among three experimental treatments, to elucidate how herkogamy affects reproductive strategies in a homostylous species. 3. Herkogamy decreases during anthesis, but the ultimate expression of herkogamy in mature flowers differs among individuals and populations. Caging caging experiments indicate that herkogamy reduces a plant's potential for autonomous selfing, and emasculation and open-pollination treatments demonstrate that herkogamy markedly decreases total seed set and the potential for reproductive assurance. 4. Herkogamy early in anthesis may enhance outcrossing potential, while its decrease later could enable reproductive assurance via delayed autonomous selfing in some, but not all plants. Conversely, pronounced herkogamy in older flowers comes at the cost of reduced total reproductive output and imposes pollinator dependence for reproduction, but may promote the genetic diversity of populations. 5. Our study suggests that even small amounts of herkogamy can have large effects on the reproductive strategy of homostylous species, by enabling more outcrossing than generally thought to be typical of homostyly. © 2012 The Authors.

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and undergo reciprocal genetic exchange, termed crossover (CO). Meiotic CO frequency varies along the physical length of chromosomes and is determined by hierarchical mechanisms, including epigenetic organization, for example methylation of the DNA and histones. Here we investigate the role of DNA methylation in determining patterns of CO frequency along Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes. In A. thaliana the pericentromeric regions are repetitive, densely DNA methylated, and suppressed for both RNA polymerase-II transcription and CO frequency. DNA hypomethylated methyltransferase1 (met1) mutants show transcriptional reactivation of repetitive sequences in the pericentromeres, which we demonstrate is coupled to extensive remodeling of CO frequency. We observe elevated centromere-proximal COs in met1, coincident with pericentromeric decreases and distal increases. Importantly, total numbers of CO events are similar between wild type and met1, suggesting a role for interference and homeostasis in CO remodeling. To understand recombination distributions at a finer scale we generated CO frequency maps close to the telomere of chromosome 3 in wild type and demonstrate an elevated recombination topology in met1. Using a pollen-typing strategy we have identified an intergenic nucleosome-free CO hotspot 3a, and we demonstrate that it undergoes increased recombination activity in met1. We hypothesize that modulation of 3a activity is caused by CO remodeling driven by elevated centromeric COs. These data demonstrate how regional epigenetic organization can pattern recombination frequency along eukaryotic chromosomes. © 2012 Yelina et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866168941

Gene expression analysis of salt-tolerant wheat lines, W4909 and W4910, compared with the CS common wheat background led to the discovery of several expressed sequences that were absent in the CS accession held in our laboratory. A survey of 20 CS accessions from 13 laboratories using the polymerase chain reaction with gene-specific primers for eight salt-responsive genes resulted in amplification success ranging from 15 to 100%. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that 99% of the genetic variation was among the accessions while the remaining 1% was within the accessions. A neighbour-joining phylogram showed that four of the five CS accessions from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) grouped with the salt-tolerant wheat cultivar Yecora Rojo while the remaining 16 CS accessions had limited genetic differences.

These interactions may depend on landscape patterns and bumble bee traits. We studied the abundance, colony density, and foraging range in long-tongued Bombus diversus Smith and short-tongued B. hypocrita Pérez, and evaluated their visits to flowers of wild plants and cultivated kabocha squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne). In forests in a farmland, B. hypocrita workers were trapped more frequently in the canopy. Full-sibs determined by nuclear microsatellite genotypes among workers collected in the farmland showed higher colony density and a larger foraging radius in B. hypocrita (30. 8 km-2 and 848 m) than in B. diversus (8. 3 km-2 and 723 m), respectively. Regarding wild plants, workers more frequently visited shallow flowers in B. hypocrita and deep flowers in B. diversus. These results suggest that bumble bees with different traits forage on different wild flowers in different habitats. Squash flowers were visited by both bumble bee species at similar frequency in the latter period of colony growth when males and new queens appeared. Composition of full-sib workers visiting squash and wild flowers did not depend on the number of collected workers of individual colonies, indicating that foraging on squash flowers was not associated with colony growth. Thus, growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies may be supported by various wild plants and cultivated squash, respectively. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.",Bombus diversus; Bombus hypocrita; Colony density; Cucurbita maxima; Foraging range,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865716526

The trials included approximately 400 open-pollinated families, encompassing 51 native stand collection localities and 19 subraces from throughout the geographic range of the species. Data were analysed using mixed models, with spatial analysis used to better identify genetic effects. Significant subrace differences in drought damage were detected, with both broad-scale, regional and localised clines evident. The quantitative genetic differentiation between subraces as measured by Q ST (0. 39 ± 0. 091) was significantly greater than the F ST for neutral marker expectations and consistent with diversifying selection shaping the patterns of subrace divergence in drought susceptibility. This conclusion is supported by the significant association of subrace drought susceptibility with bioclimatic parameters, particularly those associated with temperature seasonality. Less drought damage was observed in subraces originating from areas with more temperature seasonality, but also less radiation and rainfall seasonality, less winter rainfall, higher radiation and higher temperatures in the warmest month. Significant additive genetic variation in drought damage was detected within subraces, with narrow-sense heritabilities ranging from 0. 14 to 0. 20. We argue that spatial genetic variation in drought susceptibility of E. globulus has been shaped by natural selection acting at multiple scales and discuss opportunities for exploiting this genetic variation in breeding and deployment programs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Adaptation; Breeding; Drought; Eucalyptus; Evolution; Heritability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865540800

We investigated the potential for hybridization between the exotic hybrid Populus x canadensis Moench and its wild relative, the European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), by a series of pollination experiments in the greenhouse. We also tested the effect of mixtures of pollen from the taxon's own pollen and pollen of the foreign taxon on mating success in reciprocal crosses. We observed reduced pollen and seed viability of the hybrid clones of P. x canadensis compared to the clones of the parental species P. nigra. Surprisingly, when in combination with pollen of its wild relative P. nigra, pollen of exotic P. x canadensis sired significantly better on its own flowers. In poplar breeding, the pollen mentor technique which uses pollen mixes of artificially inactivated conspecific pollen and untreated incompatible foreign pollen, has been successfully used to overcome incompatibility barriers.

If a genome sequence is not available, an alternative strategy must be used. We previously reported the development of a pipeline (AGSNP) for genome-wide SNP discovery in coding sequences and other single-copy DNA without a complete genome sequence in self-pollinating (autogamous) plants. Here we updated this pipeline for SNP discovery in outcrossing (allogamous) species and demonstrated its efficacy in SNP discovery in walnut (Juglans regia L.).Results: The first step in the original implementation of the AGSNP pipeline was the construction of a reference sequence and the identification of single-copy sequences in it. To identify single-copy sequences, multiple genome equivalents of short SOLiD reads of another individual were mapped to shallow genome coverage of long Sanger or Roche 454 reads making up the reference sequence. The relative depth of SOLiD reads was used to filter out repeated sequences from single-copy sequences in the reference sequence. The second step was a search for SNPs between SOLiD reads and the reference sequence. Polymorphism within the mapped SOLiD reads would have precluded SNP discovery; hence both individuals had to be homozygous. The AGSNP pipeline was updated here for using SOLiD or other type of short reads of a heterozygous individual for these two principal steps. A total of 32.6X walnut genome equivalents of SOLiD reads of vegetatively propagated walnut scion cultivar 'Chandler' were mapped to 48,661 'Chandler' bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (BESs) produced by Sanger sequencing during the construction of a walnut physical map. A total of 22,799 putative SNPs were initially identified. A total of 6,000 Infinium II type SNPs evenly distributed along the walnut physical map were selected for the construction of an Infinium BeadChip, which was used to genotype a walnut mapping population having 'Chandler' as one of the parents. Genotyping results were used to adjust the filtering parameters of the updated AGSNP pipeline. With the adjusted filtering criteria, 69.6% of SNPs discovered with the updated pipeline were real and could be mapped on the walnut genetic map. A total of 13,439 SNPs were discovered by BES re-sequencing. BESs harboring SNPs were in 677 FPC contigs covering 98% of the physical map of the walnut genome.Conclusion: The updated AGSNP pipeline is a versatile SNP discovery tool for a high-throughput, genome-wide SNP discovery in both autogamous and allogamous species. With this pipeline, a large set of SNPs were identified in a single walnut cultivar. © 2012 You et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",AGSNP; BAC; BAC end sequence; Genome sequence; Infinium; Physical map; Single nucleotide polymorphism; SOLiD; Walnut,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864372382

It can be estimated indirectly through carbon isotope discrimination (?). In general, plants of more arid origins have lower values of ?. In order to study the degree of genetic control of this parameter and the genetic variation in ? of Patagonian Cypress seedlings, three Argentinean natural populations chosen to represent two contrasting precipitation regimes were sampled in a common garden trial. The dry situation was represented by two neighboring marginal forest patches from the steppe, while the humid condition was represented by a population with 1,200 mm higher mean annual precipitation. Height (H) and ? were measured in 246 five-year-old seedlings from 41 open-pollinated families. The factor 'family' had a significant effect on both variables; however heritability for ? was found not to be significant in two out of the three populations. This could be explained by low sample size in one of them and by a real evolutionary effect in the other. An inverse association between H and ? was verified, which is interpreted as evidence of an adaptation process at the intra-population level. The studied populations were not shown to discriminate carbon isotopes differently; hence evidence of adaptation to current environmental conditions could not be obtained. On the other hand, the arid populations proved to be quite different in terms of genetic variation, which seems to be the consequence of genetic drift and isolation.",Adaptation; Austrocedrus chilensis; Differentiation; Genetic drift,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864319272

Study results showed that the two Epicephala species jointly pollinated the two Breynia species, which led to a unique obligate pollination mutualism of two-to-two species specificity. A single Epicephala larva exclusively fed on seeds of host plants and developed to maturity by consuming all six seeds of each fruit, whereas a fraction of intact fruits were left to ensure the reproduction of plants within the whole population. Larvae of the two Epicephala species are competitive for resources; the population of E. mirivalvata is much smaller than that of E. lativalvaris, which has resulted from the differences in the female ovipositor structures and oviposition mode. The life history of Epicephala species highly coincides with the phenology of Breynia plants, and different phenology of B. fruticosa resulted in the different life history of the two Epicephala species in Hainan and Fujian.

Among them, several Habenaria species present specialized mechanisms, where pollination success depends on the attachment of pollinaria onto the heads of hawkmoths with very long proboscises. However, in the Neotropical region such moths are less abundant than their shorter-tongued relatives and are also prone to population fluctuations. Both factors may give rise to differences in pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits through time and space. Methodology/Principal Findings: We characterized hawkmoth assemblages and estimated phenotypic selection gradients on orchid spur lengths in populations of three South American Habenaria species. We examined the match between hawkmoth proboscis and flower spur lengths to determine whether pollinators may act as selective agents on flower morphology. We found significant directional selection on spur length only in Habenaria gourlieana, where most pollinators had proboscises longer than the mean of orchid spur length. Conclusions/Significance: Phenotypic selection is dependent on the mutual match between pollinator and flower morphologies. However, our findings indicate that pollinator-mediated selection may vary through time and space according to local variations in pollinator assemblages. © 2012 Moré et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864370879

The pollen-mediated activation tagging system was established by artificial pollination. The pollens, co-cultured with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 harbouring an activation tagging vector (pTAG-8), were used for pollination. In order to optimize the transformation efficiency, several factors (concentration of A. tumefaciens, concentration of acetosyringone during co-cultivation and the duration of co-cultivation) known to influence Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer were examined. A concentration of 0.5-1 x 108 CFU/ml for A. tumefaciens, 0.1 mM acetosyringone, and 6 hrs of co-culture period were found to be the optimal condition for high transformation efficiency. Integration of T-DNA into the genome of putative transgenic plants was confirmed by PCR and DNA blot analyses. Single copy of the transgene was observed in all transgenic plants analyzed. Most of the transgenic plants had a morphologically normal phenotype and the overall capsule formation efficiency was similar to control plant.

The hind legs of workers, which are highly specialized pollinators, deserve special attention. The hind tibia of worker has an expanded bristle-free region used for carrying pollen and propolis, the corbicula. In queens this structure is absent. Although the morphological differences are well characterized, the genetic inputs driving the development of this alternative morphology remain unknown. Leg phenotype determination takes place between the fourth and fifth larval instar and herein we show that the morphogenesis is completed at brown-eyed pupa. Using results from the hybridization of whole genome-based oligonucleotide arrays with RNA samples from hind leg imaginal discs of pre-pupal honeybees of both castes we present a list of 200 differentially expressed genes. Notably, there are castes preferentially expressed cuticular protein genes and members of the P450 family. We also provide results of qPCR analyses determining the developmental transcription profiles of eight selected genes, including abdominal-A, distal-less and ultrabithorax (Ubx), whose roles in leg development have been previously demonstrated in other insect models. Ubx expression in workers hind leg is approximately 25 times higher than in queens. Finally, immunohistochemistry assays show that Ubx localization during hind leg development resembles the bristles localization in the tibia/basitarsus of the adult legs in both castes. Our data strongly indicate that the development of the hind legs diphenism characteristic of this corbiculate species is driven by a set of caste-preferentially expressed genes, such as those encoding cuticular protein genes, P450 and Hox proteins, in response to the naturally different diets offered to honeybees during the larval period. © 2012 Bomtorin et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864327458

Herein, we examined the effects of noise pollution on pollination and seed dispersal and seedling establishment within a study system that isolated the effects of noise from confounding stimuli common to human-altered landscapes. Using observations, vegetation surveys and pollen transfer and seed removal experiments, we found that effects of noise pollution can reverberate through communities by disrupting or enhancing these ecological services. Specifically, noise pollution indirectly increased artificial flower pollination by hummingbirds, but altered the community of animals that prey upon and disperse Pinus edulis seeds, potentially explaining reduced P. edulis seedling recruitment in noisy areas. Despite evidence that some ecological services, such as pollination, may benefit indirectly owing to noise, declines in seedling recruitment for key-dominant species such as P. edulis may have dramatic long-term effects on ecosystem structure and diversity. Because the extent of noise pollution is growing, this study emphasizes that investigators should evaluate the ecological consequences of noise alongside other human-induced environmental changes that are reshaping human-altered landscapes worldwide. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Anthropogenic noise; Birds; Ecological service; Human disturbance; Pollination; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862120789

Our objective is to model the movements of honey bees and determine the conditions under which they will forage in less favorable areas of a tree and its surroundings when other pollinators are present. We hypothesize that foraging in less favorable areas leads to increased movement between trees and increased cross pollination between varieties which is required for successful nut production. We use the Shigesada-Kawasaki-Teramoto model (1979) which describes the density of two species in a two-dimensional environment of variable favorableness with respect to intrinsic diffusions and intra and interspecific interactions of species. The model is applied to almond pollination by honey bees and other pollinators with environmental favorableness based on the distribution of flowers in trees. Using the spectral-Galerkin method in a rectangular domain, we numerically approximated the two-dimensional nonlinear parabolic partial differential system arising in the model. When cross-diffusion or interspecific effects of other pollinators was high, honey bees foraged in less favorable areas of the tree. In the model, high cross-diffusion also resulted in increased activity in honey bees which manifested itself in the field in terms of accelerations, decelerations, and changes in direction, indicating rapid redistribution of densities to an equilibrium state. Empirical analysis of the number of honey bees and other visitors in 2-min intervals to almond trees shows a negative relationship, indicating cross-diffusion effects in nature with the potential to increase movement to a different tree with a more favorable environment, potentially increasing nut production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Cross- and self-diffusion; Galerkin method; Insect pollination; Intraspecific and interspecific interactions; Pollination services,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860378388

Our revision aims to discuss about specialization and evolution in pollination systems in the context of mutualism theory. We illustrate this discussion with four of the most well-studied examples of specialized pollination. The concept of mutualism has changed through history, being nowadays considered as an exploitation relationship with net benefits to all interacting species. In this scenario, the mutualistic interactions can be grouped into two categories: (1) facultative - when there is no exclusive dependence between species; and (2) obligatory - when the interacting species cannot survive outside of the relationship. Some interactions under the obligatory mutualism seem to have high degree of specialization and exclusivity between partners, being called extreme mutualisms. Here, we discuss the following potentially extreme pollination mutualism: (I) long corolla flowers and the hawk moths of Sphingidae family, (II) figs and fig-wasps, (III) yuccas and yucca-moths, and (IV) malesof Euglossini bees and orchids. Then, we discuss the underlying possible evolutionary process leading to the current scenario of such specialized relationships is presented. Although some high specialized species-specific pollination interaction can potently exist, in general, in the discussed exemples, these relationships seem to have evolved under diffuse selection pressure.

This relationship predicts that the link number of species interactions increases with habitat area, and structure is related to habitat area. Biological invasions can affect species interactions and area relationships. However, how these relationships change at different spatial scales has remained unexplored. We analysed understory plant-pollinator networks in seven temperate forest sites at 20 spatial scales (radius 120-2020 m) to clarify scale-associated relationships between forest area and plant-pollinator networks.Results: The pooled data described interactions between 18 plant (including an exotic) and 89 pollinator (including an exotic) species. The total number of species and the number of interaction links between plant and pollinator species were negatively correlated with forest area, with the highest correlation coefficient at radii of 1520 and 1620 m, respectively. These results are not concordant with the pattern predicted by species-area relationships. However, when associations with exotic species were excluded, the total number of species and the number of interaction links were positively correlated with forest area (the highest correlation coefficient at a radius of 820 m). The network structure, i.e., connectance and nestedness, was also related to forest area (the highest correlation coefficients at radii of 720-820 m), when associations with exotics were excluded. In the study area, the exotic plant species Alliaria petiolata, which has invaded relatively small forest patches surrounded by agricultural fields, may have supported more native pollinator species than initially expected. Therefore, this invasive plant may have altered the original relationships between forest area and plant-pollinator networks.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate scale-dependent effects of forest area on the size and structure of plant-pollinator networks. We also suggest that a single exotic plant species can impact plant-pollinator networks, even in temperate continental habitats. © 2012 Sugiura and Taki; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Alliaria petiolata; Biological invasion; Forest area; Mutualistic networks; Plant-pollinator interactions; Species-area relationships,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871072295

A total of 3186 flowering plant individuals were visited by hummingbirds, belonging to 67 species, 29 genera and 12 families. The mean nectar volume per flower and day was 38.6 ?l with a high interspecific variability (SD 153.5 ?l) [calculated without the bat blossoms of Ceiba: 20.2 ?l (SD 30.2 *1)]. Nectar sugars revealed an average concentration of 18.8% (SD 4.4%), with a preponderance of sucrose in a subset of species analysed by HPLC. This supports that the majority of the investigated plant species is in fact ornithophilous and regularly pollinated by hummingbirds. Short-term changes in the quantity and composition of the nectar resources were characteristic for the observed dynamics. Considered in terms of energy available, resource levels attained their maximum in a rainy month (April) and were at a minimum in a drier month (January). However, it was not possible to show significant correlations between measured precipitation and either the number of flowers or the amount of energy available. Only 27 of the 67 hummingbird-visited plant species could be verified to contribute substantially to the nectar resources; these species either flowered at least during one third of the year (contributing less than 10% of energy/day), or they contributed at least at one observation date more than 10% of the total energy available.

Trigona spinipes is a widely distributed species in South America, and described as a pollinator of many crops that can be used in a commercial pollinating system. The effects of plant extracts on insects are studied because of the demand for organic food and their selectivity to natural enemies. Plant insecticides are reported as a potential agent for the control of insect pests, however little is known about their impact on beneficial insects. This study investigated the survival of Trigona spinipes (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Meliponini) Fabricius, after exposure to the leaf extracts of Azadiracha indica (Meliaceae), Lippia sidoides ( Verbenaceae), Sapindus saponaria (Sapindaceae), Anonna squamosa (Anonnaceae) Cymbopogon winterianum (Poaceae), Corimbia citriodora (Myrtaceae), Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae) and Ricinus communis (Euphorbiaceae) and of seeds of Azadiracha indica, Ricinus communis Nordestina and AL Guarany varieties and jatropha curcas.

The best results came out between 08:00 to 11:00h for manual out-crossing of AP, while the time from 12:00 to 18:00h showed a decreasing trend. Moreover, 12mm style length was found as the most proper phenological stage in terms of stigmatic receptivity to perform out-crossing in this plant. All in all, AP behaved unlikely in each combination, and a significant difference was observed in crossability of AP accessions (P 0.01).

Within this context, angiosperms are unique in the degree to which they have shifted reproductive functions away from their ovules to associated tissues and organs. This is particularly true in regard to the carpel, which has assumed roles in pollination, seed protection, and seed dispersal previously restricted to the ovule itself. Perhaps as a consequence, angiosperm ovule development is more efficient than in nearly all other groups of living and extinct seed plants, where reproductive functions often constrain both patterns of development and the allocation of resources. For example, many living gymnosperm species are as efficient as angiosperms in minimizing ovule development prior to pollination, but they require a megagametophyte for embryo provisioning that constrains their efficiency in minimizing investment prior to fertilization. By decoupling ovules from pollination, the carpel also fundamentally altered the way in which pollination occurs in angiosperms relative to other seed plants. In particular, this change gave angiosperms greater control over the spatial positioning of their reproductive organs and may have therefore expanded the types of reproductive structures angiosperms could develop and the specificity with which these structures could interact with pollinators. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Ovules and their associated female gametophytes became greatly reduced in size, resulting in the precocious production of eggs and a greatly abbreviated pollination-to-fertilization period. The shift to small ovules was accompanied by the origin of an enclosing carpel (angiospermy) and associated accessory organs that together formed a small and ephemeral reproductive shoot, or flower. An unappreciated innovation, which arose within the context of these reductions in size and the longevity of reproductive tissues, was a set of traits that gave ancestrally slow-growing pollen tubes the capacity to evolve faster growth rates. Angiosperm pollen tube walls consist largely of callose and contain far less material than do tube walls of other seed plants, which have little or no callose but high cellulose and pectin content. This and other aspects of their novel wall architecture are hypothesized to be more energy-efficient and susceptible to faster construction rates, consequently allowing pollen tubes to begin evolving faster rates of tube elongation. The novelties of carpel closure and other ancient explorations of carpel-derived pollen tube pathways are hypothesized to have lagged early pollen tube architectural innovations. Rapid diversification of pollen tube growth rates occurred within the context of a new wall architecture via an interplay of changes in metabolic rates, wall production rates, and/or wall dimensions. The evolutionary lability of flowering plant pollen tube growth rate enabled a developmental dissociation of the pollen reception apparatus (the stigma) from the egg-bearing structure (the ovule), making possible a tremendous diversification in sizes and life spans of new floral and fruit organs. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Morindeae (Rubiaceae) display considerable diversity in growth form, inflorescence architecture, flower size, and fruit type. Lianescent habit, head inflorescence, small flower, and multiple fruit are the predominant states, but arborescent habit, non-headed inflorescence, large flower, and simple fruit states occur in various genera. This makes Morindeae an ideal model for exploring the evolutionary appearances and transitions between the states of these characters. We reconstructed ancestral states for these four traits using a Bayesian approach and combined nuclear/chloroplast data for 61 Morindeae species. The aim was to test three hypotheses: 1) self-supporting habit is generally ancestral in clades comprising both lianescent and arborescent species; 2) changes from lianescent to arborescent habit are uncommon due to ""a high degree of specialization and developmental burden""; 3) head inflorescences and multiple fruits in Morindeae evolved from non-headed inflorescences and simple fruits, respectively. Lianescent habit, head inflorescence, large flower, and multiple fruit are inferred for Morindeae, making arborescent habit, non-headed inflorescence, small flower, and simple fruit derived within the tribe. The rate of change from lianescent to arborescent habit is much higher than the reverse change. Therefore, evolutionary changes between lianescent and arborescent forms can be reversible, and their frequency and trends vary between groups. Moreover, these changes are partly attributed to a scarcity of host trees for climbing plants in more open habitats. Changes from large to small flowers might have been driven by shifts to pollinators with progressively shorter proboscis, which are associated with shifts in breeding systems towards dioecy. A single origin of dioecy from hermaphroditism is supported. Finally, we report evolutionary changes from headed to non-headed inflorescences and multiple to simple fruits. © 2012 Razafimandimbison et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864023329

Analysis showed that start dates of Artemisia pollen seasons are greatly dependent on temperature during June and July, with hot summer temperatures having a tendency to delay summer flowering. However, this relationship is not linear and the rate at which seasons become later increases when mean minimum June-July temperatures reach a threshold of about 13. °C. No explanation for variations in pollen season intensity could be found. The geographical location or amount of urbanisation did not influence, either positively or negatively, the seasonal pollen index. Second peaks in Artemisia pollen seasons can be described as the pollen seasons of late flowering Artemisia species, and mainly occurred in the geographical area south of the Carpathian Mountains. These second peaks can significantly influence the seasonal pollen index, contributing over 50% to the season's total Artemisia pollen recorded at one site. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Aerobiology; Asteraceae; Mugwort; Season characteristics; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860500492

Nestedness in mutualistic ecological networks is the tendency for ecological specialists to interact with a subset of species that also interact with more generalist species. Recent mathematical and computational analysis has suggested that such nestedness increases species richness. By examining previous results and applying computational approaches to 59 empirical data sets representing mutualistic plant-pollinator networks, we show that this statement is incorrect. A simpler metric-the number of mutualistic partners a species has-is a much better predictor of individual species survival and hence, community persistence. Nestedness is, at best, a secondary covariate rather than a causative factor for biodiversity in mutualistic communities.

The objective of current research was to assess if reduced reproductive efficiency of some genotypes under N stress is due to the effect of this nutrient on the number of completely developed florets per ear, the number of exposed silks per ear, and/or abortion of pollinated florets. Two field experiments were conducted with two hybrids previously characterized by their contrasting reproductive efficiency (high for AX820 and low for AX877) under N stress, two stand densities (9 and 12plm-2) and two levels of added N (0 and 200kgNha-1). We established links among plant and ear growth rates, reproductive traits and kernel number per plant. Reduced reproductive efficiency (quantified as kernel number per plant per unit of spikelet growth rate around silking) of both hybrids under N deficiency was mainly due to an enhanced abortion of pollinated florets of the most suppressed plants of the stand (dominated individuals). This response did not appear to be the result of low spikelet growth rate around silking, but a direct control of N on sink capacity of fertilized ovaries for assimilates allocation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Ear development; Maize; N stress; Plant growth; Reproductive efficiency; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861476931

Previous work has focused on elucidating the developmental regulation of pathways leading to the formation of pollinator-attracting secondary metabolites such as scent compounds and flower pigments. However, to date little is known about how flowers control their entire metabolic network to achieve the highly regulated production of metabolites attracting pollinators. Integrative analysis of transcripts and metabolites in snapdragon sepals and petals over flower development performed in this study revealed a profound developmental remodeling of gene expression and metabolite profiles in petals, but not in sepals. Genes up-regulated during petal development were enriched in functions related to secondary metabolism, fatty acid catabolism, and amino acid transport, whereas down-regulated genes were enriched in processes involved in cell growth, cell wall formation, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The levels of transcripts and metabolites in pathways leading to scent formation were coordinately up-regulated during petal development, implying transcriptional induction of metabolic pathways preceding scent formation. Developmental gene expression patterns in the pathways involved in scent production were different from those of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, highlighting distinct developmental regulation of secondary metabolism and primary metabolic pathways feeding into it. © 2012 Muhlemann et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863824546

Moreover, due its high cover values, ragweed is also a problem in agricultural and non-agricultural areas. By the floristic surveys (reléve method Br.-Bl, 1964) it is determined that ragweed cover a significant part of investigated territory. Floristic records (106), performed during August and beginning of September identified ragweed populations with significant number of units per area. High cover values were recorded in sunflower and stubbles, and these places are considered a focus problem. High values were also registered in ruderal habitats, and along roads and canals. Field investigations confirmed the doubts that ragweed occupies and invades more and more areas. Besides agronomic problem, ragweed is also a significant public health problem. Pollen of this weed species is exceptionally strong aeroallergen, causing big problems among sensitive persons during the summer time. Therefore, detailed aerobiological investigations (2003-2008) were performed using the volumetric method (Burkard pollen and spore trap) in order to identify parameters of pollination. Ragweed pollen was mostly present in the air at the end of summer. This is the period when the allergic reaction among the sensitive persons is most registered. Pollination starts in July and finishes in October according to six year aerobiology monitoring. Length of pollination in the investigated area lasted on the average from 74 to 94 days, with the peak between 22th of August and 3rd of September. Total daily pollen counts varied from year to year from 143 pollen grains per m3 of air to 439 pollen grains per m3 of air. Meteorological parameters have a significant influence for amount of pollen grains in the air. It is proved that concentration of the pollen in the air is getting higher along with higher temperature, but it the relative humidity increases concentration of pollen decreases. Rainfall, wind spread and strength did not show significant correlations. It is extremely important for allergic persons to know the period of sub-pathological and pathological risk. Duration of ragweed pollination in Baranya is between 8 and 13 weeks. The peak is usually in the period 34-35 weeks, which corresponds to the end of August or beginning of September. Floristic surveys and pollen monitoring represent important information for patients, but only the suppression of this noxious plant on agricultural and non-agricultural areas can help the people who suffer from allergic diseases. Control of ragweed is demanding and complex process and can be done in several ways. Agronomic practice can offers several solutions.

Most species have large white or pale yellow petals with conspicuously fringed margins, the fringes sometimes several cm long. Pollination is usually by hawkmoths. Previous molecular data for a small number of species suggested that a monophyletic Trichosanthes might include the Asian genera Gymnopetalum (four species, lacking long petal fringes) and Hodgsonia (two species with petals fringed). Here we test these groups relationships using a species sampling of c. 60% and 4759 nucleotides of nuclear and plastid DNA. To infer the time and direction of the geographic expansion of the Trichosanthes clade we employ molecular clock dating and statistical biogeographic reconstruction, and we also address the gain or loss of petal fringes. Results: Trichosanthes is monophyletic as long as it includes Gymnopetalum, which itself is polyphyletic. The closest relative of Trichosanthes appears to be the sponge gourds, Luffa, while Hodgsonia is more distantly related. Of six morphology-based sections in Trichosanthes with more than one species, three are supported by the molecular results; two new sections appear warranted. Molecular dating and biogeographic analyses suggest an Oligocene origin of Trichosanthes in Eurasia or East Asia, followed by diversification and spread throughout the Malesian biogeographic region and into the Australian continent. Conclusions: Long-fringed corollas evolved independently in Hodgsonia and Trichosanthes, followed by two losses in the latter coincident with shifts to other pollinators but not with long-distance dispersal events. Together with the Caribbean Linnaeosicyos, the Madagascan Ampelosicyos and the tropical African Telfairia, these cucurbit lineages represent an ideal system for more detailed studies of the evolution and function of petal fringes in plant-pollinator mutualisms. © 2012 de Boer et al.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863201965

Accordingly, in the gut of the honey bee, Apis mellifera, a distinctive microbial community, composed of a taxonomically restricted set of species specific to social bees, has been identified. Despite the ecological and economical importance of honey bees and the increasing concern about population declines, the role of their gut symbionts for colony health and nutrition is unknown. Here, we sequenced the metagenome of the gut microbiota of honey bees. Unexpectedly, we found a remarkable degree of genetic diversity within the few bacterial species colonizing the bee gut. Comparative analysis of gene contents suggests that different species harbor distinct functional capabilities linked to host interaction, biofilm formation, and carbohydrate breakdown. Whereas the former two functions could be critical for pathogen defense and immunity, the latter one might assist nutrient utilization. In a ?-proteobacterial species, we identified genes encoding pectin-degrading enzymes likely involved in the breakdown of pollen walls. Experimental investigation showed that this activity is restricted to a subset of strains of this species providing evidence for niche specialization. Long-standing association of these gut symbionts with their hosts, favored by the eusocial lifestyle of honey bees, might have promoted the genetic and functional diversification of these bee-specific bacteria. Besides revealing insights intomutualistic functions governed by the microbiota of this important pollinator, our findings indicate that the honey bee can serve as a model for understanding more complex gut-associated microbial communities.",Coevolution; Gilliamella; Pectin degradation; Snodgrassella; Symbiosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863578700

During pollination, constant communication between male pollen and the female stigma is required for pollen adhesion, germination, and tube growth. The detailed mechanisms of stigma-mediated reproductive processes, however, remain largely unknown. Maize (Zea mays L.), one of the world's most important crops, has been extensively used as a model species to study molecular mechanisms of pollen and stigma interaction. A comprehensive analysis of maize silk transcriptome may provide valuable information for investigating stigma functionality. A comparative analysis of expression profiles between maize silk and dry stigmas of other species might reveal conserved and diverse mechanisms that underlie stigma-mediated reproductive processes in various plant species.Results: Transcript abundance profiles of mature silk, mature pollen, mature ovary, and seedling were investigated using RNA-seq. By comparing the transcriptomes of these tissues, we identified 1,427 genes specifically or preferentially expressed in maize silk. Bioinformatic analyses of these genes revealed many genes with known functions in plant reproduction as well as novel candidate genes that encode amino acid transporters, peptide and oligopeptide transporters, and cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases. In addition, comparison of gene sets specifically or preferentially expressed in stigmas of maize, rice (Oryza sativa L.), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana [L.] Heynh.) identified a number of homologous genes involved either in pollen adhesion, hydration, and germination or in initial growth and penetration of pollen tubes into the stigma surface. The comparison also indicated that maize shares a more similar profile and larger number of conserved genes with rice than with Arabidopsis, and that amino acid and lipid transport-related genes are distinctively overrepresented in maize.Conclusions: Many of the novel genes uncovered in this study are potentially involved in stigma-mediated reproductive processes, including genes encoding amino acid transporters, peptide and oligopeptide transporters, and cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases. The data also suggest that dry stigmas share similar mechanisms at early stages of pollen-stigma interaction. Compared with Arabidopsis, maize and rice appear to have more conserved functional mechanisms. Genes involved in amino acid and lipid transport may be responsible for mechanisms in the reproductive process that are unique to maize silk. © 2012 Xu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863104730

Pollination-mediated reductions in fertility could potentially lead to exclusion of competing plant species, and may generate spatial variation in the associations among coflowering species across a landscape. Methods: I documented the potential for heterospecific pollen transfer to cause competitive interactions between two annual grassland species native to California, Limnanthes douglasii subsp. rosea and L. alba, two reproductively incompatible species that have broadly overlapping geographic ranges in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. I observed pollinator movement in constructed arrays and controlled crosses in the greenhouse and field to investigate the consequences of heterospecific pollen transfer. Key Results: Pollinators move readily between species when they are presented together in experimental arrays. In the greenhouse, deposition of heterospecific pollen decreased fertility in both species. The decrease in seeds produced per flower was much more pronounced in L. d. rosea (90.6% reduction) than in L. alba (40.8% reduction). In field experiments, L. d. rosea plants that received pollen from heterospecific neighbors first showed >50% reduction in per-flower fertility. Conclusions: Under natural pollination conditions, heterospecific pollen transfer has the ability to decrease the fertility of L. d. rosea when it occurs at low frequency in mixed stands. Accordingly, pollinator-mediated competition may contribute to the locally disjunct distributions of these two species. It may also influence important restoration decisions in vernal pool habitats. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Competition for pollination; Fine-scale distribution; Heterospecific pollen transfer; Limnanthes; Plant-plant interactions; Vernal pool,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863869901

Here, by focusing on Gladiolus (260 species), a flagship example of a clade with diverse pollination biology, we test the hypothesis that high species diversity in southern Africa, one of the world's most floristically rich regions, has primarily been driven by ecological shifts in pollination systems.We use phylogenetic methods to estimate rates of transition between the seven highly specialized pollination strategies in Gladiolus. We find that pollination systems have evolved multiple times and that some pollination strategies arose by a variety of evolutionary pathways. Pollination shifts account for up to one-third of all lineage splitting events in the genus, providing partial support for the pollinator-driven speciation model. Transitions from the ancestral pollination mode to derived systems have also resulted in increased rates of diversification, suggesting that certain pollination systems may speed up speciation processes, independently of pollination shifts per se. This study suggests that frequent pollination shifts have played a role in driving high phenotypic and species diversity but indicates that additional factors need to be invoked to account for the spectacular diversification in southern African Gladiolus. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",Gladiolus; Iridaceae; Phylogeny; Pollination; Radiation; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862120288

Context-dependent floral preferences have been demonstrated for many pollinating insects, suggesting that this behavior might be widespread. However, it is not yet known whether 2 plant species or morphotypes that share a single pollinator could be reproductively isolated through assortative visitation. We investigated the foraging behavior of the bee fly, Megapalpus capensis, in experimental arrays of distinct floral morphotypes of Gorteria diffusa, a South African daisy which is pollinated almost exclusively by M. capensis. Flies exhibited no intrinsic or context-dependent (according to prevailing morph) preference for floral variants nor do they display floral constancy behavior during visitation bouts. Thus, pollinator isolation through assortative visitation is an unlikely explanation for the maintenance of floral integrity across the narrow contact zones encountered in Gorteria. Despite random visitation patterns on arrays, flies exhibited different behaviors on different floral morphotypes, suggesting intrinsic responses to morphotype-specific floral cues. Our findings suggest that results of previous studies demonstrating labile preferences and constancy in insects such as bees and butterflies cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other important groups of pollinators. In pollinators, such as Megapalpus, which use flowers as arenas for multiple behaviors, including mating, and feed during long stationary bouts, learning constraints on flower handling time, the most widely accepted explanation for floral constancy, is unlikely to drive constant foraging behavior. © 2012 The Author.",assortative mating; Bombyliidae; floral constancy; Gorteria diffusa; pollination; reproductive isolation; South Africa; species integrity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862843064

Phylogenetic relationships within this tribe have been studied previously using only nuclear ribosomal DNA (nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer, nrITS). However, different parts of the phylogenetic tree in these analyses were weakly supported, and integrating information from different plant genomes is clearly necessary in orchids, where reticulate evolution events are putatively common. The aims of this study were to: (1) obtain a well-supported and dated phylogenetic hypothesis for tribe Orchideae, (ii) assess appropriateness of recent nomenclatural changes in this tribe in the last decade, (3) detect possible examples of reticulate evolution and (4) analyse in a temporal context evolutionary trends for subtribe Orchidinae with special emphasis on pollination systems.MethodsThe analyses included 118 samples, belonging to 103 species and 25 genera, for three DNA regions (nrITS, mitochondrial cox1 intron and plastid rpl16 intron). Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods were used to construct a well-supported and dated tree. Evolutionary trends in the subtribe were analysed using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods of character evolution.Key ResultsThe dated phylogenetic tree strongly supported the recently recircumscribed generic concepts of Bateman and collaborators. Moreover, it was found that Orchidinae have diversified in the Mediterranean basin during the last 15 million years, and one potential example of reticulate evolution in the subtribe was identified. In Orchidinae, pollination systems have shifted on numerous occasions during the last 23 million years.ConclusionsThe results indicate that ancestral Orchidinae were hymenopteran-pollinated, food-deceptive plants and that these traits have been dominant throughout the evolutionary history of the subtribe in the Mediterranean. Evidence was also obtained that the onset of sexual deception might be linked to an increase in labellum size, and the possibility is discussed that diversification in Orchidinae developed in parallel with diversification of bees and wasps from the Miocene onwards. © The Author 2012.

The European Blue Blow Fly Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 is one species with potential use as a pollinator. It occurs worldwide and is easy to rear. Caged trials conducted within a hybrid carrot (Daucus carota L.) seed crop found C. vicina to be an effective pollinator. Seed yield (number and weight) from field-grown carrot plants caged with C. vicina, but excluding all other large flower visitors (body width>3mm), was similar to seed yield from uncaged plants in the presence of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and other insects. In contrast, caged plants without C. vicina produced 10-fold less seed. Under open field conditions, C. vicina spent an average of 71.0s per umbel compared to 54.4s for honey bees; however, under caged conditions, C. vicina spent more time on average per umbel (128.9s). Counts of C. vicina and honey bees on umbels outside of cages and C. vicina inside cages found that honey bees were most abundant on days with maximum temperature>25°C, while C. vicina was more abundant on cooler days around 20°C. C. vicina may therefore be a useful pollinator of crops grown in isolation cages for plant breeding purposes as well as in open fields when climatic conditions are less favourable for optimal honey bee activity. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.",Calliphora vicina; Calliphoridae; Carrot; Crop pollination; Diptera; New Zealand,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861908284

P. biglobosa is integrated in the farming systems and produces fruit pulp and seeds used in cooking. The species is bat-pollinated, and in areas with few bats the main pollinators are assumed to be honey bees. A higher rate of effective pollination will in many instances increase fruit production, and the aim of this study was to investigate pollination efficiency of different pollinators. Access of flower visiting animals to flowers was controlled by nets with differently sized mesh, using five trees as replicates. The pollinators' identity, efficiency, and relative effect were determined. Bats, honey bees, and stingless bees were able to pollinate the species. Bat-visited capitula produced more pods, but not significantly more than honey bees. Honey bees were more efficient than stingless bees, resulting in significantly less aborted seeds. The treatment which excluded all flower visitors developed no mature pods, indicating that P. biglobosa was not autonomous autogamous, apomictic, or parthenocarpic, while the treatment with confined honey bees showed that geitonogamy is possible. Sugar content of fruit pulp was analysed and a positive correlation between number of seeds per pod and the sugar content was found. Improved pollination success may thus result in sweeter fruits. We conclude it is important to strive against a pollinator-friendly environment in order to attract bats and bees.

It has been proposed that this mechanism relies on the exploitation of pollinator's sensory biases, but field evidence is still scarce. In this study, we describe the mechanism of deceit pollination in the monoecious herb Begonia gracilis, a species with exposed rewarding structures (pollen) and intersexual mimicry. Specifically, we test the role of mimicry and exploitation of sensory biases on the reproductive success of male (pollination visitation) and female flowers (probability of setting fruits). We show that pollinators' perception of the amount of reward provided by male flowers is influenced by the independent variation in the sizes of the androecium and the perianth. Large rewarding structures and small perianths were preferred by pollinators, suggesting a central role of the relative size of the rewarding structure on pollinators' foraging decisions. Hence, rewarding male flowers cheat pollinators by exploiting their sensory biases, a strategy followed by non-rewarding female flowers. We suggest that intersexual mimicry operates through the functional resemblance of male flowers' deceit strategy. Artificial manipulation of the flowers supports our findings in natural conditions. Overall, we propose that the continuous and independent variation in the size of the perianth and the reproductive organs among male and female flowers could itself be adaptive. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Begonia gracilis; Deceit pollination; Intersexual mimicry; Natural selection; Sensory biases,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862173894

We address this gap in a pollination web consisting of two clovers (Trifolium) that differ in specialization on a bumble bee pollinator Bombus balteatus. We examine how pollination niche breadth affects plant responses to pollinator abundance, comparing early-flowering (specialized) and late-flowering (generalized) cohorts of T. parryi and early T. parryi to T. dasyphyllum, a pollination generalist. Co-pollinators disrupt the link between B. balteatus visitation and pollination rate for both clovers. Only for earlyflowering T. parryi do visitation, pollination, and seed set increase with density of B. balteatus. Bumble bee density also alters timing of seed germination in T. parryi, with seeds from plants receiving augmented B. balteatus germinating sooner than seeds of open-pollinated counterparts. Benefits saturate at intermediate bumble bee densities. Despite strong effects of B. balteatus density on individual plant fitness components, population models suggest little impact of B. balteatus density on k in T. parryi or T. dasyphyllum. Findings show that functional redundancy in a pollinator guild mediates host-plant responses to partner density.

Alterations in land use and biological invasions are two major components of global change that threaten biodiversity. There is high concern about their impact on pollinators and the pollination services they provide. However, the growing literature shows different, even contradictory results. 2.We present a global meta-analysis of 58 publications reporting 143 studies (37 on landscape alteration and 21 on biological invasions) to assess the extent to which these components affect pollinators, and whether taxonomic and ecosystem-type differences in pollinator responses occur. We also quantified which component of landscape alteration had the largest effect on pollinators and assessed whether animal invasions differ from plant invasions in their effect on native pollinators. 3.Habitat alteration and invasions affected pollinators to the same magnitude by decreasing visitation rates. Vertebrates in altered landscapes and insects (excluding bees) in invaded areas were the most affected pollinator taxa. 4.Pollinator abundance was more reduced in altered forest ecosystems than in altered grasslands; while the reverse pattern was found for pollinator richness. However, the response of pollinators to invasions was independent of ecosystem type. 5.Disturbance of the surrounding matrix was more important in decreasing pollinator visitation rates than fragment size. 6.Invasive animals seemed to have a more consistent negative effect on visitation rates than invasive plants. 7.Synthesis. Our study highlights that different components of global change have similar negative outcomes on pollination patterns, but that responses of pollinators vary among taxa and ecosystem types, as well as the attributes of landscape alteration considered and whether the invader is an animal or a plant.

Insect visitor exclusion from flowering heads and pollination treatments showed that seed production was 10x higher in open-pollinated treatments compared to bagged flowers that were not pollinated and 20x higher than flower heads receiving self pollen suggesting that cross-pollination was responsible for most seed production. Peak flowering occurred the 2nd4th wk of Jun. 2004 and the large population contributed 5068 of the flowering individuals in its plant community. During this period, Bombus (Apidae, bumblebees), Hesperiidae (skippers), and Megachile (Megachilidae, leaf-cutter bees) accounted for 73, 12, and 11 of the observed visits to coneflower, respectively. Species richness of coneflower flower visitors and number of flower visits was lower in each small population than in the large population. However, comparison of seed production between heads receiving supplemental pollen and open-pollination heads indicated that seed production was not pollen limited. In addition, over 93 of pollen grains stained normally in cotton blue-lactophenol in all six populations suggesting that pollen viability was high in small and large populations. However, seed production in the large population exceeded that in each of three small populations during 2005, and seedling size was larger in the large population compared to seedlings from one of the small populations. Comparison of soil cation concentrations among populations suggested that cations did not limit seed production. We suggest that genetic factors, such as inbreeding or low S allele variation, may limit seed production in the small populations. © 2012, American Midland Naturalist.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864183528

The aims of this study were to investigate the reproductive ecology of the flies and the plant, ascertain the importance of the flies as pollinators and examine the intimate association between flowering events and life history of the flies. We conducted sampling, observations and field pollination experiments. The flies were attracted by the odour of female-phase inflorescences in the early morning on the first day of anthesis. They fed, mated and oviposited in the inflorescences for 1day. On the second day, the flies, covered with pollen grains, left the male-phase inflorescences for the next female-phase inflorescences. The immature forms of both fly species hatched, developed and pupated within the infructescences without damaging the fruits, and developed adults emerged when the mature infructescences dehisced. The flowering events and fly behaviours were well synchronized. In field pollination experiments, inflorescences bagged with a fine mesh (insect exclusion) produced almost no fruits, whereas those bagged with a coarse mesh (bee exclusion) produced as many fruits as the open-pollinated controls. These results indicate that these flies are the most efficient and specialised pollinators for their host, A. macrorrhizos. These flies, in return, depend on A. macrorrhizos for food and habitat through most of their life cycle.

Much of the research on pollination drops has been concerned with morphological and phenological descriptions of the drop. Composition analysis has been limited by the phenology and small volume of the drop. Improved proteomics techniques have enabled a more comprehensive analysis of drop composition. It is emerging that the drop is biochemically complex. Many of the components are found in other apoplastic secretions, such as the cell wall proteome, reproductive secretions in angiosperms, floral and extrafloral nectar. In these liquids, proteins confer a variety of functions. In this review, relevant apoplastic secretions are reviewed with an aim to develop a more comprehensive model of dynamic pollination drop function. Comparing pollination drops to other apoplastic secretions reveals similarities that suggest the drop may facilitate pollen-ovule interactions and ovule defense. An example of enzyme activity in the pollination drop is provided. Chitinase activity was detected in the drop of Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) using both a biochemical and an in-gel assay.

The few pollination studies conducted in the large genus Duguetia have shown that species are usually cantharophilous, pollinated by either small (mostly Nitidulidae) or large specialized dynastid (Scarabaeidae) beetles. Foul-smelling flowers are a novelty within the genus, and to better understand their significance, we undertook a study of the reproductive biology and flower scent chemistry of D. cadaverica. In a primary forest of French Guiana, we observed and measured morphology and phenology of trees and flowers; additionally, flower pollination chamber temperature was measured and insect visitors to flowers observed. Flower scent was collected in situ and later analyzed in the laboratory by GC-MS. Flowers are visited by small beetles of a single Pycnocnemus species (Nitidulidae), which are the only insects observed to enter the pollination chamber. Moreover, flowers evince a rhythm in sexual stage, scent emission and temperature, which finds correspondence in behavioral characters of the putative nitidulid pollinator, such as timing of entry and exit from the pollination chamber. Floral scent analysis revealed an unusual, previously undescribed combination of chemical odor classes. The earthy, rank flower scent contained 18 compounds, among them fatty acid derivatives, terpenoids and N- and S-bearing compounds. The most abundant volatiles were 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone, and (E)-2-octenol, which are characteristic earthy odors of fungi; additionally, there were sulfides and 4-methylpentanoic acid, which are molecules associated with carcass and cheese odors, respectively.Saprocantharophily, discovered in Duguetia cadaverica, is a novel pollination mode for Annonaceae. The beetle pollinator Pycnocnemus sp., which belongs to the Oxycnemus genus complex having fungal hosts of the order Phallales, appears to visit the flowers through deception.

Alternatively, plants may have evolved traits that fitted pre-existing preferences or morphologies in the pollinators. Here, we test these two scenarios in the plant family of Araceae and scarab beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) as pollinators. We focused on floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and production/detection of VOCs by scarab beetles. We found phylogenetic structure in the production/detection of methoxylated aromatics in scarabs, but not plants. Within the plants, most of the compounds showed a well-supported pattern of correlated evolution with scarab-beetle pollination. In contrast, the scarabs showed no correlation between VOC production/detection and visitation to Araceae flowers, with the exception of the VOC skatole. Moreover, many VOCs were found in nonpollinating beetle groups (e.g., Melolonthinae) that are ancestors of pollinating scarabs. Importantly, none of the tested VOCs were found to have originated in pollinating taxa. Our analysis indicates a Jurassic origin of VOC production/detection in scarabs, but a Cretaceous/Paleocene origin of floral VOCs in plants. Therefore, we argue against coevolution, instead supporting the scenario of sequential evolution of floral VOCs in Araceae driven by pre-existing bias of pollinators. © 2012 The Author(s).

One of the most critical assumptions of network analysis is that the observed interaction patterns constitute an adequate sample of the set of interactions present in plant-animal communities. In spite of its importance, few studies have evaluated this assumption, and in consequence, there is no consensus on the sensitivity of network metrics to sampling methodological shortcomings. In this study we examined how variation in sampling completeness influences the estimation of six network metrics frequently used in the literature (connectance, nestedness, modularity, robustness to species loss, path length, and centralization). We analyzed data of 186 flowering plants and 336 pollinator species in 10 networks from a forest-fragmented system in central Chile. Using species-based accumulation curves, we estimated the deviation of network metrics in undersampled communities with respect to exhaustively sampled communities and the effect of network size and sampling evenness on network metrics. Our results indicate that: (1) most metrics were affected by sampling completeness but differed in their sensitivity to sampling effort; (2) nestedness, modularity, and robustness to species loss were less influenced by insufficient sampling than connectance, path length, and centralization; (3) robustness was mildly influenced by sampling evenness. These results caution studies that summarize information from databases with high, or unknown, heterogeneity in sampling effort per species and should stimulate researchers to report sampling intensity to standardize its effects in the search for broad patterns in plant- pollinator networks. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Accumulation curves; Chile; Clench model; Ecological networks; Los Ruiles National Reserve; Network size; Plant-pollinator network metrics; Sampling completeness; Sampling effort; Sampling evenness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864202776

However, most studies have focused on species with one pollinator type, and little is known about species with mixed pollination systems. We investigated the temporal variation in flower visitor activity and flower scent emission of Silene otites (Caryophyllaceae), a species regarded as being nocturnal and pollinated by moths and mosquitoes. We found, however, that S.otites is not only visited at night by moths and mosquitoes, but also by a wide range of day-active insects. Furthermore, both the intensity and composition of floral scent change during the course of the day. Total scent emission reached its maximum in the early hours of the night when compounds known to be attractants for moths and/or mosquitoes, such as lilac aldehyde, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol, dominated the scent. However, although less intensive, emission continued during the day. In the early morning, ?-pinene, hotrienol, 2-phenylethanol and ?-3-carene were the dominant scent compounds. (E)-?-Ocimene, hotrienol and benzyl alcohol contributed proportions of at least 10% before midday when flies, such as syrphids, were abundant flower visitors, whereas linalool and hotrienol contributed to the scent with at least 10% each in the afternoon when bees also contributed to flower visits. We conclude that, in S.otites, the changing emission patterns are 'in tune' with the olfactory abilities, preferences and activity times of its day- and night-active potentially pollinating flower visitors. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Diel odour patterns; Diurnal; Dynamic headspace; Floral volatile composition; Flower visitors; GC-MS; Nectar-drinking mosquitoes; Nocturnal; Pollinator attraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862514255

The nocturnally dehiscent flowers were pollen depleted by honey bees and attracted various nocturnal and diurnal bee species. A threefold increase in native bee abundance was produced by delaying pollen availability and by preventing the preemption of pollen by honey bees.

Microscopic calcium oxalate crystals in plant tissues have been proposed to protect against herbivory. Aroids, which have an unusual diversity of such crystals, also exhibit diverse pollination strategies. Many species have pollinators that do not feed while visiting the flowers, while other species, especially those pollinated by beetles, offer sterile staminodia as food rewards. We examined flowers of 21 aroid species with various pollination strategies to test the hypothesis that crystals protect vital gametes and embryos while allowing consumption of food bribes.Methods: Aroid inflorescences collected from the field or from greenhouse material were sectioned, cleared, and examined by bright field and polarization microscopy.Key results: All species examined, regardless of pollination strategy, arrayed crystals around unshed pollen and ovules. Less vital tissues, such as odoriferous appendages, had few crystals. Staminodia offered as food to beetle pollinators, however, differed greatly between species in their crystal contents. Some had minimal crystals; some had crystals in patterns suggesting they limit beetle feeding; still others had abundant crystals in no obvious pattern.Conclusions: The results are consistent with crystals protecting against insect predation of gametes and embryos. However, the role of crystals in food-bribe staminodia is unclear. They may limit and direct feeding by beetles in some species, while in others they might have no protective role. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Araceae; Beetles; Calcium oxalate; Crystal; Defense; Flowers; Herbivory; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863876007

Australian Tongue orchids (Cryptostylis species) attract their sole pollinator, male Lissopimpla excelsa wasps (Ichneumonidae), by accurately mimicking the scent and colour of female L. excelsa wasps. To test for shape mimicry of female wasps, both traditional and geometric morphometric comparisons were performed with allopatric Cryptostylis ovata and the often sympatric Cryptostylis erecta, Cryptostylis leptochila, and Cryptostylis subulata. Although some floral parts accurately mimicked the female wasp, the overall floral shape differed dramatically among orchid species. The function (if any) of this interspecific shape variation is unknown, although it does not cause character displacement of pollen attachment locations to reduce interspecific pollen transfer. Analyses showed that floral parts involved in pollinia transfer were similarly shaped for three of the four Cryptostylis species and all attach their pollinia to the same location on the pollinator's abdomen. Shape may interact with pollinator behaviour: in the field, pollination rates doubled when two Cryptostylis species were present, regardless of orchid abundances. Perhaps variation in shape hinders pollinator recognition and the avoidance of orchids, similar to scent and colour variation in other sexually deceptive orchid systems. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.",Deception; Geometric morphometrics; Ichneumonidae; Learning; Orchidaceae; Plant-animal interactions; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862339757

Since the density of adults can affect effective pollen dispersal, short-distance pollination, even by insects, may frequently occur in high-density populations. To test this prediction, we investigated pollination patterns in a high-density population of the insect-pollinated canopy tree species Castanopsis sieboldii by paternity analysis using genotypes at 8 microsatellite loci of 145 adult trees and 439 seeds from 11 seed parents in a 4-ha plot. We then explored their genetic effects on the population by calculating other population genetics parameters. Although C. sieboldii has high potential for long-distance dispersal of pollen (as indicated by a fat-tailed dispersal kernel), the cumulative pollination at the local scale was spatially limited and strongly dependent on the distance between parents due to the high density of adults. Genetic diversity estimates for pollen pools accepted by each seed parent converged on a maximum as the effective number of pollen parents increased. The genetic diversity of pollen pool bulked over all the seed parents from inside the plot did not differ from that of the total pollen pools. Therefore, although pollen flow from distant pollen parents may help to maintain the genetic diversity of offspring, pollen parents neighboring seed parents may be the main contributors to the genetic diversity of the offspring at the seed stage. © The American Genetic Association. 2012.

Significantly more pollen germinated and grew into the pistils of Tx3361 than ATx623. Pollen grains were noticeably more numerous on stigmas of Tx3361, implying that factors within Tx3361 may also affect pollen adhesion.

In investigating the features of these flowers that aid the bats search for nectar, the strategy underpinning the task of classification of static targets by bats may be understood and this may additionally offer lessons for radar and sonar systems.

Chamaecrista chamaecristoides is considered a key species of the sand dune communities, particularly for its role as a nurse species and in dune stabilization. While certain aspects of its population biology have been well studied, others, such as its reproductive biology, have been overlooked. Understanding the factors that contribute to the successful reproduction of this species is crucial for its maintenance in natural populations. In this study, we examine the floral and reproductive biology of C. chamaecristoides. Specifically, we evaluate flower morphology and phenology, the breeding system and the identity and foraging patterns of floral visitors. Our results show that flower morphs are morphologically identical; however, position, size, and pollen production vary between stamens within each flower, suggesting functional differentiation. Furthermore, plants differ in their proportion of right- and left-styled flowers over the flowering season. While this could promote cross-fertilization by favoring pollen transfer among individuals with opposite floral-morph ratios, the presence of a stamen adjacent to the style, its self-compatibility and the absence of inbreeding depression all compromise the role of enantiostyly as an outcrossing strategy in this species. Finally, even though flowers are visited by at least ten different floral visitors, reproduction of C. chamaecristoides depends heavily on only three species that together account for more than 70 of the total number of visits. Overall, our results suggest that C. chamaecristoides is highly dependent on a small subset of the community of floral visitors and that it has evolved floral strategies to reduce pollen loss and enhance the efficiency of pollen transfer. For these reasons, future conservation strategies must also consider the preservation of suitable habitat for the somewhat limited pollinator community of this species. © 2012 Torrey Botanical Club.",buzz pollination; Chamaecrista chamaecristoides; flower polymorphism; heteranthery; monomorphic enantiostyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867495482

These factors have received considerable attention in studies of dioecious and other gender dimorphic plants, yet their effects have rarely been jointly considered. We documented sex ratios in 26 populations of Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (creeping thistle), a widely distributed clonal dioecious plant, and show that population sex ratios are generally female biased (~60% of shoots were female, and 15 of 26 populations were female biased). We found clear evidence for a negative association between pollen loads and distances between females and males within populations. In contrast, and in spite of broad variation in sex ratios among populations (range: 0.11-0.99 female), we found no relationship between sex ratios and pollen receipt by females. However, both sex ratios and interplant distances were associated with female seed production: seed production declined with distances between females and males and increased with the proportion of male shoots. Our data suggest that female plants of C. arvense might often be pollen limited and that distances between individual females and males drive pollen limitation more strongly than the overall frequency of males within sites.",Biased sex ratios; Canada thistle; Clonal plants; Dioecy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863221406

The objective of this study was to determine if the glyphosate-resistance trait can be transferred via pollen movement from a glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth source to a glyphosate-susceptible sink. In 2006 and 2007 glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth plants were transplanted in the center of a 30-ha cotton field. Susceptible Palmer amaranth plants were transplanted into plots located at distances up to 300 m from the edge of the resistant pollen source in each of the four cardinal and ordinal directions. Except for the study plots, the interior of the field and surrounding acreage were kept free of Palmer amaranth by chemical and physical means. Seed was harvested from 249 and 292 mature females in October 2006 and 2007, respectively. Offspring, 14,037 in 2006 and 13,685 in 2007, from glyphosate-susceptible mother plants were treated with glyphosate when the plants were 5 to 7 cm tall. The proportion of glyphosate-resistant progeny decreased with increased distance from the pollen source; approximately 50 to 60% of the offspring at the 1- and 5-m distances were resistant to glyphosate, whereas 20 to 40% of the offspring were resistant at the furthest distances. The development of resistance was not affected by direction; winds were variable with respect to both speed and direction during the peak pollination hours throughout the growing season.

Flowering-time differences within and among protandrous, hermaphroditic plants shift the floral sex ratio from male- to female-dominated during a population's flowering season. This dynamic should induce negative frequency-dependent selection favouring relatively greater investment of resources and time in female function by early flowers and early-flowering plants than by late flowers and late-flowering individuals. In contrast, selection for floral integration to facilitate pollen export and import should limit floral variation. 2.We assessed these contrasting expectations for the protandrous Delphinium glaucum by considering the relation of variation and covariation in the lengths of perianth segments, anther and ovule number, and male- and female-phase duration for flowers at three positions within inflorescences to the first flowering date, mean gender and size of 34 plants. 3.Reproductive phenotypes varied among and within plants in association with a shift in population floral sex ratio from male- to female-biased, but not with plant size. Early-flowering plants had female-biased phenotypic gender and smaller flowers with fewer anthers per ovule and shorter male phases than late-flowering plants. Within individuals, earlier (lower) flowers were larger with higher female effort, in terms of both the relative production of ovules and anthers and the relative durations of female and male phases, than later (upper) flowers. Overall, these results are more consistent with the expectations of negative frequency-dependent selection than with proximate resource allocation. 4.Correlations among floral traits indicated significant floral integration. However, these correlations weakened from lower to upper flowers, suggesting that the patterns of intra-individual variation limit the extent of integration. 5.Synthesis. Reproductive phenotypes that incorporate systematic among-flower variation and vary consistently among individuals with flowering time, such as those exhibited by D. glaucum, may be typical of dichogamous species with multi-flowered inflorescences. Such diversity within and among plants should result from a combination of density-dependent selection against simultaneous flowering of individuals and frequency-dependent selection favouring emphasis on the least common sex role during specific stages of the flowering season, both facilitated by the positive assortative mating that accompanies asynchronous flowering among individuals. Delphinium glaucum exhibits systematic variation in flower size and female and male effort, both within and among plants. These variation patterns are consistent with shifting selection on sex function during the flowering season caused as the population floral sex ratio changes from male- to female-biased, which may limit correlations among floral traits that facilitate interactions with pollinators. © 2012 The Authors.

Recent studies demonstrated that nectar may have other functions in addition to attracting pollinators. Mainly other two functions have been recognized: defense against microbial invasion and post-secretion modification of sugar profile. The floral nectar of Cucurbita pepo L. has been analyzed to confirm the presence of defense proteins, namely xylosidases that were identified by means of a proteomic approach in a previous study. An enzyme assay was also performed that revealed low invertase activity for which the optimal pH was determined. This invertase activity is not able to modify the sugar profile significantly during the short period of anthesis (6. h). The amino acids complement of the nectar of both sexes was also determined. Sixteen of the 20 protein amino acids have been detected. Proline comprises more than 30% of total amino acid content in male and female flowers. Three non-protein amino acids (taurine, ?-alanine, and GABA) represent almost one third of the total amino acid content, and of these, GABA is the most abundant (16%). Several biological activities were attributed to these amino acids and further studies are needed to assess their presumed involvement in managing the foraging behavior of insects. More recent studies, including our own, demonstrate that the various functions of nectar are much more complex than previously thought. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Antimicrobial activity; Cucurbita pepo; Invertase; Proline; Sugars; Xylosidase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863864451

Related plant species, however, may possess similar cues either as a result of pollinator-mediated selection or as a result of sharing a common ancestor that possessed the same cues or traits. In this study, visual and olfactory floral cues in Lysimachia species exhibiting different pollination strategies were analysed and compared, and the importance of pollinators and phylogeny on the evolution of these floral cues was determined. For comparison, cues of vegetative material were examined where pollinator selection would not be expected.MethodsFloral and vegetative scents and colours in floral oil- and non-floral oil-secreting Lysimachia species were studied by chemical and spectrophotometric analyses, respectively, compared between oil- and non-oil-secreting species, and analysed by phylogenetically controlled methods.Key ResultsVegetative and floral scent was species specific, and variability in floral but not vegetative scent was lower in oil compared with non-oil species. Overall, oil species did not differ in their floral or vegetative scent from non-oil species. However, a correlation was found between oil secretion and six floral scent constituents specific to oil species, whereas the presence of four other floral compounds can be explained by phylogeny. Four of the five analysed oil species had bee-green flowers and the pattern of occurrence of this colour correlated with oil secretion. Non-oil species had different floral colours. The colour of leaves was similar among all species studied.ConclusionsEvidence was found for correlated evolution between secretion of floral oils and floral but not vegetative visual and olfactory cues. The cues correlating with oil secretion were probably selected by Macropis bees, the specialized pollinators of oil-secreting Lysimachia species, and may have evolved in order to attract these bees. © The Author 2012.

Of particular interest is whether traits vary clinally or abruptly because the latter pattern can be indicative of incipient speciation. Understanding of intraspecific variation in chemical traits is still in its infancy because studies of population variation have tended to focus on morphology or neutral genetic markers. To address these issues, the composition of cone volatile odours was examined in ten populations of the South African cycad Encephalartos villosus across its range in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu Natal using headspace sampling and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Because volatiles play a key role in attracting pollinators to cones of Encephalartos cycads and may thus reflect local adaptation to pollinators, pollinator assemblages were also investigated in the ten populations of E. villosus. Volatile compounds from populations in the north of the distribution range were dominated by unsaturated hydrocarbons, whereas, in the southern populations, nitrogen-containing compound and terpenoids were the major compounds. A shift between southern and northern populations appeared to occur at the Umtamvuna River, where populations had odour profiles with components of both the northern and southern populations. However, one population in the north (Vernon Crookes Nature Reserve) had a quantitatively similar odour profile to the populations in the extreme south of the range. These results reveal strong interpopulation variation in the cone scent of E. villosus, including variation in the relative emission of dominant compounds that may play key functional role in this pollination system. However, pollinator assemblages did not differ across the different populations, which suggest that these patterns were produced by co-evolution or drift, rather than by pollinator shifts. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.",Eastern Cape; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Insect pollinators; KwaZulu-Natal; Nitrogen-containing compounds; Odour profile; Unsaturated hydrocarbons,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862304976

Interactions may be positive or negative, so indirect effects have the potential to enhance or lessen the net impacts of herbivores. Despite the ubiquity of these interactions, the indirect pathways are considerably less understood than the direct effects of herbivores, and multiple indirect pathways are rarely studied simultaneously. We placed herbivore effects in a comprehensive community context by studying how herbivory influences plant interactions with antagonists and mutualists both aboveground and belowground. We manipulated early-season aboveground herbivore damage to Cucumis sativus (cucumber, Cucurbitaceae) and measured interactions with subsequent aboveground herbivores, root-feeding herbivores, pollinators, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We quantified plant growth and reproduction and used an enhanced pollination treatment to determine if plants were pollen limited. Increased herbivory reduced interactions with both antagonists and mutualists. Plants with high levels of early herbivory were significantly less likely to suffer leaf damage later in the summer and tended to be less attacked by root herbivores. Herbivory also reduced pollinator visitation, likely due to fewer and smaller flowers, and reduced AMF colonization. The net effect of herbivory on plant growth and reproduction was strongly negative, but lower fruit and seed production were not due to reduced pollinator visits, because reproduction was not pollen limited. Although herbivores influenced interactions between plants and other organisms, these effects appear to be weaker than the direct negative effects of early-season tissue loss. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Acalymma vittatum; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Cucumis sativus; Indirect effects; Pollinator; Root,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864262922

The topics cover studies of regeneration, use of mycorrhiza, tree/crop interactions, pollination, variation in fruit quality and genetic variation in adaptability. It is shown that there are many possibilities to improve benefits from trees. Some are likely to have immediate effect on livelihoods, such as cultivation of shade-tolerant crops under trees or improved management of pollinators. Others will require long term efforts, such as using natural variability of trees in breeding programmes to improve adaptation, quality and yield. In any case, to maintain the benefit from trees in the long run it will be necessary to identify appropriate strategies for regeneration of species that are currently in decline. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adaptation; Genetic variation; Pollination; Regeneration; Shade-tolerant crops,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864320576

The effect of multiple invaders can be superadditive (invasional meltdown), additive, or subadditive (invasional interference); which of these situations occurs has critical implications for prioritization of management efforts. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides, two congeneric invasive weeds, have a striking, segregated distribution in central Pennsylvania, USA. Possible hypotheses for this pattern include invasion history and chance, direct competition, or negative interactions mediated by other species, such as shared pollinators. To explore the role of resource competition in generating this pattern, we conducted three related experiments using a response-surface design throughout the life cycles of two cohorts. Although these species have similar niche requirements, we found no differential response to competition between conspecifics vs. congeners. The response to combined density was relatively weak for both species. While direct competitive interactions do not explain the segregated distributional patterns of these two species, we predict that invasions of either species singly, or both species together, would have similar impacts. When prioritizing which areas to target to prevent the spread of one of the species, it is better to focus on areas as yet unaffected by its congener; where the congener is already present, invasional interference makes it unlikely that the net effect will change. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Carduus acanthoides; Carduus nutans; Central Pennsylvania USA; Co-invasion; Competition; Congeners; Invader-invader interactions; Invasion ecology; Invasional interference; Invasive species management; Thistles.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864127505

We conducted artificial pollination experiments with four pollination treatments (selfing, polycross, no-pollination and open-pollination treatments) in each of two vertical crown layers (upper and lower) for 19 Pinusdensiflora ramets. We measured formed seeds as a proportion of ovules (P Form), and filled seeds as a proportion of formed seeds (P Fill) per cone in each treatment and layer, and inferred the relative influences of pollination mode and resource availability on seed productivity. In the no-pollination treatment, no seeds were formed in any cones of all five ramets. The Generalized Linear Model showed that there were no significant differences in P Form both between selfing and polycross treatments and upper and lower layers. The mean P Fill values in the selfing treatment were significantly lower than those in the polycross treatment in both layers. The mean P Fills of the two layers did not differ significantly in the selfing treatment, but did in the open-pollination and polycross treatments. The results show that pollen supply affects mainly seed formation, whereas pollen quality affects mainly seed maturation. Resource availability also affects mainly seed maturation, if pollen quality is higher than a certain threshold. © 2011 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.",Pinus densiflora; Pollen quality; Pollen supply; Resource availability; Seed formation; Seed maturation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862857421

The results suggest that monocultures of lowbush blueberries are not suitable for optimal brood rearing. In the blueberry environments we studied, the dominant pollen collected by honey bees were Alnus Mill. spp. and Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wigg., which are deficient in some essential amino acids. Significant reduction of brood rearing during honey bees' stay in blueberry monocultures in June may, therefore, be explained by nutritional deficiencies. In July, the polliniferous flora in the vicinity of cranberry monocultures was poorer but of better nutritional quality.

In this study, we conducted paternity analyses on open-pollinated seeds in four natural populations of wild cherry (Prunus avium) with contrasting density and clonal propagation, using eight microsatellite loci and one self-incompatibility system locus. We also measured four quantitative traits and spatial positions as potential correlates of reproductive success. Levels of polyandry differed among populations and 30% of the seed families exhibited unequal paternal contributions, suggesting variation in reproductive success rather than variation in mate availability. Mating occurred preferentially among neighbours in all populations, suggesting that it is a common pattern in wild cherry and probably results from pollinator behaviour. Paternal success was positively correlated with diameter at breast height, as indicated in previous studies and tree dominance only resulted in higher paternal success in low density plots. Mating patterns were thus also affected by both density and tree size.

Its prevalence is at least partly due to its rapid evolution of resistance to many groups of herbicides over the last two decades. In light of its dioecy and anemophily, pollen movement in waterhemp is considered to be an important factor in the spread of herbicide resistance genes. Thus, the biology and dispersal profile of waterhemp pollen are critical determinants for understanding and predicting the spatial population dynamics of herbicide resistance in this species. In this study, pollen longevity was investigated with greenhouse experiments, and pollen dispersal and the effect of pollen competition were investigated in field plots. Pollen dispersal was determined by measuring the frequency of seeds produced on receptor plants positioned at various distances from a pollen source, which flowered in synchrony with the receptor plants. Results indicated that waterhemp pollen can remain viable up to 120 h, implying a low limitation of pollen dispersal by its longevity. Effective pollen dispersal declined exponentially with distance, with most pollen fertilizing recipient plants within 50 m of the pollen source. However, long distance pollen dispersal (800 m) was also observed. We also saw evidence for pollen swamping in this species. Under conditions of pollen competition among distinct genotypes, pollination success was inversely related to distance between pollen donors and receptors. However, relative pollen density may also play an important role in determining the rate of long distance gene flow. This study confirmed the potential of waterhemp pollen to effect long distance gene flow and provides supporting data for quantitative spatial modeling of waterhemp resistance dynamics. © 2012 Weed Science Society of Americ.",Gene flow; herbicide resistance; pollen dispersal; pollen viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865187052

Across 15 sites, the frequency of female ramets ranged between 5% and 95%. This variation was used to examine hypotheses involving the life history and pollination biology of A. nudicaulis. Because female reproductive function is thought to incur greater resource costs than male function, we predicted that female ramets should (i) be more common where resources (and light in particular) are more abundant and (ii) have lower rates of survival than male ramets. However, there was (i) no significant association between light availability (measured as canopy closure) and female frequencies across sites and (ii) ramet ages were skewed towards older ages for females, not males. Female A. nudicaulis produce staminodes that render female inflorescences visually similar to male inflorescences. We experimentally manipulated the presence-absence of staminodes and found that pollen receipt by females without staminodes was substantially lower than for plants with intact staminodes. Finally, pollinators tend to prefer visiting male over female flowers. We were interested in evaluating whether such preferences might scale up to the population level, with higher pollinator abundances at male-dominated sites. However, we instead found a strong positive association between pollinator abundances and female frequencies. Although there is unlikely to be a causal relationship between them, the identification of a common variable underlying variation in female frequencies and pollinator abundances might reveal key insights into the factors regulating the life history and pollination of forest understory plants.","Aralia nudicaulis; Clonal plants; Dioecy; Life-history tradeoffs, pollination",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863197003

Changes in nectar volume may affect not only pollination services, but also the attraction of antagonists such as herbivores, especially if the same insect species acts as herbivore and pollinator. Plants compete with each other for the best pollination services, at the same time employing various strategies to avoid herbivory. Datura wrightii Regel and Nicotiana attenuata Torr. ex Watson, two sympatric solanaceous species, compete for the same hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca quinquemaculata (Haworth) (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae), although standing nectar volume per flower differs 50-fold (70 vs. 1.3 ?l, respectively) between these species. This large difference may also result in differences in oviposition rates. I conducted a detailed analysis of diurnal changes in nectar volume and sugar concentration in field- and glasshouse-grown D. wrightii and N. attenuata plants, and tested how well nectar production is buffered against the loss of large amounts of foliar tissue that frequently occurs due to M. quinquemaculata larval herbivory. I examined the influence of nectar volume on herbivore damage in the field and compared the results with previously published data from N. attenuata which were collected simultaneously. Oviposition by M. quinquemaculata moths increased significantly in D. wrightii plants whose nectar volume had been experimentally increased five-fold compared to untreated control plants, and correlated with the numbers of flowers per plant in native populations. The results suggest that a hawkmoth mother may use standing nectar volume of a potential host plant to estimate its size, and possibly health, to make the optimal decision for her progeny. This mode of assessment, however, is apparently not used with another plant species, as other more herbivory-related cues, such as olfaction or vision, are more influential in determining oviposition rates on other plant species. Yet within a plant species, regulating nectar volume strongly influences future herbivory. © 2012 The Netherlands Entomological Society.",Datura wrightii; Flower; Herbivory; Lepidoptera; Manduca quinquemaculata; Nectar volume; Nicotiana attenuata; Pollination; Solanaceae; Sphingidae; Sugar concentration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862196888

Until recently, little research has focused on the molecular components of nectar synthesis, and only a handful of genes have been shown to have a direct effect on nectary function. Recent transcriptomic data have made it possible to identify nectary-related candidate genes and further investigate their potential roles in the synthesis and secretion of nectar. Here we review the current state of research and address how our work aims to close gaps in knowledge relating to the process of nectar production. Using Brassicaceae species as models, we discuss the utilization of molecular and genomic tools available (i.e., sequenced genomes, T-DNA and TILLING mutants, sugar concentration assays, and metabolomics) to gain insight on the complex mechanisms of nectar secretion. Examples of preliminary data from this research are provided, and an online database (www.nectarygenomics.org) housing this data is introduced. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Arabidopsis thaliana; Brassica rapa; Brassicaceae; Nectar; Nectaries; Nectary,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863879491

We observed the foraging behaviours of insects in three androdioecious and three hermaphrodite-only populations of L. racemosa in Florida. In each population, insect visitation rates were estimated from 30-108 timed intervals. We recorded the number of flowers visited by 144-224 insects during foraging bouts made to 15-40 male and hermaphroditic plants. Male plants in androdioecious populations had significantly more visitors than hermaphroditic plants, increasing the number of vectors carrying pollen from male plants. Further, many insects visited few flowers during foraging bouts, which should increase outcrossing frequency. According to mathematical models, male plants benefit from these combined factors. Plants in hermaphrodite-only populations had significantly more visitors than hermaphroditic plants in androdioecious populations. Proportionately more insects visited many flowers during foraging bouts in hermaphrodite-only versus androdioecious populations. The increased likelihood of geitonogamous self-pollination could help explain the lack of male plants in hermaphrodite-only populations. Differences in pollinator assemblages and the relative abundances of several species were responsible for differences in foraging behaviours: Apis mellifera, Bombus sp., Melissodes sp., Xylocopa sp., Euodynerus sp. and a calliphorid species.

On seeing the long spur of A.sesquipedale, Darwin predicted that its pollinator would be a moth with a long proboscis. For more than a century following Darwin's prediction this was assumed to be the case. The pollinator was taken to be Xanthopan morganii praedicta, despite the fact that it had not been observed to visit A.sesquipedale flowers. Direct observations, infra-red cinematography and photographs published between 1993 and 1997 and a video made in 2004, all of which show X.morganii praedicta visiting A.sesquipedale flowers and removing pollinia, proved that Darwin's prediction was accurate.

However, their role in shaping floral morphological novelties, such as inflated calyx syndrome (ICS) exhibited by a few genera of the Solanaceae, remains unknown. In Withania and Physalis, sepals resume growth after pollination and encapsulate the mature fruit to form a balloon-like structure, i.e. ICS. The epidermal cells of calyx show enlargement and lobation post-fertilization. Application of hormones to depistillated flower buds of Withania revealed that cytokinins and gibberellins mimic fertilization signals. The ICS development is a synchronous step with fruit development; both processes are under the control of more or less the same set of hormones, including cytokinins and gibberellic acids. Interestingly, inhibition of ethylene in the system is sufficient to yield inflated calyx in Withania. In contrast, Tubocapsicum, a closely related species and an evolutionary natural loss mutant of ICS - showed no response to applied hormones, and ethylene led to inflation of the receptacle indirectly. In addition to hormones, the expression of an MPF2-like MADS-box transcription factor in sepals is essential for ICS formation. Nevertheless, the interactions between MPF2-like genes and hormones are barely detectable at the transcript level. Our data provide insight into the role of hormones in generating floral morphological diversity during evolution. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Ethylene; Inflated calyx syndrome; MADS-box gene; MPF2-like; Plant hormones; Withania,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861787163

Both demographic (stochasticity and the Allee effect) and genetic factors (drift load and inbreeding depression) potentially affect extinction. In fragmented populations, regular dispersal may boost population sizes (demographic rescue effect) or/and reduce the local inbreeding level and genetic drift (genetic rescue effect), which can affect extinction risks. We studied extinction processes in highly fragmented populations of the common species Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) in urban habitats exhibiting a rapid turnover of patches. A four-year demographic monitoring survey and microsatellite genotyping of individuals allowed us to study the determinants of extinction. We documented a low genetic structure and an absence of inbreeding (estimated by multilocus heterozygosity), which suggest that genetic factors were not a major cause of patch extinction. On the contrary, local population size was the main factor in extinction, whereas connectivity was shown to decrease patch extinction, which we interpreted as a demographic rescue effect that was likely due to better pollination services for reproduction. This coupling of demographic and genetic tools highlighted the importance of dispersal in local patch extinctions of small fragmented populations connected by gene flow. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Demography; Extinction; Fragmentation; Genetic structure; Rescue effect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862200433

A founding population sourced from a limited genetic pool of nonlocal provenance seed can result in genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding, potentially reducing future population resilience and restoration success. We used microsatellite markers to assess the genetic variation of natural and restored populations, and their offspring, in Banksia attenuata R.Br. (Proteaceae), a keystone species of Banksia woodlands in south-west Australia. Both natural and restored populations, and their offspring, displayed similarly high levels of heterozygosity (He range = 0.57-0.62) and allelic diversity (Ne range = 6.67-8.86) across 7 microsatellite loci. There was very weak population divergence (FST = 0.006) between the restored population and the adjacent natural population, indicating local provenance sourcing of seed. Genetic structuring within the natural population was weak, but detectable at 10 m and more strongly genetically structured than the restored population (Sp = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively). Complete outcrossing, low-correlated paternity, and very low bi-parental inbreeding were observed in both populations. Extensive pollen dispersal was observed within and among populations, with &gt;50% of paternity assigned to sires beyond the local population. In a greenhouse experiment, differences in the overall performance of seedlings from natural and restored populations were negligible. Results indicate the successful genetic management of B. attenuata in this restoration project, from which general principles emphasizing the use of diverse local provenance seeds, genetic integration, and delivery of pollinator services are supported. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",Ecological functionality; Genetic structure; Paternity; Plant mating system; Pollen dispersal; Pollinator services,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863546118

We investigated the variation in morphometric traits and ecological niches (based on edaphic conditions and pollinator assemblages) of C. perennis and C. tenuis, to evaluate the risk of inter-specific competition, and their potential for hybridization to ascertain if C. perennis might be at risk of genetic swamping by its more widespread congener. We examined whether species were found under sympatric or parapatric settings with opportunity for hybridization (or gene exchange). Such knowledge is essential for implementing restoration management protocols, including the introduction of C. perennis into substitution sites where C. tenuis might be already present. Fourteen morphological characters and 11 soil variables were measured and visiting pollinator species were identified at the site where the two species co-occur. Our results show that the two species can be distinguished based on their morphological traits, show niche overlap based on edaphic properties, and share the same pollinator assemblage. In addition, no morphologically intermediate individuals could be detected, suggesting no hybridization, and that the two species may be reproductively isolated.

There were four floral visitors; bumble bee (Apis braviceps Smith), honey bee (Apis cerena), fruit fly (Bactocera sp.) and moth (Udaspes folus), and among them A. braviceps was found to be the major pollinator due to its high pollination efficiency attributed to its big body size and foraging habit, while A. cerena acts as a pollen robber.

Pollination efficiency of bumble bee was as high as 100% while honey bee could pollinate only 8.41% of flower. Bumble bee delivers pollens in the receptive cup pf stigma, in contrary honey on the non-receptive hairs surrounding stigma cup. Nectar secretion begins at 9 hr on the day anthesis and reaches to its peak at 14 hr, followed by reduction in nectar production. A temperature range of 25-28°C and air humidity of 50-60% favoured high nectar production.

Two classes of dynamics can be distinguished in ecological networks; population dynamics, represented mainly by changes in species abundances, and topological dynamics, represented by changes in the architecture of the web. 2.In this study, we model the temporal evolution of three empirical plant-pollination networks incorporating both population and topological dynamics. We test the hypothesis that topological plasticity, realized through the ability of animals to rewire their connections after depletion of host abundances, enhances tolerance of mutualistic networks to species loss. We also compared the performance of various rewiring rules in affecting robustness. 3.The results show that topological plasticity markedly increased the robustness of mutualistic networks. Our analyses also revealed that network robustness reached maximum levels when animals with less host plant availability were more likely to rewire.

However, this assumption was based largely on studies conducted on a clade of bird-pollinated species that occur in the shrubby fynbos vegetation of the Cape region of southern Africa. To test whether self-incompatibility occurs in a grassland/savanna Protea clade, which is largely insect-pollinated, we performed controlled pollination experiments on four species, P.caffra, P.dracomontana, P.simplex and P.welwitschii. Although pollen-ovule ratios of all four species fall within the range for outcrossers, all four species are self-compatible and capable of autonomous seed production. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that self-pollen tubes had the same probability of reaching ovules as cross-pollen tubes. In the small tree P.caffra, selfed progeny had rates of germination and survivorship that were identical to those of crossed progeny. The grassland Protea spp. studied are likely to have mixed mating systems on account of being both visited by insects and capable of autonomous selfing. If one assumes previous reports of self-incompatibility in Protea to be reliable, there have been at least five losses of self-incompatibility and two gains of autonomous selfing in this genus. However, earlier studies in the genus were often methodologically flawed and a thorough re-analysis of breeding systems in Protea is required. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Autogamy; Breeding system; Genetic load; Inbreeding depression; Pollen transfer efficiency; Pollen-ovule ratios; Reproductive assurance; Self-incompatibility; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862541454

While nectar production requires resources and a reduction could in principle benefit plant fitness, only few angiosperms lack nectar, and thus cheat from a pollinator's perspective. Cheating behavior may be scarce because of pollinator foraging behaviors that select for nectariferous plants. Shorter inspection duration, interaction with fewer flowers, or even complete avoidance of plants with low/no nectar may reduce the fitness of cheating plants. The effectiveness of pollinator strategies may depend on how they are implemented. Innate strategies would invariably decrease the fitness of a cheating plant, while learned responses allow cheaters to exploit naïve pollinators. Here, we studied the foraging strategies of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta during interactions with nectariferous and reward-minimized Petunia axillaris. We found that neither naïve nor experienced hawkmoths discriminated a priori between rewarding and nectar-less plants. However, naïve hawkmoths displayed reduced probing time per flower and number of flowers visited on reward-minimized plants during the first trial, without showing further improved discrimination with experience. In conclusion, the foraging decision rules of hawkmoths that may reduce the fitness of reward-minimized plants appear to be innate, with little scope for additional learning. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862260841

An earlier morphological revision of the c. 50 species recognized three main groups, one consisting of the 23 Antillean species, another of southern South American and Andean species, and a third of species from the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield. Based on plastid and nuclear DNA sequences from up to 65 accessions representing 80% of the species, we generated a phylogeny and a calibrated chronogram for Brunfelsia to infer clade expansion and shifts in pollinators and fruit types. Brunfelsia flowers offer nectar, and attract lepidoptera, hummingbirds, or bees; the fruits are dry or fleshy. Our results imply that Brunfelsia is 16-21. Myr old and entered the Antilles from South America early during its history, with subsequent expansion along the island arc. The ancestor of the Antillean clade was hawk-moth-pollinated and had fleshy capsules, perhaps facilitating dispersal by birds. The only shift to hummingbird pollination occurred on Cuba, which also harbors the largest single radiation, with 11 species (10 included in our study) that apparently arose over the past 4. Myr.

In order to persist in human-altered landscapes organisms need to shift their habitat use accordingly. Little is known about the mechanisms by which whole communities persist in human-altered landscapes, including the role of complementary habitat use. We define complementary habitat use as the use of different habitats at different times by the same group of species during the course of their activity period. We hypothesize that complementary habitat use is a mechanism through which native bee species persist in human-altered landscapes. To test this idea, we studied wild bee communities in agro-natural landscapes and explored their community-level patterns of habitat and resource use over space and time. The study was conducted in six agro-natural landscapes in the eastern United States, each containing three main bee habitat types (natural habitat, agricultural fields, and old fields). Each of the three habitats exhibited a unique seasonal pattern in amount, diversity, and composition of floral resources, and together they created phenological complementarity in foraging resources for bees. Individual bee species as well as the bee community responded to these spatiotemporal patterns in floral availability and exhibited a parallel pattern of complementary habitat use. The majority of wild bee species, including all the main crop visitors, used fallow areas within crops early in the season, shifted to crops in mid-season, and used old-field habitats later in the season. The natural-forest habitat supported very limited number of bees, mostly visitors of non-crop plants. Old fields are thus an important feature in these arable landscapes for maintaining crop pollination services. Our study provides a detailed examination of how shifts in habitat and resource use may enable bees to persist in highly dynamic agro-natural landscapes, and points to the need for a broad cross-habitat perspective in managing these landscapes. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Agriculture; Agro-natural landscape; Apoidea; Bees; Complementarity; Deciduous forest; Habitat use; Old fields; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864143266

So every half hour throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles.

The effects of winter warming on reproductive effort have not been examined for temperate plant species. • Here, we report the results of experimentally induced seasonal winter warming (0.4 and 2.4°C increases in growing and nongrowing seasons, respectively, using warmed and ambient open-top chambers in a Tibetan Plateau alpine meadow) for nine indeterminate-growing species producing multiple (single-flowered or multi-flowered) inflorescences and three determinate-growing species producing single inflorescences after a 3-yr period of warming. • Warming reduced significantly flower number and seed production per plant for all nine multi-inflorescence species, but not for the three single-inflorescence species. Warming had an insignificant effect on the fruit to flower number ratio, seed size and seed number per fruit among species. The reduction in seed production was largely attributable to the decline in flower number per plant. The flowering onset time was unaffected for nine of the 12 species. Therefore, the decline in flower production and seed production in response to winter warming probably reflects a physiological response (e.g. metabolic changes associated with flower production). • Collectively, the data indicate that global warming may reduce flower and seed production for temperate herbaceous species and will probably have a differential effect on single- vs multi-inflorescence species. © 2012 The Authors.

Significant genetic variation was found among progenies in both height growth and cold hardiness with a narrow sense heritability of 0.16 and 0.37, respectively. There was also a significant positive genetic correlation (r a=0.39) between height growth and CT with taller trees showing later autumn cold acclimation. It was concluded that there is significant additive genetic variance for height and CT which warrants a potential for mapping quantitative trait loci.

The experiments were carried out under different growing conditions. The regression functions were fitted to the data of each group of genotypes, over years and experiments. Increasing SFP was a determinant factor for increasing OC. Oil concentration was affected by the duration of SFP, which was maximized when plants of both genotypes (open pollinates and hybrids) were exposed to lower temperatures. There was a linear negative relationship between air temperature during SFP and OC. High temperatures, accelerated the rate of plant development, lowered the length of SFP, and reduced OC potential. In both group of genotypes, the variation of OC was explained by rainfall during SFP, and temperature and radiation interactions during the period, as showed by photothermal quotient (PTQ). There was a positive logarithmic relationship between PTQ during SFP and OC.

Seed samples collected from the field site were initially screened with glyphosate in the glasshouse, and surviving individuals were self-pollinated for subsequent glyphosate dose-response studies. Glyphosate resistance was confirmed, as the suspected resistant population was found to be 8.6-fold more resistant to glyphosate than a susceptible population based on survival (LD50 of 3.72 kg ha -1), and 5.6-fold more resistant based on biomass reduction (GR50 of 1.16 kg ha -1). The glyphosate-resistant population was susceptible to label-recommended doses of all other herbicides assessed, including three acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibiting herbicides (fluazifop-P, haloxyfop, and sethoxydim), two acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides (imazamox and sulfometuron), paraquat, and glufosinate.

The aim of the study was to find out if the biotope may increase or limit the presence of foreign fauna in the nests of the solitary bee O. bicornis (L.). Four different biotopes were selected: a traditional orchard, the dendrological park of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Kórnik, a mixed forest, and a haymeadow, where artificial aggregations of O. bicornis (L.) were made, with 300 specimens in each. They were given artificial nests of common reed. The nests were then analysed after the end of the brooding period. The number of brood chambers built by females was determined. The number of chambers where the forms of development stopped at the egg or larva stage, the number of parasite-invaded chambers, and the systematic membership of the encountered foreign fauna, was also determined. The analysis of variance and Duncan's test with the significance level of ?=0.05 proved that the biotope influenced the development of the O. bicornis (L.) population. The females in the forest biotope built the most brood chambers in each tube on average, and the result was significantly different from the other biotopes. The largest number of larvae died in the nests which had been placed in the dendrological park, and that value was also statistically different from the others.

While several experiments have been dedicated to measuring alien plants' response to increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration, very few studies have been undertaken to measure the response of alien plants to warming. This study was aimed to test experimentally whether the predicted climate change in the Mediterranean Basin could be beneficial to the alien C4 grass Setaria parviflora (Poir.) Kerguélen. Location Three populations of S. parviflora from Corsica, southern France, were grown in Montpellier, southern France. Methods The C4 alien grass S. parviflora was exposed to artificial climate change conditions for 3years in open field and in competition with the local native community. We measured the response to artificial warming of +1.5 and +3°C and artificial drought (-30% precipitation) versus ambient conditions for phenology, biomass and fecundity of S. parviflora. We compared the response of S. parviflora individuals to the response of the local community. Results Artificial warming strongly enhanced the biomass and the fecundity of S. parviflora, while it decreased or did not affect the biomass and fecundity of the local community. The phenology (onset of growth, first spike pollinating and fruit ripeness) of S. parviflora was advanced significantly and explained the changes observed in biomass and fecundity. Main conclusions Here, we report a positive effect of climate change on the growth and fertility of S. parviflora, a C4 alien plant. Our results suggest that climate change predicted for the next decades in the Mediterranean Basin might substantially enhance the performance of S. parviflora, potentially increasing its invasion success. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Artificial warming; Biological invasions; Biomass; C4 grass; Drought; Fecundity; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861999589

However, little attention has been paid to gynomonoecious species, in which individuals produce both female and bisexual flowers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variations in reproductive patterns at different capitulum positions within racemiform synflorescence in Ligularia virgaurea, and to determine selective mechanisms of variations in reproductive patterns. We conducted observational and experimental studies in natural populations of the gynomonoecious composite L. virgaurea. Floral sex allocation, seed production and pre-dispersal seed predation were quantified in the field. The results showed several patterns of variation from top to bottom capitula, including an increase in bisexual flowers and flower number per capitulum, but a decrease in seed set and size. Removing earlier capitula during bud stage did not change floral sex allocation in later capitula. And no effect was found on seed set under supplemental pollination. Thus, although it has been reported many times in previous studies, the variation of floral sex allocation in L. virgaurea may not result from architectural effect or mating environment, and the variation of seed production could not be fully explained by pollination success. Additionally, our results showed that L. virgaurea was susceptible to high levels of bisexual biased predation, which was greater for top capitula. We therefore suggest that these variations may help to enhance reproductive success of L. virgaurea in the face of bisexual-biased seed predation. © 2012 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.",Capitulum; Gynomonoecy; Ligularia virgaurea; Pre-dispersal seed predation; Racemiform synflorescence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862907277

Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge - as opposed to global scientific understanding - underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction. The effects of shade trees on biophysical conditions and their interactions with coffee productivity were well understood by farmers. They recorded and classified shade trees as 'fresh' (suitable for integration with coffee) or 'hot' (unsuitable) based on their leaf texture and size, foliage density, crown shape, and root system attributes. The fresh/hot classification significantly related to positive/negative provision of services. This classification was widely used by farmers, and unknown by coffee technicians. Detailed local knowledge included several different topics, such as the role of trees in soil formation and in abundance of pollinators. Farmers were also aware of the influence of these ecosystem services on crop productivity. Generally, management decisions were made to maintain coffee productivity rather than ecosystem services. Based on these results, it is suggested that technical interventions addressing the improvement of coffee plantations are more likely to be successful if they take into account not only the scientific information on agroforestry interactions but also the knowledge possessed by farmers. Lack of comprehension of local coffee knowledge could be expected to reduce the success of development programs and projects aimed at improving productivity or other ecosystem services. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",AKT software; Central America; Costa Rica; Farmers' knowledge; Shade-grown coffee; Tree functional traits,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860322019

Most species are ornamental and several are threatened due to habitat loss and over collection. In this paper we examine the phylogenetics of Alcantarea and its relationship with the Brazilian members of Vriesea, a genus of which Alcantarea has been treated as a subgenus. We discuss the morphological evolution of the stamen position and its implication for pollination and the occurrence of Alcantarea in the Espinhaço mountain range rocky savanna-like habitat vegetation. DNA sequence data derived from two plastid markers (trnK. -rps16. , trnC. -petN) and from a low copy nuclear gene (Floricaula/Leafy) together with 20 nuclear microsatellite loci were the data source to perform analyses and construct phylogenetic and Neighbor Joining trees for the genus. Alcantarea is well supported as monophyletic in both Bayesian and parsimony analyses, but sections of Vriesea, represented by the eastern Brazilian species, appear paraphyletic. Microsatellites delimit geographically isolated species groups. Nevertheless individuals belonging to a single species may appear related to distinct clusters of species, suggesting that hybridization and/or homoplasy and/or incomplete lineage sorting are also influencing the analysis based on such markers and may be the reasons for some unexpected results. Alcantarea brasiliana is hypothesized as putative hybrid between A. imperialis and A. geniculata. Spreading stamens, a morphological floral characteristic assumed to be related to Chiropterophily, apparently evolved multiple times within the genus, and invasion of rocky savanna-like habitat vegetation by Atlantic rainforest ancestors seems to have occurred multiple times as well. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Alcantarea; Atlantic rainforest; Floricaula/Leafy; Hybridization; Inselbergs; Microsatellites; Radiation; Tillandsioideae; Vriesea,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860561738

However, in 25% of the legumes, the bacterial entry occurs more simply in an intercellular fashion. Among them, some Aeschynomene spp. are nodulated by photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium spp. that do not produce Nod factors. This interaction is believed to represent a living testimony of the ancestral state of the rhizobium-legume symbiosis. To decipher the mechanisms of this Nod-independent process, we propose Aeschynomene evenia as a model legume because it presents all the characteristics required for genetic and molecular analysis. It is a short-perennial and autogamous species, with a diploid and relatively small genome (2n = 20; 460 Mb/1C). A. evenia 'IRFL6945' is nodulated by the well-characterized photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium sp. strain ORS278 and is efficiently transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Aeschynomene evenia is genetically homozygous but polymorphic accessions were found. A manual hybridization procedure has been set up, allowing directed crosses. Therefore, it should be relatively straightforward to unravel the molecular determinants of the Nod-independent process in A. evenia. This should shed new light on the evolution of rhizobium-legume symbiosis and could have important agronomic implications. © 2012 The American Phytopathological Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863332439

Oleoides (Rhamnaceae) is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean Basin distributed along an altitudinal gradient, from sea level up to 1000 m a.s.l. The specific goals of our study were (i) to compare plant morphology between two contrasting populations, (ii) to determine the reproductive system of R. lycioides, quantifying the relative importance of insects and wind as pollen vectors, (iii) to test if pollen limitation differs between populations, (iv) to study the main factors influencing fruit set and (v) to compare plant reproductive performance (mass allocation to flowers, fruits and seeds) between the two habitats. Methods: In the present study, we examined plant morphology and the reproductive performance of R. lycioides L. in contrasting environments in two populations located at the extremes of its altitudinal range in the island of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean Basin) along a 3-year period. Plant morphology, the relative importance of insects and wind as pollen vectors, the pollen limitation to seed production and the plant reproductive performance (mass allocation to flowers, fruits and seeds) were determined. Important Findings: Rhamnus lycioides individuals showed a higher plant surface/plant height ratio at the mountain than at the coast. This species appeared to be ambophilous despite its inconspicuous flowers, although the relative importance of wind as a pollination vector was higher at the mountain than at the coastal site. Fruit set was much higher at the mountain, where pollen appeared to be a limiting factor. By contrast, fruit set was not limited by pollen availability at the coastal population, where resource (water and nutrients) limitation seemed to be more determining. Flower size was greater at the coast, in contrast to fresh fruit weight that was higher at the mountain. Despite the relatively few differences between sites in precipitation patterns along the study period, water availability appeared to be the key factor explaining not only fruit set but also the reproductive performance of this species in the study populations. © 2012 he Author.

Here, we combine information from nuclear microsatellite markers and ecological niche modelling to study the association between climate and spatial genetic structure and variability in Engelmann oak (Quercus engelmannii), a wind-pollinated species with high potential for gene flow. We first test whether genetic diversity is associated with climatic niche suitability and stability since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Second, we use causal modelling to analyse the potential influence of climatic factors (current and LGM niche suitability) and altitude in the observed patterns of genetic structure. We found that genetic diversity is negatively associated with local climatic stability since the LGM, which may be due to higher immigration rates in unstable patches during favourable climatic periods and/or temporally varying selection. Analyses of spatial genetic structure revealed the presence of three main genetic clusters, a pattern that is mainly driven by two highly differentiated populations located in the northern edge of the species distribution range. After controlling for geographic distance, causal modelling analyses showed that genetic relatedness decreases with the environmental divergence among sampling sites estimated as altitude and current and LGM niche suitability. Natural selection against nonlocal genotypes and/or asynchrony in reproductive phenology may explain this pattern. Overall, this study suggests that local environmental conditions can shape patterns of genetic structure and variability even in species with high potential for gene flow and relatively small distribution ranges. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",causal modelling; ecological niche modelling; genetic diversity; genetic structure; landscape genetics; species distribution models,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862759230

Little is known about the biology of this group in southern portions of the Americas, especially in Mesoamerica, a region of geological and ecological complexity from Mexico through Central America. One ubiquitous Mesoamerican species, Bombus ephippiatus, is enigmatic. Like many other Bombus, this species is homogeneous in body structure yet exhibits striking intraspecific color pattern polymorphism across its range, leading to uncertainty about its genealogical boundaries. It has been grouped taxonomically with B. wilmattae, a species narrowly restricted to southern Mexico and northern Guatamala. Furthermore, the relationships between these two taxa and a third species, B. impatiens, found only in America north of Mexico, have been controversial. Our phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from mitochondrial COI and nuclear PEPCK and CAD resolves the phylogeny of these three taxa as (B. impatiens, (B. ephippiatus, B. wilmattae)). Additional data from eight nuclear microsatellite markers reveal complex patterns of genetic divergence and isolation among populations of B. ephippiatus across its extensive geographic range, providing evidence for multiple independent evolutionary lineages. These lineages correspond not only to geographic and habitat variation across their range, but also to distinct color pattern groups present in the species. Knowledge of the phylogeny and genetic divergence of the B. ephippiatus group will provide a framework for understanding evolutionary and ecological origins of color pattern polymorphism in bumble bees, as well as providing insight into geographical factors enhancing speciation in Mesoamerica. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Color pattern; Mesoamerica; Microsatellites; Phylogeography; Population genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860556527

Despite a regional research-based understanding of prehistoric and historic fire regimes, a parallel understanding of contemporary fire use to preserve oak forests is only emerging, and with somewhat inconsistent results. For prescribed fires to be effective, they must positively influence oak regeneration at one or more critical life stages: pollination, flowering, seed set, germination, establishment, seedling development, and release into the canopy. We posit that a simplistic view of the relationship between fire and oak forests has led to a departure from an ecologically based management approach with prescribed fire. Here, we call for a refinement in our thinking to improve the match between management tools and objectives and provide some guidelines for thinking more ecologically about when and where to apply fire on the landscape to sustain oak-dominated forests. © 2012 by the Society of American Foresters.",Forest management; Oak ecology; Oak regeneration; Oak-fire hypothesis; Prescribed fire,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863901474

Here, we report our study on physical mapping of one male-sterile locus (BnRf) in 9012AB by exploiting the comparative genomics among Brassica species. The genetic maps around BnRf from previous reports were integrated and enriched with markers from the Brassica A7 chromosome. Subsequent collinearity analysis of these markers contributed to the identification of a novel ancestral karyotype block F that possibly encompasses BnRf. Fourteen insertion/deletion markers were further developed from this conserved block and genotyped in three large backcross populations, leading to the construction of high-resolution local genetic maps where the BnRf locus was restricted to a less than 0. 1-cM region. Moreover, it was observed that the target region in Brassica napus shares a high collinearity relationship with a region from the Brassica rapa A7 chromosome. A BnRf-cosegregated marker (AT3G23870) was then used to screen a B. napus bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. From the resulting 16 positive BAC clones, one (JBnB089D05) was identified to most possibly contain the BnRf c allele. With the assistance of the genome sequence from the Brassica rapa homolog, the 13. 8-kb DNA fragment covering both closest flanking markers from the BAC clone was isolated. Gene annotation based on the comparison of microcollinear regions among Brassica napus, B. rapa and Arabidopsis showed that five potential open reading frames reside in this fragment.

H.xhybridus and H.niger, which belong to different Helleborus sections, are economically important ornamentals. Several other species with minor impact exhibit interesting features, e.g. flower size, flower colour, foliage, scent and disease resistance, which should be introgressed into H.xhybridus or H.niger through interspecific hybridisation. The aims of this study were to investigate whether and which kind of hybridisation barriers occur in crosses between Helleborus species and if they differ in their manifestations, depending on the genetic distance of the respective partners. In order to obtain interspecific hybrids despite crossing barriers, a method to overcome these barriers should be developed. Crossing barriers in Helleborus were localised as predominantly post-zygotic according to in situ pollen tube staining with aniline blue. For certain crosses, pre-zygotic barriers could also be assumed, but pollen tube growth was not totally inhibited. Therefore, embryo rescue techniques via ovule culture were established to overcome the post-zygotic barriers. Ovules were isolated from maternal plants 5-7weeks after pollination in most cases and then cultured in vitro.

We examined variation in growth traits-tree height at ages 4 and 8 years, and diameter at age 13 years-in the common garden experiment testing open-pollinated progenies of 31 seed orchards and 5 commercial seed stands (referred to as populations) at 5 locations. We also examined bud burst phenology at two to five sites at three growing seasons. At one experimental site during the 5th growing season, we measured shoot growth rhythm on all populations. Similar measurements of shoot growth were done on a subset of populations during the 6th growing season together with the analysis of needle growth and foliar chemistry. We found significant variation among populations in growth traits, but also significant population × site (G × E) interactions. We used the regression approach and ecovalence analysis to examine populations' performance stability. Most populations had average responsiveness to environment, and a set of least-responsive poor-growing populations contributed the most to the G × E interaction. Variation in bud burst phenology was associated with geographical distribution of tested progenies. The early bud-bursting populations originated from the north-eastern to north-central Poland, and a group of late bud-bursting populations originated mainly from the south-eastern region. Correlations between bud burst and growth traits were weak to medium and varied by site, but early bud-bursting populations tended to show stronger growth on height and diameter. We found significant differences among populations in final leader length, shoot elongation time and relative growth rate (RGR). However, RGR and shoot elongation time explained less than 30% of variation in leader length and were weakly correlated with tree height. Populations varied in needle length, specific leaf area and foliar nitrogen concentration, but time trends in these traits did not vary among populations or predefined groups of populations. Therefore, the analysis of growth rhythm or needle traits did not help resolve variation in tree growth to support selection decisions. Contrary to our expectation, progeny of seed orchards did not perform significantly better than that of commercial seed stands. This finding, however, should not be extrapolated beyond our set of populations. Nonetheless, the local seed sources were not always the best. From a selection standpoint, our results help culling the worst populations rather than selecting the best ones. Therefore, testing individual family progeny and genetic roguing of existing seed orchards is highly recommended. © 2012 The Author(s).",Bud burst; Ecovalence; Genotype × environment interaction; Growth rhythm; Pinus sylvestris; Stability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860920092

One argument is that widespread and less widespread species are functionally different, whether or not they are native. An opposing statement points out ecologically relevant differences between native and non-native species. We studied the functional traits that drive native and non-native vascular plant species frequency in Germany by explaining species grid-cell frequency using traits and their interaction with status. Native and non-native species frequency was equally driven by life span, ploidy type and self-compatibility. Non-native species frequency rose with later flowering cessation date, whereas this relationship was absent for native species. Native and non-native species differed in storage organs and in the number of environmental conditions they tolerate. We infer that environmental filters drive trait convergence of native and non-native species, whereas competition drives trait divergence. Meanwhile, introduction pathways functionally bias the frequency of non-native species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Alien species; Anthropogenic habitats; Archaeophytes; Community assembly; Functional ecology; Neophytes; Niches; Novel ecosystems; Species ranges,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862119914

A high biodiversity of insect visitors was discovered, 20 insect taxa in all, including 13 species of Hymenoptera, 3 species of Coleóptera, 3 species of Lepidoptera and 1 species of Diptera. Three native bee species, Andrena squamata, Anthophora melanognatha and Megachile abluita, were validated as the principal pollinators.

One species, Coreopsis leavenworthii, is nearly endemic to Florida and is highly desirable for use in highway beautification. Maintaining genetic integrity is critical for C. leavenworthii producers, growers, and users. Coreopsis tinctoria is closely related to and shares similar habitats with C. leavenworthii in Florida. Previous studies indicated that the two species could hybridize and the F 1 hybrids showed chromosomal aberrations and reduced pollen stainability. There has been strong concern that pollen-mediated gene flow from C. tinctoria could contaminate the gene pool and compromise the genetic integrity of C. leavenworthii. In the current study, hand pollination showed that C. leavenworthii and C. tinctoria were highly compatible. F 1 hybrids were fertile and readily produced F 2 and BC 1 individuals. Inheritance studies indicated that the maroon spot on the ray flower is controlled by a single dominant allele and is homozygous in C. tinctoria. This spot serves as a reliable, easy-to-score morphological marker to detect pollen-mediated gene flow from C. tinctoria to C. leavenworthii. Following a discontinuous design, gene flow studies were conducted under field conditions in central Florida over 2 years. The highest rate of pollen-mediated gene flow from C. tinctoria to C. leavenworthii was 4.2% and occurred when the two species were grown 1.5 m apart. Gene flow from C. tinctoria to C. leavenworthii under field conditions followed a leptokurtic curve. Based on the obtained regression equation, separating the two species by 60 m or more could lower the pollen-mediated gene flow from C. tinctoria to minimal levels and protect the genetic integrity of C. leavenworthii.",Asteraceae; Interspecific hybridization; Seed wing; Spotted ray flower; Trichome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862731595

The flightless ratite moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes) were New Zealand's largest herbivores prior to their extinction soon after initial human settlement. Here we contribute to the knowledge of moa diet and ecology by reporting the results of a multidisciplinary study of 35 coprolites from a subalpine cave (Euphrates Cave) on the South Island of New Zealand. Ancient DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating revealed the coprolites were deposited by the extinct upland moa (Megalapteryx didinus), and span from at least 6,368±31 until 694±30 14C years BP; the approximate time of their extinction. Using pollen, plant macrofossil, and ancient DNA analyses, we identified at least 67 plant taxa from the coprolites, including the first evidence that moa fed on the nectar-rich flowers of New Zealand flax (Phormium) and tree fuchsia (Fuchsia excorticata). The plant assemblage from the coprolites reflects a highly-generalist feeding ecology for upland moa, including browsing and grazing across the full range of locally available habitats (spanning southern beech (Nothofagus) forest to tussock (Chionochloa) grassland). Intact seeds in the coprolites indicate that upland moa may have been important dispersal agents for several plant taxa. Plant taxa with putative anti-browse adaptations were also identified in the coprolites. Clusters of coprolites (based on pollen assemblages, moa haplotypes, and radiocarbon dates), probably reflect specimens deposited at the same time by individual birds, and reveal the necessity of suitably large sample sizes in coprolite studies to overcome potential biases in diet interpretation. © 2012 Wood et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863111028

However, compared to ruminants, the lack of data on how horses exploit pastures makes it difficult to propose management recommendations, despite evidence that grass can cover their nutritional requirements and that pasture management can be used to manipulate vegetation dynamics. In this review, we report recent insights into factors that affect the voluntary intake and feeding choices of grazing horses, and we specify the consequences of their diet selection on biodiversity in grassland ecosystems. Horses have a greater intake capacity on roughages than ruminants, which enables them to effectively control competitive grasses and maintain open areas in pastures. When facing variations in resource availability and quality, horses are able to adjust their foraging behaviour (daily grazing time, instantaneous intake rate, feeding site selection) in order to meet their nutritional requirements. How horse characteristics can affect their voluntary intake and feeding choices needs to be specified. The specific mode of grazing employed by horses maintains short lawns within a matrix of tall grass areas, which is known to promote plant and animal diversity, at least in the short term. Horses make less use of forbs and legumes than ruminants, and further studies are needed to determine whether this behaviour could benefit flowering plants and pollinating insects.",Animals; Biodiversity; Feeding choices; Grassland ecosystems; Horses; Intake; Plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862682519

The aim of this study was to describe the Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae pollen dynamics in the atmosphere of Salamanca (midwest Spain) during the years 2000-2007. Measurements were performed by the volumetric method using a Burkard spore trap located in the urban centre at the height of 20 m above ground level. This pollen type was mainly detected in the atmosphere between late spring and late summer, with an Atmospheric Pollen Season (APS) registered between late May and early October and maximum concentrations detected in August. The intradiurnal pattern, calculated by means of 3 different methods, reached a higher hourly concentration percentage in the second half of the day. The correlations obtained between daily pollen counts and different meteorological parameters showed that the airborne presence of this pollen type is associated positively with temperature and negatively with rainfall and relative humidity.

They occur mostly in the Southern Hemisphere with only a few species in the Northern Hemisphere, of which three genera, Hypoxis, Molineria, and Curculigo, with eight species are distributed in China. Recently, we have found a hypoxid-like plant in China that is quite different in floral structure from any of the three genera and even of the known taxa in Hypoxidaceae. Methodology/Principal Findings: In addition to morphological analysis, we performed maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses based on fragments of the chloroplast matK and rbcL genes of 60 taxa in 12 families representing all major clades of the Hypoxidaceae alliance. Results showed that Hypoxidaceae is monophyletic and and that the new plant belongs to it, forming a distinct clade within the family Hypoxidaceae as a sister of Molineria. Phylogeny of the Hypoxidaceae family was constructed based on a combined matrix of the chloroplast rbcL, trnS-G, and trnL-F regions of 59 taxa in Hypoxidaceae and its alliance.

The phenotypic variance was higher than their corresponding genotypic variance for all the traits. The characters like plant height, ear insertion height, days to harvest, cob length, cob diameter, husk number, green ear yield, fodder yield and puncture pressure were found to have high magnitude of environmental variance than genetic variance, indicate higher influence of environment on these traits. Highest coefficient of variance was found for turcicum leaf blight susceptibility followed by green ear yield, ear length, and fodder yield and ear insertion height. The variance analysis showed the presence of high heritability and high genetic advance for ear insertion height, ear length, ear diameter, TSS content and TLB reaction, which indicate the additive genetic control of these traits. However, days to 50% silking, days to 50% tasselling and days to harvest were found to be controlled by non-additive gene action, as these traits had high estimate of heritability accompanied with low genetic advance.

Immature fig wasps feed on galled ovules located inside figs, the inflorescences of Ficus species (Moraceae). After mating, adult pollinator males chew communal exit-holes that allow mated females (which are often also their siblings) to escape. Figs also support non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs), some of which produce exit-holes independently. We determined whether collaboration between pollinator males (Kradibia tentacularis from Ficus montana) was necessary for the release of their females, and used the relationship between male numbers and likelihood of success to measure the extent of cooperation during exit-hole production. These attributes were then compared with those of an NPFW (Sycoscapter sp.) from the same host plant. Pollinators were more abundant than NPFW, but their more female-biased sex ratio meant male pollinator densities were only slightly higher. Individual males of both species could produce an exit-hole. Single males of the NPFW were just as successful as single male pollinators, but only male pollinators cooperated effectively, becoming more successful as their numbers increased. The lack of cooperation among NPFW may be linked to their earlier period of intense inter-male aggression. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Aggression; Cooperation; Fighting; Male-male interactions; Mutualism; Parasitoid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861494554

Here, we examine the adaptive significance of flower colour in Disa ferruginea, a non-rewarding orchid that is thought to attract its butterfly pollinator by mimicking the flowers of sympatric nectar-producing species. Disa ferruginea has red flowers in the western part of its range and orange flowers in the eastern part—a colour shift that we hypothesized to be the outcome of selection for resemblance to different local nectar-producing plants. Using reciprocal translocations of red and orange phenotypes as well as arrays of artificial flowers, we found that the butterfly Aeropetes tulbaghia, the only pollinator of the orchid, preferred both the red phenotype and red artificial flowers in the west where its main nectar plant also has red flowers, and both the orange phenotype and orange artificial flowers in the east, where its main nectar plant has orange flowers. This phenotype by environment interaction demonstrates that the flower colour shift in D. ferruginea is adaptive and driven by local colour preference in its pollinator. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Batesian mimicry; Disa ferruginea; Ecological divergence; Geographical colour variation; Local adaptation; Pollinator selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865591158

The reasons remain unknown, and this has a negative impact on lotus breeding. To determine the causes, we carried out two crosses of flower lotus, that is, Jinsenianhua Qinhuaihuadeng and Qinhuaihuadeng Jinsenianhua and pollen viability, pistil receptivity, and embryo development were investigated. The pollen grains collected at 05:00-06:00hrs had the highest viability, and the viabilities of Jinsenianhua and Qinhuaihuadeng were 20.6 and 15.7, respectively. At 4h after artificial pollination, the number of pollen grains germinating on each stigma reached a peak: 63.0 and 17.2 per stigma in Jinsenianhua Qinhuaihuadeng and Qinhuaihuadeng Jinsenianhua, respectively. At 1d after artificial pollination, the percentages of normal embryos in the two crosses were 55.0 and 21.9, respectively; however, at 11 d after pollination, the corresponding percentages were 20.8 and 11.2. Seed sets of the two crosses were 17.9 and 8.0, respectively. The results suggested that low pistil receptivity and embryo abortion caused low seed set in Qinhuaihuadeng Jinsenianhua, whereas low fecundity of Jinsenianhua Qinhuaihuadeng was mainly attributable to embryo abortion.

The function of heterostyly has usually been related to the promotion of cross-pollination fostered by the perfect adjustment between pollinators and flower morphologies. Rubiaceae is the largest family in which this polymorphism is present. Nevertheless, just a few studies on the evolution of heterostyly have been carried out in this family.To investigate the appearance and maintenance of heterostyly we select the subfamily Rubioideae as study group. Rubioideae occur in both tropical and temperate regions and since the tropics are known to contain higher biodiversity and greater ecological specialisation than temperate areas, we characterise the taxa as tropical, non-tropical or mixed distributed (when they are present in tropical and non-tropical areas) and explored whether the heterostyly, as a specialised system, is more stable in tropical regions than in other climates of the world.Ancestral nodes in Rubioideae present heterostyly, which also is maintained along most evolutionary lineages of this group. Although we do not find a significant correlation between the presence of heterostyly and the climate zones along the whole subfamily, our results show that two of the main clades in the Spermacoceae alliance where heterostyly is lost are distributed in non-tropical areas or, at least, they are not restricted to tropical distributions.These results partially support the hypothesis that plant lineages when exposed to different pollination scenarios may evolve towards divergent pollination systems and different degrees of specialisation. However, a more detailed analysis at the species level is suggested for future studies. © 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.",BayesTraits; Floral polymorphism; Pollinator efficiency; Spermacoceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860841937

We describe here how these pressures shaped a bird that flies like a bird into one that flies like a fly. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862680219

Morphological characters and phenological growth stages of four olive cultivars Ousleti, Brahmi, Chaibi and Jeli were described during 2004-2006. Morphological classification used, was based on tree, leaf, inflorescence, fruit and endocarp characteristics. Technolopcal characters of the fruits concerned the oil content and their chemical composition. Floral phenology, flowering and pistil abortion rates of the cultivars were recorded at full bloom. Also, a pollen monitoring survey for each cultivar was investigated. This study shows the relative hfferences between cultivars in flowering, fruiting patterns, oil yleld and fatty acid contents of the fruits. Under the conditions of Djebel Ouslet, the flowering period of the cultivars was similar and covered each other but little differences were recorded in the duration and the onset of flowering. The evaluation of self-fertility showed that all cultivars can be considered self-compatible and fruiting rates were higher under free-pollination than under self-pollination. The results obtained are consistent with the high pollen capacity of the cultivars, suggesting their use as pollinizers in the cross-pollination assays to improve productivity. Large hfferences in oil content and in fatty acid profiles were observed in the cultivars examined. But their olive oil are conform to international standards. The ranges of fatty acid for all the cultivars fall within the accepted limits for fatty acid composition of Virgin olive oil. This database of the most representative cultivars grown in Djebel Ouslet concerning their agronomic and chemical characteristics could be exploited for screening synonyms within this olive population and could provide information for cultural purposes and breeding programs. © 2012 Academic Journals Inc.",Classification of olive; Floral biology; Oil quality; Olive trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862263810

One sperm fuses with the egg to generate a zygote, the other with the central cell to produce endosperm [1]. A mechanism preventing multiple pollen tubes from entering an ovule would ensure that only two sperm are delivered to female gametes. We use live-cell imaging [1, 2] and a novel mixed-pollination assay that can detect multiple pollen tubes and multiple sets of sperm within a single ovule to show that Arabidopsis efficiently prevents multiple pollen tubes from entering an ovule. However, when gamete-fusion defective hap2(gcs1) or duo1 sperm are delivered to ovules, as many as three additional pollen tubes are attracted. When gamete fusion fails, one of two pollen tube-attracting synergid cells persists, enabling the ovule to attract more pollen tubes for successful fertilization. This mechanism prevents the delivery of more than one pair of sperm to an ovule, provides a means of salvaging fertilization in ovules that have received defective sperm, and ensures maximum reproductive success by distributing pollen tubes to all ovules. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862689647

However, there are no studies investigating the consequences of animal scarcity on seed set, seed consumption and seed dispersal at large geographical scales. We exploited the unprecedented scarcity of pollinating bumblebees and butterflies in the vicinity of Chernobyl, Ukraine, linked to the effects of radiation on pollinator abundance, to test for effects of pollinator abundance on the ecosystem. There were considerably fewer pollinating insects in areas with high levels of radiation. Fruit trees and bushes (apple Malus domestica, pear Pyrus communis, rowan Sorbus aucuparia, wild rose Rosa rugosa, twistingwood Viburnum lantana, and European cranberry bush Viburnum opulus) that are all pollinated by insects produced fewer fruit in highly radioactively contaminated areas, partly linked to the local reduction in abundance of pollinators. This was the case even when controlling for the fact that fruit trees were generally smaller in more contaminated areas. Fruit-eating birds like thrushes and warblers that are known seed dispersers were less numerous in areas with lower fruit abundance, even after controlling for the effects of radiation, providing a direct link between radiation, pollinator abundance, fruit abundance and abundance of frugivores. Given that the Chernobyl disaster happened 25 years ago, one would predict reduced local recruitment of fruit trees if fruit set has been persistently depressed during that period; indeed, local recruitment was negatively related to the level of radiation and positively to the local level of fruit set. The patterns at the level of trees were replicated at the level of villages across the study site. This study provides the first large-scale study of the effects of a suppressed pollinator community on ecosystem functioning. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Chernobyl; Ecosystem functioning; Fruits; Plant recruitment; Radiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869082350

Ascorbic acid (Asc) promotes cell division by inducing G1 to S progression but its role in embryo development has not been examined. In this study, we show that the level of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) expression, which recycles Asc and regulates Asc pool size, affects the rate of monozygotic twinning and polycotyly. DHAR-induced twinning resulted from altered cell polarity and longitudinal instead of transverse cell division that generated embryos of equal size. Direct injection of Asc into ovaries phenocopied DHAR-induced twinning. Twinning induced by Asc was developmentally limited to the first two days after pollination whereas polycotyly was induced when the level of Asc was elevated just prior to cotyledon initiation.

H. citrina has nocturnal, yellowish flowers with a sweet fragrance and is pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths. We evaluated the relative roles of flower color and scent on the evolutionary shift from a diurnally flowering ancestor to H. citrina. We conducted a series of experiments that mimic situations in which mutants differing in either flower color, floral scent or both appeared in a diurnally flowering population. An experimental array of 6×6 potted plants, mixed with 24 plants of H. fulva and 12 plants of either F1 or F2 hybrids, were placed in the field, and visitations of swallowtail butterflies and nocturnal hawkmoths were recorded with camcorders. Swallowtail butterflies preferentially visited reddish or orange-colored flowers and hawkmoths preferentially visited yellowish flowers. Neither swallowtail butterflies nor nocturnal hawkmoths showed significant preferences for overall scent emission. Our results suggest that mutations in flower color would be more relevant to the adaptive shift from a diurnally flowering ancestor to H. citrina than that in floral scent. © 2012 Hirota et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862503657

Fruit-eating and nectar-drinking bats promote forest regeneration, support timber production, and are essential for many food products by dispersing seeds and pollinating flowers of many tropical and subtropical plant species.

Floral rewards such as nectar, however, are dynamic, and foraging animals will increase their energetic profit if they can make use of floral cues that more accurately indicate nectar availability. Here we document such a cue-transient humidity gradients-using the night blooming flowers of Oenothera cespitosa (Onagraceae). The headspace of newly opened flowers reaches levels of about 4% above ambient relative humidity due to additive evapotranspirational water loss through petals and water-saturated air from the nectar tube. Floral humidity plumes differ from ambient levels only during the first 30 min after anthesis (before nectar is depleted in wild populations), whereas other floral traits (scent, shape, and color) persist for 12-24 h. Manipulative experiments indicated that floral humidity gradients are mechanistically linked to nectar volume and therefore contain information about energy rewards to floral visitors. Behavioral assays with Hyles lineata (Sphingidae) and artificial flowers with appropriate humidity gradients suggest that these hawkmoth pollinators distinguish between subtle differences in relative humidity when other floral cues are held constant. Moths consistently approached and probed flowers with elevated humidity over those with ambient humidity levels. Because floral humidity gradients are largely produced by the evaporation of nectar itself, they represent condition-informative cues that facilitate remote sensing of floral profitability by discriminating foragers. In a xeric environment, this level of honest communication should be adaptive when plant reproductive success is pollinator limited, due to intense competition for the attention of a specialized pollinator.",Floral display; Honest signaling; Pollination biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862174774

We studied seed set in two reciprocal crosses between lotus cultivars ('Guili' × 'Aijiangnan' and 'Molingqiuse' × 'Qinhuaiyanzhi') to obtain insights into factors that govern fecundity in these experimental hybrids. Pollen viability, stigma receptivity and embryo development were compared for each hybrid and reciprocal cross.Results: Pollen viability of the individual cultivars ranged from 4.1% to 20.2%, with the highest level (>11.9%) for all cultivars observed from the earliest collected grains (05:00-06:00 a.m.). Stigmatic pollen germination peaked at 4 h after pollination and varied from 4.8 to 60.6 grains per stigma among the crosses. Production of normal embryos ranged from 7.6% to 58.8% at 1 d after pollination and from 0 to 25% by 11 d after pollination. Seed set in crosses (0.2-23.3%) was generally lower than in open-pollinated plants (8.4-26.5%). Similar to the germination results, seed set was substantially reduced in both reciprocal crosses.Conclusions: These results suggested that poor pollen fertility, low stigma receptivity, and embryo abortion were responsible for the failure of the crosses 'Molingqiuse' × 'Qinhuaiyanzhi', 'Qinhuaiyanzhi' × 'Molingqiuse', and 'Aijiangnan' × 'Guili'. © 2012 Teng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861881135

The widespread use of agricultural pesticides is recognized as a potential cause of these declines. Previous studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid on pollinator colonies, but these investigations have mainly focused on adult honey bees. Native stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) are key pollinators in neotropical areas and are threatened with extinction due to deforestation and pesticide use. Few studies have directly investigated the effects of pesticides on these pollinators. Furthermore, the existing impact studies did not address the issue of larval ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar, which could potentially have dire consequences for the colony. Here, we assessed the effects of imidacloprid ingestion by stingless bee larvae on their survival, development, neuromorphology and adult walking behavior. Increasing doses of imidacloprid were added to the diet provided to individual worker larvae of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides throughout their development. Survival rates above 50% were only observed at insecticide doses lower than 0.0056 ?g active ingredient (a.i.)/bee. No sublethal effect on body mass or developmental time was observed in the surviving insects, but the pesticide treatment negatively affected the development of mushroom bodies in the brain and impaired the walking behavior of newly emerged adult workers. Therefore, stingless bee larvae are particularly susceptible to imidacloprid, as it caused both high mortality and sublethal effects that impaired brain development and compromised mobility at the young adult stage. These findings demonstrate the lethal effects of imidacloprid on native stingless bees and provide evidence of novel serious sublethal effects that may compromise colony survival. The ecological and economic importance of neotropical stingless bees as pollinators, their susceptibility to insecticides and the vulnerability of their larvae to insecticide exposure emphasize the importance of studying these species. © 2012 Tomé et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861849676

This measure is particularly useful in facultatively autogamous plants for which seed set cannot be used as a direct measure of pollinator effectiveness. We used selective exclusion experiments to assess the importance of insects for outcrossing in Protea caffra, a facultatively autogamous shrub with scented flowers that are visited frequently by both birds and insects (mainly beetles). • Methods and results: Pollen loads on stigmas, pollen tube growth, seed set, seed mass, germination, and early seedling survivorship were similar for vertebrate-excluded and open-pollinated inflorescences. Pollen-supplementation mostly did not increase seed set, revealing resource limitation. Mean multilocus outcrossing rates, estimated using eight polymorphic allozyme loci, were similar for progeny from inflorescences excluded from bird visitors (0.65) and for those visited by both birds and insects (0.59). Wright's fixation indices indicated that the adult population is near Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium but differed markedly for maternal plants (F IS = -0.187±0.065) and their early stage progeny (F IS = 0.258 ± 0.002). Since seed from self and cross hand-pollinations were equally viable in terms of germination, this discrepancy in F IS could be explained by inbreeding depression that occurs between germination and reproductive maturity. • Conclusions: Since out crossing rates were not reduced when birds were excluded, we infer that insects are effective agents of cross pollination in P. caffra. This helps to explain the evolution of traits associated with insect pollination, such as fruity floral scent, in this species. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Allozyme analysis; Breeding system; Cetoniine beetle pollination; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Protea; Proteaceae; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862137075

Location: Diverse shrublands growing on low-nutrient soils occur around the globe, with examples in the Cape region of Africa, in the Mediterranean basin and the south-west of Australia. Methods: This Forum paper discusses and evaluates an hypothesis against the evidence in previously available (but hitherto separated) publications. Results: Low-nutrient soils create an effective excess of carbon. This makes the production of carbon-based floral rewards relatively cheap. Cheap rewards encourage the use of animal pollinators and this may lead to the generation and maintenance of elevated species-richness in some plant groups, via a number of mechanisms. The literature is used to develop 9 testable predictions of this hypothesis. Conclusions: The hypothesis discussed here is a plausible and testable explanation for the observed patterns in plant diversity. It is not, however, likely to be the only explanation, and could easily operate alongside several other mechanisms. © 2011 Commonwealth of Australia.",Carbon; Chaparral; Ecological stoichiometry; Fynbos; Heathland; Kwongan; Maquis; Matorral; Pollinator reward; Shrubland; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860187301

Group-selection silviculture (where groups of trees are removed from a forested matrix, rather than single trees), increased the abundance of pollinators and flowering stems, but only after leaf-out. Wild red raspberry (Rubus strigosus) and bees benefitted most from the creation of canopy gaps. The combination of increased light, warm, bare soils, and abundant nectar-rich raspberry flowers probably created ideal habitat for soil-nesting bees, factors which are relatively absent from unharvested stands. By contrast, before leaf-out, spring ephemerals and high light-levels were universal and pollinators were even across treatments. More pollinators were caught in canopy gaps than in forested areas, and the proportion of fertilized ovules of spring beauty (Claytonia caroliniana) was higher in gaps than in the forest, suggesting that pollinators prefer foraging in gaps, even in spring.

Corolla shape has been implicated as a factor in floral isolation and evolutionary shifts between pollinator affinities, yet few studies have investigated how quantifiable differences in corolla shape affect pollinator behaviour. 2.This study measured variation in corolla shape (primarily corolla limb dissectedness) across eight species of Nicotiana (section Alatae) and its influence on flower choice by nocturnal hawkmoths (Manduca sexta). Behavioural assays performed under simulated moonlight tested for hawkmoth preference and performance differences between the average floral shape of sphingophilous species (C Hawkmoth), the average of all Nicotiana species in this study (C All), and/or the average of hummingbird-pollinated species (C Hummingbird). 3.In mixed arrays, hawkmoths preferred C Hawkmoth over C All flowers, but only when shapes were not standardized for surface area. In homogeneous arrays, hawkmoths emptied more flowers with C Hawkmoth shapes, but performance did not differ when shapes were standardized by surface area. However, hawkmoths visited fewer C Hummingbird flowers than other shapes when surface area was standardized. 4.Our study shows that hawkmoth behaviour can be affected by differences in corolla shape, but that floral size may be more important than true shape differences in floral discrimination by hawkmoths. © 2012 The Authors.

Prolongation of floral receptivity comes at the cost of reduced male and/or female reproductive success among older flowers. Fig trees (Ficus spp.) have a highly specific pollination symbiosis and individual inflorescences (syconia) that remain receptive for days or weeks. Reproductive success in monoecious fig trees involves production of both seeds and fig wasp offspring. We assessed whether the reproductive output of individual syconia changes with the length of time they waited for pollination, and whether the relative female and male reproductive success also changes. A pollination experiment was conducted in an SE Asian monoecious fig tree Ficus curtipes, in which receptive syconia were covered with mesh bags to exclude wasps and pollinated by single pollinators of this fig tree at their different receptive ages. When the syconia matured their size and contents were recorded. Seed quality was also assessed. The results showed that pollinators entered syconia that had been waiting for up to 36 days. The frequencies of abortions among syconia pollinated at different ages were low throughout. The number of un-utilised flowers increased progressively in older syconia. Seed production was highest in syconia entered on the first day of receptivity, whereas pollinator production peaked in syconia pollinated on day 12, then declined in older syconia. Consequently, overall reproductive efficiency declined with syconium age and floral sex allocation became more male-biased in older syconia. Older syconia also produced lighter seeds. These results suggest that un-pollinated syconia of F. curtipes can remain receptive for several weeks. This makes pollination of each syconium more likely, but at the cost of reduced productivity and with more ovules allocated to male function. However, the prolongation of floral receptivity has significance for the co-adaptation between syconia and fig wasps and for the evolution of the fig tree-fig wasp symbiosis. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.",Ficus; Fig wasp; Floral sex allocation; Flower age; Pollination; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868465392

Our measurements revealed the presence of three types of photoreceptors, maximally sensitive in the UV, green and red areas of the spectrum. Using color vision space diagrams, we calculated the distribution of beetle-visited flower colors in the glaphyrid and honeybee color space and evaluated whether chromatic discrimination differs between the two types of pollinators. Respective color loci in the beetle color space are located on one side of the locus for green foliage background, whereas in the honeybee the flower color loci surround the locus occupied by green foliage.

Because insecticides are used during bloom to manage insect pests, bumble bees may be at risk of exposure. We therefore assessed the susceptibility of B. impatiens to some insecticides used or projected for use in blueberry pest management. Workers were killed by topical applications of spinosad, spinetoram, deltamethrin, and phosmet, but not flubendiamide. Similarly, when ingested in honey solution, spinetoram and deltamethrin were toxic, whereas flubendiamide did not cause mortality up to double its recommended label rate. In another experiment, workers were fed one sublethal dose of contaminated honey solution and placed in microcolonies to assess impacts on feeding, life span, and reproduction.

In some species, pollinating bees appear to preferentially visit inflorescences (blossoms) with large resin-producing glands, whereas in other species bees preferentially visit blossoms with large involucral bracts. In this study, the reliability of bract and gland size as signals of the quantity of resin produced in one species, D. scandens, was assessed. Whether resin secretion has a cost with respect to the number or mass of the seeds produced by a blossom was also examined. MethodsMeasurements were made of bract size, gland size and the amount of resin secreted by blossoms of D. scandens maintained in a common environment, and the relationships between these traits were analysed. Resin production was also manipulated, and the effects of the manipulation were tested on seed set and seed mass. Key ResultsThe amount of resin produced was better predicted by the size of the gland than by the size of the bract. Furthermore, when the effect of gland size was accounted for, bract size only weakly predicted the amount of resin produced. Neither an increase in resin secretion (by daily removal of the resin) nor a decrease (by removal of the resin gland) affected seed set or seed mass detectably, but resin production correlated positively with mean seed mass at the individual level once the size of the resin gland was accounted for. ConclusionsGland size is a better indicator of the amount of reward than bract size, although the latter remained an honest signal of the quantity of resin produced. Resin secretion has no detectable cost in terms of seed production, but may be condition dependent, as suggested by a positive correlation with seed mass at the individual level. © The Author 2012.

Long-term studies examining vegetation changes from the period before agricultural industrialisation are however rare. Here, we ask how management intensification and increased nutrient input initiated in the 1950/1960s have altered grassland plant community composition, species diversity and functional trait composition using comprehensive datasets from five floodplain regions (plus one protected reference region) in northern Germany. Sites with available historical relevés and vegetation maps (1950/1960s, 1990s) were resampled in 2008 to facilitate the analysis of a period spanning four to five decades.Plant community composition changed tremendously in all study regions during the 50. year period, which was related to increasing Ellenberg indicator values for nutrient availability. Species richness at the plot-level fell by 30-50% over the period, and losses in functional diversity were equally large. A non-formal comparison with the results from the protected reference study region indicates that the changes may mostly be attributable to local nutrient input rather than to supra-regional climate change. Our results indicate a consistent trend towards much more species-poor communities dominated by mow-tolerant, N-demanding competitive grasses, whereas species with more ruderal strategies, species flowering early in the season and, in particular, insect-pollinated herbs have all decreased.

Disentangling the relative impact of losses in plant species richness and intensified management on higher trophic level organisms is important for conservation recommendations.We established different management regimes along an experimental gradient of plant species richness within "" The Jena-Experiment"" in Germany and quantified herbivory as well as grasshoppers and pollinators. Herbivory, grasshopper density and species richness and frequency of flower visiting pollinators were recorded two times in each of four subplots of altogether 80 plots differing in plant species richness. Each of the four subplots was subject to four different levels of fertilizer application and mowing to simulate very low, low, high and very high land use intensity.Fertilization and mowing significantly affected plant-herbivore interactions but plant species richness had no discernible effect. Grasshoppers were most abundant at high intensity subplots (3.1 individuals perm 2) and least abundant on very low intensity subplots (1.3 individuals perm 2). Leaf damage caused by herbivores was highest in even the very high intensity subplots (3.7%) with four mowing events per year and high amounts of fertilizer application and lowest on subplots with a low management intensity (2.4%) comprising two mowing events per year but no fertilizer application. In contrast, pollinators benefited most from lower management intensities, with only one or two mowing events and no fertilizer addition. In addition, higher numbers of flowering plant species and increased blossom cover was associated with enhanced pollinator species richness and flower visitation.Our results indicate that even in grasslands with high plant species richness, mowing and fertilization are more important drivers of herbivory and flower visitation by pollinators. Management with no more than two cuts per year and without fertilizer application in our grasslands balanced the ecosystem functions of increased pollination and decreased herbivory. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Bees; Ecosystem functions; Fertilization; Grasshoppers; Land use; Mowing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860222034

This is exemplified in California where the demand for honeybees Apis mellifera to pollinate almond Prunus dulcis is increasing, but problems with honeybee health suggest it may not be sustainable to rely solely on the pollination service of a single species. 2.We investigated the effect of the quantity of surrounding natural habitat, organic management and strips of semi-natural vegetation on flower visitation frequency of wild and managed pollinators and fruit set in 23 California almond orchards (15 conventional, 8 organic). Five conventional and four organic orchards were surrounded by a low percentage (<5%) of natural or semi-natural habitat in a 1-km radius and another five conventional and four organic orchards were surrounded by a high percentage of these habitats (>30%). A further five conventional orchards with a low percentage of surrounding natural habitat had an adjacent strip of semi-natural vegetation and were included in the study to represent a realistic option for orchard management in intensive agricultural landscapes. 3.Wild bee species visited almond flowers but only in orchards with adjacent semi-natural habitat or vegetation strips. Organic management increased the flower visitation frequencies of hover flies and wild bees. The presence of a strip of semi-natural vegetation in orchards with a low percentage of surrounding natural habitat increased the number of species and the flower visitation frequency by wild pollinators but only at orchard edges and not to the degree seen when natural habitat was abundant. 4.Wild bee species richness and flower visitation frequency, but not honeybee frequency, were related to fruit set. Fruit set increased with increasing percentage of natural habitat surrounding the orchards. Organic farming or the presence of a vegetation strip did not increase fruit set. 5.Synthesis and applications. The restoration of high quality habitat strips along the edges of crop fields in highly intensified agricultural landscapes should be encouraged and monitored to conserve pollinators and to determine whether benefits for agriculture can be realized. Although honeybees are the main and most important pollinating insects for many plants, wild pollinators may be necessary to ensure high fruit set.

We studied marginal populations of Trollius laxus Salisbury (Spreading Globeflower), a rare herbaceous plant of calcareous wetlands, making observations of natural variation in one population, and experimentally cutting back herbaceous neighboring plants in another. In a Trollius population under a mixed canopy, we quantified natural light levels at each plant and tested for correlations with measures of reproduction and herbivory. Flowering and fruit production were positively correlated with light level in one of the two years measured, while herbivore damage and plant growth were uncorrelated with light level. In another study population, where the woody canopy had been removed previously, experimental clipping of herbaceous neighbors did not increase herbivore damage to T. laxus, nor did it decrease flowering or fruit production. Also, the few potential pollinators observed were all small insects unlikely to be negatively affected by increased light. Our results suggest that management to reduce shade in these marginal T. laxus populations is unlikely to have a negative impact on these rare plants via their herbivores and pollinators.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863937756

The effects of the distance between the mother and male trees and the size of the male trees on pollen dispersal as well as fractional paternity allocation for the offspring and the number of un sampled males were estimated simultaneously. Based on the estimated parameters of pollen dispersal, the availability of pollen from the males along the river was obtained for the individual mother trees. The pollen availability was not correlated with the proportion of offspring sired by immigrating pollen from un sampled males (8%-50%), but was positively correlated with the effective number of pollen donors in sampled males (1-8). The results suggest that the reduced pollen donor diversity owing to low pollen availability increases the fraction of full-sibs in offspring and subsequent reduction in genetic diversity, but that pollen immigration compensates the offspring for the reduced genetic diversity.",Fragmentation; Micro satellite loci; Paternity assignment; Pollen-mediated gene flow; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861853516

Bacteria have also been occasionally observed in floral nectar, but their prevalence, phylogenetic diversity and ecological role within plant-pollinator-yeast systems remains unclear. Here we present the first reported survey of bacteria in floral nectar from a natural plant community. Culturable bacteria occurring in a total of 71 nectar samples collected from 27 South African plant species were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Rarefaction-based analyses were used to assess operational taxonomic units (OTUs) richness at the plant community level using nectar drops as sampling units. Our results showed that bacteria are common inhabitants of floral nectar of South African plants (53.5% of samples yielded growth), and their communities are characterized by low species richness (18 OTUs at a 16S rRNA gene sequence dissimilarity cut-off of 3%) and moderate phylogenetic diversity, with most isolates belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria. Furthermore, isolates showed osmotolerance, catalase activity and the ability to grow under microaerobiosis, three traits that might help bacteria to overcome important factors limiting their survival and/or growth in nectar. © 2012 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Whether divergence between the cultigen and wild forms has also lead to reduced reproductive compatibility is unknown for many species. Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) has been bred as a crop at least since Roman times. To test if this has led to a loss in reproductive compatibility with wild chicory, we planted cultivar, wild, and F 1 hybrid plants into two field plots, and let them pollinate freely. On 2 days, in the beginning and middle of the flowering season, we counted the numbers of flowering capitula and open flowers per capitulum, which in combination with counts of viable pollen per flower were used to estimate the expected proportion of seeds fathered by cultivar, wild, and hybrid plants. Open capitula on wild and hybrid plants were marked, and when seeds were ripe we determined whether cultivar, wild or hybrid plants had pollinated the seeds, using AFLP markers. Cultivar plants fathered much fewer seeds than expected, both on wild and hybrid plants, suggesting that some degree of incompatibility has evolved between cultivar and wild chicory. Hybrid plants fathered more seeds than expected on some of the hybrid plants, indicating that hybrids do not suffer much from outbreeding depression. Our study thus suggests that cultivated and wild chicory, even though they belong to the same species, have diverged to an extent where reproduction between them is somewhat impaired. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cichorium intybus; Crop × wild hybridization; Fertilization; Outbreeding depression; Plant domestication; Pollination; Seed maturation; Sexual compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860993338

The creation of wildflower strips has emerged as a key tool to conserve beneficial insect groups in these systems. Yet, the efficacy of these schemes in delivering multiple ecosystem services is usually limited by our poor understanding of how plant species composition, functional traits and trait diversity affect insect visitation and resource use. Here we investigate the effects of plant floral traits and trait diversity on flower visitation by three functionally distinct beneficial insect groups, which provide crop pollination and pest control services: bumblebees, hoverflies and parasitoid wasps. We created plots that contained plants with either long or short-corolla flowers, as well as mixed plots, which contained plants presenting both floral traits concurrently. In functionally simple plots, insect groups exhibited distinct floral associations, with bumblebees being almost exclusively associated with long-corolla flower plots, whereas parasitoids and hoverflies strongly favoured plots with short-corolla flowers. When these flower types were planted in combination (mixed-trait plots), bumblebee and hoverfly visitation was maintained at the level of their respective preferred single-trait plot, but parasitoid visitation was reduced by 50%. Thus, the informed selection of functionally diverse flower patches can be an effective tool to attract a higher diversity of insect groups than functionally simple plots. However, this may increase interference competition between visitors and limit the value of floral resources for beneficials that are weak competitors. © 2012 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Agro-ecosystems; Biological control; Community ecology; Conservation; Floral resources; Functional diversity; Insects; Interaction webs; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864932714

However, selection for less attractive displays imposed by non-pollinating agents, particularly herbivores, may balance pollinator-driven selection for highly visible inflorescences. We investigated whether inflorescence architecture, particularly the unusual groundlevel flowering associated with a specialized bird perch in Babiana ringens may have originated, in part, as an adaptive response to mammalian herbivory. Methods: We measured levels of herbivory by antelope in populations of B. hirsuta, the putative sister species of B. ringens, which possesses the likely ancestral form of inflorescence architecture. To test for position-dependent effects of herbivory on flowers, we compared the herbivory rates and seed production of manipulated inflorescences in a field experiment. We predicted that flowers at the base of inflorescences would suffer less herbivory than those in apical positions. Results: We found herbivore damage to flowers in 50% of naturally occurring B. hirsuta plants. Manipulated inflorescences with only basal flowers, and consequently similar inflorescence architecture to B. ringens, experienced significantly lower herbivory and higher seed set than inflorescences manipulated to have only apical flowers. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that position-dependent herbivory on inflorescences could have played a role in the evolution of inflorescence design.

In the field where the daily mean temperature for 3weeks prior to pollen dispersal was 16.5°C, the mean pollen fertility of the F1 plants was 42.8%, which was lower than the value observed in the parental species (96.0-98.1%). In two greenhouses with a daily mean temperature of 20.4 and 15.8°C, the mean pollen fertility of the F1 plants was 53.1% and 44.0%, respectively, which were higher than the values reported previously for the hybrids between L. temulentum×L. multiflorum (maximum of about 20%). The seed set of the F1 plants was 24% under open-pollinated conditions in the field compared with 4.2-8.8% under self-pollinated conditions in the two greenhouses. These results indicated that the F1 plants were self-fertile and able to set F2 seed, with a significant reduction in pollen fertility occurring with a decrease in the daily mean temperature (2.15% decrease in fertility per unit decrease in temperature). The germination rate of the F2 seeds was approximately 57%, indicating the possibility of producing an F2 population for future genetic analysis. This is the first report of F1 plants from L. temulentum×L. multiflorum with fertile pollen and with the ability to produce progeny by self-pollination.

These genera form the desmoid clade, which, because of the presence of diverse flower and fruit syndromes including different types of pollination chambers and moniliform monocarps, offers an opportunity to investigate potentially ecologically significant shifts in flower and fruit characters. Despite its morphological diversity, however, generic delimitation within the desmoid clade is problematic and the intergeneric relationships of the constituent genera are only poorly understood. Bayesian, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses of plastid DNA sequence data (matK, psbA-trnH, ndhF, rbcL, trnL-F; ca. 5.4 kb; 52 taxa) were used to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the desmoid clade. The evolution and taxonomic utility of selected fruit and flower characters was investigated with likelihood and parsimony ancestral character reconstructions. The results indicate problems in the current delimitations of Dasymaschalon and Friesodielsia. Friesodielsia as currently circumscribed is polyphyletic, with African Friesodielsia species allied to the African genus Monanthotaxis, and only distantly related to Asian representatives. The majority of Dasymaschalon species form a strongly supported clade, but three species are more closely related to Asian species of Friesodielsia. Ancestral character reconstructions indicate that seed number and monocarp shape are of limited value in generic circumscriptions, and that the three-petalled corolla characteristic of Dasymaschalon evolved independently twice within the desmoid clade. Disruptions to homeotic gene expression or strong selective pressure for a partial enclosure of the mature stamens and carpels by the corolla are hypothesised to underlie the parallel evolution of pollination chambers formed by outer petal homologues subsequent to inner petal loss.",Annonaceae; Character evolution; Dasymaschalon; Flower morphology; Friesodielsia; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862316547

The use of managed, pathogen-carrying bumblebees for pollination of greenhouse crops began shortly before these declines, and wild bumblebees near greenhouses now have high pathogen loads. This has led to speculation that pathogen spillover from commercial bumblebees caused declines of these species. We test this hypothesis using a large dataset of bumblebee occurrence records and agricultural census data. We find support for the pathogen spillover hypothesis for two species but no evidence that pathogen spillover caused the near disappearance of the previously widespread Bombus affinis. Furthermore, we show that pesticide use and habitat loss are unlikely to be major causes of decline for any of the Bombus species examined.

Crotalaria. A representative sample of flowers from 211 species was dissected to record morphological character states.

Six structural-functional flower types were identified: (1) pump; (2) gullet; (3) hugging; (4) saddle; (5) tunnel and (6) brush (saddle and tunnel types described here for the first time). . Crotalaria uniquely has the brush type, characterized by a rostrate keel, highly dimorphic anthers, stylar trichomes and elaborate callosities on the standard petal. Remarkably, . Crotalaria and . Bolusia are the only genera of the tribe Crotalarieae with callosities present in all of the species. In other genera, callosities are generally absent or infrequent. Trends towards specialization of pollination syndromes are apparent as assemblages of apomorphic states that co-occur in what we refer to here as "" specialized flowers"" ; individual characters are labile or non-homologous (e.g. callosities) and diagnostically less valuable.

The main goal of this study was to analyse the functional aspects of nectar secretion related to interaction with pollinators by evaluating floral biology, cellular and sub-cellular anatomy of the septal nectary and nectar composition of Ananas ananassoides, including an experimental approach to nectar dynamics. MethodsObservations on floral anthesis and visitors were conducted in a population of A. ananassoides in the Brazilian savanna. Nectary samples were processed using standard methods for light and transmission electron microscopy. The main metabolites in nectary tissue were detected via histochemistry. Sugar composition was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The accumulated nectar was determined from bagged flowers ('unvisited'), and floral response to repeated nectar removal was evaluated in an experimental design simulating multiple visits by pollinators to the same flowers ('visited') over the course of anthesis. Key ResultsThe hummingbirds Hylocharis chrysura and Thalurania glaucopis were the most frequent pollinators. The interlocular septal nectary, composed of three lenticular canals, extends from the ovary base to the style base. It consists of a secretory epithelium and nectary parenchyma rich in starch grains, which are hydrolysed during nectar secretion. The median volume of nectar in recently opened 'unvisited' flowers was 27·0 ?L, with a mean (sucrose-dominated) sugar concentration of 30·5 . Anthesis lasts approx. 11 h, and nectar secretion begins before sunrise. In 'visited' flowers (experimentally emptied every hour) the nectar total production per flower was significantly higher than in the 'unvisited' flowers (control) in terms of volume (t = 4·94, P = 0·0001) and mass of sugar (t = 2·95, P = 0·007), and the concentration was significantly lower (t = 8·04, P = 0·0001). ConclusionsThe data suggest that the total production of floral nectar in A. ananassoides is linked to the pollinators activity and that the rapid renewal of nectar is related to the nectary morphological features. © The Author 2012.

Six different techniques are described in detail that have been used to recover pollen from a variety of insects including pests such as boll weevils, Mexican corn rootworms and corn earworm moths. These techniques can be use to recover pollen from internal insect tissues (gut, alimentary canal, crop, etc.), external tissues (proboscis, legs, eyes, etc.) or both.

A PRSV-resistant transgenic papaya 'Rainbow' containing the coat protein gene of PRSV was released commercially in Hawaii in 1998, and saved the papaya industry from further devastation. In the ensuing years since the release of the transgenic papaya, a number of farmers grew hermaphrodite nontransgenic 'Kapoho' papaya in close proximity to plantings of hermaphrodite transgenic 'Rainbow' papaya. These plantings provided a unique opportunity to assay for transgenic-pollen drift under commercial conditions. Between 2004 and 2010, assays for the GUS (beta-glucuronidase) transgene in embryos were done to study transgenic-pollen drift in commercial 'Kapoho' plantings and in replicated field plots. Very low pollen drift (0.8%) was detected in fruit of 'Kapoho' trees in the border row of one plantation when 90 embryos were assayed per fruit, while no pollen drift was detected in four other commercial plantings in which eight embryos were tested per fruit. Pollen drift averaged 1.3% of tested embryos in field plots where individual hermaphrodite 'Kapoho' trees were adjacent to two or four 'Rainbow' trees. In contrast, 67.4% of tested embryos were GUS positive in similarly located female 'Kapoho' trees. The very low transgene flow to close-by 'Kapoho' plantings is likely due to the fact that hermaphrodite trees are used commercially in Hawaii and that these trees are largely self-pollinated before the stigma is exposed to external pollen. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).",Coexistence; Hawaiian solo papaya; Pollination; Risk assessment; Transgene flow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862491298

We sampled a wide range of invertebrate taxa and feeding guilds at sites 3months, 1year and 3years after fire, and in unburned control sites at the same time. A range of invertebrate sampling techniques was used on Table Mountain, in the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot, an area prone to natural and human-induced fires. Sampling time differences strongly affected the composition of the whole assemblage, with fire having a major additional influence. Assemblages showed differential resilience to fire, especially in terms of species richness and abundance. One year after fire, the burned sites had the most compositional differences for the surface-active species compared to control sites, while after 3years, these sites were similar. Aerial assemblages were very different 3years after burning, especially the pollination guild. Furthermore, these 3-year-old burned sites had the most unique species, suggesting that burning and longer-term recovery is important for overall diversity. Some components of the invertebrate assemblage were remarkably resilient to fire (particularly ants), while others were far more conservative (pollinators). Nevertheless, fire allows new species to enter the ecosystem and can thus be used to promote local biodiversity if used appropriately. Ants alone should not be used to represent the whole invertebrate assemblage as they do not represent the more fire-prone groups. A cross-section of functional guilds is recommended in invertebrate recovery/fire management conservation programmes. These results have general significance in that a variety of feeding guilds need to be sampled when monitoring invertebrate responses to fire. © 2011 The Authors.

Pesticide regimes that threaten their sustainability should therefore be assessed. As an example, evidence that the agricultural use of neonicotinoid pesticides is a cause of the recently observed declines in honey bees is examined. The aim is to define exacting demographic conditions for a detrimental factor to precipitate a population decline, and Hill's epidemiological 'causality criteria' are employed as a structured process for making an expert judgement about the proposition that trace dietary neonicotinoids in nectar and pollen cause population declines in honey bees. Results: In spite of the absence of decisive experimental results, the analysis shows that, while the proposition is a substantially justified conjecture in the context of current knowledge, it is also substantially contraindicated by a wide variety of circumstantial epidemiological evidence. Conclusion:It is concluded that dietary neonicotinoids cannot be implicated in honey bee declines, but this position is provisional because important gaps remain in current knowledge.

Both domestic and wild bee populations in central Wisconsin pickling cucumber fields were assessed using a combination of pan trapping and floral observations before and during bloom. Together with land cover analyses extending 2,000 m from field centers, the relationship of land cover components and bee abundance and diversity were examined. Over a 2-yr sample interval distributed among 18 experimental sites, 3,185 wild bees were collected representing >60 species. A positive association was found between both noncrop and herbaceous areas with bee abundance and diversity only during bloom. Response of bee abundance and diversity to land cover was strongest at larger buffers presumably because of the heterogeneous nature of the landscape and connectivity between crop and noncrop areas. These results are consistent with previous research that has found a weak response of wild bees to surrounding vegetation in moderately fragmented areas. A diverse community of wild bees is present within the fields of a commercial cucumber system, and there is evidence of floral visitation by unmanaged bees. This evidence emphasizes the importance of wild pollinators in fragmented landscapes and the need for additional research to investigate the effectiveness of individual species in pollen deposition. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.",cucumber; pan trapping; wild bees; Wisconsin,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862516794

However, individuals who are exposed to environmental allergens are characterized by elevated values of FeNO. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) on the dynamics of FeNO determined during consecutive pollination seasons. Methods: This study, performed between 2005 and 2008, included 41 patients with confirmed sensitivity to grass pollens and predominating symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, randomly assigned to desensitization by preseasonal or maintenance SCIT. FeNO was measured prior to and during each pollen season (November- January and May-July, respectively). The results were conferred to data on grass pollination intensity in 2006-2008 (air concentration of grass pollen grains, seasonal number of days when air concentration of grass pollen reached at least ?50 grains per 1m 3). Results: Median content of FeNO in exhaled air was significantly higher in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2008 pollen seasons. During 2007 and 2008 pollen seasons, significant increase in FeNO was observed compared to the respective preseasonal values. Median number of days with air concentration of grass pollen ?50 grains per 1m 3 of air during 4 weeks preceding seasonal FeNO measurement was significantly higher in 2007, corresponding to higher FeNO value recorded during this pollen season. However, no significant correlation was observed between seasonal number of days with 50 grass pollen grains per 1m 3 of air and FeNO in exhaled air (r=0.09, p=0.362). Conclusions: Most seasonal allergic rhinitis patients show physiological levels of FeNO prior to the pollen seasons and a marked increase in this parameter, probably proportional to pollination intensity, is observed within the seasons. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",allergen-specific immunotherapy; nitric oxide; seasonal allergic rhinitis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862294411

We investigated relationships between population characteristics (i. e. size, density and pollinator abundance), offspring performance, genetic diversity and differentiation in Trolliuseuropaeus, a plant with a nursery pollination system. In 19 populations of different sizes and located in north-east Switzerland, an area which has undergone widespread land use changes over the last decades, we assessed neutral genetic diversity (N total = 383) using AFLPs and plant performance in a greenhouse experiment (N total = 584) using competition and control treatments. Overall genetic differentiation was low (F ST = 0. 033) with a marginal significant isolation by distance effect (P = 0. 06) indicating (historical) genetic connectivity among the populations. Mean expected heterozygosity was H E of 0. 309 (0. 0257-0. 393) while inbreeding coefficients (F IS) were significant in only three populations. Genetic diversity was not related to population size, plant density or pollinator abundance. Plant performance was reduced under competition (P &lt; 0. 001) but the severity of competition was independent of genetic diversity and population size. In summary, remnant populations of T. europaeus retain genetic diversity and seem capable of persisting under the present conditions within an agricultural matrix. T. europaeus is a perennial herb, thus it may require several generations for the negative effects of fragmentation and isolation to manifest. Our findings indicate that small populations are as important as large populations for the conservation and management of genetic resources. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Absolute severity of competition; AFLP; Genetic diversity and differentiation; Nursery pollination; Plant performance; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860487249

(1?3)-?-D-Glucan appears transiently during cellularization but reappears in patches in the subaleurone cell walls around 20 DAP. (1?3, 1?4)-?-Glucan, the most abundant polysaccharide of the mature barley grain, accumulates throughout development. Arabino-(1-4)-?-D-xylan is deposited significantly earlier than we previously reported. This was attributable to the initial deposition of the polysaccharide in a highly substituted form that was not recognized by antibodies commonly used to detect arabino-(1-4)-?-D-xylans in sections of plant material. The epitopes needed for antibody recognition were exposed by pretreatment of sections with ?-L-arabinofuranosidase; this procedure showed that arabino-(1-4)-?-D-xylans were deposited as early as 5 DAP and highlighted their changing structures during endosperm development. By 28 DAP labeling of hetero-(1?4)- ?-D-mannan is observed in the walls of the starchy endosperm but not in the aleurone walls.

There is, however, limited evidence for the applicability of Baker's Rule to invasive plants. We determined the breeding systems of three invasive milkweed species-Asclepias curassavica, Gomphocarpus fruticosus and G. physocarpus-in their invaded range in south-east Queensland, Australia. Although dependent on pollinators for reproduction, hand-pollinations revealed that all three species are self-compatible which is consistent with Baker's Rule and notable because milkweeds are generally self-incompatible. In progeny performance trials, seedlings from self-pollinations generally did not perform as well as those from cross-pollinations, but the differences were minor. Evidence for self-compatibility in G. physocarpus is a particularly noteworthy feature of this study, as this species has been reported to be self-incompatible in its native range and may thus have evolved self-compatibility during the invasion process. Furthermore, potential for hybridization between the two Gomphocarpus species was observed.

The elimination of maize chromosomes in the hybrid embryo is caused by uniparental genome loss during early steps of embryogenesis. Some of these haploid plants set seed in up to 50% of their self-pollinated spikelets. The high fertility was found to be mainly caused by formation of numerically unreduced female and male gametes (nunreduced = 3x + 0 ... 3 = 21 ... 24 chromosomes). Gamete formation involves meiotic nuclear restitution. The restitution process is caused by an alternative type of meiosis. It follows the model of levigatum-type semi-heterotypic divisions, but with a formation of the nuclear membrane at the transition from telophase I to interkinesis, which resembles the model of pygaera-type pseudo-homotypic divisions. We propose the name haploid meiotic restitution for this particular process combination. We discuss the use and implications of the specific process of gamete formation in F1 (oat × maize) plants. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Avena sativa L.; Haploid; Inter-species hybridization; Meiotic restitution; Unreduced gametes; Zea mays L,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861349373

The extent of variation in the chromosome number and rDNA loci was determined in the Potamogeton species on both the inter- and intra-specific level. Moreover, one of the hybrid sets (P. perfoliatus ? × P. wrightii ?) was picked for performing artificial pollination for producing F1 generation adults and for sequential morphological character analysis and FISH detection. After comparing the parental species and natural hybrids from three different geographic locations, the intraspecific variations of rDNA loci were revealed in sampled plants; in addition, comparisons between artificial F1 and natural hybrids (P. × intortusifolius) showed a rapid change of 45S rDNA loci in response to the interspecific hybridization. We also compared our results concerning rDNA patterns with phylogenetic documents to derive complementary clues to karoytype evolution and interspecific relationships. Based on frequent hybridizations and active clonal reproduction with weak genetic selection, the rDNA chromosomal repatterning, such as the gain or loss of rDNA loci together with rDNA movements, might be one trend of chromosome evolution in this genus. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Chromosome evolution; Interspecific hybridization; Karyotype evolution; Physical mapping of rDNAs; Potamogeton,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861708914

This study reports on the development of a laboratory miniature-dispenser-based bioassay. This bioassay system was used to investigate the compatibility of five model products, Prestop-Mix, Signum, kaolin, wheat flour and cellulose, with the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L. Results: The laboratory one-way miniature-dispenser bioassay showed that the fungicides and the carrier/diluent kaolin caused a worker mortality of > 70% after 5 weeks of exposure, while worker loss with wheat flour and cellulose was no higher than in the blank control (i.e. empty miniature dispenser) (<25%). The laboratory two-way miniature-dispenser bioassay comprised separated passageways and demonstrated that only kaolin was toxic (89 ± 11%). These results were also confirmed in a flight-cage experiment. In addition, a negative effect was observed against reproduction/colony development when nests were exposed to kaolin (P < 0.05) in the two-way miniature-dispenser and flight-cage bioassays. Conclusions: In the context of entomovectoring technology, the developed laboratory two-way miniature-dispenser bioassay gives a reliable prediction of the hazards associated with powder products. Additionally, the present data indicate the possibility of using cellulose and kaolin as respective negative and positive control carriers/diluents in future risk assessment experiments. Overall, the results show that, apart from kaolin, the tested fungicides and carriers/diluents are safe to be used with B. terrestris. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",Behaviour; Bombus terrestris; Cellulose; Entomovectoring; Kaolin; Laboratory assay; Lethal effects; Powder; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860886538

Gene diversity (d) and the average number of alleles (a r) per locus was estimated for DH lines based on 24 simple sequence repeat markers. Analysis across three environments revealed no significant differences between x? of OP- and SC-derived DH lines for TCGY and TCDMC. Significant genetic variance for both traits was only detected among OP-derived DH lines which may be explained by a larger number of segregating quantitative trait loci (QTL) as suggested by higher d and a r values than in SC-derived DH lines. The usefulness criterion (U = x? + ?G) was higher for OP-derived DH lines for TCDMC, but higher for SC-derived DH lines for TCGY. DH lines from OP1, OP2, and OP3 showed high TCGY, suggesting that they may be useful in tropical hybrid breeding.

Although a lot of studies concerning male euglossine bees have been done in this region, few works have so far been carried out in the Cerrado biome. This manuscript has the main objective to present the orchid bee community from a Gallery Forest in the Northeastern Brazilian Cerrado landscape, taking account the species composition, abundance, seasonality and hourly distribution. Male euglossine bees were collected monthly from October 2007 to May 2009, in the Reserva Florestal da Itamacaoca belonging to the Companhia de Água e Esgoto do Maranhão, in Chapadinha municipality, Maranhão State. The scents eucalyptol, eugenol and vanillin were utilized, between 07:00 and 17:00hr, to attract the euglossine males. Cotton balls were dampened with the scents and suspended by a string on tree branches 1.5m above soil level, set 8m from one another. The specimens were captured with entomological nets, killed with ethyl acetate and transported to the laboratory to be identified. A total of 158 individuals and 14 species of bees were recorded. The genus Eulaema was the most representative group of euglossine bees in relation to the total number of the sampled individuals, accounting for 50.6% of bees followed by Euglossa (26.6%), Eufriesea (15.2%) and Exaerete (7.6%). The most frequent species were Eulaema nigrita (27.8%), Eulaema cingulata (19%) and Euglossa cordata (18.3%). Many species typical of forested environments were found in samples, like Euglossa avicula, Euglossa violaceifrons and Eulaema meriana, emphasizing the role played by the Gallery Forests as bridge sites to connect the two great biomes of Amazonia and Atlantic Forest. The occurrence of Exaerete guaykuru represents the second record of this species for the Neotropical region, and both records coming from the Gallery Forest zones. The male euglossine bees were sampled mainly in the dry season, where 62.5% of the individuals were collected in that period. Eufriesea species appeared at the baits only in the wet season. The hourly frequency of bees at scent baits showed a clear preference for the morning period, where 87.9% visited the baits from 07:00 to 12:00hr. The euglossine bee fauna found in the Northeastern Maranhão Cerrado is represented chiefly by species of large geographic distribution and by some forest bee species, where their occurrence is maybe related to to the environmental conditions supported by the Gallery Forest ecosystem.",Cerrado; Diversity; Euglossini; Exaerete guaykuru; Scent bait,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866601416

From an agronomical point of view, this is a particularly key process because fertilization guarantees fruit formation in most cultivated fruit species. In the olive, however, in spite of its agricultural importance, little attention has been paid to the study of sexual reproduction. In order to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate pollen-pistil interactions in the olive during the progamic phase, it is essential to first have a good knowledge of the reproductive structures involved in such interactions. This study characterizes the anatomical and ultrastructural changes in the olive pistil, beginning from the young pistil developing within the bud until the time of petal loss and visible stigma senescence. We have correlated changes in the pistil with a series of defined floral developmental stages and determined that olive pistil structures cannot be considered completely mature and ready to be pollinated and fertilized until the onset of anthesis. Our results clearly show histological and ultrastructural variation during the diverse flowering events. We discuss whether the changes observed might influence or result from pollen-pistil interactions during the progamic phase. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Development; Histochemistry; Olea europaea; Pistil; Ultrastructure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861339359

Trials were conducted at three locations in 2007 and 2008, and at four locations in 2009. Twenty-seven single hybrids, four double-cross hybrids, and four open-pollinated varieties, were grown at three densities at each location each year. 56% of total yield gain was contributed to breeding from 1950 to 2000. New hybrids had more resistance to compound stress. Levels of response of all hybrids to higher-yielding environments were similar, and greater than that of OPVs. All maize cultivars showed morphological changes for all characteristics tested in a volatile manner from 1950 to 2000, except for relatively stable leaf number. ASI decreased and tolerance to root lodging improved, which were enhanced at higher plant densities. There were no trends for other characteristics at higher densities. Shorter maturity, smaller plant size and more tolerance to root and stalk lodging will be required for further yield improvement.

The jumonji C (jmjC) domain-containing proteins have been shown to reverse histone methylation in nonplant model systems. However, knowledge of the jmjC domain-containing histone demethylase that is involved in pollen development and fertilization in plants remains limited. In this study, BcJMJ30 (Brassica campestris Jumonji 30), encoding a putative jmjC domain-containing protein that is up-regulated after pollination of sterile pistils and fertile flower buds, has been cloned in the genic male sterile AB line (Bajh97-01A/B) of Chinese cabbage-pak-choi (B. campestris L. ssp. chinensis Makino). Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that the BcJMJ30 was closely related to At3g20810 (AtJMJ30) in Arabidopsis, which belongs to the JMJD5 subgroup of the jmjC domain-only group. Spatial and temporal expression patterns analysis by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR indicates that transcripts of BcJMJ30 was preferentially expressed in stamens of fertile flower buds and are steadily expressed in pistils following pollination. In situ hybridization results have revealed that BcJMJ30 is expressed in both pollen and tapetum.

A combination of foreground and background selection is used to tag donor alleles and to accelerate BC programmes. Similarly, doubled haploid (DH) lines are increasingly used in maize and various other crops to speed up breeding programmes. The DH technology cannot accelerate the BC procedure, but it is beneficial for the final step in BC programmes. For the fixation of target gene(s), smaller population sizes are required in case of DHs compared with progeny produced by self-pollination. The objectives of this study were to determine the usefulness of DH compared with BC nF 2 populations in the final step of BC programmes in relation to (i) the number of target genes and (ii) the genetic distance of a pair of target genes, linked in repulsion phase.

The objectives of this study were to (1) analyze means and genotypic variances for line per se performance (LP) and testcross performance (TP) of doubled haploid (DH) lines for GER severity and DON concentration as well as for some agronomic traits, (2) examine correlations among these traits, (3) validate QTL for resistance detected in previous studies for LP and their effect on TP and (4) investigate the relative efficiency of indirect selection (RE) for LP to improve TP. Testcross progenies of 94 DH lines originating from four flint populations were developed using a susceptible dent tester as pollinator. Artificial inoculations with F. graminearum led to appreciable disease development. Average TP for GER severity and DON concentration were lower than the mean mid-parent values of the tester and DH lines, indicating mid-parent heterosis for resistance. Genotypic variation for resistance was significant for LP and TP. Genotypic correlations between LP and TP were low and resistance QTL for LP had no significant effects on TP. Accordingly, RE for resistance was low, suggesting to allocate resources mostly to the evaluation of testcrosses. Correlations of resistance to GER and DON contamination with grain yield (measured under non-inoculated conditions) were not significant, indicating that selection for resistance and higher grain yield can be carried out simultaneously. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Deoxynivalenol; Fusarium graminearum; Gibberella ear rot; Grain yield; Line per se performance; Testcross performance; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861229753

We designed a spatial distribution with four varieties of genetically-modified (GM) yellow maize to generate different sized fields while maintaining a constant distance to neighbouring fields of conventional white kernel maize. Samples of cross-fertilized, yellow kernels in white cobs were collected from all of the adjacent fields at different distances. A special series of samples was collected at distances of 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 120 m following a transect traced in the dominant down-wind direction in order to identify the origin of the pollen through SSR analysis. The size of the receptor fields should be taken into account, especially when they extend in the same direction than the GM pollen flow is coming. From collected data, we then validated a function that takes into account the gene flow found in the field border and that is very useful for estimating the % of GM that can be found in any point of the field. It also serves to predict the total GM content of the field due to cross fertilization. Using SSR analysis to identify the origin of pollen showed that while changes in the size of the donor field clearly influence the percentage of GMO detected, this effect is moderate. This study demonstrates that doubling the donor field size resulted in an approximate increase of GM content in the receptor field of 7%. This indicates that variations in the size of the donor field have a smaller influence on GM content than variations in the size of the receptor field. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Gene flow; GMO; Maize; Pollen compatibility; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860886668

We investigated changes in bee species richness and community composition in the city centre and suburbs of Pozna?, Poland. During 2006-2008 we recorded 2,495 individuals from 104 species. The most abundant species was Andrena haemmorhoa. Other abundant species were Bombus pascuorum, Andrena vaga, Andrena nitida, Bombus terrestris. Several species appeared to be more abundant in the city centre whereas others showed an opposite tendency. We have found that the urbanized landscape can act as a filter for the bee community since some specific ecological traits facilitate colonization of the city centre. Small-bodied species that start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a city dwelling bee. We suggest that a city can be a very important habitat for a diverse bee fauna and that conservation of a wide range of habitats of different urbanization levels seems to be the most suitable strategy for conservation of bee diversity in cities. © 2011 The Author(s).",Apoidea; Bees; City; Hymenoptera; Pozna?; Urbanization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860991820

Our objective was to generate inducers with improved adaptation to tropical conditions. We developed segregating generations from crosses between temperate inducers having haploid induction rates (HIR) of 8-10 % and tropical CIMMYT maize lines (CML; HIR = 0 %) and evaluated these for HIR and agronomic performance under tropical lowland field conditions. The applied pedigree breeding scheme comprising mass selection on individual F 2 plants for highly heritable and visually scorable traits, followed by family-based selection for HIR and other agronomic characteristics in advanced selfing and backcross (BC) generations seems highly suitable for breeding improved haploid inducers with adaptation to different agroecologies. The most advanced tropical inducer candidates (TIC) combine HIR of up to 10 % with improved pollen production, disease resistance, and plant vigor compared to temperate inducers under tropical conditions. Agronomic characteristics were significantly improved in the BC to CML compared to BC to inducers, while mean HIR of both populations were similar, indicating that backcrossing to the adapted parent was suitable to improve adaptation of new inducers without sacrificing high HIR. When screening random open-pollinated maize accessions, HIR of up to 3 % were observed, suggesting that novel genetic variation may be present in maize accessions that could be exploited to improve HIR in maize. In conclusion, tropical inducer development proceeds well, but evaluation of TIC in multi-environment trials needs to be completed before large-scale dissemination can commence. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Doubled haploid; Haploid inducer; Haploid induction rate; Maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861229370

Although the upper Amazon region is the center of origin for cacao, 70% of the world's supply of cacao beans currently comes from small farms in West Africa. While cacao breeding programs in producer nations are the source of improved planting material, modern marker-based breeding is difficult to perform due to the lack of genotyping facilities in these countries. While DNA extraction can be routinely performed, the equipment needed to analyze simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is seldom available, forcing the outsourcing of genotyping to foreign laboratories and delaying the breeding process. We describe a 5? nuclease (TaqMan)-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay for genotyping cacao plants under conditions similar to those found in most cacao-producing areas. The assay was tested under field conditions by planting open pollinated seeds of seven pods from four different maternal plants. The resulting 171 seedlings were successfully genotyped with 18 SNP markers representing 12 loci. The ability to use temperature-stable reagents and rapid DNA extraction methods is also explored. Additionally, by examining the seedling genotypes for the SNP markers and 14 additional SSR markers, we investigated whether seeds in a pod are the result of single or multiple pollination events. This simple, effective method of genotyping cacao seedlings in the field should allow for more efficient resource management of seed gardens and is currently being implemented in Ghana. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Among the insecticides, the most used in the control of insect pragues has as active agent the pyriproxyfen, analogous to the juvenile hormone (JH). Unfortunately the insecticides used in agriculture affect not only the target insects but also beneficial nontarget ones as bees compromising therefore, the growth rate of their colonies at the boundaries of crop fields. Workers that forage for provisions in contaminated areas can introduce contaminated pollen or/and nectar inside the beehives. As analogous to JH the insecticide pyriproxyfen acts in the bee's larval growth and differentiation during pupation or metamorphosis timing. The flighty muscle is not present in the larvae wingless organisms, but differentiates during pupation/metamorphosis. This work aimed to investigate the effect of pyriproxyfen insecticide on differentiation of such musculature in workers of Brazilian africanized honey bees fed with artificial diet containing the pesticide. The results show that the bees fed with contaminated diet, independent of the insecticide concentration used, show a delay in flight muscle differentiation when compared to the control. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Bees; Histology; Juvenile hormone; Laboratory brood rearing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861349365

Box 6, 50250 Bet-Dagan, Israel","Trees require a long maturation period, known as juvenile phase, before they can reproduce, complicating their genetic improvement as compared to annual plants. 'Spadona', one of the most important European pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivars grown in Israel, has a very long juvenile period, up to 14 years, making breeding programs extremely slow. Progress in understanding the molecular basis of the transition to flowering has revealed genes that accelerate reproductive development when ectopically expressed in transgenic plants. A transgenic line of 'Spadona', named Early Flowering-Spadona (EF-Spa), was produced using a MdTFL1 RNAi cassette targeting the native pear genes PcTFL1-1 and PcTFL1-2. The transgenic line had three T-DNA insertions, one assigned to chromosome 2 and two to chromosome 14 PcTFL1-1 and PcTFL1-2 were completely silenced, and EF-Spa displayed an early flowering phenotype: flowers developed already in tissue culture and on most rooted plants 1-8 months after transfer to the greenhouse. EF-Spa developed solitary flowers from apical or lateral buds, reducing vegetative growth vigor. Pollination of EF-Spa trees generated normal-shaped fruits with viable F1 seeds. The greenhouse-grown transgenic F1 seedlings formed shoots and produced flowers 1-33 months after germination. Sequence analyses, of the non-transgenic F1 seedlings, demonstrated that this approach can be used to recover seedlings that have no trace of the T-DNA. Thus, the early flowering transgenic line EF-Spa obtained by PcTFL1 silencing provides an interesting tool to accelerate pear breeding. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Genetic transformation; Juvenility; MdTFL1; Plant breeding; Precocious flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861592215

As their ranges expanded when climates warmed, genetic drift and inbreeding in relatively small peripheral populations are expected to have reduced genetic diversity and the segregating genetic load. Therefore, inbreeding depression in peripheral populations might be lower than in centrally located sites. We evaluated the consequences of inbreeding for fitness traits in six central and six northern peripheral populations of the herb Campanulastrum americanum. Inbreeding reduced performance for all traits. Inbreeding depression in peripheral populations was lower than in central populations. This difference increased across the life cycle from similar levels for germination, to central populations having three times the inbreeding depression for adult traits. Geographical patterns of inbreeding depression suggest that mating system variation and potential future mating system evolution in many temperate taxa might reflect, at least in part, nonequilibrium conditions associated with historic range changes. © 2012 The Authors.

For effective use, information about environment, and genotype × environment effects on cross-fertilization by ga1 as well as heritability of cross incompatibility in maize is necessary. Our objective was to obtain this information. Four population pairs differing in their genotype at ga1 were evaluated for cross incompatibility with ga1 pollen in different environments. Populations were derived by crossing the recurrent parents B116, PHG35, ARZM16035:S19, and (CHZM05015:Mo17)Mo17 to Ga1-s donor parent Mo508W/Mo506W. Two replicates of each treatment were grown in the center of 952 m 2 fields planted with purple corn as an adventitious source of ga1/ga1 pollen. Open pollination was allowed and the amount of cross-fertilization estimated by averaging the percentage of purple seeds. Environment and genotype × environment effects were not significant. Contrasts to evaluate differences in cross-fertilization between Ga1-s and ga1 populations revealed that mean percentages of cross-fertilization in Ga1-s populations of B116, ARZM16035:S19, and (CHZM05015:Mo17)Mo17 were significantly lower than in ga1 populations. The estimated broad-sense heritability on an entry-mean basis for cross incompatibility was 0. 81. Results suggest differences in genotype at ga1 played a major role in cross-fertilization of populations differing in their genotype at the ga1 locus. Incompatibility may be selected effectively over different environments and the Ga1-s system may be of value to reduce cross-fertilization with GM corn pollen. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cross incompatibility; Gametophyte factor; Genotype × environment; Heritability; Maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861233226

Given the evolution of these extremes of size and development, we sought to understand whether post-pollination processes still varied predictably with breeding system in Trithuria. To address this question, we studied two Western Australian species, Trithuria austinensis (dioecious, obligately outcrossing) and Trithuriasubmersa (bisexual, highly selfing). To document developmental timing, carpels were hand-pollinated, collected at sequential time points, and examined with light and fluorescence microscopy. In both species, pollen tubes first entered ovules <1 h after pollination, but the pollen tube pathway of outcrossing T. austinensis was almost four times longer and its pollen tube growth rates were up to six times faster (?2,166 vs. 321 ?m/h) than those of T. submersa. T. austinensis also exhibited greater male investment, slower pollen germination, and greater pollen tube attrition. These differences in male gametophyte development are predicted for outcrossers versus selfers in phylogenetically derived angiosperms. These new data for Hydatellaceae reinforce the idea that an acceleration of pollen tube development occurred in the Nymphaeales stem lineage, before the origin of Hydatellaceae. We infer that a recent evolutionary transition to selfing in T. submersa has been accompanied by predictable modifications to reproductive development, which, because of the ancient relationship between Hydatellaceae and all other angiosperms, suggests that traits underlying the lability of flowering plant post-pollination biology were present early in their history. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Dioecy; Hydatellaceae; Pollen tube growth rate; Progamic phase; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862777280

Its sequence was confirmed and elongated by screening a sunflower genomic DNA BAC Library. HaL1L, whose cDNA had already been sequenced and characterized, encodes a NF-YB subunit of a CCAAT box-binding factor (NF-Y) involved in the early stages of zygotic and somatic embryogenesis in the Helianthus genus. In the HaL1L 5?-flanking region, elements specific to a putative TATA-box promoter and two ""CG isles"" were identified. An investigation of the methylation status of these CG rich DNA regions showed that differentially methylated cytosines were recognizable in the DNA of embryos on the fifth day after pollination in comparison to leaf DNA suggesting that during plant development epigenetic regulation of HaL1L transcription was achieved by methylating cytosine residues. We also searched the HaL1L nucleotide sequence for cis-regulatory elements able to interact with other transcription factors (TFs) involved in the HaL1L regulation. Of the elements identified, one of the most intriguing is WUSATA, the target sequence for the WUSCHEL (WUS) TF, which may be part of a complex regulation network controlling embryo development. In this article, we show that the WUSATA target site, located in the intron of HaL1L, is able to bind the TF WUS. Interestingly, we found auxin and abscisic acid responsive motifs in the HaL1L promoter region suggesting that this gene may additionally by under hormonal control. Finally, the presence of a cytoplasmic polyadenylation signal downstream to the coding region indicates that this gene may also be controlled at the translation level by a temporarily making the pre-synthe-sized HaL1L mRNA unavailable for protein synthesis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",CCAAT binding factor; EMSA; Gene expression; Helianthus annuus L; Methylation; Promoter region; Transcription factors,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864282802

Among these, two were composite varieties Early Composite (Check) and Bajaura Makka (L 201) and rest six were locally grown traditional open pollinated maize varieties collected from diverse regions of North-west Himalaya. The data were recorded for three haploid induction parameters viz. pseudo seed formation, embryo formation and regeneration. In most of the crosses, haploid embryos were produced, asserting the potential of wheat × maize system as a genotype non-specific system as compared to androgenesis and bulbosum technique, where the genotype specificity limits the development of haploid plants. Frequencies of all the three haploid induction parameters in different crosses of wheat × maize clearly indicated that both wheat and maize genotypes were behaving differently for different crosses. The line × tester analysis also revealed significant influence of crosses, wheat, maize and their interaction on all the three haploid induction parameters. The results obtained suggest association of both additive and dominance gene action with all the haploid induction parameters. Over all proportional contribution of tester for embryo formation and regeneration parameters was found to be more, followed by line × tester interaction. On the basis of haploid formation efficiency (HFE) as well as general combining ability (GCA), Bajaura Makka has emerged to be the best general combiner among maize genotypes and also superior to the earlier identified variety, Early Composite. Also, HPW 155 × VL 852 and HPW 155 × HPW 211 were the top general combiners among wheat genotypes.

The duration between initial protrusion of the pistil and full opening, for individual flowers, ranged from 4 to 8 days. This variability was due to weather conditions during bloom, genotype, and flower position on the tree. Filament growth occurred generally before the flower opened, whereas pistil growth was not complete until the 'popcorn' stage of flowering. Interestingly, flowers with protruding pistil had similar fruit set potential to normal flowers. Controlled environment studies revealed a negative relationship between air temperature and the incidence of protruding pistils. This is likely due to growth of petals and pedicels being more sensitive to cold temperature than pistil growth. Low temperature reduced petal size but not stylar length.

Establishing the relationship between the temperature at which these processes become detrimental and regulatory behaviour is critical in resolving the mechanisms by which insects cope with physiologically stressful environments. Here, we compare levels of metabolic rate and EWL measured by flow-through respirometry with field activity in the ichneumonid wasp Lissopimpla excelsa. Metabolic rate increased to a maximum of 10.8±0.4mLCO 2.g -1.h -1 at 35°C before decreasing to 8.4±0.4mLCO 2.g -1.h -1 at T a = 40°C. EWL showed an exponential pattern of increase, with a significant increase in EWL from T a = 12°C to T a = 35 and 40°C. Male wasps were active in the field from T a = 20.1 to 36.8°C (peak activity T a = 26.5°C and relative humidity = 44.4%), though activity levels were most strongly correlated with time of day. Being active in the mornings may be advantageous in that temperatures are warm enough to maintain activity but avoid excess energy expenditure and EWL. Furthermore, food or calling females may be most abundant during this period. Based on a consensus allometric scaling relationship derived for insect resting metabolic rates, the metabolic rate of L. excelsa at T a = 25°C was higher than predicted, as was EWL. Since the present study is the first describing the metabolic physiology of an ichneumonid wasp, it remains unclear whether this pattern is characteristic of ichneumonids in general of L. excelsa in particular. © 2012 The Zoological Society of London.",Activity; Evaporative water loss; Ichneumonid; Lissopimpla excelsa; Metabolic rate; Pollination; Temperature tolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861454199

In plants, silent transposons are also marked by cytosine methylation, especially at non-CpG sites. Transposon-specific non-CpG methylation in plants is controlled by small RNAs and H3K9me. Although it is often assumed that small RNA directs H3K9me, interaction between small RNA and H3K9me has not been directly demonstrated in plants. We have previously shown that a mutation in the chromatin remodeling gene DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1) induces a global decrease but a local increase of cytosine methylation and accumulation of small RNA at a locus called BONSAI. Here we show that de novo BONSAI methylation does not depend on RNAi but does depend on H3K9me.

BER is believed to result from calcium (Ca) deficiency, but the relationship between Ca content and BER incidence is not strong. Our objectives were to better understand how GAs and a GA biosynthesis inhibitor affect BER development in tomato fruit. Tomato plants of two BER-susceptible cultivars, 'Ace 55 (Vf)' and 'AB2,' were grown in a greenhouse environment and subjected to Ca-deficiency conditions. Plants were treated weekly during fruit growth and development with 300 mg L -1 GA 4+7, 300 mg L -1 prohexadione-calcium (Apogee ®, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor), or water beginning 1 day after flower pollination. GA 4+7 treatment induced an increase in BER incidence in both cultivars up to 100%, whereas 'Ace 55 (Vf)' and 'AB2' plants treated with Apogee did not show BER incidence. The number of functional xylem vessels was higher in the placental and pericarp tissue of tomato fruit treated with Apogee at the early stages of fruit growth. Treatment with Apogee also increased fruit pericarp Ca concentration. GA 4+7 treatment enhanced the expression of the putative CAX and Ca-ATPase genes, that code for proteins involved in Ca movement into storage organelles. The lowest water-soluble apoplastic Ca concentration and the highest membrane leakage values were observed in the pericarp of GA 4+7-treated fruit. These results suggest that GAs consistently reduced fruit Ca uptake and water-soluble apoplastic Ca concentration, leading to leakier plasma membranes and an increase in BER development in fruit tissue of both tomato cultivars. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Apoplast; BER; Blossom-end rot; Ca; Membrane; Solanum lycopersicum L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860376851

Changes in population structure over time were analysed using F-statistic estimators. Although heterogeneity was evident between loci, the analysis showed significant differentiation among months within a year for all polymorphic loci. Fixation indexes were all positive and statistically different from zero, highlighting a significant departure from random mating. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA), the pattern of inbreeding (f) showed significant changes over time (season); among the polymorphic loci, Enp most strongly contributed to this significance.

These allele frequency deviations over time can be attributed to changes in pollinator behaviour, and frequent genetic bottlenecks that are associated with changes in environmental conditions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Allele frequencies; genetic structure; natural population; temporal variation; Vigna unguiculata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863455177

Host plant resistance is a method of LGB control which should be prioritized in order to reduce these losses. The objective of this study was to assess maize resistance to the larger grain borer and recognize some potential causes of resistance. One hundred and sixty-three (163) genotypes were tested; these included 85 hybrids, 2 checks, 6 open pollinate varieties, and 70 landraces, among them gene bank accessions. Grain biochemical content, (protein, oil and starch) and insect resistance parameters, (percentage grain damage, weight loss, flour weight, and number of emerged insects) were measured. There were significant differences (P < 0. 001) among the genotypes for all the traits measured except number of insects. The most resistant hybrids were CKPH08024, CKPH08009, CKPH08012, CKPH08014, CKP08033, CKPH08026, CKPH08014, and CKPH08003. The most resistant landrace accessions were BRAZ 2451, GUAT 1162, BRAZ 2100, and GUAN 36. The percentage weight loss was found to be the most important resistance trait for discriminating among genotypes for it had the largest canonical coefficient. Protein content had higher contribution to variation in resistance to the larger grain borer and this probably contributed to the grain hardness which is a putative trait of resistance to storage pests. The LGB-resistant germplasm could be used for the development of an integrated pest-management program against the LGB. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Biochemical traits; Insect resistance; Post-harvest pests; Prostephanus truncatus; Protein content,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860726709

Box 1000, Johnston, IA 50131-0184, United States","The maize (Zea mays) shrunken-2 (Sh2) gene encodes the large subunit of the rate-limiting starch biosynthetic enzyme, ADP- glucose pyrophosphorylase. Expression of a transgenic form of the enzyme with enhanced heat stability and reduced phosphate inhibition increased maize yield up to 64%. The extent of the yield increase is dependent on temperatures during the first 4 d post pollination, and yield is increased if average daily high temperatures exceed 33°C. As found in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa), this transgene increases maize yield by increasing seed number. This result was surprising, since an entire series of historic observations at the whole-plant, enzyme, gene, and physiological levels pointed to Sh2 playing an important role only in the endosperm. Here, we present several lines of evidence that lead to the conclusion that the Sh2 transgene functions in maternal tissue to increase seed number and, in turn, yield. Furthermore, the transgene does not increase ovary number; rather, it increases the probability that a seed will develop. Surprisingly, the number of fully developed seeds is only ?50% of the number of ovaries in wild-type maize. This suggests that increasing the frequency of seed development is a feasible agricultural target, especially under conditions of elevated temperatures. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

Characterization of C-and D-class MADS-box genes could help reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying gynostemium and ovule development in orchids. In this study, we isolated and characterized a C-and a D-class gene, PeMADS1 and PeMADS7, respectively, from Phalaenopsis equestris. These two genes showed parallel spatial and temporal expression profiles, which suggests their cooperation in gynostemium and ovule development. Furthermore, only PeMADS1 was ectopically expressed in the petals of the gylp (gynostemium-like petal) mutant, whose petals were transformed into gynostemium-like structures. Proteinprotein interaction analyses revealed that neither PeMADS1 and PeMADS7 could form a homodimer or a heterodimer. An E-class protein was needed to bridge the interaction between these two proteins. A complementation test revealed that PeMADS1 could rescue the phenotype of the AG mutant. Overexpression of PeMADS7 in Arabidopsis caused typical phenotypes of the D-class gene family. Together, these results indicated that both C-class PeMADS1 and D-class PeMADS7 play important roles in orchid gynostemium and ovule development. © 2012 The Author.",C-cl ss MADS-box gene; D-class MADS-box gene; Gynostemium; Orchid; Ovule; Phalaenopsis equestris,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862189456

In this study, 258 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between a dent corn and a popcorn inbred were evaluated for grain fresh and dry weight at 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after pollination (DAP) and the activities of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPP), granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), and soluble starch synthase (SSS) at 30 DAP. Grain-filling rate (GFR) and increasing rate of fresh weight (FWIR) were calculated during all periods. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was conducted for all traits. Meta-QTL (mQTL) was revealed by meta-analysis using BioMercator. Totally, 161 QTL were detected for six traits. QTL on chromosomes 1, 7, and 10 were detected in most cases, with 43, 54, and 28 QTL, respectively. For each trait, 1-4 QTL were detected but no QTL for GBSS. Three mQTL at bins 7. 02-7. 03, 1. 03-1. 04, and 10. 05-10. 06 included 47, 24, and 23 QTL detected in this study. Together with 28 QTL for grain weight detected in our previous research, they included 53, 28, and 25 QTL, respectively. Five identified expressed sequence tags (EST), five candidate genes with related functions, and QTL for grain weight in other research were co-located in these regions. It is worth concentrating further research on these regions to develop near-isogenic lines (NILs) of common QTL and their chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL). Also, cloning and function validation for co-located EST and candidate genes could facilitate identification of genes for grain development and final weight. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Co-location; Common QTL; Grain weight; Grain-filling rate; Meta-QTL analysis; Starch synthesis enzyme,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861741797

In order to determine the attractiveness of flowers to Tachinidae, 12 species of cultivated, introduced/established and native potted plants-in-flower were individually placed beneath interception traps erected along the wooded margins of fields planted seasonally with either feed-corn or rye. Simultaneous controls consisted of traps associated with the same species of plant without flowers, a pot without plants or both. In two additional instances where flowering-plants grew in situ it was necessary to compare initial trap captures to those following the removal of the plants. Of the 14 plant species tested five captured more Tachinidae at the family level than controls (Agastache hybrid, Ageratina aromatica (L.), Aloysia virgata (Lopez & Pavon), Daucus carota L. and Stelleria media (L.)). At the tachinid subfamily and genera/species levels traps associated with Buddleia davidii Franch., Galium aparine L., Agastache hybrid, A. aromatica, A. virgata and D. carota caught significantly more flies than controls. Over all taxonomic levels, half (7) of the plant species-in-flower were associated with trap-catches greater than those associated with plants out-of-flower and/or without plants. There was no relationship between the ratios of flies captured in flowering plant-baited traps relative to those captured in controls and flower widths, flower depths, flower densities, numbers of flowers or floral areas (flower area * number of flowers). However particular plants were identified that might be incorporated into regional conservation biological control programs. © 2012.",Biological control; Coleoptera; Conservation; Floral morphology; Lepidoptera; Parasitoid; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860348699

We also investigated the coancestry and effective population size of progeny arrays for conservation and environmental restoration purposes. Open-pollinated seeds were collected from 15 seed trees within the forest fragment, in which all adult trees were mapped, measured and genotyped. Twenty seeds were also collected from the nearest neighbor tree located 1. 2 km from the forest fragment. Our results show that levels of genetic diversity were significantly higher in adults than offspring and significant levels of inbreeding were detected in offspring (F = 0. 226). From paternity analysis, we observed low levels of selfing (s = 8%) and pollen immigration (m = 8%) in the fragment, but very high levels were detected for the isolated tree (s = 20%; m = 75%), indicating that the population and the tree are not reproductively isolated and are connected by patterns of long distance pollen dispersal (maximum detected 1,420 m). Within the forest fragment, the pattern of pollen dispersal was a near neighbor pattern with 49% of the pollen being dispersed within 50 m. The effective population size of the progeny array was low, indicating the need to collect seeds from a large number of seed trees (at least 76) for conservation purposes. The results show that the spatial isolation of the population and isolated tree due to forest fragmentation has not disrupted genetic connectivity; however, spatial isolation does seem to increase selfing and correlated mating. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Gene flow; Mating system; Microsatellite loci; Pollen dispersal; Tropical trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860479732

Recent research has indicated complex ecological and evolutionary interactions involving cacti and other organisms.Aims: We reviewed four studies involving cacti that have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of life traits and maintenance of cactus diversity. Also, these studies illustrate how the modern theoretical background of the ecology and evolution of species interactions is influencing the research in Cactaceae.Methods: The studies showed here are (1) the evolutionary ecology of a mistletoe-cactus parasitism in central Chile, (2) the effect of an exotic grass on the demography of a threatened cactus in Puerto Rico, (3) the herpetochory in a tropical genus of cacti in Venezuela, and (4) the role of abiotic and biotic factors on the floral morphology in globose cacti species in northern Chile.Results: The parasitic interaction between the mistletoe and a columnar cactus highlights the importance of spine length as a defensive co-evolving trait. Reproductive success in the endemic cactus in Puerto Rico was depressed by the presence of the exotic grass. Lizards actively fed on fruits of a tropical group of cacti, increasing the germination percentages of seeds. Climatic gradients might induce morphological change in the flowers of Mediterranean cactus species.Conclusions: Interactions involving cacti reflect a complex scenario of ecological and evolutionary processes which may account for several patterns of the diversity of Cactaceae. In this sense, to enhance the on-going research, we emphasise the necessity of the development of a cactus interaction database; the assessment of detrimental effects of invasive species on cactus diversity; and the quantification of multi-species interactions. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.",American continent; Caribbean; climatic drivers; grass invasion; parasitism; pollination; seed dispersal; succulent,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870584951

The interlocking of the palea and lemma is critical for maintaining fertility and seed yield in rice; however, the molecules that control the interlocking structure remain largely unknown. Here, we showed that when OsCR4 mRNA expression was knocked down in rice by RNA interference, the palea and lemma separated at later spikelet stages and gradually turned brown after heading, resulting in the severe interruption of pistil pollination and damage to the development of embryo and endosperm, with defects in aleurone. The irregular architecture of the palea and lemma was caused by tumour-like cell growth in the outer epidermis and wart-like cell masses in the inner epidermis. These abnormal cells showed discontinuous cuticles and uneven cell walls, leading to organ self-fusion that distorted the interlocking structures. Additionally, the faster leakage of chlorophyll, reduced silica content and elevated accumulation of anthocyanin in the palea and lemma indicated a lesion in the protective barrier, which also impaired seed quality. OsCR4 is an active receptor-like kinase associated with the membrane fraction. An analysis of promoter::GUS reporter plants showed that OsCR4 is specifically expressed in the epidermal cells of paleas and lemmas. Together, these results suggest that OsCR4 plays an essential role in maintaining the interlocking of the palea and lemma by promoting epidermal cell differentiation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",epidermal cell; fertility; interlock; OsCR4; palea and lemma; rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862231339

In the last two decades, it has become clear that to further understand multitrophic interactions, the barrier between the belowground and aboveground domains has to be crossed. Belowground organisms that are intimately associated with the roots of terrestrial plants can influence the levels of primary and secondary chemistry and biomass of aboveground plant parts. These changes, in turn, influence the growth, development, and survival of aboveground insect herbivores. The discovery that soil organisms, which are usually out of sight and out of mind, can affect plant-herbivore interactions aboveground raised the question if and how higher trophic level organisms, such as carnivores, could be influenced. At present, the study of above-belowground interactions is evolving from interactions between organisms directly associated with the plant roots and shoots (e. g., root feeders - plant - foliar herbivores) to interactions involving members of higher trophic levels (e. g., parasitoids), as well as non-herbivorous organisms (e. g., decomposers, symbiotic plant mutualists, and pollinators). This multitrophic approach linking above- and belowground food webs aims at addressing interactions between plants, herbivores, and carnivores in a more realistic community setting. The ultimate goal is to understand the ecology and evolution of species in communities and, ultimately how community interactions contribute to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we summarize studies on the effects of root feeders on aboveground insect herbivores and parasitoids and discuss if there are common trends. We discuss the mechanisms that have been reported to mediate these effects, from changes in concentrations of plant nutritional quality and secondary chemistry to defense signaling. Finally, we discuss how the traditional framework of fixed paired combinations of root- and shoot-related organisms feeding on a common plant can be transformed into a more dynamic and realistic framework that incorporates community variation in species, densities, space and time, in order to gain further insight in this exciting and rapidly developing field. © 2012 The Author(s).",Above-belowground interactions; Multitrophic interactions; Parasitoids; Plant defense; Plant-insect interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862328308

Currently available models mainly focus on provisioning services and do not distinguish changes in the functioning of the ecosystem (Ecosystem Functions-ESFs) and human use of such functions (Ecosystem Services-ESSs). This limits the insight on the impact of global change on human well-being. We present a set of models for assessing ESFs and ESSs. We mapped a diverse set of provisioning, regulating and cultural services, focusing on services that depend on the landscape structure. Services were mapped using global-scale data sets. We evaluated the models for a sample area comprising Eastern Europe. ESFs are mainly available in natural areas, while hotspots of ESS supply are found in areas with heterogeneous land cover. Here, natural land cover where ESFs are available is mixed with areas where the ESSs are utilized. We conclude that spatial patterns of several ESFs and ESSs can be mapped at global scale using existing global-scale data sets. As land-cover change has different impacts on different aspects of the interaction between humans and the environment, it is essential to clearly distinguish between ESFs and ESSs in integrated assessment studies. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",air quality; carbon sequestration; crop yield; global scale; natural hazard protection; pollination; tourism; wild food,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863651580

Consequently, coloured pan trapping is an efficient technique that can be easily and cost-effectively used to quantitatively sample assemblages of anthophiles. However, colour preferences of anthophiles is an important source of bias that needs to be considered in pan trap surveys. By drawing sub samples comprised of different colour combinations from a database of pan trap surveys in the lowlands of the Cape Floristic Region, we examine the effects of colour on pan trap catches and determine which combinations of colours might provide better estimates of diversity when sampling with multi-colour sets of pan traps. Pan trap catches included the major groups of anthophiles in the region (Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera), but butterflies (Lepidoptera) were strongly under-represented. Colour played an important role in determining the species richness and composition of pan trap catches, with colour sets that included high reflectance yellow and white generally having catches with the highest species richness. While all colour combinations provided reasonable estimates of proportional species richness, proportional abundance of taxa varied among different colour sets, and did not accurately reflect actual proportions of different taxa in the entire dataset. For comparative biodiversity surveys and assessments we recommend the use of high reflectance colours such as white and yellow traps, while for full inventory surveys, it may be necessary to include other colours to catch rarer species that are excluded by the high reflectance colours alone. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Colour preference; Insect diversity; Insect pollinators; Invertebrate surveys; Trap bias,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860990114

Over 50% of immature ZEs from immature seed collected at 30 days after pollination produced direct somatic embryos (SEs) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0-0.44 ?M 6-benzyladenine (BA) in combination with 5.73 ?M naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) or with 0.91-2.26 ?M 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) alone. Fourteen to 23 SEs per explant were regenerated on MS medium supplemented with BA 0.44 ?M in combination with NAA 5.73 ?M. SE formation decreased when sucrose concentrations were higher than 40 g L -1. Repetitive embryogenesis occurred following culture on solid MS medium containing 12 ?M abscisic acid, 75 g L -1 polyethylene glycol, and 20 g L -1 sucrose at 25 ± 1°C under a 16-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 40 ?mol m -2 s -1. Over 40% of the mature SEs germinated on solid MS medium under light condition described previously. Up to 40% of the regenerated plantlets were successfully acclimatized under greenhouse conditions. Plantlets derived from SEs grew vigorously with similar morphology as those germinated from ZEs. Histological studies of explants at various developmental stages of somatic embryogenesis revealed that SEs passed through globular, heart, torpedo, and mature stages. Similar to ZE suspensors, similar structures of SE degenerated in later stages of embryo development.

Intensive arable plant communities have previously been shown to contain higher proportions of self-pollinated plants compared to natural or semi-natural plant communities. Though intensive grasslands are widespread, it is not known whether they show similar patterns to arable systems nor whether local and/or landscape factors are influential. We investigated plant community composition in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms across Ireland in relation to the local and landscape context. Relationships between plant groups and local factors (farming system, position in field and soil parameters) and landscape factors (e.g. landscape complexity) were investigated. The percentage cover of unimproved grassland was used as an inverse predictor of landscape complexity, as it was negatively correlated with habitat-type diversity. Intensive grasslands (organic and conventional) contained more insect-pollinated forbs than non-insect pollinated forbs. Organic field centres contained more insect-pollinated forbs than conventional field centres. Insect-pollinated forb richness in field edges (but not field centres) increased with increasing landscape complexity (% unimproved grassland) within 1, 3, 4 and 5<bold> </bold>km radii around sites, whereas non-insect pollinated forb richness was unrelated to landscape complexity. Pollination systems within intensive grassland communities may be different from those in arable systems. Our results indicate that organic management increases plant richness in field centres, but that landscape complexity exerts strong influences in both organic and conventional field edges. Insect-pollinated forb richness, unlike that for non-insect pollinated forbs, showed positive relationships to landscape complexity reflecting what has been documented for bees and other pollinators. The insect-pollinated forbs, their pollinators and landscape context are clearly linked. This needs to be taken into account when managing and conserving insect-pollinated plant and pollinator communities. © 2012 Power et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861650376

This study investigated the effects of increasing intensity of urban land use on pollinator diversity, flower visitation rates and reproductive success in Digitalis purpurea. To this end, we set up experimental populations of D. purpurea in three urban-rural gradients and contrasted these against two large, natural populations. In the experimental populations we quantified the number of flower visits per 20. min and applied supplemental hand-pollinations to determine the impact of pollen limitation on fruit-level seed set. We found no impact of urbanization intensity on pollinator diversity at all locations studied, and also the number of flower visits did not differ significantly between urban and rural populations. Reproductive success appeared, however, pollen limited in all sites, even in the large and optimal reference populations. This led us to conclude that the pollen limitation was caused by a bet-hedging strategy of the species rather than by insufficient pollination. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Digitalis purpurea; Experimental populations; Pollen limitation; Reproductive success; Urban-rural gradient; Urbanization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860350565

However, the responses of fig wasps to volatiles released from figs during their developmental phases are less clearly understood and are the focus of this study. We extracted and identified the volatiles released from the figs of Ficus curtipes throughout their development. Using Y-tube choice experiments, we also compared the behavioural responses of the tree's pollinator (Eupristina sp.) to figs at different developmental stages, and compared these results to those obtained by trapping fig wasps as they arrived at a tree with a developing fig crop. The chemical composition of the fig volatiles changed during fig development with the blends exhibiting clear segregation among figs at different developmental phases. Male phase figs had the most distinct blend. Fig wasp females were preferentially attracted to receptive figs, but figs at most other developmental phases were also attractive. Conversely, male phase figs had a repellent effect. These results were supported by the behaviour of the wasps under natural conditions, with small numbers of fig wasps arriving at the tree before and after receptive figs were present. These results indicate a more complex relationship between fig volatiles and fig wasp behaviour than previously realized, with volatiles mediating both the initial meeting of the mutualists to achieve pollination and egg laying and the subsequent departure of the next generation of fig wasps. This offers an explanation for the specialization and long-term coexistence of figs and fig wasps. © 2012 Springer Basel AG.",Agaonidae; Behavioural response; Chemical communication; Ficus; Mutualism; Obligate pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869093865

Between October and November 2010, we examined the variation of pollinator's entomofauna of E. nitens. Environmental factors, such as temperature and the number of open flowers per plant, were registered to determine the level of dependence on the frequency of visits. The most abundant insects visiting E. nitens belonged to the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. However, the proportion of individuals in each group of flower visitors varied considerably among the sampling months: Hymenoptera (203), Coleoptera (21) in October and Coleoptera (280), Hymenoptera (57) in November. For Hymenoptera, environmental temperature was significant compared to frequency of visitors; whereas for Coleoptera, the number of open flowers per plant has been significant for insect activity. Results show that the visit frequency of pollinators in E. nitens is highly variable within the sampling period and temperature and density of open flowers per plant can produce variations within the group of pollinators.",Abundance; Coleoptera; Diptera; Hymenoptera; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861399282

Species with life stages in both terrestrial and aquatic systems may be particularly likely to link the effects of trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries. Using experimental wetlands planted with purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), we tested the degree to which the bottom-up effects of floral density of this invasive plant could trigger a chain of interactions, changing the behavior of terrestrial flying insect prey and predators and ultimately cascading through top-down interactions to alter lower trophic levels in the aquatic community. The results of our experiment support the linkage of terrestrial and aquatic food webs through this hypothesized pathway, with high loosestrife floral density treatments attracting high levels of visiting insect pollinators and predatory adult dragonflies. High floral densities were also associated with increased adult dragonfly oviposition and subsequently high larval dragonfly abundance in the aquatic community. Finally, high-flower treatments were coupled with changes in zooplankton species richness and shifts in the composition of zooplankton communities. Through changes in animal behavior and trophic interactions in terrestrial and aquatic systems, this work illustrates the broad and potentially cryptic effects of invasive species, and provides additional compelling motivation for ecologists to conduct investigations that cross traditional ecosystem boundaries. © 2012 The Author(s).",Bottom-up; Consumer-resource; Purple loosestrife; Top-down; Trophic interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869080092

However, self-pollination is common in pollinating animal-scarce habitats. In such habitats, self-pollinations require the assistance of a pollinating agent (e.g., wind, gravity, or floral assembly) to transport the pollen grains from the anther onto its own stigma. Methodology/Principal Findings: Based on observations on floral morphology and flowering phenology, tests of the breeding system, and a comparison of pollination mechanisms, a new self-pollination process was discovered in the hermaphroditic (i.e., possessing spatially separated male and female organs) flower of a slipper orchid, Paphiopedilum parishii. The anther changes from a solid to a liquid state and directly steps onto the stigma surface without the aid of any pollinating agent or floral assembly. Conclusions: The mode of self-pollination discussed here is a new addition to the broad range of genetic and morphological mechanisms that have evolved in flowering plants to ensure their reproductive success. The present self-contained pollination mechanism is a possible adaptation to the insect-scarce habitat of the orchid. © 2012 Chen et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861354525

The value of directly dependent crops attributed to all insect pollination (2009 USD) decreased from $14.29 billion in 1996, the first year for value data in this study, to $10.69 billion in 2001, but increased thereafter, reaching $15.12 billion by 2009. The values attributed to honey bees and non-Apis pollinators followed similar patterns, reaching $11.68 billion and $3.44 billion, respectively, by 2009. The cultivated area of crops grown from seeds resulting from insect pollination (indirectly dependent crops: legume hays, carrots, onions, etc.) was stable from 1992 through 1999, but has since declined. Production of those crops also declined, albeit not as rapidly as the decline in cultivated area; this asymmetry was due to increases in aggregate yield. The value of indirectly dependent crops attributed to insect pollination declined from $15.45 billion in 1996 to $12.00 billion in 2004, but has since trended upward. The value of indirectly dependent crops attributed to honey bees and non-Apis pollinators, exclusive of alfalfa leafcutter bees, has declined since 1996 to $5.39 billion and $1.15 billion, respectively in 2009. The value of alfalfa hay attributed to alfalfa leafcutter bees ranged between $4.99 and $7.04 billion. Trend analysis demonstrates that US producers have a continued and significant need for insect pollinators and that a diminution in managed or wild pollinator populations could seriously threaten the continued production of insect pollinated crops and crops grown from seeds resulting from insect pollination. © 2012 Nicholas W.

Morphology and function of different parts of Coronilla emerus L. flowers were related to their role in the pollination mechanism. The corolla has a vexillum with red nectar lines, a keel hiding stamens and pistil, and two wing petals fasten to the keel with two notched folds. Pollinators land on the complex of keel and wings, trigger the protrusion of pollen and finally of the stigma from the keel tip. Data on pollen viability and stigma receptivity prove that flowers are proterandrous. The results of hand-pollination experiments confirmed that insects are fundamental to set seed. Interaction with pollinators allows not only the transport of pollen but also the rupture of the stigmatic cuticle, necessary to achieve both allogamy and autogamy. Field observations showed that Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera visited the flowers. Only some of the Hymenoptera landed on the flowers from the front and elicited pollination mechanisms. Most of the insects sucked the nectar from the back without any pollen transfer. Finally, morphological and functional characteristics of C. emerus flowers are discussed in terms of floral larceny and reduction in pollination efficiency. © 2012 Giovanna Aronne et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861021476

The pollen migration was studied on naturally isolated source trees. The pollen trapping was done in all directions up to 2.5km. The average reproductive period in P. roxburghii was 36 days with 3-5 days protandry. There were significant year and population effects for male and female cone output and pollen grains production per tree.

We examined bumblebee behaviour and pollen transfer between two hybridizing Rhinanthus species that are very similar in ecology and floral traits. The two species, Rhinanthus minor and R. angustifolius, shared similar pollinator guilds and assemblages, but pollinator recruitment and flower visitation rates were higher in R. angustifolius sites, probably because of its higher reward levels and better visibility. When presented with Rhinanthus flowers, bumblebees that previously foraged on R. angustifolius were less prone to visit R. minor inflorescences, while R. minor foragers accepted both species in similar proportions. Although Rhinanthus has been cited as a case of mechanical isolation resulting from interactions between bee behaviour and differences in stigma and anther placement, we found no support for efficient mechanical reproductive isolation. Bumblebees that foraged on R. minor flowers carried more pollen, but pollen placement on their bodies was similar to that of bees that visited R. angustifolius, and cross-specific stigmatic pollen deposition was similar in both directions. However, the asymmetry in pollinator handling time between the two species, due to dissimilar pollen rewards, may have lowered relative heterospecific pollen receipt on R. angustifolius, suggesting that net gene flow resulting from pollen transfer dynamics is more likely towards R. minor, although this effect remains weak and will be most likely counterbalanced by context-based labile pollinator preference. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus; Hybridization; Mechanical isolation; Orobanchaceae; Pollinator assemblage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867563423

However, most of such methods have failed. Somatic embryogenesis is an alternative system that includes the simultaneous production of both an organized root and a shoot axis. Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a key role in zygotic embryo development at each stage, in both a stimulatory and an inhibitory manner. Thus the influences of the development stages of immature zygotic embryo on somatic embryogenesis was studied. ABA concentration of immature zygotic embryos was also detected. Immature embryos were microscopically visible at 8-9 weeks postpollination with pale yellow liquid endosperm. Cotyledons expanded rapidly at 10-12 weeks postpollination. The immature embryos were actively growing and cotyledons were fully elongated at weeks 14 weeks post-pollination. Cotyledons were filled with of kernel, and endosperm was utilized at 15-16 weeks post-pollination. The concentration of ABA ranged from 29.1 to 166.8ngg-1 FW within the development of zygotic embryos. The ABA content levels at 8-9 weeks and 16 weeks postpollination were significantly lower and higher, respectively, than ABA contents at all otherdevelopmental stages. For callus induction, the frequency gradually increased with the development of the zygotic embryos from 8 to 10 weeks post-pollination followed by a decrease from 10 weeks to 16 weeks post-pollination. The highest frequency (66.67%) of embryogenic callus formation was obtained at the stage of 10 weeks post-pollination, with low levels obtained before or after this period. For direct somatic embryogenesis, frequency increased with the development of zygotic embryos from 8 to 11 weeks post-pollination followed by a decrease from 11 to 16 weeks post-pollination. The highest frequency of somatic embryogenesis was 46.67%, obtained with explants collected 11 weeks postpollination. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",ABA; Callus; Hickory (Carya cathayensis Sarg.); Somatic embryogenesis; Zygotic embryos,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860490585

We observed insect visitation to H. scoparium over two flowering seasons and estimated pollen limitation using fruit set and seed production. Our results indicate that fruit set and seed production increased significantly with pollen supplementation compared with open pollination.

Bee visitation varied significantly among the patches of habitats, but not associated with patch size of habitat. In general, pollen limitation occurred more strongly during fruit set than during seed production. The patches that received higher rates of pollinator visits were less pollen limited for fruit set.

An unusual inheritance pattern was detected during examination of male fertility restoration in the CMS-inducing '9E' type cytoplasm of sorghum: Rf-genes were functional in self-pollinated progeny of F1 hybrids yet were either not expressed or poorly expressed in backcrosses of these hybrids to CMS-lines with the same cytoplasm type. In experiments on parallel growing of the same F1 hybrid combinations in the 'dry plot' and in the 'irrigated plot,' it was found that high level of plant water availability during panicle and pollen developmental stages significantly increased male fertility of F1 and test-cross hybrid populations, in which fertility-restoring genes were in heterozygote state, whereas in F2 populations the influences of water availability conditions cause less pronounce effects. Similarly, male-sterile F1 plants, being transferred from the 'dry plot' to greenhouse, produced male-fertile panicles. In addition, male-sterile plants from F2 families, which segregated-out as recessives, being transferred to greenhouse also produced male-fertile panicles. In the progenies of these revertants that were grown in field conditions and in the 'dry plot,' stable inheritance of male fertility for three cycles of self-pollination was observed, and a number of stable fertile lines in the '9E' cytoplasm were obtained. However, in test-crosses of these fertile lines to CMS-lines with the '9E' cytoplasm restoration of male fertility was not observed, except the progeny of one revertant that behaved as fertility-restorer line. These data suggest that the functional state of fertility-restoring genes for the '9E' sorghum cytoplasm is epigenetically regulated trait established by the influence of environmental factors and is transmitted to sexual generations. © 2012 Elkonin and Tsvetova.",Cytoplasmic male sterility; Drought; Epigenetic inheritance; Sorghum bicolor (L.)

In order to understand how its impacts extend to the pollination service at the community level, we studied the AHB and its interactions in a multi-species context using network theory. We analyzed six pollination networks from the Brazilian Caatinga, a xeric biome where beekeeping is increasing very quickly. The AHB occupied a central position in all networks, as it was responsible for a large share of the interactions observed (14 ± 7 %) and bound together different modules. By simulating the removal of the AHB from each network, we observed no effects on connectance, but a strong decrease in nestedness (-23 ± 19 %) and an increase in modularity (8 ± 5 %). The robustness of networks to cumulative random extinctions was on average not affected. In summary, our evidence points out that the AHB induces significant changes in the structure of native pollination networks, mainly by making them more cohesive and monopolizing many interactions. Although the AHB did not affect network robustness, its net impact on the pollination service may be negative, because this invasive species is very generalistic and may not be an efficient pollinator for some native plants. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Apis mellifera; Centrality; Complex networks; Ecosystem services; Modularity; Nestedness; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867402537

Two of the most intriguing aspects of orchid pollination that promote cross-pollination are pollinarium reconfiguration (PR) and deceptive pollination. PR and generalized food deception employ virtually antagonistic methods of promoting cross-pollination: PR occurs through delayed pollination, involving the relatively long visitation periods that are typically observed for the pollinators of one flower or inflorescence; conversely, generalized food deception leads to reductions in the visitation periods of pollinators to one flower or inflorescence. Thus, it is logical to hypothesize that PR is unnecessary or PR happens soon in generalized food-deceptive orchids in the promotion of cross-pollination. Using Doritis pulcherrima as a model, the aim of this study was to understand the following: (1) the pollination and breeding system of D. pulcherrima; (2) the morphological interactions between orchids and their pollinators; and (3) whether PR is necessary in the promotion of cross-pollination in D. pulcherrima. Results: Our observations indicated that Doritis pulcherrima is pollinated almost exclusively by Amegilla nigritar (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and possesses pollinia that are deposited on the ""occiputs"" (cervical membranes) of these insects. All of evidences are indicated that D. pulcherrima is a generalized food-deceptive orchid. Our morphometric measurements of the flowers and pollinators show that the heights of the ""occiputs"" with un-oriented pollinaria were equal to the distances between stigmas and surfaces of the middle lobes, suggesting that pollinarium reconfiguration is not necessary in Doritis pulcherrima. Conclusions: Our observation and analyses supported the hypothesis that pollinarium reconfiguration is unnecessary in generalized food-deceptive orchids, such as Doritis pulcherrima, for the promotion of cross-pollination. This conclusion was indirectly supported by the abundance of deceptive orchids that do not exhibit pollinarium reconfiguration. There are two mechanisms (i.e. clone-growing characteristics and a long flowering season) that promote fruit sets in the epiphytic food-deceptive orchids in tropical regions. © 2012 Xiaohua et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Aeridinae; Doritis pulcherrima; Floral deception; Orchidaceae; Pollinarium reconfiguration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860878354

We studied the highland hummingbird assemblage of Cerro de La Muerte, Costa Rica, both at a site with permanent feeders (La Georgina Restaurant) and further from it. We examined how feeder use and monopolization affected seasonal changes in pollen loads during four sampling periods, including dry and wet seasons, from 2003-2005. We expected that species monopolizing the feeders would carry little or no pollen whatsoever, and would have pollen loads characterized by low floral diversity, in contrast with species less dependent on feeders. We obtained pollen samples from 183 individuals of four hummingbird species captured around the feeders using mist nets, which were compared with a pollen reference collection of plants with a pollination syndrome by hummingbirds. The same methods were implemented at a site 3km away from the feeders. Feeder usage was quantified by counting the number of times hummingbirds drank from the feeders in periods of 4min separated by Imin. The effects of hummingbird species and season on pollen load categories were assessed using a nominal logistic regression. The alpha species at the site, the Fiery-throated Hummingbird {Panterpe insignis), dominated the feeders during the dry season. Meanwhile, in the wet season, feeder usage was more evenly distributed across species, with the exception of the Volcano Hummingbird, Selasphorusjlammula, which occupies the last place in the dominance hierarchy. Pollen loads of hummingbirds captured near feeders were low in abundance (more than 50% of captured individuals had zero or low pollen loads), and low in species richness (96% of the hummingbirds with pollen from only one plant genus, Centropogon). Overall pollen loads increased during the dry season coinciding with peaks in flower availability, although the majority of captured hummingbirds carried no pollen. Mist nets located 3km from La Georgina returned few captures (one-to-three specimens) per sampling date, contrasting with observations made before feeders were present. These results suggest that sugar-water feeders gather hummingbirds in over considerable distances drawing them away from flowers. The competitive and antagonistic pattern shown between feeders and flowers indicate that natural pollination system could be significantly altered. Supplementing hummingbirds with food seems likely to interfere with pollination networks already stressed by many anthropogenic effects.",Artificial feeders; Cerro de la Muerte; Colibrí thalassinus; Eugenes fulgens; Foraging ecology; Panterpe insignis; Pollen loads; Selasphorus flammula,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860598695

Floral traits are likely important since they are usually considered as evolutionary adaptations to pollinators, and thus to play a key role in the reproductive success of plants. In the subnival belt of the Hengduan Mountains (a globally important biodiversity hotspot with extreme environmental conditions in southwest China) plants show diverse floral morphologies. However, information on the flower diversity of this unique alpine ecosystem is scarce, especially at the regional scale. Therefore, using published information, herbarium collections and field observations, we have studied the sexual system and floral morphology of plants in the subnival belt of the Hengduan Mountains. Of the 823 species recorded in the region, 88. 5 % are hermaphroditic (a particularly high proportion compared to floras of other regions). The flower morphology patterns indicate that showy flowers (attracting pollinators) and generalized floral traits (suited to a wide range of pollinators) are common in our study region.

We show that the pollinating wasps Elisabethiella stuckenbergi and Elisabethiella socotrensis form a species complex of five lineages in East and Southern Africa. Up to two morphologically distinct lineages were found to co-occur locally in the southern African region.Wasps belonging to a single lineage were frequently the main regional pollinators of several Ficus species. In South Africa, two sister lineages, E. stuckenbergi and E. socotrensis, pollinate Ficus natalensis but only E. stuckenbergi also regularly pollinates Ficus burkei. The two wasp species co-occur in individual trees of F. natalensis throughout KwaZulu-Natal. Floral volatile blends emitted by F. natalensis in KwaZulu-Natal were similar to those emitted by F. burkei and different from those produced by other African Ficus species. The fig odour similarity suggests evolutionary convergence to attract particular wasp species. The observed pattern may result from selection for pollinator sharing among Ficus species. Such a process, with one wasp species regionally pollinating several hosts, but several wasp species pollinating a given Ficus species across its geographical range could play an important role in the evolutionary dynamics of the Ficus-pollinating wasp association. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Coexistence; Host switch; Mutualism; Specificity; Volatile compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858774087

The centrality of a given node captures its importance within the network. We hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight individualbased networks originated from the interaction between Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks, each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree. The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate for the interacting phenotype of individuals. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Centrality; Individual generalization; Individual-based networks; Interacting phenotype; Plant fitness; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858757258

Furthermore, following recent sequencing of its genome and the availability of expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries, it is a valuable model plant for studying carbon assimilation in endosperms of oilseed plants. There have been several transcriptomic analyses of developing physic nut seeds using ESTs, but they have provided limited information on the accumulation of stored resources in the seeds. Methodology/Principal Findings: We applied next-generation Illumina sequencing technology to analyze global gene expression profiles of developing physic nut seeds 14, 19, 25, 29, 35, 41, and 45 days after pollination (DAP). The acquired profiles reveal the key genes, and their expression timeframes, involved in major metabolic processes including: carbon flow, starch metabolism, and synthesis of storage lipids and proteins in the developing seeds. The main period of storage reserves synthesis in the seeds appears to be 29-41 DAP, and the fatty acid composition of the developing seeds is consistent with relative expression levels of different isoforms of acyl-ACP thioesterase and fatty acid desaturase genes. Several transcription factor genes whose expression coincides with storage reserve deposition correspond to those known to regulate the process in Arabidopsis. Conclusions/Significance: The results will facilitate searches for genes that influence de novo lipid synthesis, accumulation and their regulatory networks in developing physic nut seeds, and other oil seeds. Thus, they will be helpful in attempts to modify these plants for efficient biofuel production. © 2012 Jiang et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860505122

In apple breeding programmes, GS can be used to obtain genomic breeding values (GEBV) for choosing next-generation parents or selections for further testing as potential commercial cultivars at a very early stage. Thus GS has the potential to accelerate breeding efficiency significantly because of decreased generation interval or increased selection intensity. We evaluated the accuracy of GS in a population of 1120 seedlings generated from a factorial mating design of four females and two male parents. All seedlings were genotyped using an Illumina Infinium chip comprising 8,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and were phenotyped for various fruit quality traits. Random-regression best liner unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP) and the Bayesian LASSO method were used to obtain GEBV, and compared using a cross-validation approach for their accuracy to predict unobserved BLUP-BV. Accuracies were very similar for both methods, varying from 0.70 to 0.90 for various fruit quality traits. The selection response per unit time using GS compared with the traditional BLUP-based selection were very high (&gt;100%) especially for low-heritability traits. Genome-wide average estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between adjacent SNPs was 0.32, with a relatively slow decay of LD in the long range (r2 = 0.33 and 0.19 at 100 kb and 1,000 kb respectively), contributing to the higher accuracy of GS. Distribution of estimated SNP effects revealed involvement of large effect genes with likely pleiotropic effects.

(Verbenaceae) is a shrub of Neotropical origin that has spread to at least 60 countries (Day et al. 2003), and its ability to rapidly occupy disturbed habitat has led to it being named one of the ten worst weeds on the planet (Cronk & Fuller 1995, Sharma et al. 2005). A number of traits may have contributed to its success as an invasive species. For example, L. camara increases the available soil nitrogen in otherwise nitrogen-poor ecosystems (Sharma & Raghubanshi 2009), it is extremely resilient to disturbance (Gentle & Guggin 1997a, Hiremath & Sundram 2005), it is allelopathic to native plants (Achhireddy & Singh 1984, Gentle & Duggin 1997b) and its fruits are dispersed by a variety of birds (Mandon-Dalger et al. 2004, Swarbrick et al. 1998).

Apis mellifera in several locations, and it has been proposed that diverse native bee communities may be key for continued pollination of economically important crops. However, there is some inconsistency in the literature as to how these communities should best be managed. To address this issue, we collected bees from an intensively managed agricultural region in eastern Australia using blue vane traps. Both linear remnants of vegetation, which form part of a larger corridor network, and adjacent fields of native and exotic pastures, wheat, canola, and lucerne were sampled. A total of 3249 individual bees, representing four families and 36 species were collected. Highly modified environments of nectar-bearing crop supported the most species-rich bee assemblages, and the highest abundance of individual bee species. Distance from the remnants did not limit the body size of species occupying fields (up to 400. m). However, richness of bee assemblages also responded positively to the presence of conservation land in nearby areas, or the number of remnant native trees surrounding traps. Linear remnants of native vegetation contributed to assemblage heterogeneity by adding unique species to the regional pool. Our findings indicate that agricultural industries that currently rely on pollination by . A. mellifera should ensure that intensive land use is complemented by untilled areas in the form of conservation land, or farm dams and scattered trees in fields, to support wild pollinators that may act as insurance against further future losses of managed hives. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Corridor; Ecosystem services; Pollination; Roadside; Scattered trees; Stock route; Wild bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859791364

Using a combination of observations and experiments we compared the effectiveness of introduced honeybees with that of hummingbirds, native bees and moths on both the male and female components of fitness of the Andean shrub Duranta mandonii (Verbenaceae). Our results demonstrated significant variation among flower visitors in rates of visitation, pollen removal ability and contribution to fruit set. This variation was not always correlated; that is, taxa that regularly visited flowers did not remove the most pollen or contribute to fruit set. Despite the taxonomic diversity of visitors, the main natural pollinators of this shrub are large native bees, such as Bombus spp. Introduced honeybees were found to be as effective as native bees at pollinating this species. Duranta mandonii has high apparent generalization, but low realized generalization and can be considered to be a moderate ecological generalist (a number of species of large bees provide pollination services), but a functional specialist (most pollinators belong to a single functional group).

Flowers are well-replicated habitat islands, among which the microbes disperse via pollinators. This metapopulation system allows for investigation of microbial distribution at multiple spatial scales. We examined the distribution of the yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii, and other fungal species found in the floral nectar of the sticky monkey flower, Mimulus aurantiacus, a hummingbird-pollinated shrub, at a California site. We found that the frequency of nectar-inhabiting microfungi on a given host plant was not significantly correlated with light availability, nectar volume, or the percent cover of M. aurantiacus around the plant, but was significantly correlated with the location of the host plant and loosely correlated with the density of flowers on the plant.

We compared visit rates of two pollinator species, hoverflies and honeybees, to 40 Chrysanthemum segetum patches in which we manipulated predation risk (patches with and without crab spiders) and nectar availability (rich and poor patches) using a full factorial design. Pollinators responded differently to the tradeoff between maximising intake rate and minimising predation risk: honeybees preferred rich safe patches and avoided poor risky patches while the number of hoverflies was highest at poor risky patches. Because honeybees were more susceptible to predation than hoverflies, our results suggest that, in the presence of competition for resources, less susceptible pollinators concentrate their foraging effort on riskier resources, where competition is less severe. Crab spiders had a negative effect on the rate at which inflorescences were visited by honeybees. This effect was mediated through changes in the foraging strategy of honeybees, and could, in principle, be reversed by increasing nectar productivity of inflorescences. Our study shows that both pollinator species responded simultaneously and differently to variations in food reward and predation risk, and highlights the importance of studying the foraging strategies of pollinators in order to fully understand how plant-pollinator interactions are established. © 2011 The Authors.

According to the Vorobyev-Osorio color vision model, these differences in color reflection are likely to allow visual discrimination by herbivores. Goats preferred feeding on clipped inflorescences over control inflorescences. Locusts preferred leaves over flags. To test whether this was due to deterrence from the flags' coloration, we also offered them choice between leaves and a rare, white morph, of the flags. The locusts chose both equally immediately after presentation, but leaves attracted more individuals after 5 min of feeding. The locusts also preferred green cabbage over anthocyanin-rich red cabbage. These results support the function of colorful extra-floral displays as warning signals. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Anthocyanin; Flag display; Goat; Locust; Salvia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859611874

Here, we examine the contribution of plant-pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the geographic range consistently across four years of study. This decline in pollinator availability was caused to a greater extent by variation in the abundance of generalist rather than specialist bee pollinators. Climate data suggest that patterns of precipitation in the current and previous year drove variation in bee abundance because of its effects on cues for bee emergence in the current year and the abundance of floral resources in the previous year. Experimental floral manipulations showed that marginal populations had greater outcross pollen limitation of reproduction, in parallel with the decline in pollinator abundance. Although plants are self-compatible, we found no evidence that autonomous selfing contributes to reproduction, and thus no evidence that it alleviates outcross pollen limitation in marginal populations. Furthermore, we found no association between the distance to the range edge and selfing rate, as estimated from sequence and microsatellite variation, indicating that the mating system has not evolved in response to the pollination environment at the range periphery. Overall, our results suggest that dependence on pollinators for reproduction may be an important constraint limiting range expansion in this system. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Adaptation; California endemic plant; Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana; Climate; Evolutionary constraint; Mating system; Mutualsim; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Reproductive assurance; Self-fertilization; Species border and distribution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859441266

In this study we investigated the hypothesis that brightly coloured and fruity-scented flowerheads of four Protea species (P. caffra, P. simplex, P. dracomontana and P. welwitschii) represent a novel shift from bird to insect pollination in a grassland lineage in the genus. These species are visited by a wide range of insects, but cetoniine beetles were found to be the most important pollinators because of their abundance, size and relatively pure pollen loads. Three of the four putatively insect-pollinated Protea species have flowers presented at ground level, and experiments showed that cetoniine beetles preferred inflorescences at ground level to those artificially elevated to the height of shrubs and small trees. Relative to insects, birds were infrequent visitors to all of the study species. The nectar of all the study species contained xylose, as documented previously in bird- and rodent-pollinated Protea species, suggesting that this is a phylogenetically conserved trait. However, the very low concentration of nectar (ca. 8%), short nectarstigma distance and the fruity scent of florets appear to be traits that are associated with specialisation for pollination by cetoniine beetles. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Atrichelaphinis tigrina; Cetoniinae; Nectar; Specialized pollination systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860163167

Examples are given of species pollinated by beetles (cantharophily), which is the predominant mode of the majority of species worldwide, by small or large beetles (both groups having either diurnal or nocturnal flowers with or without thermogenesis), species pollinated by thrips (Thysanoptera), flies (myiophily and sapromyiophily), cockroaches and even bees (melittophily). Adaptational features of floral structures are compared with the behaviour of flower visitors, emphasizing floral rhythm, flower size, petal thickness, stamen structure and odour production. Anaxagorea, the earliest divergent surviving genus in Annonaceae, exhibits floral characters thought to be basal for the family: tissue-rich thick petals that form a pollination chamber; several Anaxagorea spp. exhibit thermogenesis, emit a fruit-like odour and attract small beetles as pollinators. As cantharophily is plesiomorphic in Anaxagorea and in Annonaceae, characters associated with beetle pollination appear imprinted in members of the whole family.

As in the wasp-flower Epipactis helleborine, we found so-called 'green leaf volatiles' (GLVs) in the floral odour; these GLVs are highly attractive to the wasps. GLVs, mostly six-carbon aldehydes, alcohols and acetates, and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are emitted by many plants infested with herbivores, e.g. caterpillars.

In the absence of natural pollinators for a variety of reasons, farmers in Maoxian County of southwestern China employ ""human pollinators"" to pollinate apple and other fruit crops to secure yields. In 2001, we conducted a study to gain an understanding of the process and significance of hand pollination of apples, which revealed that 100 of the apples in Maoxian were hand pollinated. Because it was a unique approach developed by these Chinese farmers the authors were curious to revisit the site in 2011 to assess the sustainability of human pollination and see whether farmers had invented better alternatives. The findings suggest that, recently, Maoxian farmers have been working toward phasing out apples and replacing them with plums, walnuts, and loquats along with vegetables. These new fruit and vegetable crops are economically and ecologically more appropriate to them, because they do not require pollination by humans and also fetch a better price. However, hand pollination by human pollinators is still practiced with apples to a lesser degree, which indicates that all these farmers have yet to find satisfactory alternatives to this economically unsustainable practice. © 2012 by the Authors.",apple; China; human pollinators; Maoxian; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862529840

We evaluated the role of self, wind and insect pollination to . Coffea canephora production in this landscape. The giant Asian honeybee, . Apis dorsata, which nests in remnant forests, was the main pollinator of coffee (accounting for 58% of the floral visitors). The proportion of flowers that developed into fruits was highest when hand cross-pollinated (44%), followed by open- (insect and wind combined; 33%) and wind- (22.1%) pollination treatments.

Self-pollination (1.7%) and no pollination (1%) treatments produced very low fruit set, emphasizing the importance of cross-pollination in . C. canephora. Unlike measures of pollination success, initial fruit set (five weeks after flowering) proved an unreliable proxy for final fruit set. Size of adjoining forest fragments (mostly 0.3-20. ha, with a few exceeding 200. ha) positively influenced pollinator visitation to coffee flowers, but distance to such fragments had no influence on pollination.

Despite considerable variation in acorn production from year to year, analyses confirmed this prediction and indicated that there was significant overall stabilizing selection on budburst date consistent with the pollen limitation hypothesis.

Factors that influence these effects include the degree of shared pollinator species, synchronous flowering phenology, similar flower morphology and color, relatedness of invasive and natives, and showiness and densities of flowers. We investigated such plant-pollinator dynamics by comparing the invasive Lespedeza cuneata and three native congeners, all sympatric with synchronous flowering, using in situ populations over 2 years during peak floral displays. Insect visitation rates of the invasive were significantly higher per plant in both years than on the native species. The invasive exerted a competitive effect on visitation of the two native species with fewer shared pollinators, and a facilitative effect on visitation of the native species with the highest degree of shared insect visitors. Positive correlations were found between floral density and visitation rate per plant in all the native species. Although no such correlation was found for the invasive, floral density in L. cuneata was at least twenty times higher than in the native species and likely saturated the response of the pollinator community.

Information is summarized on the pollination biology of individual clades and the evolutionary adaptations favouring different pollinator guilds evaluated. Although the majority of species of Annonaceae are pollinated by small beetles, five other pollinator groups are known: large beetles, thrips, flies, bees and cockroaches. Small-beetle pollination is inferred as the ancestral pollination system, with all other systems being derived. Evolutionary shifts to pollination by large beetles, thrips and flies are unlikely to have been significantly constrained by previous adaptations favouring pollination by small beetles, as many of the adaptations to these different pollinator guilds are similar (including protogyny, partially enclosed floral chambers and olfactory cues). In contrast, however, the evolutionary shift to bee pollination has presumably been constrained by both protogyny (as pollen-collecting bees are unlikely to visit pistillate-phase flowers) and the presence of floral chambers. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Cantharophily; Pollination ecology; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859899945

The spatial separation of sex organs, herkogamy, is believed to limit sexual interference in hermaphrodite flowers. Reverse herkogamy (stigma recessed below anthers) and long, narrow corolla tubes are expected to promote efficiency in male function under hawkmoth pollination. We tested this prediction by measuring selection in six experimental arrays of Polemonium brandegeei, a species that displays continuous variation in herkogamy, resulting in a range of recessed to exserted stigmas. Under glasshouse conditions, we measured pollen removal and deposition, and estimated selection gradients (?) through female fitness (seeds set) and male fitness (siring success based on six polymorphic microsatellite loci). Siring success was higher in plants with more nectar sugar and narrow corolla tubes. However, selection through female function for reverse herkogamy was considerably stronger than was selection through male function. Hawkmoths were initially attracted to larger flowers, but overall preferred plants with reverse herkogamy. Greater pollen deposition and seed set also occurred in reverse herkogamous plants. Thus, reverse herkogamy may be maintained by hawkmoths through female rather than male function.

The transition is associated with the modification of several floral traits, including flower color and size, relative size and orientation of the petals, and nectar composition and quantity. Here, we examine petal surface micromorphology in relation to pollination type, using SEM and LM. In the bee-pollinated Lotus (the majority of the genus), papillose conical cells (PCS) are the most abundant epidermal type on dorsal and lateral petals. However, bird-pollinated species completely lack PCS on their dorsal petals and have only a small patch of PCS in a highly localized region of the lateral petal. In the bee-pollinated species (including those most closely related to the bird-pollinated species), PCS develop early in floral development. In contrast, the small amount of residual PCS in bird-pollinated species forms later in development, after the other two major epidermal types have been formed. The almost complete elimination of PCS during the shift of pollination syndrome from bee to birds may be adaptively driven as a both probird and antibee trait. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",Ornithophily; Papillose conical cells; Petal identity; Pollination shift; SEM,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859981844

Plants that depend on animals for pollination vary in the longevity of their flowers and also in how the quality of the rewards they offer varies in flowers of different ages. However, costs of floral longevity are rarely studied. Using field experiments with Ficus semicordata, a SE Asian dioecious fig tree, we examined sexual differences in syconium ageing, how the reproductive success of the plant and its pollinator change with syconium age and whether these changes are reflected in pollinator preferences. Un-pollinated syconia remained receptive to their host-specific pollinators for long periods, but eventually abort. Compared with male syconia, un-pollinated female syconia aborted more quickly and lost their ability to attract pollinators more quickly. Older pollinated female syconia were also more likely to abort. Further, declines in productivity with syconium age were also more apparent in female syconia, though older male syconia also produced fewer, smaller wasp offspring. The longevity costs are reflected in pollinator preferences. This suggests that sexual differences in duration of receptivity may be adaptive and a component of the reproductive strategies. It also indicates that placing fig wasps onto older syconia over-estimates their likelihood of being pollinated under natural conditions and prolonged receptivity increases the likelihood of pollination at the cost of reduced productivity with syconium age. This opens interesting perspectives on the co-evolution of this inter-specific interaction. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ageing; Ficus; Fig wasp; Mutualism; Pollination; Receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859564522

In one of the possible evolutionary pathways, pollinators may disrupt intermorph pollen flow, and, as a consequence, floral morphs may gradually specialize as either male or female (functional dioecy). Natural patterns of pollen deposition and fruit and seed production were estimated in Palicourea demissa (Rubiaceae) and used as parameters to assess functional gender differences between floral morphs. Pollen flow was asymmetrical in P. demissa. Long-styled flowers were more effective than short-styled flowers in pollen deposition towards compatible stigmas, whereas short-styled flowers were more effective in legitimate pollen receipt. Accordingly, short-styled plants produced more fruits and viable seeds than long-styled plants. The contributions of male and female function to the potential functional gender were equivalent in both morphs. However, the realized functional gender deviated significantly from the potential functional gender in both morphs, in which short-styled plants were more successful through their female function, but long-styled plants through their male function. If pollinators disrupt the complementarities of pollen transfer between the two morphs (asymmetric pollen flow), the expression of a more profitable gender is expected in each morph. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that dioecy may evolve in distylous populations through the gradual specialization of each morph as either male or female. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Asymmetric pollen flow; Distyly; Functional dioecy; Palicourea demissa; Reciprocal herkogamy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860155500

Benth is a destructive parasitic weed to maize (Zea mays L.) in West and Central Africa. The presence of large genetic variation among parasite populations contributes to significant genotype × environment interaction, complicating assessment of resistance reactions of genotypes in field trails. The present study was conducted at Abuja and Mokwa in Nigeria for 5 and 6 yr, respectively, with and without artificial Striga infestation (i) to examine the reaction patterns of open-pollinated maize cultivars with varying levels of resistance to S. hermonthica and (ii) to identify cultivars or genotypes with stable resistance to the parasite across varying growing environments. In the combined analysis of variance, cultivar and cultivar × environment interaction significantly affected grain yield, emerged Striga plant count, and Striga damage rating under Striga infested condition. The nonparametric test of concordance was significant (p < 0.0001) and strong (coefficient of concordance [W] = 0.71 to 0.83) for the three traits recorded under infestation, indicating consistent ranking of the resistance reactions of the cultivars to S. hermonthica across environments. Both additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and cluster analyses of each trait recorded under infestation across environments placed the resistant cultivars in one group and the tolerant and susceptible cultivars in a second group. Further analysis of stability of rank order of individual cultivars across environments using nonparametric tests did not indicate any instability of the resistance reactions of the eight open-pollinated maize cultivars. The resistant cultivars had low average ranks for grain yield under infestation, Striga damage rating, and emerged Striga plant count whereas the reverse was true for both the tolerant and susceptible cultivars. Cultivars with stable resistance, which can be used directly for cultivation or as sources of resistance alleles for breeding, were identified in this study. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859984057

This harsh environment is likely to result in a unique, usually endemic, flora. However, not all plants growing on serpentine soils are endemic; some plants appear to be indifferent (bodenvag) to the serpentine condition. It is likely that these apparently bodenvag serpentine taxa may be ecotypically differentiated into serpentine tolerant and intolerant races whilst appearing morphologically indistinguishable (cryptic). This study investigated whether aspects of life history (biomass, productivity, life forms) and breeding system characteristics (pollen viability, pollen/ovule ratios, pollinator exclusions, pollination syndromes) could indicate ecotype formation in selected, apparently bodenvag, serpentine taxa on the Witwatersrand. Multivariate analyses, namely correspondence analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) as well as Student's . t-tests, were used to analyse the data. The results indicate that reproductive and life history data do not separate the study taxa into ecotypes.

In particular, floral scents appear to play crucial roles in deceptive pollination strategies, contributing to floral mimicry of ripe or decaying fruits, fungi and, potentially, carrion or faeces. Occasionally, floral scent may advertise genuine floral rewards, as is the case for two species of Unonopsis pollinated by male euglossine bees.

However, whether these inducible tolerance responses can be extended to pine trees and how these responses could be modulated by genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. Biomass allocation and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations in above- and below-ground tissues were measured in Pinus pinaster juveniles belonging to 33 open-pollinated families grown under two P availabilities (P-deficient and complete fertilization). Measurements were taken 15days after half of the plants received a foliar spray treatment of 22mmolL -1 methyl jasmonate (MJ) to simulate above-ground herbivore attack. Simulated above-ground herbivory promoted a strong preferential allocation of biomass below ground in the form of fine roots, leading to an almost two-fold increase in fine root biomass in MJ-treated plants and a significant reduction in above-ground tissues and coarse roots. In addition, MJ signalling increased P and N concentrations in the shoots while reducing (P) or maintaining (N) concentrations in the roots. These results suggest that induced resource sequestration is not a generalized strategy in this pine species. Fine root biomass and concentration of N and P in plant tissues showed additive genetic variation, but responses to MJ signalling did not vary among families. Allocation of biomass to fine roots was not affected by P availability, whereas allocation of P to the shoot was more intense under complete fertilization. Synthesis: Two new putative tolerance mechanisms inducible by MJ signalling may help to minimize the impact of above-ground herbivore damage on the future fitness of young pine trees by (i) allocation of carbon to fine roots, this appeared to be a generalized strategy with weak environmental modulation and (ii) reallocation of P and N from roots to shoots, which was largely affected by P availability, and thus susceptible to greater phenotypic variation in heterogeneous environments. We provide evidence that changes in tolerance-related traits are rapidly inducible by herbivory cues in this pine species. These results should be integrated with induced resistance responses to fully understand the costs and benefits associated with induced responses to herbivory. © 2011 The Authors.

Extragynoecial compita, commonly occurring in basal angiosperms, have been proposed to have the potential to increase offspring quantity in apocarpous species through the intercarpellary growth of pollen tubes. To date, the impact of an extragynoecial compitum on fruit or seed set has not been studied in any species. This study investigated the pollen tube pathway between adjacent carpels and its contribution to fruit set in Schisandra sphenanthera. Methods: We investigated the fruit set ratio in the field and collected hundreds of gynoecia at their full flowering stage. Pollinated carpel ratio and pollen tube pathway observations were performed using fluorescence optics. Key results: Pollen grains germinated and tubes extended along the pseudostyle surface. Some of them turned and entered the ovules at the end of the stigmatic crest, whereas others subsequently grew into neighboring carpels through promontory connections located at the base of the unfused carpels. No tubes were found growing on the surface of the receptacle. More than 24 carpels could be fertilized by pollen tubes from one carpel through hand pollination.

The output of competitive interactions between ants and bees for inflorescences of jambolan Syzygium jambolanum (Myrtaceae) in an agroforestry system in Brazilian Meridional Amazonian are an interesting system of investigation due the possibility to control variables experimentally. In 20 S. jambolanum individuals we performed 300 treatments in different inflorescences of two strata (upper and lower) as follows: (1) ants exclusion, (2) bees exclusion, and (3) control group where ants and bees could access the inflorescences. There was no difference in the number of inflorescences, volume of nectar and sugar concentration between the strata. Also the visitors considered are distributed equally in the tree's stratum. When bees were prevented from access the inflorescences, ants dominated more inflorescences only in the lower stratum. On the contrary, when ants were excluded, bees visited more inflorescences only in the upper stratum. We conclude that ants prevent the access to bees and vice versa as the result of different ability of resource utilization and foraging strategies. Thus, preventing the access of ants to the floral nectar could increase the level of nectar available to pollinators of S. jambolanum, thereby increasing productivity and reducing economic losses. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agriculture; Competitive interactions; Nectar; Pollination; Pollinator cheaters,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861227052

The stigma width of long styled flowers is larger than that of short ones, and L-morph (long) stigmas have longer and less number of papillae than the S-morphs (short). Flowers produced significantly smaller pollen grains, but in greater numbers, in L-morph than in S-morph. In .

Populations containing only the L-morph were occasionally found, but populations fixed for the S-morph were not observed. The biased style-morph ratios maybe result from morph-specific differences in assortative mating or artificial disturbance.

Population phenology was studied every two weeks, over two consecutive flowering seasons, in three to six 0.25m 2 quadrats set in monocultures of the species at each of eight sites in New South Wales, Australia. Floral density (flowersm -2) ranged from 0 to 5800±1400m -2 and varied significantly among sites (P&lt;0.05). Peak flowering occurred in mid-late October, during a period of no tidal inundation; fruit maturation coincided with inundation by extreme high tides in December, January and February. Sediment samples collected from each quadrat post-flowering were analysed for water content, salinity, texture (clay content) and pH. Ordinal logistic regression (OLR) of floral density against foliage volume and sediment variables showed a significant positive response to increasing foliage volume and negative responses to increasing salinity and clay content (P&lt;0.05). Foliage volume, in turn, showed a significant positive response to sediment water content and again negative responses to increasing salinity and clay content (P&lt;0.05). Fruit development occurred at all sites; however, little to no seed was produced at five of the sites. When quadrats not producing seed were excluded (to limit the influence of self-incompatibility), OLR of seed yield against floral density and sediment variables indicated sediment water content was the only significant predictor of yield (P=0.015). The morphology and phenology of individual flowers, potential pollination vectors, and general seed biology were also investigated. A combination of floral characteristics indicated that W. backhousei is wind-pollinated, likely to be outbreeding, and may be self-incompatible. The fruit is buoyant and, as maturation coincides with inundation by extreme high tides, may be dispersed within and among sites by tidal flow. The seed was found to be viable and long-lived (&gt;70% germination in both fresh seed and seed aged for 6 years); however, seed germination is limited by physical dormancy and is significantly reduced by salinity levels ?40dSm -1 (6±2.4% after 28 days, P&lt;0.001).

Yeast frequency and species richness were assessed in external sources (bee glossae, air, plant phylloplane) as well as in pollinator rewards (pollen, nectar). Yeasts were most frequent in external sources (air, flower-visiting insects), less so in the proximate floral environment (phylloplane), and least in pollen and nectar.

Nectar, pollen, and insect yeast assemblages differed in physiological characteristics from those in other substrates.

Nevertheless, few interspecific hybrids between melon and wild Cucumis spp. have been obtained because of strong reproductive barriers such as pollen-pistil incongruity and hybrid seed abortion. For this study, we examined the temperature conditions enhancing pollen tube growth and fruit set in interspecific crosses between melon and wild Cucumis spp. Before temperature-conditioned pollination, four wild Cucumis spp. were pollinated with the melon line 'MR-1' and two lines of C. anguria, PI 147065 and PI 320052, and a line of C. metuliferus, PI 526242, were selected for later experiments. These three lines were crossed reciprocally with 'MR-1' under controlled temperatures of 24-34. °C at 2. °C intervals. When 'MR-1' pistils were pollinated with three lines of wild Cucumis spp., pollen tube growth was arrested after germination at all temperatures. However, in the pistil of wild Cucumis spp., pollen tube growth of 'MR-1' was significantly greater at 32. °C and at 34. °C than that under 30. °C. Furthermore, pollen tube length in pistils of PI 320052 and PI 526242 at 32. °C was comparable to that of 'MR-1' self-pollination at 28. °C. Fruit set frequency was also improved at 32. °C. These results demonstrated that the pollen tube inhibition of Cucumis spp. interspecific crosses might be partially or fully recoverable in higher-temperature conditions. Moreover, 32. °C is apparently the threshold temperature for promoting pollen tube growth in these cross combinations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Cucumis spp.; Incongruity; Interspecific cross; Pollen tube; Pre-zygotic barrier,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858125765

We sampled 5841 specimens in total, which included 549 morphospecies and were distributed among 11 families. Of the total specimens sampled, 80% were Formicidae, which besides being the most abundant, was also the most diverse and constant family.

Lately, however, positive effects were shown to be transient and highly trait-specific within the social bumblebees. Contrary to bumblebees, solitary wild bees may benefit more sustainably from mass-flowering crops due to a better seasonal match of the mass provision of resources and their sexual reproduction. We quantified reproductive activity and reproductive output of the polylectic solitary bee . Osmia rufa during and after mass-flowering in landscapes with differing amounts of oilseed rape and semi-natural habitats. Across seasons, the number of produced offspring increased with availability of oilseed rape and semi-natural habitats while brood abortion decreased with the former and parasitation with the latter. Season-specific analyses suggest that increased nest-building during mass-flowering of oilseed rape early in the season outweighs negative effects on the number of cells per nest and the percentage of parasitized cells once the mass-flowering has ceased. No effect on number of cells per nest during mass-flowering and exemplary pollen analysis indicate that oilseed rape benefits solitary bees in the form of abundant nectar for foraging flights rather than pollen for brood provisioning. Besides providing permanent forage and nesting sites, semi-natural elements seem to benefit pollinators also by mitigating negative effects of parasitation, potentially via enhanced hyperparasitism. In conclusion, . O. rufa clearly benefits from mass-flowering oilseed rape. Yet, the outweighing of the negative post-flowering effects by the early benefits of oilseed rape is tightly linked to the bee's polylecty and early phenology. Thus, it remains to be tested if species unable to utilize oilseed rape due to mismatched oligolecty or later phenology suffer disproportionally from the post-flowering phase of oilseed rape. © 2012 Gesellschaft für ökologie.",Agricultural landscapes; Canola; Ecosystem service; Environmental change; Functional traits; Pollen analyses; Pollinators; Resource pulse; Trap nests,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861754137

The maintenance of dimorphic and polymorphic reproductive systems may be problematic. For example, to coexist with hermaphrodites the females of gynodioecious species have to compensate for the lack of male function. In our study species, Geranium sylvaticum, a perennial gynodioecious herb, the relative seed fitness advantage of females varies significantly between years within populations as well as among populations. Differences in reproductive investment between females and hermaphrodites may lead to differences in future survival, growth and reproductive success, i.e. to differential costs of reproduction. Since females of this species produce more seeds, higher costs of reproduction in females than in hermaphrodites were expected. Due to the higher costs of reproduction, the yearly variation in reproductive output of females might be more pronounced than that of hermaphrodites. Methods: Using supplemental hand-pollination of females and hermaphrodites of G. sylvaticum we examined if increased reproductive output leads to differential costs of reproduction in terms of survival, probability of flowering, and seed production in the following year. Key Results: Experimentally increased reproductive output had differential effects on the reproduction of females and hermaphrodites. In hermaphrodites, the probability of flowering decreased significantly in the following year, whereas in females the costs were expressed in terms of decreased future seed production. Conclusions: When combining the probability of flowering and seed production per plant to estimate the multiplicative change in fitness, female plants showed a 56 and hermaphrodites showed a 39 decrease in fitness due to experimentally increased reproduction. Therefore, in total, female plants seem to be more sensitive to the cost of reproduction in terms of seed fitness than hermaphrodites. © 2012 The Author.",cost of reproduction; Geranium sylvaticum; Gynodioecy; hand-pollination; maintenance of gynodioecy; pollen limitation; seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860430595

A simple mathematical model can be used to calculate the maximum predator abundance compatible with positive growth of solitary bee populations. Using published data to estimate model parameters, the model shows that medium-sized (20-80 mg dry weight) solitary bees are very sensitive to predation and their populations can hardly grow when 1-2% of flowers are occupied by ambush predators-a predator abundance well within the range reported in most studies. Smaller and larger bees, on the other hand, can easily cope with normal predator abundances: small bees do not need to visit many flowers to provision an offspring, making it unlikely that they encounter a predator, and large bees are less vulnerable to predator attacks. According to a sensibility analysis, the parameters with the greatest impact on bee population viability are the number of flowers that bees must exploit to provision an offspring and the probability that a bee, upon landing on a predator-harboring flower, is actually captured. It follows that ambush predators cannot be excluded a priori from the list of factors affecting bee diversity and abundance: small changes in the abundance of ambush predators, possibly related to changes in the availability of alternative prey, could have dramatic effects on the viability of medium-sized solitary bees. © 2012 The Author.",antipredator behavior; Apoidea; pollinator decline; population regulation; predation; provisioning cost,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859502862

One factor that may influence the pollinator-production relationship across regions is phenology, or the timing of recurring biological events, because crop phenology can be proximately controlled by climatic variables and phenology can affect plant reproductive success. For the economically important crop, coffee (Coffea arabica), at least three aspects of flowering phenology (onset, density and frequency) are influenced by precipitation, which varies across coffee's cultivated range. Of these aspects of flowering phenology, flower density may particularly impact production in coffee because high-density flowering can severely limit outcrossing which is a major contributor to high yields and larger, high quality beans. We studied the C. arabica coffee plant-pollinator interaction over 3 years and across two distinct types of coffee blooms: (1) low-density, synchronous flowering and (2) high-density, synchronous (mass) flowering. Bee species richness was similar for four out of five flowering periods (9.8 ± 2.7 95% CI), but nearly tripled during one high-density flowering period (26 ± 8.6 95% CI). During low-density flowering coffee fruit set rates were varied, but when coffee flowered at high-density, initial fruit set rates remained close to 60% (the rate obtained from manual self-pollination of coffee flowers in pollination experiments). We discuss how changing precipitation patterns may alter coffee flowering phenology and the coffee plant-pollinator relationship, providing insight into how climate change may influence this interaction as well as the resultant coffee production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agroforestry; Bees; Climate; Phenology; Shade-coffee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861228527

(Butomaceae) to assess its consequence on male fitness. Light microscope observations indicated that stomium breakage was simultaneous in all the anthers within an opening flower; however, detachment of the epidermis and outward bending of the anther wall were asynchronous. SEM observations showed that epidermis cells alternated between orbicular and crinkly shapes in response to absorption and loss of water. This generated centripetal and centrifugal forces which were significant enough to cause inward and outward bending of the anther wall, thus causing opened anthers to close and closed anthers to re-open respectively, depending on relative humidity of the environment. Behaviour of in vitro and in situ anthers from different whorls within a flower was recorded under four regimes of relative humidity or under a water-spraying treatment. The three stages of anther opening namely stomium breakage, epidermis detachment and outward bending of the anther wall were affected differently by moisture levels. Outward bending of anther wall which was responsible for reversible anther opening was mainly dependent on environmental relative humidity levels. Notably, on sunny days, anther re-opening was inhibited at high relative humidity for in vitro anthers, but not for anthers in situ. Reabsorption, rather than evaporation was responsible for reversible anther opening for this aquatic plant. Water-spraying treatment indicated that flowers with re-closed anthers attracted fewer pollinators. Results using pollen stainability and germinability of pollen on stigmas for pollen grains from different treatments also showed the mechanism of reversible anther opening significantly prolonged pollen longevity by maintaining high viability in a simulated rainy. Discontinuous pollen presentation due to reversible anther opening avoided unfavorable pollination environment and pollen loss. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",Outward bending of anther wall; Pollen longevity; Pollen viability; Pollen/ovule ratio; Pollination; Reabsorption,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862784651

The fine-scale nectar drinking time, number of contacts with anthers and/or stigmas, and frequencies of body part contact with anthers and/or stigmas differed significantly among pollinator species. Pollination efficiency was not equal among pollinators. In addition, M. pyrrhosticta made the least number of contacts with anthers and/or stigmas even though it showed the highest visitation frequency.

Few studies, however, have directly assessed the spatiotemporal variation in resource availability that arises from landscape pattern, or its effect on populations and population dynamic parameters. We tested the effect of floral resource availability at the landscape scale on the numbers of worker, male, and queen offspring produced by bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, colonies experimentally placed within complex agricultural-natural landscapes. We quantified flower densities in all land use types at different times of the season and then used these data to calculate spatially explicit estimates of floral resources surrounding each colony. Floral availability strongly correlated with landscape structure, and different regions of the landscape showed distinct seasonal patterns of floral availability. The floral resources available in the landscape surrounding a colony positively affected the number of workers and males it produced. Production was more sensitive to early-than to later-season resources. Floral resources did not significantly affect queen production despite a strong correlation between worker number and queen number among colonies. No landscape produced high floral resources during both the early and late season, and seasonal consistency is likely required for greater queen production. Floral resources are important determinants of colony growth and likely affect the pollination services provided by bumble bees at a landscape scale. Spatiotemporal variation in floral resources across the landscape precludes a simple relationship between resources and reproductive success as measured by queens, but nonetheless likely influences the total abundance of bumble bees in our study region. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Apoidea; Bombus; Bumble bee; Floral resources; Landscape structure; Pollinator; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861400005

We examined the relationship between mating patterns, using microsatellites, and fitness of progeny, in a common garden trial, for the insect-pollinated big-leaf mahogany, Swietenia macrophylla King, sourced from forests and isolated trees in 16 populations across Central America. As expected, isolated trees had disrupted mating patterns and reduced fitness. However, for dry provenances, fitness was negatively related to correlated paternity, while for mesic provenances, fitness was correlated positively with outcrossing rate and negatively with correlated paternity. Poorer performance of mesic provenances is likely because of reduced effective pollen donor density due to poorer environmental suitability and greater disturbance history.

Although the mechanisms driving reproduction have been thoroughly investigated and discussed, their relative importance and possible coexistence remain an open question. Seed rain abundance and viability of balsam fir Abies balsamea, white spruce Picea glauca, and white birch Betula papyrifera were monitored during 1994-2007 along a chronosequence of developmental stages at different densities represented by four stands in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. The aim of the study was to verify whether seeding temporal dynamics and abundance were affected by stand density, and to test the causal relationships between the hypotheses of pollination efficiency and predator satiation. Seed rain abundance varied substantially among years and species, with the highest values being observed in 1994 and 1996, and attaining up to 28.2 × 10 3 seeds m -2 year -1. However, the annual dynamics of seed production was similar in the three sites with the higher densities. The greater proportions of germinating and dead seeds were observed in white birch, while balsam fir showed an average of 11.2% of damaged seeds, which were infected by larvae. The conifer species had the higher proportions of empty seeds. The causal models tested on balsam fir demonstrated that seed rain abundance influenced the amount of both viable and larval-infected seeds, although no causal relationship existed between these last two variables. The comparable and synchronous seed rain abundances observed among sites demonstrated that stand density can significantly affect the reproduction of trees, probably by limiting the access to resources, but not the annual dynamics of seeding. Pollination efficiency and predator satiation are important forces in the reproductive effort of trees and could be not mutually exclusive because both these mechanisms of natural selection synergistically coexist in driving the seeding dynamics of balsam fir. © 2011 The Authors.

However, the current study, using field observations, pollination studies, gut content analyses, laboratory feeding tests, and exclusion experiments, established that Funambulus squirrels in cultivated coconut patches do not feed on nuts and hence do not generate economic losses. Squirrels cause male flower drop and feed on few male flowers without any negative impact on palm productivity or other aspects of the plantation ecosystem. Instead, squirrels pollinate (therophily) flowers, feed on insect pests, regulate vegetation at the microhabitat level as seed consumers and dispersers, and thus are an ecologically important component of cultivated coconut patches. Squirrels were found to be the most effective pollinators (85.70% nut formation in Arsikere and 94% at Madenur, Hassan).

In this study, the floral characteristics and the development of reproductive structures of these two cut flowers are investigated. On a macro-level, flower morphology was analysed by dissections, light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The female and male gametophyte development as well as embryogenesis was investigated on a micro-level by light microscopy of paraffin sections and fluorescence microscopy. These analyses confirmed that anthers of A. coronaria and R. asiaticus are tetrasporangiate and that the stamens of R. asiaticus can be transformed to petals. Pollen development in A. coronaria and R. asiaticus is of the simultaneous type. The mature pollen is spheroid, polyporate and bicellular. For both species, the development of the embryo sac is of the octonucleate Polygonum-type. The two polar nuclei inside the embryo sac fuse before fertilization while two of the three antipodal cells persist after fertilization. On the moment of fruitlet shedding, the embryos are not fully developed yet implicating an autonomous maturation prior to germination. Finally, pollination tests revealed that R. asiaticus 'Alfa' is self-incompatible. The results presented here provide new insights in the reproductive biology of A. coronaria and R. asiaticus supportive for future breeding strategies. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Anemone coronaria; Megagametogenesis; Microgametogenesis; Microsporogenesis; Ranunculus asiaticus; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857678753

Based on 287 publications with 1551 individual cases that addressed the impact of 167 invasive plant species belonging to 49 families, we present the first global overview of frequencies of significant and non-significant ecological impacts and their directions on 15 outcomes related to the responses of resident populations, species, communities and ecosystems. Species and community outcomes tend to decline following invasions, especially those for plants, but the abundance and richness of the soil biota, as well as concentrations of soil nutrients and water, more often increase than decrease following invasion. Data mining tools revealed that invasive plants exert consistent significant impacts on some outcomes (survival of resident biota, activity of resident animals, resident community productivity, mineral and nutrient content in plant tissues, and fire frequency and intensity), whereas for outcomes at the community level, such as species richness, diversity and soil resources, the significance of impacts is determined by interactions between species traits and the biome invaded. The latter outcomes are most likely to be impacted by annual grasses, and by wind pollinated trees invading mediterranean or tropical biomes. One of the clearest signals in this analysis is that invasive plants are far more likely to cause significant impacts on resident plant and animal richness on islands rather than mainland. This study shows that there is no universal measure of impact and the pattern observed depends on the ecological measure examined. Although impact is strongly context dependent, some species traits, especially life form, stature and pollination syndrome, may provide a means to predict impact, regardless of the particular habitat and geographical region invaded. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biome; Invasive plants; Islands; Prediction; Resident biota; Soil resources; Species diversity; Species traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859501746

In plants, partial or facultative selfing limits the risk of pollination failure. In preferentially outcrossing species, this may result in mixed-mating. In hermaphroditic animals, recent studies suggest that mixed mating might be much rarer than in plants. However more studies are required to substantiate this claim, especially focusing on species whose lifestyle entails a high potential benefit of reproductive assurance via selfing. We studied a hermaphroditic snail, Drepanotrema depressissimum, which inhabits very unstable and fragmented freshwater habitats. Individuals often have to recolonize newly refilled ponds after long droughts, a situation of low population density and hence low mate availability in which selfing could be an advantage. We estimated selfing rates in natural populations from Guadeloupe (Lesser Antilles), and used laboratory experiments to characterize the reproductive behaviour and success of individuals with or without mates. We detected no sign of selfing in natural populations. Even when given no other option, isolated individuals were extremely reluctant to self. They produced either no or very small clutches, and in the latter case initiated egg-laying later than non-isolated individuals. Self-fertilized clutches suffered near-total (98%) inbreeding depression at the juvenile stage. The example of D. depressissimum therefore shows that a species can overcome periods of mate shortage and habitat instability without the potential to rely on facultative selfing. We hypothesize that metapopulation persistence in this landscape is probably related to a form of dormancy (aestivation in dry ground) rather than to recolonization by rare immigrants and reproductive assurance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Double-copulation; Life-history traits; Mating system; Molluscs; Selfing rate; Waiting time,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858072204

This shift is often accompanied by a suite of changes in floral and reproductive characters termed the selfing syndrome. Here, we characterize the genetic architecture and evolutionary forces underlying evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella rubella following its recent divergence from the outcrossing ancestor C. grandiflora. We conduct genotyping by multiplexed shotgun sequencing and map floral and reproductive traits in a large (N= 550) F2 population. Our results suggest that in contrast to previous studies of the selfing syndrome, changes at a few loci, some with major effects, have shaped the evolution of the selfing syndrome in Capsella. The directionality of QTL effects, as well as population genetic patterns of polymorphism and divergence at 318 loci, is consistent with a history of directional selection on the selfing syndrome. Our study is an important step toward characterizing the genetic basis and evolutionary forces underlying the evolution of the selfing syndrome in a genetically accessible model system. © 2012 The Author(s).

After fertilization, the maternal seed coat develops in a coordinated manner with formation of the embryo and endosperm. In the arabidopsis bsister (abs) mutant, the endothelium, which is the most inner cell layer of the integuments that surround the haploid embryo sac, does not accumulate proanthocyanidins and the cells have an abnormal morphology.

SEEDSTICK regulates ovule identity redundantly with SHATTERPROOF 1 (SHP1) and SHP2 while a role in the control of fertility was not reported previously. Here we describe the characterization of the abs stk double mutant. This double mutant develops very few seeds due to both a reduced number of fertilized ovules and seed abortions later during development. Morphological analysis revealed a total absence of endothelium in this double mutant. Additionally, massive starch accumulation was observed in the embryo sac.

Indirect effects may include non-additive interactions with density dependence. Detection of climate drivers is critical to predicting climate change effects, but identification of potential drivers may depend on knowing the underlying mechanisms. For the butterfly Speyeria mormonia, one climate driver, snow melt date, has multiple effects on population growth. Snow melt date in year t has density-dependent indirect effects. Through frost effects, early snow melt decreases floral resources, thence per-capita nectar availability, which determines fecundity in the lab. Snow melt date in year t+1 has density-independent direct effects. These effects explain 84% of the variation in population growth rate.

Here, we examine the reproductive biology of a small population of R. ciliata occurring in a residential nature reserve 30 km east of Cape Town to provide baseline information for future studies. Data were recorded on the functional structure of the flower, duration of the morphological gender phases, floral visitor profile and the relationship between breeding system and habitat. Observations revealed that this species possesses reproductive characteristics typical of Campanulaceae such as dichogamy, protandry and secondary pollen presentation via pollen collecting hairs. Floral longevity ranges between 1 and 3 days. Anthesis occurs in synchronicity at 0700 hours and individual flowers close between 0930 and 1500 hours daily. The staminate phase lasts between 2 and 29 h and is significantly influenced by the removal of pollen by floral visitors, while the pistillate phase lasts between 21 and 69 h. R. ciliata maintains a generalized, entomophilous pollination system although floral visitors are generally scarce. Despite some intraspecific variation, the pollen/ovule ratio indicates that R. ciliata has a facultatively autogamous breeding system, in contrast to its floral attributes which might favour xenogamy. This reproductive mechanism may ensure survival under these habitat conditions and could represent a shift from outcrossing to selfing at the cost of reducing genetic variation over time. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Campanulaceae; Cape Floristic Region; Habitat fragmentation; Reproductive biology; Roella ciliata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860182747

In this work, phenolic profiles of virgin olive oils (VOOs) from segregating populations obtained by cross breeding in Cordoba (Spain) have been evaluated. Genotypes obtained from open pollination of the cultivar Manzanilla de Sevilla, and from crosses between the cultivars Arbequina×Arbosana, Picual×Koroneiki and Sikitita×Arbosana were tested. The phenolic composition was determined after liquid-liquid extraction with 60:40 v/v methanol-water and subsequent chromatographic analysis with ultraviolet (UV) detection of both absorption and fluorescence in a sequential configuration. Results for all studied compounds showed high degree of variability between genotypes, with a higher range of variation than the observed for the genitors. Most of the observed variability was attributable to differences in genotypes within crosses rather than among crosses.

Throughout the Neotropics there has been a strong increase in recent years in the use of artificial nectar feeders in private nature reserves to encourage ecotourism through prolonged observations of hummingbirds. Currently, there is considerable uncertainty whether artificial feeders have a detrimental effect on plant reproduction through competition or a beneficial effect through facilitation. This uncertainty is disconcerting given that nature reserves harbour many rare and endangered plants whose successful reproduction is a conservation goal. To assess whether nectar feeders affected hummingbird visitation to flowering plants, we determined visitation rates in ten flowering species in five Andean nature reserves in Ecuador. We found that visitation rates tended to be higher within 5. m around the feeders than they were at 100. m, 500. m, or 1.5. km distance to the feeders, therefore indicating that nectar feeders tended to facilitate flower visitation at close distance. Because visitation rates at 100. m and 500. m distance from the feeders did not differ from those at 1.5. km, we suggest that feeders do not draw hummingbirds away from flower resources, but if they have an effect on flower visitation at all, they tend to facilitate flower visitation rather than reduce plant reproduction. © 2012 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Ecotourism; Plant conservation; Plant reproduction; Plant-animal interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861722746

Some of the major factors that can affect spatial genetic structure (SGS) in plants are the level of gene flow, spatial arrangement and life stages of individuals within populations. Applying six highly variable microsatellite markers, we investigated the effect of these factors on spatial genetic structure selecting two natural populations of sycamore maple, which is an insect-pollinated, autotetraploid and an indigenous hardwood species in Germany and in other central European countries. The two study populations had different shapes (""compact"" and ""elongated"") and tree densities. Significant SGS extended to ~180 m in the elongated population and to ~35 m in the compact population. Juvenile plants of the compact population showed significant SGS up to 40 m. Estimate of Sp statistic in high-density population was almost double of that in the population with low density. Gene dispersal distance in the low-density population was about 9 times higher than in the population with high density. The similar level of significant SGS in both adult and juvenile plants suggested minimal or no effect of life stages of individuals on SGS in the sycamore maple population. The data presented in this study can provide guidelines for seed collection and to establish populations for the conservation and management of genetic resources of the species. © 2011 The Author(s).",Acer pseudoplatanus; Autotetraploid; Microsatellites; Spatial genetic structure; Sycamore maple,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859506377

The elucidation of its origin and domestication history is therefore of great interest. The wild Central Asian species Malus sieversii has previously been identified as the main contributor to the genome of the cultivated apple (Malus domestica), on the basis of morphological, molecular, and historical evidence. The possible contribution of other wild species present along the Silk Route running from Asia to Western Europe remains a matter of debate, particularly with respect to the contribution of the European wild apple. We used microsatellite markers and an unprecedented large sampling of five Malus species throughout Eurasia (839 accessions from China to Spain) to show that multiple species have contributed to the genetic makeup of domesticated apples. The wild European crabapple M. sylvestris, in particular, was a major secondary contributor. Bidirectional gene flow between the domesticated apple and the European crabapple resulted in the current M. domestica being genetically more closely related to this species than to its Central Asian progenitor, M. sieversii. We found no evidence of a domestication bottleneck or clonal population structure in apples, despite the use of vegetative propagation by grafting. We show that the evolution of domesticated apples occurred over a long time period and involved more than one wild species. Our results support the view that self-incompatibility, a long lifespan, and cultural practices such as selection from open-pollinated seeds have facilitated introgression from wild relatives and the maintenance of genetic variation during domestication. This combination of processes may account for the diversification of several long-lived perennial crops, yielding domestication patterns different from those observed for annual species. © 2012 Cornille et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863661802

Methods: We investigated the association of family-level inbreeding depression and presumed inbreeding history in a tristylous population of Oxalis alpina (Oxalidaceae). Key results: Mid-styled individuals possessed the greatest degree of self-compatibility (SC) and produced more autogamous capsules than short-or long-styled individuals. Offspring of highly self-compatible mid-styled individuals showed reduced inbreeding depression. Mid-styled plants that produced capsules autogamously exhibited reduced stigma-anther separation compared to mid-styled plants that produced no capsules autogamously. Reduced inbreeding depression was not correlated with stigma-anther separation, suggesting that self-compatibility and autogamy evolve before morphological changes in stigma-anther separation. Conclusions: Purging of inbreeding depression occurred in SC mid-styled maternal families. Low inbreeding depression in SC mid-styled plants may lead to retention of the mid-styled morph in populations, despite the occurrence of higher selfing rates in mid-styled relative to short-or long-styled morphs. Variation among individuals in levels of self-fertilization within populations may lead to associations between inbreeding lineages and lower levels of inbreeding depression, influencing the evolution of mating systems. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Autogamy; Heterostyly; Inbreeding depression; Oxalis alpina (Oxalidaceae); Purging; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860569248

The six nectaries each occupied a groove that is located 2-4 mm above the tepal base. The average nectary measured 11. 0 mm long and 1. 0-1. 2 mm wide. The structure of nectaries situated on both inner and outer tepal whorls was identical, and at anthesis they were equally accessible to potential pollinators. However, secretion from nectaries associated with inner tepals tended to exceed that produced by nectaries located on the outer tepals. On average, regardless of flower stage, one flower secreted 10. 87 ± 12. 98 mg of nectar (mean and SD; N = 182). The nectar concentration ranged between 3 and 75%, with average concentration of sugars exceeding 50%. Both nectar production and concentration were dependent on the stage of anthesis, with the highest scores being recorded during full anthesis (21. 75 ± 16. 08 mg; 70. 5%, mass and concentration, respectively) and the lowest at the end of anthesis (1. 32 ± 2. 69 mg; 16. 9%, mass and concentration, respectively). A decline in both mass of nectar secreted and nectar concentration during the final stage of anthesis indicates nectar resorption. Nectar was composed of sucrose, glucose and fructose in approx. equal quantities, and its composition did not change significantly during subsequent stages of flowering. The nectaries comprised a single-layered secretory epidermis and several layers of subepidermal parenchyma. The nectariferous cells did not accumulate starch during any of the investigated stages. The nectary was supplied with one large and several smaller vascular bundles comprising xylem and phloem. Transport of assimilates and nectar secretion by protoplasts of secretory cells (and probably also nectar resorption) were facilitated by cell wall ingrowths present on the tangential walls of epidermal cells and subepidermal parenchyma.

We demonstrate that amongst nonpollinating fig wasps (NPFWs) parasitic on Ficus citrifolia, a species of Idarnes galls flowers and another species feeds on galls induced by other wasps killing their larvae. The galling wasp inserts its ovipositor through the fig wall into the fig cavity. The ovipositor then follows a sinuous path and is introduced through the stigma and style of the flower. The egg is deposited between the integument and nucellus, in the exact location where the pollinating mutualistic wasp would have laid its egg. Gall induction is a complex process. In contrast, the path followed by the ovipositor of the other species is straightforward: attacking a larva within a developed gall poses different constraints. Shifts in feeding regime have occurred repeatedly in NPFWs. Monitoring traits associated with such repeated evolutionary shifts may help understand underlying functional constraints. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Convergent evolution; Feeding behaviour; Ficus; Oviposition behaviour; Parasite of mutualism; Sycophaginae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859373313

In flowering plants, inbreeding depression commonly acts most intensely during seed development. This predispersal component is typically estimated by comparing seed production following exclusive self- and cross-pollination, but such estimates are unbiased only if seed production is limited by ovule availability, rather than by pollen receipt or seed-development resources. To overcome this problem, we propose experimental and statistical methods based on a model of ovule fertilization and seed development that accounts for differential fertilization by self- and cross-pollen, limited ovule viability or receptivity, differential survival of self- and cross-zygotes and limited resource availability. Simulations illustrate that the proposed methods eliminate bias in estimated predispersal inbreeding depression caused by pollen limitation and can improve estimates under resource limitation. Application of these methods to two orchid species further demonstrates their utility in identifying and estimating diverse influences on reproductive performance under typical conditions. Although our theoretical results raise questions about the reported intensity of predispersal inbreeding depression, our proposed methods guard against bias while also providing insight into plant reproduction. © 2011 The Author(s).

Mean foraging distances were 755 m for Bombus lapidarius and 775 m for B. pascuorum (using our most conservative estimation method). Colony-specific foraging distances of both species varied with landscape structure, decreasing as the proportion of foraging habitats increased.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivory and disease, history, and conservation. Campanula rotundifolia is a slender, rhizomatous, prostrate to erect herb with long-stalked roundish basal leaves, linear stem leaves, and a blue, bell-shaped corolla. It is widespread in the British Isles though absent from parts of Ireland. Globally, C. rotundifolia has a circumpolar distribution extending from the Arctic Circle to northern Mexico and North Africa. It forms a polyploid complex with some characters linked to ploidy level. Populations in the British Isles are predominantly tetraploid and hexaploid, with occasional pentaploids. The distribution of these cytotypes in the British Isles has a strong spatial structure. Campanula rotundifolia has a wide ecological amplitude, tolerating very dry conditions but also occasionally occurring in permanently saturated habitats, and it grows on a very wide range of soil types, from coarse sands through loams to heavy clays and pure peats. However, C. rotundifolia is rarely found on fertile lowland clays where competition from more vigorous species may limit growth. Campanula rotundifolia is found in a range of grassland, heath, mire, scrub and sand dune communities spanning a wide range of soil pH. Campanula rotundifolia is perennial and spreads by seed and by rhizome. Plants generally overwinter as frost-resistant green rosettes. As the spring season progresses, plants make slow vegetative growth. Erect flowering stems develop from June onwards. Campanula rotundifolia is largely self-incompatible, and is insect pollinated, regularly producing large quantities of viable seed. Although C. rotundifolia is a widespread and locally very common species there is some evidence from Britain and across Europe that it is in decline. These losses are likely to be due to a number of factors including agricultural intensification, reversion of grassland to scrub and woodland, disturbance, and atmospheric pollution. © 2012 The Authors.

We then describe the known mechanisms of competition and show how it is a critical driver of the evolutionary dynamics, persistence, and diversification of mutualism. We argue that empirical and theoretical research on the ecology and evolution of mutualisms will jointly progress by addressing four key points: (i) the existence and shape of physiological trade-offs among cooperation, competition, and other life-history and functional traits; (ii) the capacity for individuals to express conditional responses to variation in their mutualistic and competitive environment; (iii) the existence of heritable variation for mutualistic and competitive traits and their potentially conditional expression; and (iv) the structure of the network of consumer-resource interactions in which individuals are embedded. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.",Competition; Consumer-resource; Mutualism; Partner control,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860995460

We recently demonstrated that CYCLOIDEA2-like genes (CYC2A and CYC2B) are associated with the development of the stereotypical floral zygomorphy that is critical to this plant-pollinator mutualism. Here, we build on this developmental framework to characterize floral symmetry in three clades of Malpighiaceae that have independently lost their oil bee association and experienced parallel shifts in their floral morphology, especially in regard to symmetry. We show that in each case these species exhibit a loss of CYC2B function, and a strikingly similar shift in the expression of CYC2A that is coincident with their shift in floral symmetry.

Using detailed information on global crop yields of 60 pollination dependent or profiting crops, we provide a map of global pollination benefits on a 5? by 5? latitude-longitude grid. The current spatial pattern of pollination benefits is only partly correlated with climate variables and the distribution of cropland. The resulting map of pollination benefits identifies hot spots of pollination benefits at sufficient detail to guide political decisions on where to protect pollination services by investing in structural diversity of land use. Additionally, we investigated the vulnerability of the national economies with respect to potential decline of pollination services as the portion of the (agricultural) economy depending on pollination benefits. While the general dependency of the agricultural economy on pollination seems to be stable from 1993 until 2009, we see increases in producer prices for pollination dependent crops, which we interpret as an early warning signal for a conflict between pollination service and other land uses at the global scale. Our spatially explicit analysis of global pollination benefit points to hot spots for the generation of pollination benefits and can serve as a base for further planning of land use, protection sites and agricultural policies for maintaining pollination services. © 2012 Lautenbach et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860354863

It is an outcrossing, insect-pollinated species with gene flow occurring naturally between plants. A 2-year study was conducted to assess the relationship between gene flow and physical distance in white clover under field conditions in southern Australia. White clover plants exhibiting a red leaf mark phenotypic trait acted as pollen donors to recipient plants lacking leaf markings at distances up to 200m distant from the donor plants. Progeny were scored for the dominant red-leafed phenotype and gene flow was modelled. Paternity was confirmed using simple sequence repeat markers. A leptokurtic pattern of gene flow was observed under conditions designed to measure maximised gene flow with the majority of pollination occurring in the first 50m from the donor pollen source. The combined use of simple sequence repeat and visual markers confirmed that there was also a white clover pollen source in addition to the donor plants.

For plants in which both pollen and seeds are wind-dispersed, it may be advantageous for male plants to be taller when pollen is dispersed and female plants to be taller when seeds are dispersed. We examined the dynamics of height dimorphism in Rumex hastatulus, an annual, wind-pollinated, dioecious plant from the southern USA. A field survey of seven populations indicated that females were significantly taller than males at seed maturity. However, a glasshouse experiment revealed a more complex pattern of height growth during the life cycle. No dimorphism was evident prior to reproduction for six of seven populations, but at flowering, males were significantly taller than females in all populations.

Few molecular biological studies of SI in Citrus have been performed, and the molecular mechanism of SI has not been clarified. To investigate the effect of different stages of style development on pollen tube behavior, flower buds of self-incompatible 'Hyuganatsu' (Citrus tamurana hort. ex Tanaka) were histologically assayed. When the flower buds were observed 168 hours after pollination, pollen tubes in the self-pollinated flower buds 1 and 3 days before anthesis (DBA) were arrested in the upper part of the styles, while those in flower buds self-pollinated 5 DBA reached the base of the styles. These results revealed that SI in 'Hyuganatsu' has not yet occurred in the flower buds 5 DBA, but generated in the flower buds 3 DBA. To search SI-related pistil proteins in Citrus, we profiled a number of protein expressions in 'Hyuganatsu' styles of 1, 3, and 5 DBA by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. One-hundred thirty-eight protein spots were significantly different in abundance among the three stages, and 17 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated protein spots could be identified. Among the 17 up-regulated proteins, nine up-regulated proteins exhibited the expression pattern of 1 DBA ? 3 DBA > 5 DBA, a pattern which reflected the transmission from SC to SI, evaluated by pollen tube growth. BLASTP homology search against the peptide sequences of these proteins was carried out and predicted the proteins related to the maintenance of cell shape, the signaling of pollen tube growth, the flavonol biosynthesis, the responses to various stresses, photosynthesis, and the methionine metabolic process. Among the nine proteins, some may be the SI-related pistil proteins; however, it was not possible to determine the SI-related key protein of the style in Citrus. © 2012.",Bud pollination; Pollen tube elongation; Proteome analysis; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859826777

Pollination could be maintained through compensation if remaining pollinators increase their contribution or if novel species are recruited as pollinators, but empirical evidence of this compensation is so far lacking. Using a natural experiment in New Zealand where endemic vertebrate pollinators still occur on one offshore island reserve despite their local extinction on the adjacent North Island, we investigated whether compensation could maintain pollination in the face of pollinator extinctions. We show that two recently arrived species in New Zealand, the invasive ship rat (Rattus rattus) and the recent colonist silvereye (Zosterops lateralis; a passerine bird), at least partly maintain pollination for three forest plant species in northern New Zealand, and without this compensation, these plants would be significantly more pollen-limited.

Generalized food-deceptive (GFD) orchids compete poorly with rewarding species for pollinator services, which may be overcome by flowering early in the growing season when relatively more pollinators are naive and fewer competing plant species are flowering, and/or flowering for extended periods to enhance the chance of pollinator visits. We tested these hypotheses by manipulating flowering time and duration in a natural population of Calypso bulbosa and quantifying pollinator visitation based on pollen removal. Both early and long flowering increased bumble-bee visitation compared with lateand briefflowering, respectively. To identify the causeofreduced visitation during late flowering, we tested whether negative experience with C. bulbosa (avoidance learning) and positive experience with a rewarding species, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, (associative learning) by captive bumble-bees could reduce C. bulbosa's competitiveness. Avoidance learning explained the higher visitation of early- compared with late-flowering C. bulbosa. The resulting pollinator-mediated selection for early flowering may commonly affect GFD orchids, explaining their tendency to flower earlier than rewarding orchids.

Species specific VOCs normally repel polyphagous herbivores and those specialised on other plant species, but may attract specialist herbivores and their natural enemies, which use VOCs as host location cues. Attraction of predators and parasitoids by VOCs is considered an evolved indirect defence, whereby plants are able to indirectly reduce biotic stress caused by damaging herbivores. In this chapter we review these interactions where VOCs are known to play a crucial role. We then discuss the importance of volatile communication in self and nonself detection.

Consequently, the identification of factors shaping the performance of taxa in anthropogenic landscapes is gaining importance, especially for taxa playing critical roles in ecosystem functioning. As phyllostomid bats provide important ecological services through seed dispersal, pollination and control of animal populations, in this study we assessed the relationships between phyllostomid occurrence and the variation in local and landscape level habitat attributes caused by disturbance. We mist-netted phyllostomids in 12 sites representing 4 successional stages of a tropical dry forest (initial, early, intermediate and late). We also quantitatively characterized the habitat attributes at the local (vegetation structure complexity) and the landscape level (forest cover, area and diversity of patches). Two focal scales were considered for landscape characterization: 500 and 1000 m. During 142 sampling nights, we captured 606 individuals representing 15 species and 4 broad guilds. Variation in phyllostomid assemblages, ensembles and populations was associated with variation in local and landscape habitat attributes, and this association was scale-dependent. Specifically, we found a marked guild-specific response, where the abundance of nectarivores tended to be negatively associated with the mean area of dry forest patches, while the abundance of frugivores was positively associated with the percentage of riparian forest. These results are explained by the prevalence of chiropterophilic species in the dry forest and of chiropterochorous species in the riparian forest. Our results indicate that different vegetation classes, as well as a multi-spatial scale approach must be considered for evaluating bat response to variation in landscape attributes. Moreover, for the long-term conservation of phyllostomids in anthropogenic landscapes, we must realize that the management of the habitat at the landscape level is as important as the conservation of particular forest fragments. © 2012 Avila-Cabadilla et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859968483

Se can be biotransferred throughout the food web, but few studies have examined its effects on the insects that feed on Se-accumulating plants, particularly pollinators. In laboratory bioassays, we used proboscis extension reflex (PER) and taste perception to determine if the presence of Se affected the gustatory response of honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) foragers. Antennae and proboscises were stimulated with both organic (selenomethionine) and inorganic (selenate) forms of Se that commonly occur in Se-accumulating plants. Methionine was also tested. Each compound was dissolved in 1 M sucrose at 5 concentrations, with sucrose alone as a control. Antennal stimulation with selenomethionine and methionine reduced PER at higher concentrations. Selenate did not reduce gustatory behaviors. Two hours after being fed the treatments, bees were tested for sucrose response threshold. Bees fed selenate responded less to sucrose stimulation. Mortality was higher in bees chronically dosed with selenate compared with a single dose. Selenomethionine did not increase mortality except at the highest concentration. Methionine did not significantly impact survival. Our study has shown that bees fed selenate were less responsive to sucrose, which may lead to a reduction in incoming floral resources needed to support coworkers and larvae in the field. If honey bees forage on nectar containing Se (particularly selenate), reductions in population numbers may occur due to direct toxicity. Given that honey bees are willing to consume food resources containing Se and may not avoid Se compounds in the plant tissues on which they are foraging, they may suffer similar adverse effects as seen in other insect guilds. © 2012 Hladun et al.

Current climate change has already altered global plant phenology and distribution, and projected increases in temperature pose a significant challenge to agriculture. Despite the important role of temperature on plant development, the underlying pathways are unknown. It has previously been shown that thermal acceleration of flowering is dependent on the florigen, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). How this occurs is, however, not understood, because the major pathway known to upregulate FT, the photoperiod pathway, is not required for thermal acceleration of flowering. Here we demonstrate a direct mechanism by which increasing temperature causes the bHLH transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) to activate FT. Our findings provide a new understanding of how plants control their timing of reproduction in response to temperature. Flowering time is an important trait in crops as well as affecting the life cycles of pollinator species. A molecular understanding of how temperature affects flowering will be important for mitigating the effects of climate change. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Two studies were conducted for 2 years at 5 locations in Nigeria. The objective was to determine the combining ability of seven extra-early yellow-endosperm inbreds, place them into heterotic groups, identify the best testers and superior single-cross hybrids under drought, Striga infestation, optimal conditions and across environments. General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were significant for grain yield and most other traits across test environments. Mean squares for GCA were larger than those of SCA in all environments, indicating that additive gene action was more important in the inheritance of traits. Three testers (TZEEI 79, TZEEI 76 and TZEEI 63) and opposing heterotic groups (TZEEI 95, TZEEI 78, TZEEI 79), (TZEEI76, TZEEI 82) and (TZEEI 63, TZEEI 58) were identified across environments. TZEEI 79 had the highest positive GCA effects for grain yield across environments. Furthermore, TZEEI 95 × TZEEI 79 was identified as the potential single-cross tester for the development of three-way and double-cross hybrids. Results of repeatability analysis showed that the managed drought test site, IKDT, was the most repeatable even though it was not very discriminating. In contrast, ZAWW had high representativeness, discriminating ability and repeatability, indicating that it was the ideal test location. The best extra-early hybrid TZEEI 79 × TZEEI 63 under drought stress and TZEEI 82 × TZEEI 79 under Striga infestation were comparable in yield to the best open-pollinated early check. GGE biplot analysis revealed TZEEI 79 × TZEEI 76 as the highest yielding and most stable hybrid across environments.

Epipogium roseum (D.Don) Lindl. is a small saprophytic orchid that is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical Asia, Australia and Africa. The floral biology and insect visitation of E. roseum were studied in Xishuangbanna, south Yunnan Province, China. E. roseum possesses an obligate self-pollination system, in which the degenerative rostellum has lost its function as a physical barrier separating the stigma and stamens (pollinia), allowing contact between the stigmatic secretions and the pollinia during bud development. Flowers of E. roseum usually open and successfully attract insect visitors. The Asian honey bee (Apis cerana cerana) was the only visitor observed, and regularly visited flowers of E. roseum for nectar. However, these bees did not carry pollinia away after visiting the flowers due to the absence of a viscid disk in E. roseum; the results of experiments also indicated that the Asian honey bee does not contribute to fruit set in E. roseum. The visiting frequency of Asian honey bees to flowers of E. roseum varied both spatially and temporally. E. roseum does not undergo outcrossing mediated by insects and is adapted to obligate self-pollination. We suggest that this may have evolved because of the uncertainty of pollinator services associated with its saprophytic lifestyle. Our current studies do not support the hypothesis that obligate autogamy is favoured by myco-heterotrophic plants due to resource limitations. © 2012 CSIRO.",obligate autogamy; Orchidaceae; pollinator services; relic floral features; saprophyte,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859388660

It may be especially harmful to endangered and endemic plants with small populations. In this study, we quantify the effect of pollen limitation on seed production and seedling emergence in an endangered narrow endemic crucifer, Erysimum popovii. We conducted a pollen addition experiment across the entire geographic distribution of the species, and explored the effect of pollinator assemblage, plant population size and density, and other habitat variables on pollen limitation intensity in 13 populations. We supplemented flowers in 20 plants per population with allogamous pollen. To account for potential resource reallocation, we used two types of control untreated flowers: internal control flowers from the same individual as the supplemented flowers, and external control flowers from other individuals. Our results indicate that E. popovii is pollen-limited in most of the populations studied, but only through seed production, since pollen supplementation did not enhance seedling emergence. Beefly abundance was associated with among-population differences in pollen limitation intensity. Populations in which beeflies were more abundant were less pollen-limited. In contrast, the abundance of other flower visitors, such as large bees or butterflies, was not associated with pollen limitation. Annual rainfall and bare soil cover were associated with the intensity of pollen limitation across populations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Beefly; Endangered plant; Erysimum; Plant reproductive ecology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866336648

It is predominantly autogamous but cross-pollination can have several positive effects, including higher seed yield. We studied the effect of fertilization with different foliar microfertilizers on the flower density and pollen and nectar production of spring oilseed rape as well as the impact of these factors on the abundance of flower visiting bees - honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees. Field experiments were carried out in 2004 and 2005. The field consisted of 32 plots (10 m 2 each): control plots (no mineral fertilizers used), plots fertilized with the complex fertilizer OptiCrop (NPK 21-08-12 + S + Mg + B + Ca) alone and plots treated with OptiCrop and one of the six foliar microfertilizers (Mn, S, Cu, B, Mg, Mo). There were four replicates of each treatment. Flower visiting bees were counted twice a week on sunny days. Flowers were counted at the same time on an area of 1 m 2 on each plot. Nectar production by the flowers was measured in the field by inserting a 1 ?l capillary into the corolla tube of flowers isolated for 24 h. Pollen grains were counted from previously isolated flowers after dissolving the flower tissues. The density of flower visiting bees (honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees) on spring oilseed rape depended mainly on flower density. Fertilization increased not only the number of flowers but also the amount of nectar and pollen per flower. Additional foliar fertilization had no effect either on the number of flowers or the amount of pollen grains per flower. Nectar production per flower seemed to be inhibited by additional manganese. Therefore, to secure higher number of pollinators for achieving higher seed yield and other benefits deriving from crosspollination, spring oilseed rape should be given proper complex fertilization. Microfertilizers turned out to be useless in terms of increasing the number of pollinators.",Apoidea; Brassica napus L. var. oleifera; Flower density; Foliar fertilization; Nectar production; Pollen production; Spring oilseed rape,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859396531

In this study, the structure and biodiversity of fig wasp community inside syconia of F. virens Ait. var. sublanceolata were investigated based on 10 plants at two selected sites in Cangshan and Minhou town of Fuzhou. A total of 13458 fig wasps were collected from 267 syconia in different seasons. Seven fig wasp species were found, which belonged to Agaonidae, Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoryctinae, Eurytomidae, Ormyridae and Eulophidae of Chalcidoidea, respectively. Among them, only Platyscapa coronata of Agaonidae served as a pollinating agent for F. virens Ait. var. sublanceolata through a way of active pollination. Male polymorphism was common in the non-pollinating fig wasps. Both pollinating and non-pollinating fig wasps showed female-biased sex ratios. The sex ratio of pollinating fig wasps was 0. 19±0. 07, and the sex ratios of non-pollinating fig wasps Camarothorax bismasculinus, Walkerella sp., Sycoscapter sp. and Sycophila sp. were 0. 36±0. 10, 0. 36±0. 22, 0. 31±0. 22 and 0. 35±0. 13, respectively. Male polymorphism may be one of the reasons for the increase of sex ratio in the non-pollinating wasps. According to the number and continuity of occurrence, fig wasps could be classified into common species and occasional species. Platyscapa coronata, Camarothorax bismasculinus, Walkerella sp., Sycoscapter sp. and Sycophila sp. were common species, while Omyrus sp. and Aprostocetus sp. were occasional species. The presence of occasional species had little effect on the number of common species. Occasional species might use the unsaturated part of the resources in the fig fruit. It might also be that the fig fruit reserved space and resources for the occurrence of the occasional species. It was the first time that a certain number of Eulophidae parasitic insects were found in fig fruits. This provides the basic data for the taxonomy and the research of biological and ecological characteristics of Eulophidae insect. The wasp community composition and structure differed greatly across seasons. In winter and spring (from December to May of next year), there were more species and higher numbers of fig wasps inside syconia, among which pollinating fig wasps were the dominant species with an importance index up to 0. 42. This resulted in a high setting rate of fig seeds. In summer and autumn (from June to November), there were fewer species and lower numbers of fig wasps inside syconia, among which Camarothorax bismasculinus and Sycophila sp. were dominant species with importance indexes up to 0. 56 and 0. 28, respectively, whereas the importance indexes of pollinating wasps was only 0. 025. During this period, it was difficult to find pollinating wasps in the fig. Therefore, the setting rate of fig seeds was lower. The large proportion of nonpollinating had a great negative impact on the reproduction of Ficus virens Ait. var. sublanceolata. Rain and high temperature might be the main causes of the dramatic decrease of the number of pollinating fig wasps inside syconia during the summer and autumn seasons. There were no significant differences in community structure and its annual change between the two sites. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for the urban greening and biodiversity conservation in tropical rain forests.",Community structure; Diversity; Ficus virens var. sublanceolata; Importance index; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859302384

China is the 2 nd economic entity in the world and faces even more challenge. Heavy metals are naturally found in soils and rock formations but may also occur in fertilizers and pesticides, as a result of which may cause heavy-metal contamination. The global rate of heavy metal pollution is rapidly increasing in various habitats, heavy metals such as Cadmium (Cd) are one of the most fundamental causes of soil and water pollution in industrialized and developing countries. Metal pollution is a serious environmental problem worldwide, and severely threatens biological diversity and human health. Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal that accumulates in the environment and causes pollution as well as intoxication of both vertebrates and invertebrates. Cd biomagnification in the terrestrial food chain appears to be dependent on the physiological properties of the organisms rather than on their trophic level. Although high Cd body burdens in spiders from the field have been reported many times, experimental verification of the key factors that determine the rate of cadmium accumulation is lacking. Metals can accumulate in plants, and via food webs can cause harmful effects to herbivorous and pollinating insects and their predators, among other members of the biota. Biological indicator species are species that can be measured as surrogates for environmental health and levels of pollution before adverse environmental impacts become obvious. spiders are exposed to environmental pollutants, growth and reproduction can be sharply reduced due to an increased detoxification effort. Spiders, at the individual level, have great potential as biological indicators of metal contamination in soil, because of their position in the food web and consequent biological magnification. Spiders occupy an important part of the predatory arthropod fauna in terrestrial ecosystems. They also play a large role in the regulation of pest species in agriculture. Wolf spiders are generalist predators of other terrestrial invertebrates. The wolf spider Pirata subpiraticus (Araneae,Lycosidae) is a common, surface-active wolf spider that inhabits very wet places and can be used as a very important bio-indicator for heavy metals pollution. Here, we investigated the cadmium assimilation rate in the common wolf spider Pirata subpiraticus for three generations fed by Drosophila melanogaster reared on artificial diets with 20 mg/ kg. In addition, biological response traits of P. subpiraticus to adapt to heavy metal polluted diets was tested experimentally. It was demonstrated that a high cadmium assimilation (65. 4%,68. 5% and 69. 1%) and an excretion rate approaching zero resulted in high Cd concentration factors in P. subpiraticus for three generations. Cd biomagnification fators were 1. 71, 2. 12 and 2. 17, respectively. The results indicate the importance of spiders in cadmium biomagnification along critical pathways. Furthermore, Our results illustrate that P. subpiraticus responds behaviorally to the presence of high concentrations of heavy metals in food. The results also indicate the metal-selected P. subpiraticus have a significantly lower width of carapace, survival rate, cocoon weight and egg number. And P. subpiraticus also exhibit behaviors resulting in extended total duration, increased egg volume and decreased tolerance starvation life span. Our results suggest that although P. subpiraticus displays the potential to develop tolerance to heavy metals, particularly Cadmium, this may occur at a significant biological cost, which can adversely affect its ecological fitness. From these observations, we speculate that P. subpiraticus avoidance behavior towards high concentrations of heavy metals may have a positive effect on their survival and reproductive success in nature, particularly in the presence of metalcontaminated food sources. P. subpiraticus can be employed as a specific indicator for metal exposure, and also for the valuation of chronic effects of metals in foodchains after long-term exposure. The results might provide more adequate theoretical basis insight into Cd along the soil-insects-predators transmission, biomagnification and physiological tolerance.",Accumulation; Biomagnification; Cadmium; Development duration; Elimination; Pirata subpiraticus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859323247

As a self-pollinated diploid with a small estimated genome size of ~370 Mb, flax is well suited for fast progress in genomics. In the last few years, important genetic resources have been developed for this crop. Here, we describe the assessment and comparative analyses of 1,506 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) of which, 1,164 were derived from BAC-end sequences (BESs) and 342 from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The SSRs were assessed on a panel of 16 flax accessions with 673 (58 %) and 145 (42 %) primer pairs being polymorphic in the BESs and ESTs, respectively. With 818 novel polymorphic SSR primer pairs reported in this study, the repertoire of available SSRs in flax has more than doubled from the combined total of 508 of all previous reports. Among nucleotide motifs, trinucleotides were the most abundant irrespective of the class, but dinucleotides were the most polymorphic. SSR length was also positively correlated with polymorphism.

Plants are self-incompatible; they cannot reproduce sexually unless pollinators move pollen between flowers of different genets. We found no evidence that: seed production was limited by inadequate pollination or that pollinations between near neighbor plants (inbreeding depression) or between distant plants (outbreeding depression) resulted in reduced fruit or seed set. Examples are given of the potentially devastating effect of grazing on fruit and seed production. Preliminary evidence suggests that P. obcordata can hybridize with its common congener, P. acutifolia. Only crosses with P. obcordata as pollen recipient and P. acutifolia as pollen donor seemed fertile. Primary flower-visitors of P. obcordata are ground-nesting native bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae. Most species visiting the flowers of P. obcordata are generalists. Only two bee species were likely mustard specialists. The only non-bee visitor of any import was a dipteran, Gonia (Tachinidae). Predictions of the distances flown by common bee visitors were made using the equations of Greenleaf et al. (2007). No bee is likely to travel more than 1 km from its nesting site to visit P. obcordata flowers and most are likely to fly distances that are significantly less. The implications of flight range estimates for gene flow between Physaria populations and for pollinator protection are discussed. Several recommendations are made for conservation of P. obcordata and its attendant bees.",breeding system; native bees; pollination; pollinator limitation; rare plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863655611

In this study, we used eight microsatellite markers to investigate mating systems at two hierarchical levels (fruits within individuals and individuals within populations) for the insect pollinated Neotropical tree Tabebuia roseo-alba. We found that T. roseo-alba has a mixed mating system with predominantly outcrossed mating. The outcrossing rates at the population level were similar across two T. roseo-alba populations; however, the rates varied considerably among individuals within populations. The correlated paternity results at different hierarchical levels showed that there is a high probability of shared paternal parentage when comparing seeds within fruits and among fruits within plants and full-sibs occur in much higher proportion within fruits than among fruits. Significant levels of fixation index were found in both populations and biparental inbreeding is believed to be the main cause of the observed inbreeding. The number of pollen donors contributing to mating was low. Furthermore, open-pollinated seeds varied according to relatedness, including half-sibs, full-sibs, self-sibs and self-half-sibs. In both populations, the effective population size within a family (seed-tree and its offspring) was lower than expected for panmictic populations. Thus, seeds for ex situ conservation genetics, progeny tests and reforestation must be collected from a large number of seed-trees to guarantee an adequate effective population in the sample. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Effective population size; Forest fragmentation; Microsatellite loci; Paternity correlation; Tabebuia; Tropical trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858009260

When flower visitors alternate between two species of flower, heterospecific pollen transfer takes place. The impact of these mixed loads on the female reproductive success of a recipient has received considerable attention, but the concomitant loss of male reproductive success - because of pollens grains being lost to foreign stigmas - has received less. Furthermore, pollen losses are not limited to grains that land on stigmas, but can also include deposition on non-stigmatic surfaces of the intervening flowers, or loss from the animal's body through passive detachment or active grooming. We collectively term these losses because of competition 'pollen misplacement'. Here, we quantify pollen transferred by nectar bats between focal flowers (Aphelandra acanthus) with and without intervening visits to one of two competitor species. One competitor (Centropogon nigricans) places its pollen in the same region of bats' heads as the focal species, while the other (Burmeistera sodiroana) places its pollen farther forward. We found that (i) any intervening visit caused some reduction in the number of pollen grains transferred, (ii) competitor flowers with similar pollen-placement locations caused greater reductions in pollen transfer and (iii) of these competitors, those in male phase (dispensing pollen) caused greater pollen loss than those in female phase (without pollen). This study provides rare empirical support for the detrimental effects of competition for pollination on male fitness via pollen misplacement and is the first to show an added cost imposed by male-phase competitors. Although this competition is especially strong when competitors overlap in pollen placement, diverging in pollen placement will not completely eliminate pollen loss during visits to foreign flowers, simply because pollen sheds or is groomed from pollinator's bodies at some background rate over time. This suggests that any angiosperms that share pollinators face pervasive selection through male fitness to diverge in floral traits, alleviating competition by attracting different pollinators, altering floral phenology or encouraging floral constancy. © 2012 The Authors.

Though longevity varies substantially among angiosperm species, longer flower longevities may be a selective advantage under unpredictable or scarce pollination activity. This study examined this hypothesis in Narcissus serotinus L. (Amaryllidaceae), a small Mediterranean geophyte that blooms during the autumnal rainy season. Field experiments performed in three natural populations through 3 consecutive years shows that N. serotinus has the ability to expand flower longevity when pollination has not occurred. Flowers that were open longer to pollination have higher reproductive fitness than younger flowers. As N. serotinus flowers age, there was a shift in pollination patterns since flower visits by butterflies became scarcer and are replaced by one small pollen beetle. Given that there was evidence of pollen limitation and that this species produces one single flower, we suggest that extended flower longevity is selected because it assures pollination success under scarce insect visits.",Autumnal pollination; Flower longevity; Narcissus serotinus; Pollen limitation; Reproductive fitness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860206510

Speculating that it was caused by inadequate partial pollination, we devised an appropriate model. We artificially pollinated one out of five pistils of apple gynoecium, and then investigated the correlations among inadequate partial pollination, seed number, distribution, and fruit shape.It was speculated that a decrease in seed number and an increase in the rate of lopsidedness were caused by inadequate partial pollination. A deviation in seed distribution was also a factor in the occurrence of lopsided fruits. Since many of the main pollinator Osmia cornifrons visited a flower repeatedly at an orchard consisting of a single cultivar and pollinizers, we analyzed the effect of repeated pollination on increasing and improving seed number in fruits and fruit shape, respectively, using artificial pollination of a pollinizer and cultivars with various S-genotypes. Repeated pollination at 24-h intervals did not contribute to fertilization, but those at 4-h intervals contributed significantly as pollen parents of seeds in fruits. The ability of pistil fertilization was maintained until four days after flowering regardless of pollination, but once fertilization occurred, this pistil was not considered to contribute to seed production 24. h after initial pollination. Those results suggested that pollinizers in full bloom be shifted more than a day seemed unnecessary at an orchard with single commercial cultivar, and repeated artificial pollination must be done within one day. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Lopsided fruits; Malus×domestica; Pollinizer; S-RNase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857220453

Although most crab spiders (Thomisidae) are known by their ability to change colour in order to match the background, a few use a different strategy. They are UV-reflective, creating a colour contrast against UV-absorbing flowers that is attractive for pollinators. The nature of the relationship between colour contrast and foraging success is unknown, as is how spiders trade off the potential costs and benefits of strong colour contrast. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between spider colouration, foraging success and background colouration in a crab spider species known to lure pollinators via UV reflectance (Thomisus spectabilis). Field data revealed that spider body condition - a proxy of past foraging success - is positively related to overall colour contrast. We experimentally tested the effect of satiation and background colour on spider colour change. Throughout the experiment, spiders changed their colour contrast regardless of their food intake, suggesting that colour contrast and the UV component contributing to overall contrast are not caused by spider condition. Although spiders responded to different backgrounds by subtly changing their body colour, this did not result in colour matching. We believe that the observed variation in colour contrast and hence conspicuousness in the field, coupled with the spiders' reaction to our manipulation, could be the result of plasticity in response to prey. © 2012.

Colonies of Russian honey bees (RHB) and outcrossed bees with Varroa-sensitive hygiene (VSH) were managed without miticide treatments and compared with colonies of Italian honey bees that served as controls. Control colonies were managed as groups which either were treated twice each year against V. destructor (CT) or kept untreated (CU). Totals of 240 and 247 colonies were established initially for trials in 2008 and 2009, respectively. RHB and VSH colonies generally had adult and brood populations similar to those of the standard CT group regarding pollination requirements. For pollination of almonds [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb] in February, percentages of colonies meeting the required six or more frames of adult bees were 57% (VSH), 56% (CT), 39% (RHB), and 34% (CU). RHB are known to have small colonies in early spring, but this can be overcome with appropriate feeding. For later pollination requirements in May to July, 94100% of colonies in the four groups met pollination size requirements for apples (Malus domestica Borkh.), cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton), and lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton). Infestations with V. destructor usually were lowest in CT colonies and tended to be lower in VSH colonies than in RHB and CU colonies. This study demonstrates that bees with the VSH trait and pure RHB offer alternatives for beekeepers to use for commercial crop pollination while reducing reliance on miticides. The high frequency of queen loss (only approximately one fourth of original queens survived each year) suggests that frequent requeening is necessary to maintain desired genetics. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.",Apis mellifera; crop pollination; genetic resistance; migratory beekeeping; Varroa destructor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859613299

The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success - plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services. © 2011 The Authors.

In contrast to Europe and North America, ice-sheets did not cover most of China during glacial periods, and the effects of glacial cycles were less dramatic. Fig trees are a predominantly tropical group pollinated by host-specific fig wasps. We employed partial mitochondrial COI (918 bp) and nuclear ITS2 (462 bp) gene sequences to investigate the genetic structure and demographic histories of the wasps that pollinate the subtropical Ficus pumila var. pumila in Southeastern China. Deep genetic divergence in both mitochondrial (7.2-11.6%) and nuclear genes (1.6-2.9%) indicates that three pollinator species are present and that they diverged about 4.72 and 6.00 Myr bp. This predates the Quaternary ice ages, but corresponds with the formation of the Taiwan Strait and uplifting of the Wuyi-Xianxia Mountains. The three pollinators have largely allopatric distribution patterns in China and display different postglacial demographic histories. Wiebesia spp. 1 and 2 occupy, respectively, the northern and southern regions of the mainland host range. Their populations both underwent significant postglacial spatial expansions, but at different times and at different rates. Wiebesia sp. 3 is largely restricted to northern islands and shows less evidence of recent population expansion. Their mainly allopatric distributions and different demographic histories are consistent with host plant postglacial expansion from three distinct refugia and suggest one mechanism whereby fig trees gain multiple pollinators. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",co-evolution; demographic history; Ficus pumila; fig wasp; glacial refugium; phylogeography; Wiebesia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862804146

The microsporidian pathogens Nosema apis, Nosema ceranae and Nosema bombi may in fact be major candidates contributing to this decline. Different molecular and non-molecular detection methods have been developed; however, a comparison, especially of the highly sensitive PCR based methods, is currently lacking. Here, we present the first comparative quantitative real-time PCR study of nine Nosema spp. primers within the framework of primer specificity and sensitivity. With the help of dilution series of defined numbers of spores, we reveal six primer pairs amplifying N. apis, six for N. bombi and four for N. ceranae. All appropriate primer pairs detected an amount of at least 104 spores, the majority of which were even as sensitive to detect such low amounts as 103 to ten spores. Species specificity of primers was observed for N. apis and N. bombi, but not for N. ceranae. Additionally, we did not find any significant correlation for the amplified fragments with PCR efficiency or the limit of detection. We discuss our findings on the background of false positive and negative results using quantitative realtime PCR. On the basis of these results, future research might be based on appropriate primer selection depending on the experimental needs. Primers may be selected on the basis of specificity or sensitivity.

This method was used to cross female adults of A. auriculiformis with males of A. mangium, with intraspecific pollination of A. auriculiformis conducted as the control. In this method, pollen was first collected by inserting a tube into spikes of male adults immediately after flowering. The tube was then stored at -18 °C for either one day, one month or two months. The germination rate of A. mangium pollen was 17% following storage for one day but increased to greater than 40% following storage for one or two months. In contrast, the germination rate of A. auriculiformis pollen exceeded 40% regardless of the storage duration. Artificial pollination was conducted by inserting the stored tube with pollen into flowering spikes of A. auriculiformis. Results of interspecific pollination showed that an average of three hybrid seedlings was acquired per pollination using pollen stored for one day, and was greater than five when pollen stored for one or two months was used. However, DNA analysis revealed that 2.6% of seedlings were contaminated by A. auriculiformis. In contrast, less than three seedlings were acquired per intraspecific pollination regardless of the duration of pollen storage. These results suggest that this tube method is a suitable procedure for the establishment of A. auriculiformis hybrids using stored pollen. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.",Acacia mangium; Artificial pollination; Germination; Mature seed; Seedling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859905486

Competitive interactions are expected when plants flower en-masse and availability of pollinators is limited. We tested this prediction using Lapeirousia oreogena, a mass-flowering South African iris that is pollinated by a single species of long-proboscid fly. Controlled hand-pollination experiments showed that L. oreogena is self-compatible, but reliant on pollinator visits for seed set. Seed production per flower showed a significant negative relationship with patch size (and the correlated measure of number of individuals per patch), but was not affected by flower density or distance to neighbouring patches. There was a tendency for fly abundance to increase with patch size, but the rate of visits to individual flowers by flies was not affected by patch size. Seed set of hand-pollinated flowers did not differ for plants in and out of dense patches, indicating that the large differences in seed set among patches were likely to reflect pollinator visits, rather than the genetic or physiological capacity of plants to produce seeds. The reduced fecundity of L. oreogena in large patches with a greater numbers of flowers is consistent with the idea that plants with highly specialized pollination systems can experience intra-specific competition for pollination. © 2011 The Authors.

However, when ants serve as reliable pollen vectors, for example in harsh, windy habitats, were flying insects are less active, plants should have evolved floral signals to attract them to the flowers. We tested this hypothesis in the alpine orchid, Chamorchis alpina. C. alpina was found to be predominantly ant pollinated, with some occasional pollination by ichneumonid wasps. In all three investigated populations, only two species of ants, Formica lemani and Leptothorax acervorum visited the flowers and removed pollinaria. These two pollinator ants were found to be among the most common ant species in all habitats, but other, non-pollinating ants were also frequently found, suggesting a factor that mediates specific pollination. Floral morphology was found to be compatible with at least one of the common non-pollinator ants. Floral scent consistently comprised five terpenoid compounds, ?-phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, linalool, ?-terpineol, and ?-caryophyllene. A synthetic blend of these five compounds emitting from rubber septa, was found to be attractive to one pollinator ant-species, F. lemani, in the field. The floral scent of C. alpina, through attracting only specific ants, may thus play a role in filtering floral visitors. © 2011 Swiss Botanical Society.",Floral evolution; Floral filter; Floral VOC; Formicidae; Orchidaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859910972

Although existing evidence supports this assumption for the effect of animals on plants, no studies have evaluated it for the reciprocal effect of plants on animals. We evaluate this assumption using data on the reproductive effects of pollinators on plants and the reciprocal reproductive effects of plants on pollinators. The magnitude of species impacts of plants on pollinators, the reciprocal impacts of pollinators on plants, and their asymmetry were well predicted by interaction frequency. However, interaction strength was a key determinant of the sign of species impacts. These results underscore the importance of quantifying interaction strength in studies of mutualistic networks. We also show that the distributions of interaction strengths and species impacts are highly skewed, with few strong and many weak interactions. This skewed distribution matches the pattern observed in food webs, suggesting that the community-wide organization of species interactions is fundamentally similar between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Our results have profound ecological implications, given the key role of interaction strength for community stability. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Asymmetry; Ecological networks; Interaction frequency; Interaction strength; Monte desert; Mutualism; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollination; Species impact,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861386194

The role of nectar in attracting pollinators has been extensively studied, but its effects on floral antagonists are less understood. Furthermore, the composition of non-sugar nectar components, such as secondary compounds, may affect plant reproduction via changes in both pollinator and floral antagonist behavior. We manipulated the nectar alkaloid gelsemine in wild plants of the native perennial vine Gelsemium sempervirens. We crossed nectar gelsemine manipulations with a hand-pollination treatment, allowing us to determine the effect of both the trait and the interaction on plant female reproduction. We measured pollen deposition, pollen removal, and nectar robbing to assess whether gelsemine altered the behavior of mutualists and antagonists. High nectar gelsemine reduced conspecific pollen receipt by nearly half and also reduced the proportion of conspecific pollen grains received, but had no effect on nectar robbing. Although high nectar gelsemine reduced pollen removal, an estimate of male reproduction, by one-third, this effect was not statistically significant. Fruit set was limited by pollen receipt. However, this effect varied across sites such that the sites that were most pollen-limited were also the sites where nectar alkaloids had the least effect on pollen receipt, resulting in no significant effect of nectar alkaloids on fruit set. Finally, high nectar gelsemine significantly reduced seed weight; however, this effect was mediated by a mechanism other than pollen limitation. Taken together, our work suggests that nectar alkaloids are more costly than beneficial in our system, and that relatively small-scale spatial variation in trait effects and interactions could determine the selective impacts of traits such as nectar composition. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Floral evolution; Gelsemine; Nectar robbing; Pollination; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858005772

Various aspects of the floral and reproductive biology of two groups of individuals, which occur on the edge of gallery forests on the Panga stream (in Uberlândia, southeastern Brazil), were studied. Observations were carried out during the flowering season of 1999. Cuphea melvilla is a shrub with floral features adapted to hummingbird pollination. It has a long flowering period, from January to July, but flowers the most during the rainy season. The flower tube of this species is of hypanthial origin, has a spur at the base, and accumulates nectar, which is produced by a nectary at the base of the ovary. The flowers were protandrous but different floral phases were present from the top to the bottom of the simple racemes. The species appears to be self-compatible but non-apomictic and needs active pollination to form fruits. Pheathornis pretrei, Amazilia fimbriata, Thalurania furcata, Eupetomena macroura and Chlorostilbon lucidus (female) were the hummingbird species observed visiting and pollinating the C. melvilla flowers. Amazilia fimbriata and C. lucidus showed occasional territorial behaviour in relation to the C. melvilla populations, whereas P. pretrei seemed to be trapliner. Thalurania furcata and E. macroura visited the studied populations sporadically. Amazilia fimbriata, C. lucidus and P. pretrei were considered the main pollinators for the studied populations due to their frequency. The flower features of Cuphea melvilla that are related to hummingbird pollination appear to be derived within the genus, and bird pollination, within different sections of the genus, indicate a convergent adaptation.",Cerrado; Dichogamy; Hummingbirds; Pollination; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864026954

Unfortunately, whilst this field has rapidly expanded community ecology, it rarely includes other trophic levels such as insects and pollinators. Here, we combine facilitation, pollination, and reciprocity measures to explore the general hypothesis that sexual dimorphism in a benefactor plant species mediates its impact. The following three predictions were tested and supported using the gynodioecious alpine cushion plant Silene acaulis (L.) Jacq.: (i) that the trait set of a gynodioecious benefactor plant varies between genders; (ii) that dimorphism changes the facilitation of other plants, arthropods, and pollinators; and (iii) that insect selectivity, particularly pollinators, reciprocally impacts the reproductive output of the two genders. Female S. acaulis cushion plants produced significantly more flowers but they were smaller than those of hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodite cushions facilitated other plant species and pollinators more effectively than females, whilst females strongly facilitated more arthropods. Finally, female plants have significantly higher reproductive output as estimated by fruit and seed production, and this was directly related to visitation rate by pollinators. Hence, this study clearly establishes the value of combining some of the common themes of pollination biology such as sexual dimorphism, floral morphology, and measuring reproduction with the study of positive plant- plant interactions.",Alpine; Cushion plant; Facilitation; Gender; Gynodioecy; Pollinators; Reciprocity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860205079

Altered phenologies have caused concern that species could suffer population declines if they flower at times when effective pollinators are unavailable. For two perennial wildflowers, Tradescantia ohiensis and Asclepias incarnata, we used an experimental approach to explore how changing phenology affects the taxonomic composition of the pollinator assemblage and the effectiveness of individual pollinator taxa. After finding in the previous year that fruit set varied with flowering time, we manipulated flowering onset in greenhouses, placed plants in the field over the span of five weeks, and measured pollinator effectiveness as the number of seeds produced after a single visit to a flower. The average effectiveness of pollinators and the expected rates of pollination success were lower for plants of both species flowering earlier than for plants flowering at historical times, suggesting there could be reproductive costs to earlier flowering. Whereas for A. incarnata, differences in average seed set among weeks were due primarily to changes in the composition of the pollinator assemblage, the differences for T. ohiensis were driven by the combined effects of compositional changes and increases over time in the effectiveness of some pollinator taxa. Both species face the possibility of temporal mismatch between the availability of the most effective pollinators and the onset of flowering, and changes in the effectiveness of individual pollinator taxa through time may add an unexpected element to the reproductive consequences of such mismatches. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Asclepias incarnata; Climate change; Flowering phenology; Mismatch; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollination; Pollinator effectiveness; Seed set; Tradescantia ohiensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861400028

Box 7044, 750 07 Uppsala, Sweden","Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than elsewhere, and is predicted to have a large impact on biodiversity, since entire cold-adapted ecosystems are likely to disappear. Here, we highlight changes in the insect species richness and community composition of wild bees, butterflies and moths over 60 years in an area situated above the tree limit (Padjelanta National Park) in northern Sweden. Although there were changes in habitat availability, indicated by a significant decrease in the area of a glacier (from 22 km 2 in 1898 to 7.5 km 2 in 2009), and an increase in the area of birch forest in the National Park, we nevertheless found relatively moderate changes in the insect communities. Indeed, the observed number of species increased from 52 in 1944 to 64 in 2008. Remarkably, the mean number of butterflies and moths per site, but not wild bee species, increased significantly. Among the species that were recorded in both periods, the average altitude of 17 species had shifted downhill, 12 shifted uphill, and the altitude of the remaining 17 had not changed. While alterations in community composition were greater at the highest altitudes, changes in the insect community were smaller than expected, indeed much smaller than those reported from agricultural landscapes in North-West Europe. Interestingly, our results suggest that lower alpine altitudes (600-800 m a. s. l.) have become colonized by southern species, but also that high alpine areas (above 1,000 m a. s. l.) have recently become colonized by high alpine species previously absent from these sites, likely as a result of increasing habitat availability. We conclude that wild bee, butterfly, and moth communities in Arctic areas in northern Sweden are in flux, as a result of climate change and suggest that increased attention must be given to conservation planning in cold areas. In addition, we propose that monitoring programs should be established, because more pronounced climate-driven changes can be expected in the future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Alpine; Bumble bees; Butterflies; Climate change; Moths; Padjelanta National Park,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858150796

A single controlled pollination procedure results in low yield of fully filled pine nuts, and pollination at later development stages of the female strobilus results in high yields of fully filled pine nuts per pine cone. Controlled pollination in A. angustifolia proved effective for pine nut production and its application in oriented breeding procedures will enable breeding that up until now was considered impossible in nature on account of the considerable distance between the parent plants.

However, some cultivars of the 'Brasília' group have important genetic disorders with negative impacts on the visual, sensorial, and nutritional quality of the roots. 'BRS Planalto' is a new open pollinated cultivar released by the Embrapa Vegetable Crops breeding program, aiming to minimize much of these problems. 'BRS Planalto' was developed after 18 cycles of recurrent selection based upon the performance of half-sib progenies using the cultivar Brasília as the basic germplasm. Evaluations were carried out in each selection cycle for a set of phenotypic traits using two replications (1 m2 plots) with about 100 roots per plot of each half-sib family. 'BRS Planalto' has a darker orange root color when compared to 'Brasília' due to the higher accumulation of the carotenoid pigments ?-carotene and ?-carotene (vitamin A precursors). In addition, 'BRS Planalto' displays uniform xylem and phloem color and low incidence of precocious bolting during the warm season. 'BRS Planalto' has lower green and purple root shoulder incidences as well as lower frequency of white halo in the root tissue when compared to 'Brasília'. 'BRS Planalto' has also a more uniform root pattern (shape and size) when compared to other cultivars of the 'Brasília' group. 'BRS Planalto' is adapted to both conventional and organic crop systems and presents a very high yield potential.

Vegetative and reproductive phenological observations (leaf fall, leaf flushing, flowering, and fruiting) were made on a monthly basis among a group of 10 individuals. The floral biology patterns observed included: anthesis, duration of the flowers, stigma receptivity, pollen viability, and the presence of osmophores and pigments that reflect UV light. Reproductive mechanisms were examined by testing manual and natural self-pollination as well as cross-pollination. Visitors and pollinators were identified, and the time, duration, and frequency of their visitation, as well as their behavior, were noted. Senna cana is an episodic evergreen species showing seasonal and highly synchronous reproductive events (intermediate flowering after a rainy period, and long fruiting during the dry period).

The self-incompatibility and maximization of fruit production through cross-pollination represent reproductive mechanisms favored by the phenological strategies and the pollination syndrome demonstrated by this species.",Fabaceae; Melittophily; Seasonality; Synchrony,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864062499

Trees may be more resilient to fragmentation effects due to potential long-distance dispersal mechanisms that genetically connect fragments. Polylepis woodlands in the high Andes are highly fragmented and are currently the focus of reforestation and conservation efforts. Polylepis multijuga Plige (Rosaceae) is a threatened, endemic tree species in the northern Andes of Peru. Samples were collected from 371 adult trees in nine forest fragments separated by 0. 5-80 km and genotyped at amplified fragment length polymorphism loci (AFLP) and chloroplast intergenic regions to determine the connectedness of fragments and their suitability for collecting seed for restoration efforts. P. multijuga is wind-pollinated and dispersed; however, genetic diversity in P. multijuga was about half that reported for other wind-pollinated species. Genetic spatial autocorrelation and patterns of chloroplast and AFLP diversity suggest seed dispersal is very limited and that wind dispersed pollen does not effectively connect all fragments. Conservation of this species will require reforestation efforts and possibly augmentation of some fragments to increase their genetic diversity. Collecting seed from multiple large fragments and from individuals separated by at least 25 m within fragments would maximize the genetic diversity of seed collections for reforestation or augmentation. Future studies of this and other Polylepis species should determine how complex topography may affect wind mediated dispersal between fragments and patterns of genetic diversity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",AFLPs; Chloroplast; Forest fragmentation; Montane; Polylepis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858003907

For Nothofagus obliqua (Mirb.) Oerst. and Nothofagus nervosa (Phil.) Krasser, the production of flowers and viable seeds were compared among axes of contrasting size and category in the tree crown. For annual shoots arising from three axis categories (main branches, secondary branches, and twigs), the numbers of nodes, staminate flowers, pistillate flowers and axillary buds, and seed viability were evaluated. Most flowering shoots produced both staminate and pistillate flowers. The number of flowers of each type was related positively with the number of nodes of the shoot. Longer shoots had proportionally more pistillate flowers than short shoots. The three axis categories produced both flower types in direct proportion to the size of their shoots, but main branches presented more axillary vegetative buds than secondary branches and twigs. For N. obliqua, the percentage of viable seeds was lower in secondary branches than in main branches and twigs, perhaps owing to a lower probability of cross-pollination in secondary branches. The coexistence of vegetative and reproductive functions may cause interference between them.

Salsola kali and Chenopodium album are considered the main species responsible; however, there is a discrepancy between the pollination period of these two plants and clinical symptoms. The objectives of this study were to identify new Chenopodiaceae/ Amaranthaceae members with sensitization capacity and to correlate symptoms, pollen counts and degree of flowering of different species. Methods: A total of 37 individuals monosensitized to S. kali and C. album were included in the study. All patients recorded daily symptom scores between May and October 2007. Extracts from Chenopodium (album, vulvaria and murale), Salsola (kali, vermiculata, and oppositifolia), Bassia scoparia, Atriplex (patula and halimus) and Amaranthus (deflexus and muricatus) were manufactured and used in skin prick tests (SPTs). Protein content and IgE binding were assessed for each extract. Pollen counts and degree of flowering (based on the Orshan specific semiquantitative method) were assessed weekly. Results: Symptom scores demonstrated a positive correlation with pollen counts even outside the pollination period of S. kali. Positive SPTs were obtained with all 11 species tested, which showed common proteins with IgE-binding capacity. Different species flowered at different times during the pollen season. Conclusion: Different taxonomically related species of Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae can induce allergic sensitization and should be considered for use in diagnosis and treatment. Degree of flowering is a complementary method for assessing pollination that could be used for botanical families with indistinguishable pollen grains. Copyright © 2011 S.

'NC-Sunshine' is a new monoecious slicing hybrid cucumber with a high percentage of pistillate nodes. Because of the high percentage of pistillate nodes, a pollenizer might be required to maximize pollination to get high total and early yield. Hence, an experiment was conducted at three locations to evaluate the effect of the pollenizer 'Poinsett 76' on yield of 'NC-Sunshine' compared with no pollenizer 'Gray Zucchini' squash (Cucurbita pepo). Differences (P ? 0.05) due to pollenizer, location, and the interaction of pollenizer and location on 'NC-Sunshine' yield traits were detected. Pollenizer influenced cucumber yield at two of three locations. Results indicated that the pollenizer 'Poinsett 76' significantly increased total, marketable, and early yield of 'NC-Sunshine'. The percentage of early and marketable yield was also higher with the pollenizer 'Poinsett 76'. In addition, the use of a pollenizer decreased cull yield.

Population persistence in fragmented areas depends on dispersal potential and maintenance of gene flow among fragments of habitat. Here we used population genetic techniques to characterize, for two equally abundant orchid bee species that differ in their physiology and ecology, levels of genetic differentiation among fragments of tropical forest in southeastern Costa Rica in a ~200 km 2 landscape. We measured population differentiation with ? PT (an analogue to the traditional summary statistic Fst), as well as two measures that may more accurately reflect the level of differentiation when highly variable loci are used: G'st and D est. We also calculated pairwise genetic distances among individuals and conducted Mantel tests to test the correlation of genetic and geographic distance, for each species. We found strong differences in genetic structure between the species. Contrary to our expectations, each measure of genetic structure revealed that the larger-bodied species, Eulaema bombiformis, had higher levels of differentiation than the smaller species, Euglossa championi. Furthermore, for Eulaema bombiformis there was a significant positive correlation of genetic and geographic distance while for Euglossa championi there was no significant positive correlation. Our results demonstrate that bee species can have strikingly different levels of gene flow in fragmented habitats, and that body size may not always act as a useful proxy for dispersal, even in closely related taxa. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Dispersal; Euglossine; Fragmentation; Genetic differentiation; Landscape; Orchid bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858006253

Differential display technique was used to study genes expressed during the female flower development, comparing styles before emergence from the bud and styles at full bloom. The fulllength cDNA clone, designated CavPrx (Corylus avellana peroxidase) and isolated in mature styles, was characterized as a sequence encoding for a 330 amino acids protein, containing all the conserved features of class III peroxidases. CavPrx resulted expressed only in styles, with a peak in mature styles pollinated with compatible pollen. Class III peroxidases are expressed in several different plant tissue types and are involved in a broad spectrum of physiological processes. Until now, four peroxidases expressed in the stigma were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and Senecio squalidus: they were assumed to be possibly involved in pollen-pistil interaction, pollen tube penetration/growth and/or in defence against pathogens.

The study area is a Brazilian National Forest in southern Brazil, established in the 1950s. Genetic analysis was investigated using nine allozyme loci. Significant and positive fixation index was detected for the adults of all studied populations. Although we observed lower levels of genetic diversity and biparental inbreeding in some populations, their pattern of mating, similar to that expected in panmixia, indicates that all populations can be used in conservation planning. Furthermore, the presence of unique alleles and the significant genetic differentiation among all adult populations (F ST = 0.404) reinforces that all populations are important conservation resources. The average paternity correlation was high in almost all populations, showing that open-pollinated families are composed of mixtures of half- and full-sibs. With regards to conservation strategies, our results suggest that seed collection from at least 133 seed trees is necessary to retain a reference effective population size of 500.

One possible explanation is that multimodal signalling ensures that at least one signal component will be transmitted effectively under varying environmental conditions (the 'efficacy backup' hypothesis). For example, by transmitting both component A and B, a signaller can communicate under environmental conditions where transmission of component A is reduced; component B 'backs up' A. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether a floral scent could back up a floral colour signal when light levels were low. We trained nectar-foraging bumblebees to discriminate rewarding and unrewarding targets that differed in colour, scent, or both colour and scent, and then presented the targets at different levels of illumination. We measured bees' accuracy at distinguishing the two targets and their rate of visits to the trained target. Performance on both measures declined under low light when targets were unscented. The presence of scent reduced the loss of accuracy under low light, supporting the efficacy backup hypothesis, but this effect depended upon the colour of the previously rewarded target. In contrast, the presence of scent did not affect the overall rate of correct visits under low light (correct visits/foraging time). A backup mechanism that maintains accuracy, but not rate of nectar collection, does not necessarily benefit the pollinator. However, it most likely benefits the plant through reduced pollen wastage. In short, multimodal floral signals may benefit the plant by improving pollen transfer, while not benefiting the pollinator. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Accuracy; Bombus impatiens; Colour; Efficacy backup hypothesis; Learning; Light intensity; Multimodal signal; Nectar foraging; Scent,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858747556

There are three fig species (Ficus boninsimae, F. nishimurae and F. iidaiana) endemic to the Ogasawara Islands, and these species have been considered to be closely related to Ficus erecta, and to have diverged within the islands. However, this hypothesis remains uncertain. To investigate this issue, we assessed the phylogenetic relationships of the Ogasawara figs and their close relatives occurring in Japan, Taiwan and South China based on six plastid genome regions, nuclear ITS region and two nuclear genes. The plastid genome-based tree indicated a close relationship between the Ogasawara figs and F. erecta, whereas some of the nuclear gene-based trees suggested this relationship was not so close. In addition, the phylogenetic analyses of the pollinating wasps associated with these fig species based on the nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial cytB genes suggested that the fig-pollinating wasps of F. erecta are not sister to those of the Ogasawara figs These results suggest the occurrence of an early hybridization event(s) in the lineage leading to the Ogasawara figs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Co-speciation; Fig wasps; Figs; Hybrids; Molecular phylogeny; Oceanic islands,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857234933

Wind pollination is often associated with unisexual flowers, but which evolved first and played a causative role in the evolution of the other is unclear. Thalictrum, meadow-rues (Ranunculaceae), provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of these traits because it contains insect and wind pollination and four sexual systems. We used a phylogenetic approach to reconstruct ancestral states for sexual system, pollination mode, and geographic distribution in Thalictrum, and tested for correlations to uncover the factors involved in the evolution of unisexuality and wind pollination. Our results show that dioecy, andro- and gynomonoecy evolved at least twice from hermaphroditism. Wind pollination, unisexual flowers, and New World distribution were all significantly correlated. Wind pollination may have evolved early in the genus, followed by multiple losses and gains, and likely preceded the origin of unisexual flowers in several cases; we found no evidence for unisexual flowers evolving prior to wind pollination. Given a broad scale study showing the evolution of dioecy before wind pollination, our results from a finer scale analysis highlight that different evolutionary pathways are likely to occur throughout angiosperms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Dioecy; ITS; Monoecy; Rpl16; Thalictrum; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857232998

To test this assumption, we conducted a meta-analysis with data on 97 woody plant species derived from 98 studies of habitat fragmentation. We measured the weighted response of four different measures of population-level genetic diversity to habitat fragmentation with Hedge's d and Spearman rank correlation. We tested whether the genetic response to habitat fragmentation was mediated by life-history traits (longevity, pollination mode, and seed dispersal vector) and study characteristics (genetic marker and plant material used). For both tests of effect size habitat fragmentation was associated with a substantial decrease in expected heterozygosity, number of alleles, and percentage of polymorphic loci, whereas the population inbreeding coefficient was not associated with these measures. The largest proportion of variation among effect sizes was explained by pollination mechanism and by the age of the tissue (progeny or adult) that was genotyped. Our primary finding was that wind-pollinated trees and shrubs appeared to be as likely to lose genetic variation as insect-pollinated species, indicating that severe habitat fragmentation may lead to pollen limitation and limited gene flow. In comparison with results of previous meta-analyses on mainly herbaceous species, we found trees and shrubs were as likely to have negative genetic responses to habitat fragmentation as herbaceous species. We also found that the genetic variation in offspring was generally less than that of adult trees, which is evidence of a genetic extinction debt and probably reflects the genetic diversity of the historical, less-fragmented landscape. © 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.",Effect size; Extinction debt; Pollen limitation; Pollination vector; Woody species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858865541

Lags impede prioritization of invasive-species control efforts: when eradication is most feasible, it is often unclear whether a species is benign or a potentially harmful ""sleeper weed."" I used herbarium records to estimate lag phases for invasive or potentially invasive plant species in three regions of the upper Midwest. I tested whether factors related to species' invasion epidemiology, traits, or the habitats they invade were correlated with lag lengths. From an initial pool of 151 species, there were sufficient records to test for lags in 76 for northern Wisconsin, 90 for southern Wisconsin, and 91 for the southern Lake Michigan region. Lags were identified in 77% (197) of these 257 datasets and ranged from 3-140 years with a mean of 47.3 ± 34.6 (SD). Lags differed by native range, introduction pathway, growth form and habit, dispersal mode, flowering phenology, pollination mode for a subset of species, and breadth, light availability, and water availability of invaded habitats. However, estimated lags were highly variable and tested factors did not have strong explanatory power. Exotic species comprised an increasing proportion of total herbarium records. Of the species with known introduction pathways, 85% were intentionally introduced, mainly as ornamentals. The long durations, high variability, and low predictability of lags, along with human culpability for an increasingly non-native flora, support a cautious approach to species introductions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Exotic species; Herbarium data; Lag phase; Logistic growth; Species traits; Von Bertalanffy growth function,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858797930

At anthesis, ovulate flowers have carpels bearing immature orthotropous ovules. After pollination, the ovules increase in size and become anatropous and the ovary enlarges. Simultaneously, the pollen tubes extend from the stigma to the ovules with several phases of growth and quiescence. Finally, after the first fertilization, the remaining ovules abort, resulting in a single-seeded fruit. Three-dimensionally preserved potentially fagaceous mesofossil flowers from the Campanian of Massachusetts, USA, provide evidence on the evolution of these characters. The fossils share putative synapomorphies with the Fagales (six tepals, mostly inferior, three-carpellate ovary with each locule initially containing two pendant ovules, punctate-rugulate, tricolporate pollen and fruit with a single seed). However, the fossil is bisexual and has nectaries, characters shared with the sister order Cucurbitales, and both lack the fagalean immature orthotropous developmental stage. The fossil shares synapomorphies of an inferior ovary and a single-seeded indehiscent fruit with both living orders and appears to be transitional. Comparison of ontogenetic changes between the fossil and related fagalean taxa suggests independent stepwise changes in development in which some characters of the modern clades were in place at ?75Myr and others evolved more recently. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Cretaceous; Cucurbitaceae; Fagaceae; Floral development; Floral evolution; Fossil angiosperm; Phylogenetic relationships,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857936159

The structure of its gynoecium and fruit is thus potentially of great interest in understanding gynoecium evolution in calamoid palms and in Arecaceae as a whole. The wall of the incompletely trilocular gynoecium of Eugeissona is thick and differentiated into several topographic zones, with a well-developed vascular system even before pollination. During gynoecium and fruit development, the outer and inner epidermises are little specialized and form the exocarp and endocarp (obliterated in the mature fruit), respectively. In contrast, the mesophyll of the carpels differentiates strongly and is markedly specialized: four massive topographic zones are easily distinguished within the mesocarp. The peripheral zone of the mesocarp forms the body of the scales (a synapomorphy for Calamoideae). The second and the fourth zones are multilayered and parenchymatous with a massive derived vascular system in the former. The third zone of the mesocarp comprises a stout sclerenchymatous pyrene, made of fibre-like sclereids, the innermost bundles of the derived vascular system and dorsal, ventral and lateral vascular bundles. The fruits of all other Calamoideae lack the sclerenchymatous pyrene and thus differ dramatically from Eugeissona fruits. The similarity of the processes of histogenesis during gynoecium and fruit development in Eugeissona with those in Nypa and borassoid palms, suggests these features could be plesiomorphic for the family. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Borasseae; Carpel wall structure; Nypa; Pericarp anatomy; Pyrene; Scales; Vasculature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857967630

Whether avian pollinators place selective pressure on the plants they feed on, in terms of flower morphology and nectar traits, is still debated. While considerable research exists that examines the sugar preferences, concentration preference and digestive ability of specialist nectar-feeding birds, there is little known about these parameters for occasional nectar-feeding birds, as most previous studies have not controlled for the energetic value of solutions employed in choice experiments. Birds of the Sturnidae--Muscicapoidea lineage lack sucrase and are intolerant of solutions or fruit above 11-15% sucrose content. African Red-winged Starlings Onychognathus morio are occasional nectarivores that play a role as pollinators of several plant groups, particularly aloes, which produce large amounts of dilute floral nectar. We confirmed that these birds, like other members of their lineage studied outside of Africa, are unable to digest sucrose. In laboratory trials, they strongly preferred hexose (1:1 glucose:fructose) over sucrose solutions in paired equicaloric choice tests at a range of concentrations (5-20%) and maintained energy balance at these concentrations. However, they were unable to maintain body mass when given a choice between sucrose and hexose solutions at the highest concentration (25%) and showed no sugar preference at this level, suggesting that high concentration solutions may place physiological stress on starlings. Starlings preferentially consumed lower concentration solutions, when simultaneously offered four hexose solutions of varying concentrations (10-25%). These results suggest that starlings impose pollinator-mediated pressure for low concentration, hexose-rich nectar in the plants they pollinate. © 2011 Dt.

How an embryo forms during seed maturation remains unclear, especially in the case of monocotyledonous plants. Generally, the complex processes of embryogenesis result from the action of a coordinated network of genes. Thus, a large-scale survey of changes in protein abundance during embryogenesis is an effective approach to study the molecular events of embryogenesis. In this study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) was applied to separate rice embryo proteins collected during the three phases of embryogenesis: 6 days after pollination (DAP), 12 DAP, and 18 DAP. We then employed matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight/time of flight mass spectrometry(MALDI TOF/TOF MS) to identify the phase-dependent differential 2DE spots. A total of 66 spots were discovered to be regulated during embryogenesis, and of these spots, 53 spots were identified. These proteins were further categorized into several functional classes, including storage, embryo development, stress response, glycolysis, and protein metabolism. Intriguingly, the major differential spots originated from three globulins. We further examined the possible mechanism underlying the globulins' multiple forms using Western blotting, proteolysis, and blue native gel electrophoresis techniques and found that the multiple forms of globulins were produced as a result of enhanced proteolysis during embryogenesis, indicating that these globulin forms may serve as chaperone proteins participating in the formation of multiple protein complexes during embryogenesis. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

C. radiata is discoid with an equatorial thickening and two large opposite apertures, with radial thickenings in one of them and two central apertural occlusive opercula-like structures. Beneath there is a thick amorphous electron-dense nexine. The combination of characters seen in this pollen type is very unusual, and no parallels are known in fossil or extant gymnosperm grains. Functional interpretation of the apertural exine suggests that the radial thickenings and apertural membranes were involved in harmomegthy, the opercula-like structures in germination, and the apertural nexine perhaps as a strengthening layer.

In the Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park, numerous olive varieties are grown as the native cultivars 'Pisciottana', 'Rotondella', and 'Salella', the varieties 'Frantoio' and 'Biancolilla', widely cultivated in Southern Italy, and a new variety, known as 'FS17', obtained by self-pollination of 'Frantoio' cultivar. In order to assess the phenolic composition of these cultivars, metabolomic techniques (1D and 2D NMR, and HPLC analyses) were extensively applied. 1H-NMR spectral data were processed and analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to point out possible differences in polyphenol composition between the cultivars. The radical scavenging capacity of the investigated cultivars was also evaluated through 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylydrazyl (DPPH). Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was used to estimate the total phenolic content.

Molecular analysis of the transgenics revealed stable integration of the transgene upto T2 generation. High level of expression of the transgene (driven by its own stress-inducible promoter), as well as the protein, was detectable in the leaves under simulated salinity stress (250 mM NaCl, 24 h); the expression level being higher than wild type (WT) plants. The Rab16A transcript also increased gradually with seed maturity, with its maximal accumulation at 30 d after pollination (DAP) i.e., fully matured seeds, explaining the protective role of Rab16A gene during seed maturation. Enhanced tolerance to salinity was observed in the plants transformed with Rab16A. The superior physiological performances of the transgenics under salt treatment were also reflected in lesser shoot or root length inhibition, reduced chlorophyll damages, lesser accumulation of Na+ and reduced loss of K+, increased proline content as compared with the WT plants. All these results indicated that the overproduction of RAB16A protein in the transgenics enable them to display enhanced tolerance to salinity stress with improved physiological traits. Our work demonstrates the profound potential of Group 2 LEA proteins (to which RAB16A belongs to) in conferring stress tolerance in crop plants through their genetic manipulation. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Abiotic stress; Responsive to abscisic acid; Salt tolerance; Transformation; Transgenic rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862834658

During the formation of leaf primordia, they need to establish the proximodistal, mediolateral, and ab/adaxial axes. Among these axes, the ab/adaxial axis might be the most important. ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2) gene is a member of AS2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARY (LOB) family of Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work, we transformed 35S:AS2 transgene constructs to cockscomb (Celosia cristata) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. All primary transformants subsequently obtained were placed into phenotypic categories and self-pollinated. As a whole, a total of 44 T1 35S:AS2 cockscomb plants obtained were grouped into two major categories: (I) slightly wrinkled leaves (28/44), (II) extremely curved leaves (16/44), on the basis of their leaf phenotypes. Furthermore, we characterized the anatomical features of these malformed leaves; and found the transformation of adaxial cell types into abaxial cell ones. A series of data suggest that AS2 might be involved in the determination of abaxial polarity in cockscomb plants. However, a few research teams have reported that AS2 might be involved in the determination of adaxial polarity in leaf primodia of Arabidopsis thaliana. These data above indicate that the roles of the same ab/adaxial determinant might differ between distinct species. At last, the different function of AS2 in distinct species was discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Arabidopsis thaliana; ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2 (AS2); Cockscomb (Celosia cristata) ab-adaxial polarity; Malformed leaves; Overexpression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863084120

Although the structure of their communities is critically affected by anthropogenic disturbances, little is known about these bees in small forest fragments. The objectives of this study were to analyze the composition, abundance, and diversity of euglossine bee species in nine small fragments of different phytophysiognomies of the Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil, and to identify the environmental variables that may be related to the species composition of these communities. Males were sampled quarterly from May 2007 to May 2009 with aromatic traps containing methyl cinnamate, vanillin, eucalyptol, benzyl acetate, and methyl salicylate. A total of 1558 males, belonging to 10 species and three genera of Euglossina were collected. The richness ranged from five to seven species per fragment. Euglossa cordata, E. securigera, Eulaema nigrita e E. cingulata were common to all fragments studied. The diversity differed significantly among areas, ranging from H' = 1.04 to H' = 1.65. The precipitation, phytophysiognomy, and altitude had the highest relative importance over the species composition variation. The results presented in this study demonstrate that small forest fragments are able to support populations of euglossine bee species, most of which are widely distributed and reportedly tolerant to open and/or disturbed areas and suggest that the conservation of such areas is important, particularly in areas that are regenerating and in regions with agricultural matrices where these bees can act as important pollinators.",Chemical baits; Fragmentation; Loss habitat; Orchid bees; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867625563

By means of various pollination measures, different mating systems, and varying selection methods, nine advanced interspecific-bridge lines were developed, in which the crossing barrier among the species and the male sterility of the F1 and subsequent generations were overcome over a 12-year period from 1999 through 2011. Despite the considerable influence of parental cultigens and environmental factors on the incompatibility of interspecific crosses, the plant and population compatibility significantly increased when a backcross with a recurrent parent in the same species or a multiple-way cross with a parent in the different species was made. As the generations advanced, the percentage of fertile seeds (PFS) significantly increased in all the sib- and self-families. The four advanced interspecific-bridge lines out of nine not only have gained the normal crossability of interspecific hybridization, but also could eliminate the sexual obstacles of the subsequent generations. The results demonstrate that a two- or three-species bridge line with crossing compatibility can be created by two- or threespeciesrecombination and continuous selection.

Given the effect of these various traits on fitness, pleiotropy may alter the evolution of both mating systems and floral displays, two characters with high diversity among angiosperms. The influence of viability selection on mating system evolution has not been studied theoretically. We model plant mating system evolution when a single locus simultaneously affects the selfing rate, pollen export, and viability. We assume frequency-independent mating, so our model characterizes prior selfing. Pleiotropy between increased viability and selfing rate reduces opportunities for the evolution of pure outcrossing, can favor complete selfing despite high inbreeding depression, and notably, can cause the evolution of mixed mating despite very high inbreeding depression. These results highlight the importance of pleiotropy for mating system evolution and suggest that selection by nonpollinating agents may help explain mixed mating, particularly in species with very high inbreeding depression. © 2012 The Author(s).

A large proportion of the remaining species are self-compatible, and they either outcross using various contrivances or self-fertilize to some extent. Because of the common occurrence of populations and individuals with intermediate levels of self-incompatibility, categorization of the expression of self-incompatibility as an approximately binary trait has become controversial. We collect a widely reported index (index of self-incompatibility [ISI]) used to asses the strength and variation of self-incompatibility from over 1200 angiosperm taxa. Its distribution is bimodal and positively associated with outcrossing rate, albeit with a weak relationship within self-compatible taxa. A substantial fraction of species has intermediate mean values of ISI. Their occurrence can be caused by segregating ephemeral self-compatible mutations, averaging artifacts, and experimental biases, in addition to the often invoked stabilizing selection acting on the expression of self-incompatibility. Selection may also generally favor taxa with high ISI values through increased lineage birth and death rates, and it may counter lower level selection advantages within taxa expressing intermediate and low values of ISI. Such a null hypothesis is nearly universally overlooked, despite the fact that it could adequately explain the observed distribution of mating and breeding systems. © 2011 The Author(s).

One approach to remedy this situation in species whose seeds and fruits are not of particular value is to engineer male sterility into the transgenic lines. In this study, three meiosis-critical genes, namely AHP2, AtRAD51C and SWITCH1 (SWI), were chosen as silencing targets to test the feasibility of incorporating sterility into plants using an RNAi-based approach. Our results indicated that the silencing of each of these genes via hairpin RNA (termed AHPi, RAD51Ci and SWIi lines) in Arabidopsis thaliana yielded a proportion of transgenic plants exhibiting a similar 'partially sterile' phenotype in which less than 50% of pollen was viable. In addition, a 'sterile' phenotype was also evident in a minority of RAD51Ci and SWIi, but not AHPi, lines in which plants yielded no seeds and either produced inviable pollen (RAD51Ci lines) or displayed a complete absence of pollen (SWIi lines). This suggests that AtRAD51C and SWI may function at distinct stages of meiosis. Further analyses of SWIi lines demonstrated that the 'sterile' phenotype was associated with a substantial reduction in the level of targeted gene transcript in floral tissues and resulted from sterility of the male, but not female gametes. This work demonstrates that generating male sterility through the silencing of key genes involved in the regulation of meiosis is feasible, and its advantages and potential applications for transgene containment are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).",Arabidopsis; Gene containment; Gene silencing; Meiosis; RNAi; Sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858291874

The objectives of this study were to compare the genetic diversity of natural and artificial populations, and to determine the effects of ?-radiation on genetic variability when evaluated by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Two populations used in this study include 66 plant introductions (PI) from the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA; POP1), and 43 mutants derived from one of the plant introductions, Bd43 (PI 227011; POP2) treated with a ?-irradiation ranging from 100 to 600 Gy. The highest performance of the phenotypic traits was observed at 200 Gy for germination rate, 100 Gy for height, and 600 Gy for tiller number, implying that the LD50 for determining of optimum dosage depends on the physiological parameters measured. Based on AFLP analysis, POP2 showed higher polymorphism (79. 4%), PIC (polymorphism information content; 0. 162), and genetic diversity (0. 195) than POP1 (59. 4%, 0. 113, and 0. 130, respectively). Those three genetic parameters were evaluated for the mutants derived at various ?-radiation dosages and were found to be the highest when irradiated at 300 Gy. Artificial mutagenesis using ?-radiation improved genetic diversity compared to that of the natural population, and 300 Gy was a useful dosage to enlarge genetic variability in Brachypodium. Results suggest that a dosage maximizing the genetic diversity when evaluated with AFLP markers is an alternative index to LD50 for determining the optimum level for mutation induction. © 2012 Korean Society for Horticultural Science.",AFLP analysis; artificial mutagenesis; genetic variability; optimum dosage; polymorphism information content (PIC),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864444456

Location One of the highest mountain forest regions of the world, located in the Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorian Andes. Methods We compared genetic diversity and structure of adult trees with those of seedlings (n= 118 in both cases) in nine forest stands spanning an altitudinal gradient from 3500 to 4100m a.s.l. using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Genetic diversity was calculated as percentage of polymorphic bands (P) and Nei's expected heterozygosity (He); genetic differentiation was assessed using analysis of molecular variance, ? ST statistics and Bayesian cluster analysis. Results Estimates of genetic diversity at the population level were significantly lower in seedlings than in adults. Genetic diversity (He-value) was, in both cases, negatively correlated to altitude and positively correlated to population size in the seedlings. Genetic differentiation of the seedlings was approximately as high (? ST= 0.298) as that of the adults (? ST= 0.307), and geographical differentiation was clearly reflected in both AFLP profiles, with mountain ridges acting as barriers to gene flow. Main conclusions Our study provides evidence of a historic upslope migration of P. incana in central Ecuador. In addition, it highlights the detrimental effects of unexpectedly strong genetic isolation, both recent and historical, particularly for our wind-pollinated species where the distance between forest stands was less than 25km. We therefore additionally propose that in habitats with pronounced high-mountain landscape structures, gene flow may be hampered to such an extent that species have a more pronounced sensitivity to habitat fragmentation, even among populations of wind-pollinated trees. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",AFLPs; Altitudinal gradient; Central Andes; Ecuador; Genetic structure; High-mountain forests; Life stages; Polylepis incana,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858079918

Anti-herbivore defences against insects can act as repellents, deterrents, growth inhibitors or cause direct mortality. In turn, insects have evolved a variety of strategies to act against plant toxins, e.g., avoidance, excretion, sequestration and degradation of the toxin, eventually leading to a co-evolutionary arms race between insects and plants and to co-diversification. Anti-herbivore defences also negatively impact mutualistic partners, possibly leading to an ecological cost of toxin production. However, in other cases toxins can also be used by plants involved in mutualistic interactions to exclude inadequate partners and to modify the cost/benefit ratio of mutualism to their advantage. When considering the whole community, toxins have an effect at many trophic levels. Aposematic insects sequester toxins to defend themselves against predators. Depending on the ecological context, toxins can either increase insects' vulnerability to parasitoids and entomopathogens or protect them, eventually leading to self-medication. We conclude that studying the community-level impacts of plant toxins can provide new insights into the synthesis between community and evolutionary ecology. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Antagonism; Coevolution; Evolutionary arms race; Inter-guild interactions; Multitrophic interactions; Mutualism; Pollination; Predators; Repellent; Secondary metabolism; Symbionts; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860246434

The frequency of mating system shifts has made it difficult to reconstruct historical evolutionary dynamics unless transitions have been very recent. Here, we examine molecular and phenotypic variation to determine the polarity, timescale, and causes of a transition between outcrossing and self-fertilization in sister subspecies of Clarkia xantiana. Phylogenetic analyses and coalescent-based estimates of the time to most recent common ancestor indicated that outcrossing is ancestral to selfing and that there has been a single origin of selfing. Estimates of divergence time between outcrossing and selfing subspecies were 10,000 (95% CI [credible interval]: 3169-66,889) and 65,000 years ago (95% CI: 33,035-151,448) based on two different methods, suggesting a recent and rapid evolutionary transition. Population genetic data indicated that the transition to selfing was associated with a 80% reduction in molecular diversity, which is much greater than the 50% reduction expected under a shift from obligate outcrossing to obligate self-fertilization alone. Our data also suggest that this severe loss of diversity was caused by colonization bottlenecks.

Weekday and study week average CO 2 and PM 2.5 concentrations were higher near study homes compared to central site sampling points, but peak measures and overnight/pre-dawn time period averages were elevated at the central site. Pollen counts were typically lower at homes-even if grass, trees, flowers or potted plants were present-compared to the central site closer to and generally downwind from commercial agricultural tree production. Data are new; the nine-county San Joaquin Valley has one pollen count station in the national network, and two of four government outdoor air monitoring stations in the county are in national parks. We suggest-given poor air quality in large part due to PM-adding routine pollen counts to regional/state agency air monitoring sites and more CO 2 and PM monitoring. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Carbon dioxide; Near roadway measurements; Particulate matter; Pollen; Spatial heterogeneity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856656426

In order to optimize the process of hand-pollination, in this work we have studied the conservation potential of E. pubescens pollen stored for approximately 2 months at -20°C, -70°C and -196°C. The optimal desiccation time of E. pubescens pollen was found to be 210 min. In vitro pollen germination of fresh pollen was 56.0%, and it was progressively reduced after conservation at -20°C, -70°C and -196°C reaching a minimum of 4.2%, 6.0% and 4.4%, respectively after 2 months of storage. The germination capacity of pollen stored at -20°C and -196°C was similar to that observed at -70°C, therefore for reasons of convenience and economy, pollen can be efficiently stored at -20°C. There were no fruit set differences between the field pollinations performed with stored pollen and pollinations performed with fresh pollen.

The ears of four differently-colored cultivars of maize, (Xixingheinuo NO1 [black], Zinuoxiang [purple], Xixingchinuo NO1 [red] and Yuxiangnuo [white]) were shaded after anthesis using opaque bags. Changes in grain colors of maize seeds during development under shading treatment and the location of coloration were observed. Anthocyanin, total phenolic compounds, starch, soluble protein and sugar contents, as well as phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) activity, were also measured. Over 99% of the anthocyanin content in Xixingchinuo NO. 1 was found in its pericarp and seed coat. In Zinuoxiang and Xixingheinuo NO1, over 99% of their anthocyanin contents were found in the aleurone layer. Shade treatment (The ears shaded after anthesis using opaque bags from anthesis until harvest) decreased the intensity of the kernels' apparent color. Shade treatment significantly reduced anthocyanin production during the early grain filling stage of growth, but the difference in percentage of reduction between the control and shade-treated plants decreased during development. In contrast, differences of total phenolic contents between the control and shade-treated plants were increased, except Yuxiangnuo, Shade treatment decreased anthocyanin and total phenolic contents by 68.6%, 68.8%, 60.0% 56.1% and 20.6%, 3.6%, 6.6%, 10.0%, respectively, in Yuxiangnuo, Xixingchinuo NO1, Zinuoxiang, and Xixingheinuo NO1 15 d post-anthesis (DPA).

These findings show significant differences in anthocyanin and total phenolic syntheses in maize. Shade treatment decreased PAL activity, soluble sugar and starch contents but increased soluble protein contents compared with control kernels. The results of this study indicate that fresh ears could be picked at about 35 DPA, at which point anthocyanin contents would be at maximum levels.

The cultivars grown were open-pollinated Esplanada and hybrid Sugar Snax 54. Root and Cenourete® yield varied with all the main factors and no interaction was significant. The root yield of both cultivars increased with later harvest at each density level. Yield of Esplanada root was only marginally affected by line spacing. Although significant, the effect of plant density on the yield of SugarSnax 54 accounted for less than 5% of the variation in the data set and differences between means were not significant by Tukey (?= 0.05). Cenourete® yield from Esplanada cultivar varied from 9.4±3.9 to 15.2±6.5 t/ha and from SugarSnax 54 it varied from 9.9±3.9 to 18.2±6.5 t/ha, depending on treatment. Anticipating harvest had a much greater effect in enhancing the recovery of Cenourete® from carrot roots than increasing plant density. Although it didn't affect total yield, decreasing line spacing to 10 cm was important to assure that a larger proportion of thinner roots were produced and consequently the production of superior quality Cenouretes® was higher. Harvest time was also important to determine the Cenourete® size since the increase in total production at later harvest was due to a higher proportion of larger Cenouretes®. The best combination line spacing x harvest time for Esplanada and SugarSnax 54 under the conditions of this experiment will depend whether the interest lies in the production of any or of a particular Cenourete® size.",Baby-carrot; Cenourete®; Crop spacing; Daucus carota; Fresh-cut carrot; Harvest time; Plant density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864498302

In practice, provenances are often delineated based on climate, geomorphology and correlated spatial descriptors following the boundaries of larger natural regions. They are thought to comprise genetically homogenous plant material. Here we investigate genetic variation at AFLP loci in 26 natural populations of the regionally common grassland species Geranium pratense, which is often used in seed mixtures. Most studied populations are located in one previously delineated provenance in Germany. We assess within- and among provenance differentiation patterns and aspects of gene flow by investigating the mating system, the genetic structure at regional and local scale, gene dispersal and potential selective mechanisms that may have contributed to differentiation patterns found. Compared to other herbaceous, insect-pollinated grassland species and despite being outcrossed (mean t m = 0. 88), G. pratense showed low genetic diversity (mean H E = 0. 15), considerable genetic differentiation among populations within provenances (mean pairwise F ST = 0. 20) and a pronounced within-population spatial genetic structure (mean Sp = 0. 064). A genome scan approach identified three potentially adaptive loci. However, their allelic frequencies were only weakly related to climatic parameters thus providing little evidence for adaptive divergence. Nevertheless, the distribution of genetic diversity and derived gene dispersal estimates indicate limited dispersal ability, suggesting that gene flow at distances larger than 10 km is negligible. Our findings may question the approach of delineating provenances by general criteria, and highlight the importance of species-specific studies on differentiation and adaptation patterns. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",AFLP; Genome scan; Geranium pratense; Local provenance; Outcrossing rate; Population structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858004451

Here we re-sequenced the DGAT1-2 region responsible for oil variation in a maize landrace set and in 155 inbred lines (35 high-oil and 120 normal lines). The high-oil DGAT1-2 allele was present in most Northern Flint and Southern Dent populations but was absent in five of eight Corn Belt Dent open-pollinated populations and in most of the earlier inbred lines. Loss of the high-oil DGAT1-2 allele possibly resulted from genetic drift in the early twentieth century when a few Corn Belt Dent populations were selected for the development of high-grain-yield inbred lines. Association analysis detected significant effects of two PCR-based functional markers (HO06 and DGAT04; developed based on DGAT1-2 polymorphisms) on kernel oil content and oleic acid composition using the 155 inbred lines. Zheng58 and Chang7-2, the parent inbred lines of elite hybrid Zhengdan958, were used to transfer the favorable allele from the high-oil line By804 using marker-assisted backcrossing with the two functional markers.

Apis mellifera, show learned odour preferences for flowers that provide nectar as a reward. However, little is known about such behavioural plasticity when bees exploit pollen sources. Furthermore, the question about whether nectar and pollen foragers use the same learned strategy to improve foraging efficiency remains untested. Here, we demonstrate that honeybee foragers are able to learn odour cues associated with pollen as a reward. This was tested in free-flying bees in a dual-choice feeding device after the bees had gathered pollen from a scented feeder. Free-flying bees that associated odour with pollen successfully recalled these memories in olfactometer odour choice tests in a Y-maze, but they failed to show extension of the proboscis to learned odour cues when restrained (proboscis extension reflex, PER, assay). In addition, odour cues associated with pollen at the feeding site induced foraging reactivation when bees were blown into the hive. In PER assays, after fatty acids were applied to the bees' antennae, pollen foragers were more responsive than nectar foragers. This, in turn, allowed pollen foragers in the PER assay to associate an odour cue with pollen in some trials. On the other hand, the unconditioned response (UR) and the odour-conditioned response (CR) to sucrose and amino acids were similar for both types of foragers. Pollen foragers also showed more URs to fresh pollen of different flower species and even performed better during conditioning with some pollen types as the reward than did nectar foragers. By studying biases in pollen-foraging responses after learning, we provide new insights to help comprehend and characterize the search for food between pollen and nonpollen honeybee foragers. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Apis mellifera; Decision making; Honeybee; Olfactory learning; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858752755

Iterative spatial analysis was applied to eliminate the effect of the spatial dependence in the original data and to estimate accurately genetic parameters for evaluating the potential for selection of the measured trees. Spatial analysis was very beneficial for growth traits and survival, but less so if at all for form traits. Estimated individual heritabilities ranged from moderate to high for growth traits (? 2 i = 0.29 - 0.42%) and stem straightness (? 2 i = 0.24 - 0.42%) High coefficients of additive genetic variance were obtained for volume (?V A = 36.5 - 41.5%) and straightness(?V A = 44.26 - 53.84%) Phenotypic and estimated genetic correlations between growth traits were very high, and correlations between sites indicated that there was no important family × site interaction. No adverse correlations between traits were evident. The results indicate the ample potential for selection in the current progeny trial, where responses to within-family and combined selection for growth traits may be high.

Rice (Oryza sativa) is an excellent monocot plant model for studying embryogenesis with a known genome sequence. Here, we conducted proteomic analysis of embryo development in rice (O. sativa L. ssp. indica cv. 9311). The aim was to investigate and characterize the changes in the protein expression profile during embryo development. For this purpose, the proteome of developing embryos was characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and nano liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. Proteomic analyses identified 275 differentially expressed proteins throughout the 5 sequential developmental stages from 5 to 30 days after pollination. Most of these proteins were classified into eight functional categories: metabolism, protein synthesis/destination, disease and defense, transporter, transcription, signal transduction, cell growth/division, and storage proteins, which were involved in different cellular and metabolic processes. Hierarchical clustering analyses of protein expression profiles showed that highly expressed proteins in early stages were involved in metabolism, protein synthesis/destination, and most of the other cellular functions, whereas the proteins highly expressed in later stages functioned in the desiccation and dormancy of the embryo. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Embryo development; Nano LC-MS/MS; Proteome; Rice; Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858861182

We evaluated the effects of the structural connectivity of forest patches (i.e., distance between patches) and matrix class (land-cover type) on the functional connectivity of 3 bird species (the White-crested Elaenia [Elaenia albiceps], the Green-backed Firecrown Hummingbird [Sephanoides sephaniodes], and the Austral Thrush [Turdus falklandii]). We measured functional connectivity as the rate at which each species crossed from one patch to another. We also evaluated whether greater functional connectivity translated into greater ecological connectivity (dispersal of fruit and pollen) by comparing among forest patches fruit set of a plant pollinated by hummingbirds and abundance of seedlings and adults of 2 plants with bird- and wind-dispersed seeds. Interpatch distance was strongly associated with functional connectivity, but its effect was not independent of matrix class. For one of the bird-dispersed plants, greater functional connectivity for White-crested Elaenias and Austral Thrushes (both frugivores) was associated with higher densities of this plant. The lack of a similar association for the wind-dispersed species suggests this effect is linked to the dispersal vector. The abundance of the hummingbird-pollinated species was not related to the presence of hummingbirds. Interpatch distance and matrix class affect animal movement in fragmented landscapes and may have a cascading effect on the distribution of some animal-dispersed species. On the basis of our results, we believe effort should be invested in optimizing patch configuration and modifying the matrix so as to mitigate the effects of patch isolation in fragmented landscapes. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.",Ecological connectivity; Intervening matrix; Structural connectivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858811256

There appears to be a significant commercial opportunity for establishment of a planted sandalwood resource. However, lack of basic biological knowledge is one constraint on such development. The study reported here addresses one such constraint. Controlled pollination using 13 genotypes of Santalum lanceolatum was undertaken to elucidate (i) self-incompatibility (ii) intraspecific cross-compatibility in the species, and (iii) interspecific cross-compatibility with S. album and S. austrocaledonicum. S. lanceolatum may be considered to have a facultative allogamous (incomplete outbreeding) breeding system. This study found variation between genotypes in the level of putative self-incompatibility: some (20%) were found to set seed following self-pollination, while the remaining 80% had no seed development with such pollinations. However, a significantly greater proportion of genotypes developed seed following intraspecific cross-pollination (62%) compared with self-pollination (20%). While total geographic isolation and significant morphological divergence exists between S. lanceolatum with each of S. album and S. austrocaledonicum this study found no indication of reproductive barrier(s) between them, indicating potential for use of interspecific hybridization in genetic improvement, but also suggesting the potential of undesirable gene flow between native and introduced species. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Genetic improvement; Mating system; Sandalwood,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858624364

In this study we examine how a shift from within-crown reproductive synchrony to asynchrony influences reproductive assurance through contributions to selfing and outcrossing in small, spatially isolated populations of Ficus. Methods: The research focuses on the monoecious fig F. petiolaris and consists of phenological analyses and genetic assessments of selfing and outcrossing for populations located in Baja California's Sonoran Desert. Key results: Phenological censuses of eight populations revealed within-crown asynchrony in 44% of reproducing trees, with 16% having sufficient overlap of male and female flowering phases to permit selfing via the cycling of pollinating fig wasps within natal trees. In mating system analyses of two of these populations, however, multilocus outcrossing rates (tm) were indistinguishable from 1. This result, combined with low levels of inbreeding, indicates selfing to be absent or at best a minor contributor to reproductive assurance. Conclusions: The results indicate that the fitness benefits of within-crown asynchrony lie not with selfing, as commonly asserted, but with increased opportunities for outcross pollen transmission and receipt, changing our understanding of the mechanisms by which reproduction is facilitated and extinction risk minimized in naturally fragmented Ficus populations. Given the role of fig fruit as a keystone food resource in many tropical environments, trait variation leading to reproductive assurance in figs, such as within-crown asynchrony, has broader ecosystem-level implications. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Allee affects; Ficus; Fig wasp; Habitat fragmentation; Mating system analysis; Mexico; Moraceae; Mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860586927

We used automatic UV light-traps to sample noctuid moths on two remote islands, and compared traits of island occupants with those of a species pool from mainland southeast Sweden. Widely distributed species, generalist species, species with a long adult activity period and species active late in the summer had higher probability of occupancy on the remote islands. The results were consistent between islands. The traits of host plant specificity and species with an adult activity period during late summer remained robust and were statistically significant after controlling for any possible phylogenetic bias. This indicates that species exhibiting those traits survive better when habitat and climate changes. It is crucial to include our results in; (1) conservation planning, e. g. when devising conservation measures in fragmented landscapes; (2) for predictions of future occupancy patterns; and (3) ecosystem impact assessments, e. g. the importance of moths as pollinators, herbivores and being the functional link between parasitoids, plants, consumers and predators. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Colonisation; Dispersal; Distribution; Light-trap; Mobility; Noctuidae; Persistence; Remote island,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858151090

Citrus varieties, such as Clementine mandarin and other related species, show parthenocarpic fruit development without seeds due to self-incompatibility. In spite of that, these fruits frequently contain seeds as a result of cross-pollination by insects with compatible pollen from other citrus cultivars grown nearby. To solve this problem using a biotechnological approach we aim at the destruction of ovules and/or seeds by directing the expression of a toxic gene using the promoter of an ovule and/or seed specific gene. With the purpose of isolating this kind of genes we constructed two cDNA libraries from ovules and seeds at different developmental stages of the Clementine mandarin (Citrus clementina cv.

Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed nearly specific expression in ovule and/or seed of two genes, TRANSPARENT TESTA16 (CcTT16) and TRANSPARENT TESTA7 (CcTT7). Expression of these two genes is restricted to early seed development, and is localized in the embryo sac and endothelium.

However, this measurement veils the complexity of gene flow, especially in the case of gene stacking. We have investigated the impact of gene stacking on adventitious GM presence due to pollen flow and seed admixture as well as its translation in terms of the percentage of GM-DNA in a non-GM maize harvest. In the case of varieties bearing one to four stacked events, we established a set of relationships between the percentage of GM kernels and the percentage of GM-DNA in a non-GM harvest as well as a set of relationships between the rate of seed admixture and the percentages of GM material in a non-GM harvest. Thanks to these relationships, and based on simulations with a gene flow model, we have been able to demonstrate that the number of events and the stacking structure of the emitting fields impact the ability of a non-GM maize producer to comply with given GM kernel or GM-DNA thresholds. We also show that a great variability in the rates of GM kernels, embryos and DNA results from seed admixture. Finally, the choice of a unit of measurement for a GM threshold in seed lots can have opposite effects on the ability of farmers to comply with a given threshold depending on whether they are crop or seed producers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Coexistence; Gene flow; Gene stacking; GMO; Maize; Seed admixture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859100521

Ears were either covered or removed at silking, the dry weight (DW) and NPK contents at silking and maturity in major sink organs of plants were closely observed. In comparison with control plants, covering ears reduced, and removing ears further decreased total DW and NP gains of whole plants, regardless of the larger root size and reduced shoot:root DW ratio. Since the total DW and NP gains of the new maize varieties after silking were more than that of the old varieties, the decrease of the total DW and NP gains caused by pollination-prevention and removing ears were also more in the new varieties. The uptake and distribution patterns of NP and K in maize plants were different. Developing grains and cob plus husks differentially reduced net post-silking K loss. The results suggested that the amount of nutrient uptake was not decided by the root size itself. Developing maize grains enhanced nutrient uptake rate of roots.

The objectives here were to estimate mating system parameters and to fit the pollen dispersal kernel for the southern beech, Nothofagus nervosa. We sampled 25 mothers and 372 progeny from two stands in the Tromen Lake region of Argentina. We registered spatial positions of the maternal trees, and genotyped mothers and offspring for five simple sequence repeat markers. We estimated single-locus (t s = 0.95) and multilocus (t m = 0.99) outcrossing rates and biparental inbreeding (t m-t s = 0.04). The species is strongly outcrossing, but correlated paternity within maternal sibships (r p = 0.10) indicates that each maternal parent is sampling a different and restricted array of pollen donors. We used two protocols (twogener and kindist) to fit an exponential power dispersal kernel to the structure of pollen clouds sampled by different mothers. The estimated effective number of pollen donors contributing to a single mother was N ep = 9.9. The twogener and kindist analyses yielded slightly different estimates, but both indicated short average distances for pollen dispersal (&lt;35 m), indicating that the dispersal kernel was strongly leptokurtic (? = 0.36). While short-distance pollen dispersal predominates, there remains a nontrivial probability of long-distance dispersal. The results are discussed in the context of ongoing conservation and management programs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Gene flow; kindist; Outcrossing rates; Patagonian forests; twogener,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866742751

Although many acute infections can be controlled by vaccination, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against persistent viruses and tumors remains challenging. The diverse immune evasion strategies used by persistent DNA viruses such as herpesviruses contribute directly to their persistence and escape from immune control. Intriguingly, many tumors have also developed escape mechanisms to dismantle similar aspects of the host's immune system. Analogous targets of immune evasion mechanisms comprise suppression of antigen presentation and T cell costimulatory pathways, induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, and obstruction of interferon and chemokine functions, which emphasizes them not only as critical elements of T cell activation pathways but also as the potential "" Achilles' heels"" of the host immune system. The insight that immune evasion by viruses and tumors targets analogous host immune pathways might lead to cross-pollination of the viral and tumor immunology research fields, which could lead to new perspectives and appreciation of the intricacies and subtleties that arise from the merging of these fields. Accordingly, a rational and combinatorial manipulation of immune evasion pathways and their targets should aid in the development of safer and more effective vaccine strategies and immunotherapies for a wide range of infections and malignancies. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",Costimulation; Cytokine; DNA viruses; IFN; Immune evasion mechanism; T cells; Vaccine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858774207

This constitutes a possible route through which crop (trans)genes could become established in natural populations. The likelihood of introgression of transgenes will not only be determined by fitness effects from the transgene itself but also by the crop genes linked to it. Although lettuce is generally regarded as self-pollinating, outbreeding does occur at a low frequency. Backcrossing to wild lettuce is a likely pathway to introgression along with selfing, due to the high frequency of wild individuals relative to the rarely occurring crop-wild hybrids. To test the effect of backcrossing on the vigour of inter-specific hybrids, Lactuca serriola, the closest wild relative of cultivated lettuce, was crossed with L. sativa and the F 1hybrid was backcrossed to L. serriola to generate BC 1and BC 2populations. Experiments were conducted on progeny from selfed plants of the backcrossing families (BC 1S 1and BC 2S 1). Plant vigour of these two backcrossing populations was determined in the greenhouse under non-stress and abiotic stress conditions (salinity, drought, and nutrient deficiency).Results: Despite the decreasing contribution of crop genomic blocks in the backcross populations, the BC 1S 1and BC 2S 1hybrids were characterized by a substantial genetic variation under both non-stress and stress conditions. Hybrids were identified that performed equally or better than the wild genotypes, indicating that two backcrossing events did not eliminate the effect of the crop genomic segments that contributed to the vigour of the BC 1and BC 2hybrids. QTLs for plant vigour under non-stress and the various stress conditions were detected in the two populations with positive as well as negative effects from the crop.Conclusion: As it was shown that the crop contributed QTLs with either a positive or a negative effect on plant vigour, we hypothesize that genomic regions exist where transgenes could preferentially be located in order to mitigate their persistence in natural populations through genetic hitchhiking. © 2012 Uwimana et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858734929

This process traditionally relies on tissue culture, and cotton has not been an exception to this paradigm. Though the commercialization of transgenic cotton is a resounding success, cotton transformation, which is the first step in producing transgenic cotton, is a burdensome process since there is a very long tissue culture process and a limited number of cultivars that can be regenerated. An improved process which is easier to handle and more genotype independent could efficiently generate more transgenic plants and allow meaningful analyses of gene function and transgenic plants. Cotton pistil drip by inoculating Agrobacterium tumefaciens onto the pistil after pollination gave rise to stable transformants. Since this transformation process in cotton occurs following pollination and during fertilization (postanthesis) but not during preanthesis as in Arabidopsis, the mechanism by which Agrobacterium enters plant cells and integrates into the cotton genome may differ from that in Arabidopsis.

Morpho-anatomical, physiological, pollen characters and seediness were observed. Increasing ploidy level increased petiole stem diameter, leaf thickness, stomata size, plastid number per cell, SPAD value, chlorophyll content, and pollen size but decreased stomata density per unit area, pollen fertility, and no fruit set as result of seedlessness. There were no tendencies of different ploidy level of mutant on increasing magnitude of characters, except in pollen size and viability of DNKW001. Seediness could be improved by artificial pollination with octoploid pollen. The ability in germination of pollen and crossing of ploidy mutant with lower ploidy, excepted Ca 130-13, was an opportunity to use ploidy mutant in intercrossing specific traits of wild type into Fragaria x ananassa. © 2012 Friends Science Publishers.",Different ploidy; Fertility; Leaf thickness; Plastid; Pollen; Seediness; Stomata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863360472

Do parallel population histories allow sustained interactions (such as host-parasite or plant-pollinator) among species, or do discordant histories necessarily interrupt them? Though few empirical data exist, these issues are central to our understanding of multispecies evolutionary dynamics [3-6]. Here we use hierarchical approximate Bayesian analysis [7] of DNA sequence data for 12 herbivores and 19 parasitoids to reconstruct the assembly of an insect community spanning the Western Palearctic and assess the support for alternative host tracking and ecological sorting hypotheses [2, 8, 9]. We show that assembly occurred primarily by delayed host tracking from a shared eastern origin. Herbivores escaped their enemies for millennia before parasitoid pursuit restored initial associations, with generalist parasitoids no better able to track their hosts than specialists. In contrast, ecological sorting played only a minor role. Substantial turnover in host-parasitoid associations means that coevolution must have been diffuse [4-6], probably contributing to the parasitoid generalism seen in this and similar systems [10, 11]. Reintegration of parasitoids after host escape shows these communities to have been unsaturated [12, 13] throughout their history, arguing against major roles for parasitoid niche evolution or competition [3, 4, 6] during community assembly. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858697734

We quantify the effect of bitrophic interactions on the diversity of plants and their animal interactors, and we show their complex dependence on the structure of the interaction network, the strength of interactions, and the dispersal rate. We then develop a method to parameterize our model with real-world networks and apply it to 54 datasets describing three types of interactions: pollination, fungal association, and insect herbivory.

However, evaluating the effect of several insects on fruit and seed production is difficult in plants visited by a variety of insects. Here, we analyzed the effect of three types of pollinators, Papilio spp., Macroglossum pyrrhosticta, and Xylocopa appendiculata on fruit and seed production in Clerodendrum trichotomum by using a flower visitor barrier experiment with nets of specific mesh sizes. As a result, fruit/flower and seed/ovule ratios were significantly lower under Papilio exclusion than under natural conditions. On the other hand, ratios were not significantly different between Papilio excluded and both Papilio and M. pyrrhosticta excluded treatments. Therefore, Papilio and X. appendiculata are effective pollinators, whereas M. pyrrhosticta, which was the most frequent visitor, of C. trichotomum, is not. From our observations of visiting behaviors, we believe that because M. pyrrhosticta probably promotes self- pollination, this species is a non-effective pollinator.

Genetic distances ranged from 0.175 (populations growing under optimal conditions) up to 0.875 (populations growing under marginal conditions). A total of 39 trees were chosen from these populations, and in four different years 58 different parental crosses were made, from which a total of 2,277 individuals were produced for assessment as potential biomass producers. The progenies from each cross were rated according to a selection index (SI) based on three characteristics (height, leading shoot diameter and resistance to the rust Melampsora larici-populina). Sixteen of such crosses had significantly higher SI compared to the lowest SI values observed. In 19 of the crosses, it was shown that certain individual trees had made a significant contribution to lower susceptibility to rust, and in particular, two male trees used in the parental crosses were implicated as being the source of rust resistance. Selected individuals were cloned and used in a field trial with NE-42, as a control. It was found that six clones had significantly higher SI than NE-42. In crosses between trees originating from contrasting conditions, there was a higher average SI than in crosses between trees from the same conditions. However, these differences were not statistically significant. The successful clones are recommended for use in those areas where the native populations of pure black poplar are threatened by cross-pollination with allochthonous species. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Melampsora larici-populina Kleb.; Natural population; Plant breeding; Populus nigra L; Source of rust resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866735580

Benth., ex Kurz.) is an important medicinal plant. Flowers of this plant are protogynous and need cross-pollination for seed set. The characterization of its pollinators and pollination mode is, therefore, important. Entire ranges of flower visitors of sarpagandha were captured with hand net from its field and were identified. These visitors were characterized as pollinators and non-pollinators based on their mode of working on the flowers. Their relative abundances, foraging rates activity durations, number of pollen grains carried on the body, effect of multiple visits were used to determine their pollinating efficiencies. At Hisar (Haryana, India), nineteen insect species were found to visit the flower of sarpagandha. The insects visiting the flowers of sarpagandha showed two types of foraging modes. On the basis of these modes, the flower visitors were characterized as pollinators and non-pollinators. Some foragers of A. dorsata and A. mellifera were base-foragers (nectar thieves/non-pollinators). However, all the lepidopterous species and some of the hymenopterous species were exclusively front-foragers (pollinators). Most abundant were two species of butterflies viz. Papilio demoleus and Pieris brassicae and three species of bees viz. Mellisodes sp., Xylocopa fenestrata and Megachile sp. The peak activity of all the insect visitors was observed at 1300 h. Maximum duration of activity in the field was shown by Papilio demoleus. All the visitors carried excessively higher number of pollen grains on their bodies than required by the flower for fruit set. Incremental visits also did not have significant increase on the fruit set. Therefore, on the basis of population abundance, foraging mode, foraging rate and activity duration, pollinating efficiency of the visitors was determined, where in Papilio demoleus was ranked as the best pollinator of sarpagandha at Hisar, that confirmed our earlier belief about predominance of psychophilous mode of pollination (i.e., pollination by butterflies) in sarpagandha. © 2012 Academic Journals Ink.",Abundance; Bees; Diversity; Foraging behaviour; Insects; Pollinating efficiency; Sarpagandha,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857931904

Both populations differed in the extent and origin of segregation distortion. The population derived from the cross between C. reshni and Poncirus trifoliata (R × Pr) showed 75 % of codominant markers with distorted segregation. The origin of this distortion was prezygotic in most cases. Meanwhile, 100 % of codominant markers in the self-pollinated population [F 2(R × Pr)] showed genotypic distortion, and the origin of such distortion was mostly postzygotic, with the heterozygote being the most frequent genotype in all cases. In the R × Pr population, where two pollinator varieties were used, allele segregation was significantly heterogeneous not only in P. trifoliata (28.6 % of markers) but also in C. reshni (19.5 %). The results on segregation heterogeneity in the F 2(R × Pr) suggest the presence at linkage group 4c of a postfertilization system of balanced lethal factors that reduces homozygosis in self-compatible hybrids. Four low to medium contributing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for the duration of juvenility period by both Kruskal-Wallis and interval mapping methodologies. For seed embryony type, three QTLs were detected by both methodologies, with the previously reported Apo2 being the QTL contributing the most.

Numerous reproductive patterns associated with alpine and arctic species, particularly mechanisms associated with reproductive assurance, are suggested to be driven by high levels of pollen limitation. We studied the reproductive ecology of Parrya nudicaulis, a species with relatively large sexual reproductive investment and a wide range of floral pigmentation, in tundra habitats in interior montane Alaska to estimate the degree of pollen limitation. The plants are self-compatible and strongly protandrous, setting almost no seed in the absence of pollinators. Supplemental hand pollinations within pollinator exclusion cages indicated no cage effect on seed production. Floral visitation rates were low in both years of study and particularly infrequent in 2010. A diversity of insects visited P. nudicaulis, though syrphid and muscid flies composed the majority of all visits. Pollen-ovule ratios and levels of heterozygosity are consistent with a mixed mating system. Pollen limitation was severe; hand pollinations increased seed production per plant five-fold. Seed-to-ovule ratios remained low following hand pollinations, indicating resource limitation is likely to also be responsible for curtailing seed set. We suggest that pollen limitation in P. nudicaulis may be the result of selection favoring an overproduction of ovules as a bet-hedging strategy in this environmental context of highly variable pollen receipt. © 2012 Fulkerson et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858019939

Thus, our aim was to develop a methodology of in vitro production of stingless bee queens by offering a large quantity of food to the larvae. Our methodology consisted of determining the amount of larval food needed for the development of the queens, collecting and storing the larval food, and feeding the food to the larvae in acrylic plates. We found that the total average amount of larval food in a worker bee cell of R varia is approximately 26.70 ± 3.55 ?L. We observed that after the consumption of extra amounts of food (25,30,35 and 40[?L) the larvae differentiate into queens (n = 98). Therefore, the average total volume of food needed for the differentiation of a young larva of F. varia queen is approximately 61.70 ± 5.00 ?L. In other words; the larvae destined to become queens eat 2.31 times more food than the ones destined to become workers. We used the species Frieseomelitta varia as a model, however the methodology can be reproduced for all species of stingless bees whose mechanism of caste differentiation depends on the amount of food ingested by the larvae.

This study aimed to indentify the main floral families in honey from apiaries in the Atlantic Forest and Sergipe state coast. Honey samples from these apiaries were studied, as well as plants that grow around them, which can be used as a source of foraging for bees. The palynological technique was used to compare the pollen content of honey samples with the pollen grains from leaves of plants found in the vicinity of the apiaries to assess whether they had been visited by bees. The results of studies in both sites were similar in terms of incompatibility of families found in the apiary vicinity and honey. Thus, it was possible to observe that in honey samples from the coast and in the remaining Atlantic forest, the number of families was greater than the number of families found in the apiary vicinity, which highlights the diversity of plants visited by bees and a possible expansion of the visited area for food search. This diversity suggests an adaptive foraging behavior to plant resources available in the environment, which may facilitate the pollination of these botanical families and consequently improve their genetic quality.",Food preferences; Honey; Palynology; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857848363

A critical function that bacteria perform for their honey bee hosts, but one that is poorly understood, is the transformation of worker-collected pollen into bee bread, a nutritious food product that can be stored for long periods in colonies. We used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to comprehensively characterize in genetically diverse and genetically uniform colonies the active bacterial communities that are found on honey bees, in their digestive tracts, and in bee bread. This method provided insights that have not been revealed by past studies into the content and benefits of honey bee-associated microbial communities. Colony microbiotas differed substantially between sampling environments and were dominated by several anaerobic bacterial genera never before associated with honey bees, but renowned for their use by humans to ferment food. Colonies with genetically diverse populations of workers, a result of the highly promiscuous mating behavior of queens, benefited from greater microbial diversity, reduced pathogen loads, and increased abundance of putatively helpful bacteria, particularly species from the potentially probiotic genus Bifidobacterium. Across all colonies, Bifidobacterium activity was negatively correlated with the activity of genera that include pathogenic microbes; this relationship suggests a possible target for understanding whether microbes provide protective benefits to honey bees. Within-colony diversity shapes microbiotas associated with honey bees in ways that may have important repercussions for colony function and health. Our findings illuminate the importance of honey bee-bacteria symbioses and examine their intersection with nutrition, pathogen load, and genetic diversity, factors that are considered key to understanding honey bee decline. © 2012 Mattila et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858039964

In each area, worker bees were collected from 10 colonies, 10 workers per colony. To assess the diversity on the right wings of worker bees, 15 landmarks were plotted and the measures were used in analysis of variance and multivariate analysis, principal component analysis, discriminant analysis and clustering analysis. There were significant differences in the shape of the wing venation patterns between colonies of two sites (Wilk's? = 0.000006; p < 0.000001), which is probably due to the geographical distance between places of origin which impedes the gene flow between them.

To illuminate the origin of such asymmetry, we study a model network in which links are assigned under generalized preferential-selection rules between two groups of nodes and find the sensitive dependence of the resulting connectivity pattern on the model parameters. The nonlinearity of preferential selection can come from interspecific interactions among animals and among plants.

Previous studies suggest that pollination network structure remains nested while network composition is highly dynamic. However, little is known about temporal variation in the structure and function of plant-pollinator networks, especially in species-rich communities where the strength of pollinator competition is predicted to be high. Here we quantify temporal variation of pollination networks over four consecutive years in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains biodiversity hotspot in China. We found that ranked positions and idiosyncratic temperatures of both plants and pollinators were more conservative between consecutive years than in non-consecutive years. Although network compositions exhibited high turnover, generalized core groups - decomposed by a k-core algorithm - were much more stable than peripheral groups. Given the high rate of turnover observed, we suggest that identical plants and pollinators that persist for at least two successive years sustain pollination services at the community level. Our data do not support theoretical predictions of a high proportion of specialized links within species-rich communities. Plants were relatively specialized, exhibiting less variability in pollinator composition at pollinator functional group level than at the species level. Both specialized and generalized plants experienced narrow variation in functional pollinator groups. The dynamic nature of pollination networks in the alpine meadow demonstrates the potential for networks to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in species composition in a high biodiversity area. © 2012 Fang, Huang.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863237606

Past studies have focused largely on terrestrial species with biotic pollination modes, but precise causes and consequences of pollen limitation remain unknown. Here, sex ratio, seed production, seed recruitment, and viability were examined in intertidal populations of a dioecious, abiotically pollinated marine angiosperm, Phyllospadix torreyi (Torrey's surfgrass). Using field surveys and a common garden experiment, this study was conducted near Santa Barbara, California, USA, from 2007 to 2008. Reproduction and recruitment of P. torreyi primarily occur near the parental source (tens of meters) because female reproductive success ratio (RSR, measured as the ratio of fertilized ovules to total ovules) increased with local pollen production (RSR range: 0.02-0.71), and seed recruitment was predicted by local (site) seed production and elevation zone within the intertidal. Low RSR at sites with extreme male rarity (&lt;0.3 male flowering shoots m ?2) suggests that pollen limitation is occurring within this system. Seed recruitment was predicted by local (site) seed production and elevation zone (area of potential seed recruitment within the intertidal). The occurrence of seed production and recruitment at sites with extreme male rarity suggests some dispersal of seeds and pollen extending beyond the immediate vicinity of the site. Pollen or seed dispersal over longer distances, although rare, may reduce habitat fragmentation by facilitating colonization of newly available habitat. Localized pollen availability affected seed quantity but not quality; seed germination and growth were uniform among sites. © 2012 Inter-Research.",Dioecy; Dispersal; Pollen limitation; Reproductive failure; Seagrass; Seed viability; Sex bias; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858113812

In plants, evolution of earlier flowering requires that the individuals bearing genes for early flowering successfully reproduce; for non-selfing, zoophilous species, this means that early flowering individuals must be visited by pollinators. In a laboratory experiment with artificial flowers, we presented captive bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) with flower arrays representing stages in the phenological progression of a two-species plant community: Bees that had been foraging on flowers of one colour were confronted with increasing numbers of flowers of a second colour. Early flowering individuals of the second 'species' were significantly under-visited, because bees avoided unfamiliar flowers, particularly when these were rare. We incorporated these aspects of bee foraging behaviour (neophobia and positive frequency dependence) in a simulation model of flowering-time evolution for a plant population experiencing selection against late flowering. Unlike simple frequency dependence, a lag in pollinator visitation prevented the plant population from responding to selection and led to declines in population size. Pollinator behaviour thus has the potential to constrain evolutionary adjustments of flowering phenology. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Climate change; Colour preference; Frequency dependence; Hysteresis; Phenology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63849122783

The mechanistic model we developed shows that a specialization of T. europaeus on Chiastocheta could be the result of an attempt to escape over-exploitation by closing its flower. The pressure for such an escape increases with the parasite's frequency and its pollination efficiency but decreases in the presence of alternative pollinators. The resulting specialization is a priori an unstable one, leading either to strong evolutionary oscillations, or to evolutionary suicide due to over-exploitation of the plants. It becomes stable if the plants develop a defense mechanism to regulate their parasite's population size and limit seed-exploitation. The development of a counter-measure by the latter can destabilize the mutualism depending on the costs linked to such a trait. On the other hand, we find that a specialization on a purely mutualistic basis would require a preexisting high diversity of flower-opening within the population. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Chiastocheta; Coevolution; Exploitation; Parasitism; Trollius europaeus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455173191

Functional and expression analyses in distantly related core eudicots and monocots implicate independent recruitment of class II TCP genes in the evolution of flower bilateral symmetry. Furthermore, available evidence suggests that monocot flower bilateral symmetry might also have evolved through changes in B-class homeotic MADS-box gene function.Methods: In order to test the non-exclusive hypotheses that changes in TCP and B-class gene developmental function underlie flower symmetry evolution in the monocot family Commelinaceae, we compared expression patterns of teosinte branched1 (TB1)-like, DEFICIENS (DEF)-like, and GLOBOSA (GLO)-like genes in morphologically distinct bilaterally symmetrical flowers of Commelina communis and Commelina dianthifolia, and radially symmetrical flowers of Tradescantia pallida.Results: Expression data demonstrate that TB1-like genes are asymmetrically expressed in tepals of bilaterally symmetrical Commelina, but not radially symmetrical Tradescantia, flowers. Furthermore, DEF-like genes are expressed in showy inner tepals, staminodes and stamens of all three species, but not in the distinct outer tepal-like ventral inner tepals of C. communis.Conclusions: Together with other studies, these data suggest parallel recruitment of TB1-like genes in the independent evolution of flower bilateral symmetry at early stages of Commelina flower development, and the later stage homeotic transformation of C. communis inner tepals into outer tepals through the loss of DEF-like gene expression. © 2012 Preston and Hileman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",B class genes; Commelinaceae; CYCLOIDEA; Homeotic change; Monocots; Teosinte branched1; Tepals,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868311014

In flowering plants, the outcome of hybridization depends in part on the effectiveness of pollinators in interspeciflo pollen transport. In the Asclepias exaltata and A. syriaca (Apocynaceae) hybrid zone in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, extensive introgression has been documented. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the extent of pollinator overlap among A. exaltata, A. syriaca, and their hybrids and (2) identify the insect taxa responsible for hybridization and introgression. • Methods: We observed focal plants of parental species and hybrids to measure visitation rate, visit duration, and per-visit pollinia removal and deposition, and we calculated pollinator effectiveness and importance. • Key results: Visitation rates varied significantly between the 2 yr of the study. Overall, Apis mellifera, Bombus sp., and Epargyreus clarus were the most important pollinators. However, Bombus sp. was the only visitor that was observed to both remove and insert pollinia for both parent species as well as hybrids. • Conclusions: We conclude that Bombus may be a key agent of hybridization and introgression in these sympatric milkweed populations, and hybrids are neither preferred nor selected against by pollinators. Thus, we have identified a potential mechanism for how hybrids act as bridges to gene flow between A. exaltata and A. syriaca. These results provide insights into the breakdown of prezygotic isolating mechanisms. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Apocynaceae; Asclepias exaltata; Asclepias syriaca; Hybridization; Introgression; Pollen deposition; Pollen removal; Pollination effectiveness; Pollinator importance; Pollinia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858605339

Cerinthe major (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) was investigated with regard to: floral morphology, phenology, sexual receptivity during anthesis, the production of nectar and its sugar and amino acid content. The pollinator array of this species was also investigated. . Cerinthe major has showy, pentamerous, hermaphroditic flowers with a deep yellow corolla tube arranged on numerous scorpioid inflorescences. Nectar and pollen are the main floral rewards for pollinators. The arrangement of stamens limits access to nectar and promotes pollen loading onto pollinator bodies as they force their way towards the source of nectar. By limiting the direct exposure of nectar to the environment, the corolla tube and the arrangement of anther filaments seemingly protect nectar from evaporation resulting from high temperatures and low relative humidity during flower anthesis. The green, annular nectary located at the base of the ovary lobes is composed of a very thin epidermis enclosing a dense mass of parenchyma. The epidermis lacks stomata, and the thin cuticle has an irregular surface. The parenchyma cells do not store starch during the pre-secretory stage, suggesting that immediate photosynthesis is the most likely source of nectar carbohydrates. Generally, anthesis lasts 4-5 days; the gynoecium becomes fully receptive on the second day and this is synchronous with anther dehiscence. Since nectar production begins during the bud stage, a substantial volume is available for flower visitors at anthesis. Nectar production decreases drastically in senescent flowers and, if not consumed, the nectar can be re-absorbed. Analysis of sugars revealed a sucrose-dominant nectar (sucrose. =. 93.18. ±. 1.35%). Proline, GABA, taurine, leucine, citrulline and alanine were the main amino acids present and are probably implicated in pollinator flight performance.The bees . Bombus hortorum, . Anthophora sp. and . Eucera sp. were constant and frequent visitors of . C. major flowers. Moreover, the manner in which they interacted with the flower in order to obtain nectar and pollen loads was sufficient evidence for their role as pollinators. Their different foraging behaviours suggest that each species may promote differences in pollen flow both within and among individuals of the population. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",Cerinthe major; Nectar composition and dynamics; Nectary; Pollination; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858278708

Here we synthesize information on a guild of South African plants that are pollinated by functionally similar pompilid wasps in the genus Hemipepsis and investigate the extent of trait convergence in guild members. The guild includes members from three plant families (Apocynaceae, Orchidaceae and Asparagaceae subfamily Scilloideae) and contains remarkably high levels of functional specialization with 18 of the 23 known guild members being pollinated exclusively by Hemipepsis wasps. The distribution of the guild is centred in the moist upland grasslands of eastern South Africa. Qualitative similarities among guild members include dull greenish- or brownish-white flowers, often with purple blotches, mid-summer flowering, sweet spicy scent and exposed nectar. To assess the extent of convergent evolution within the guild, we compared floral traits of guild members with those of congeneric non-wasp-pollinated species. Guild members typically produce moderate volumes (>4?L per flower per day) of concentrated (>50% sugar by weight) sucrose-dominant nectar. The nectar properties of guild members did not, however, differ significantly from those of congeneric species pollinated by other vectors. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of scent data for 15 guild members and 17 congeners (obtained through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of headspace samples and supplemented with published data) yielded little evidence for convergent evolution in the overall scent composition of guild members. However, convergence in floral spectral reflectance was evident in the guild members; in particular, loci for colours of guild members were significantly closer to the guild centroid than loci for colours of congeners, and they formed a distinct cluster in the blue to blue-green region of the hymenopteran colour hexagon. The colours of guild members were also significantly closer to the colour of background vegetation than those of congeneric species, suggesting a role for cryptic colouring in this system. These results confirm convergence in the floral colours of plants that are pollinated by Hemipepsis spider-hunting wasps, but also suggest that other traits, such as nectar properties, do not necessarily evolve during shifts between pollination systems. Identification of particular scent compounds and non-sugar nectar constituents that influence wasp behaviour will be essential for illuminating the extent of biochemical convergence in the guild members. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Colour hexagon; Convergent evolution; Floral filter; Floral syndrome; Floral volatile; Hyacinthaceae; Prey-hunting wasp; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856852816

Cordia lutea, a heterostylous member of the Galápagos flora, was submitted to pollination experiments, visitor observations, nectar sampling, pollen transfer studies, pollen-ovule ratio studies, and pollen measurements. Flowers set fruit and seed via open pollination, autonomous autogamy, facilitated autogamy, facilitated cross-pollination, diurnal pollination, and nocturnal pollination. There was a significant difference in fruit set between flowers experiencing legitimate cross-pollinations (pin × thrum) and those experiencing all other pollination treatments except facilitated autogamy. There was no significant difference in seed set among any of the treatments, but there was a trend toward greater seed set for flowers experiencing open-pollination, legitimate cross-pollination, and nocturnal pollination. There was no significant difference in fruit set or seed set between flowers experiencing diurnal pollination and nocturnal pollination, although there was a trend toward greater seed set resulting from nocturnal pollination. Carpenter bees were the most effective diurnal pollinators, whereas moths were the most effective nocturnal pollinators. Of the two, moths are more efficient at transporting pollen from plant to plant. Results indicate that an overall low productivity of this species is due to pollen limitation exacerbated by nectar robbing.

It proposes that an increase in the resources available to an organism induces a higher relative investment on the most energetically costly sexual structures. In plants, pollination interactions are known to play an important role in the evolution of floral features. Because the SAM directly concerns flower characters, pollinators are expected to have a strong influence on the application of the model. This hypothesis, however, has never been tested. Here, we investigate whether the identity and diversity of pollinators can be used as a proxy to predict the application of the SAM in exclusive zoophilous plants. We present a new approach to unravel the dynamics of the model and test it on several widespread Arum (Araceae) species. By identifying the species composition, abundance and spatial variation of arthropods trapped in inflorescences, we show that some species (i. e. A. cylindraceum and A. italicum) display a generalist reproductive strategy, relying on the exploitation of a low number of dipterans, in contrast to the pattern seen in the specialist A. maculatum (pollinated specifically by two fly species only). Based on the model presented here, the application of the SAM is predicted for the first two and not expected in the latter species, those predictions being further confirmed by allometric measures. We here demonstrate that while an increase in the female zone occurs in larger inflorescences of generalist species, this does not happen in species demonstrating specific pollinators. This is the first time that this theory is both proposed and empirically tested in zoophilous plants. Its overall biological importance is discussed through its application in other non-Arum systems. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Araceae; Flower evolution; Plant-insect interactions; Reproductive strategy; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857450205

In spite of extremely low visitation rates to this early spring-flowering plant, the species is not pollen limited. Although the largest pollen loads are transferred by solitary bees, the key pollinators are bumblebees (mostly the most common species, Bombus terrestris and B. lapidarius) due to their seasonal and floral constancy, and tolerance of bad weather conditions. The current decline of the studied population seems not to be related to the species' pollination or breeding systems but to plant habitat loss.

Furthermore, variation in floral display may affect pollinator response and plant reproductive success through changes in pollinator visitation and availability of compatible pollen. To asses if flower color polymorphism and floral display influences pollinator preferences and movements within and among plants and fitness-related variables we used the self-incompatible species Cosmos bipinnatus Cav. (Asteraceae), a model system with single-locus flower color polymorphism that comprises three morphs: white (recessive homozygous), pink (heterozygous co-dominate), and purple (dominant homozygous) flowers. We measured the preferences of pollinators for each morph and constancy index for each pollinator species, pollination visitation rate, floral traits, and female fitness measures. Flower color morphs differed in floral trait measures and seed production. Pollinators foraged nonrandomly with respect to flower color. The most frequent morph, the pink morph, was the most visited and pollinators exhibited the highest constancy for this morph. Moreover, this morph exhibited the highest female fitness. Pollinators responded strongly to floral display size, while probed more capitulums from plants with large total display sizes, they left a great proportion of them unvisited. Furthermore, total pollinator visitation showed a positive relation with female fitness. Results suggest that although pollinators preferred the heterozygous morph, they alternate indiscriminately among morphs making this polymorphism stable. © 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Attraction traits; Cosmos bipinnatus; Female fitness; Pollinator preference; Pollinator visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858792114

For 16 populations along this gradient, we quantified composition of the pollinator assemblage, pollination efficiency and limitation, and reproductive output. The treelet has a generalized pollination system, but the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes was the most effective pollinator. The relative importance of this hummingbird as a flower visitor within populations influenced pollen transfer and fruit set more strongly than local precipitation. As hummingbirds and other pollinators, including passerine birds and nemestrinid flies, were replaced by bees towards the dry eastern range limit, pollen limitation increased and reproduction eventually failed.

Weak but statistically significant selection was caused by weevil larvae on stem diameter and anther-nectary distance, and by slugs on median-flower date. • In this study, pollinators imposed stronger selection than herbivores on floral traits in L. cardinalis.

Bag X01 Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg 3209, South Africa","Background and AimsPollen-collecting bees are among the most important pollinators globally, but are also the most common pollen thieves and can significantly reduce plant reproduction. The pollination efficiency of pollen collectors depends on the frequency of their visits to female(-phase) flowers, contact with stigmas and deposition of pollen of sufficient quantity and quality to fertilize ovules. Here we investigate the relative importance of these components, and the hypothesis that floral and inflorescence characteristics mediate the pollination role of pollen collection by bees. MethodsFor ten Aloe species that differ extensively in floral and inflorescence traits, we experimentally excluded potential bird pollinators to quantify the contributions of insect visitors to pollen removal, pollen deposition and seed production. We measured corolla width and depth to determine nectar accessibility, and the phenology of anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity to quantify herkogamy and dichogamy. Further, we compiled all published bird-exclusion studies of aloes, and compared insect pollination success with floral morphology. Key ResultsSpecies varied from exclusively insect pollinated, to exclusively bird pollinated but subject to extensive pollen theft by insects. Nectar inaccessibility and strong dichogamy inhibited pollination by pollen-collecting bees by discouraging visits to female-phase (i.e. pollenless) flowers. For species with large inflorescences of pollen-rich flowers, pollen collectors successfully deposited pollen, but of such low quality (probably self-pollen) that they made almost no contribution to seed set. Indeed, considering all published bird-exclusion studies (17 species in total), insect pollination efficiency varied significantly with floral shape. ConclusionsSpecies-specific floral and inflorescence characteristics, especially nectar accessibility and dichogamy, control the efficiency of pollen-collecting bees as pollinators of aloes. © The Author 2012.

Since most weeds rely on mutualistic relationships in their new environment, they may act as new competitors for pollinators. Pollinator competition is likely to be density dependent, but it is often difficult to disentangle competition caused by flower quality from effects caused by flower quantity. In order to test the effects of the presence and number of flowers of the invasive weed Bunias orientalis on the insect visitation rates in a native species (Sinapis arvensis), we performed two replacement experiments using plants with standardised flower numbers. The visitation rates in S. arvensis were significantly higher than in B. orientalis and the number of insect visits dropped significantly with increasing density of S. arvensis flowers. These results suggest that intraspecific competition among flowers of S. arvensis is stronger than the competitive effect of alien flowers. As flowers of B. orientalis do not seem to distract visitors from S. arvensis, it is unlikely that pollinator competition between these two plant species plays a crucial role. However, it cannot be excluded that mass blossom stands of B. orientalis may distract flower visitors from native species. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Competitive displacement; Facilitation; Flower visitors; Invasive plants; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863722048

Thus, it may be expected that solitary bees are more effective pollinators than honeybees when foraging on the same floral resource. To test this, we studied two Wahlenbergia species (Campanulaceae) in South Africa that are visited by both social honeybees and solitary bees, and which are shown here to be genetically self-incompatible and thus reliant on pollinator visits for seed production. Contrary to expectation, the solitary bee Lipotriches sp. (Halictidae) and social bee Apis mellifera (Apidae), which were the two most frequent visitors to flowers of the study species, were equally effective pollinators in terms of the consequences of single visits for fruit and seed set. Both bee species preferentially visited female phase flowers, which contain more nectar than male phase flowers. Male solitary bees of several genera frequently shelter overnight in flowers of both Wahlenbergia species, but temporal exclusion experiments showed that this behavior makes little contribution to either seed production or pollen dispersal (estimated using a dye particle analogue). Manipulation of flower color using a sunscreen that removed UV reflectance strongly reduced visits by both bee groups, while neither group responded to Wahlenbergia floral odour cues in choice tests. This study indicates that while flowers of Wahlenbergia cuspidata and W. krebsii are pollinated exclusively by bees, they are not under strong selection to specialise for pollination by any particular group of bees. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Apis mellifera; Bee pollination; Breeding system; Lipotriches; Pollinator effectiveness; Specialisation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857448087

For example, bird pollination was shown to have arisen only in insect-pollinated lineages that already produced greater amounts of floral cyanide, a feature that reduces florivory. We examine a central conclusion of that study, and a common assumption in the literature, that bird pollination arose in insect-pollinated lineages, rather than the reverse. • Methods: We combined morphological and DNA data to infer the phylogeny and age of the Australian genus Hakea, using 9.2 kilobases of plastid and nuclear DNA and 46 morphological characters from a taxonomically even sampling of 55 of the 149 species. • Key results: Hakea is rooted confidently in a position that has not been suggested before. The phylogeny implies that bird pollination is primitive in Hakea and that multiple shifts to insect pollination have occurred.

Floral syndromes have been used successfully to develop hypotheses about pollination systems but can be misleading when plants have unusual floral morphology or mechanisms of pollen transfer. A case in point is . Erica halicacaba, a local endemic shrub on the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. Its short-tubed greenish-yellowish flowers with a narrow aperture have been considered to be insect pollinated. However, field observations, selective exclusion experiments and analysis of pollen loads all indicate that its primary pollinator is the Orange-breasted Sunbird (. Anthobaphes violacea). These sunbirds were common visitors and netted individuals carried large numbers of . E. halicacaba pollen tetrads on their culmens, rather than on their head plumage as is typical for Cape . Erica species with longer tubular flowers. Plants of . E. halicacaba from which vertebrates were excluded had a lower incidence of anther tripping and set significantly fewer seeds than those exposed to both birds and insect visitors. Nectar in . E. halicacaba is present in small concentrated amounts and, typical of sunbird-pollinated plants, is dominated by sucrose. Flowers often had holes in their corollas and we identified ants, specifically . Myrmicaria nigra, as the likely agents. This was supported by reduced rates of corolla damage on branches from which crawling insects such as ants were experimentally excluded. These findings indicate that considerable caution should be applied when attempting to predict pollinators from floral syndromes, and highlight the role that crawling insects can play in damaging flowers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Anthobaphes violacea; Bird pollination; Erica halicacaba; Ericaceae; Floral Syndromes; Nectar; Nectar Robbing; Pollination Biology,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84055214116

We investigated these traits in three species of Afromontane mistletoe Globimetula braunii, Agelanthus brunneus and A. djurensis in Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve, Nigeria, to test whether the traits were reliable indicators of relative reproductive success and could be used to predict relative vulnerability to pollinator loss. For each mistletoe species, insect and bird visitors were identified during a 160-240-min observation period of 4-10 plants and their roles in flower opening and fruit set were investigated using exclusion experiments applied to 250-500 flowers. We found that all three mistletoes are self-compatible but not capable of autonomous self-fertilization.

However, the timing and synchrony of male and female flowering in wheat is a crucial determinant of seed set and may be an important factor affecting gene flow and resilience to climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for assessing the timing and synchrony of flowering in wheat, Triticum aestivum. MethodsFrom the onset of flowering until the end of anthesis, the anther and stigma activity of each floret was assessed on the first five developing ears in potted plants grown under ambient conditions and originating from 'Paragon' or 'Spark-Rialto' backgrounds. At harvest maturity, seed presence, size and weight was recorded for each floret scored. Key Results and ConclusionsThe synchrony between pollen dehiscence and stigma collapse within a flower was dependent on its relative position in a spike and within a floret. Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approx. 30% and did not change throughout the duration of flowering. A modelling exercise parameterized by flowering observations indicated that the temporal and spatial variability of anther activity within and between spikes may influence the relative resilience of wheat to sudden, extreme climatic events which has direct relevance to predicted future climate scenarios in the UK. © The Author 2012.

This is especially important in regions experiencing rapid anthropogenic change that threatens the survival of these important pollinators and the ecological services that they provide. To study occurrence trends at the community level, bees visiting a common and abundant floral resource species, Tecoma stans, were sampled across three urban landscapes located in the tropical dry forest of northwestern Costa Rica. Frequency-of-visitation counts that measured both bee visitor abundance and bee taxon richness were used to assess foraging variation and individual resource constancy, and to evaluate the effects of plant resource characteristics (floral abundance, resource size, and vertical structure), city size, and regional landscape context on bee occurrence. Of the resource characteristics studied, only the total number of flowers at a food resource had a significant impact on bee occurrence, with resources that possessed more flowers attracting more bees and more bee types. The taxon richness observed at a resource increased significantly as city size increased, but there was no association between city size and bee visitor abundance. Cities located within similar regional landscapes had similar bee community composition, indicating that the surrounding landscape influenced species presence and absence patterns. The patterns of occurrence recorded in this study can be seen as a positive result for bee conservation and management in urban landscapes; the correlation of high bee visitation with abundant flowers suggests that efforts to increase resource availability should be successful in producing a corresponding increase in bee presence. © 2012 Urban Habitats.",Bees; Costa Rica; Foraging; Hymenoptera; Pollinators; Regional landscape; Resource characteristics; Tecoma stans; Tropical dry forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865103444

GPC-B1 is a NAC transcription factor and has a paralogous copy on chromosome 2B in wheat, GPC-B2. The closest rice homolog to both wheat GPC genes is Os07g37920 which is located on rice chromosome 7 and is colinear with GPC-B2. Since rice is a diploid species with a sequenced genome, we initiated the study of Os07g37920 to develop a simpler model to study senescence and mineral remobilization in cereals. We developed eleven independent RNA interference transgenic rice lines (Os07g37920-RNAi) and 10 over-expressing transgenic lines (Os07g37920-OE), but none of them showed differences in senescence. Transgenic Os07g37920-RNAi rice plants had reduced proportions of viable pollen grains and were male-sterile, but were able to produce seeds by cross pollination. Analysis of the flower morphology of the transgenic rice plants showed that anthers failed to dehisce. Transgenic Os07g37920-OE lines showed no sterility or anther dehiscence problems. Os07g37920 transcript levels were higher in stamens compared to leaves and significantly reduced in the transgenic Os07g37920-RNAi plants. Wheat GPC genes showed the opposite transcription profile (higher transcript levels in leaves than in flowers) and plants carrying knock-out mutations of all GPC-1 and GPC-2 genes exhibited delayed senescence but normal anther dehiscence and fertility. These results indicate a functional divergence of the homologous wheat and rice NAC genes and suggest the need for separate studies of the function and targets of these transcription factors in wheat and rice. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Male sterility; NAC transcription factor; Rice; Senescence; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857059913

We present a study of its reproductive biology to look for the causes of its threatened status. It was carried out in natural populations at Cap de Catalunya and Coves Blanques and in ex-situ cultivated plants on the campus of the Universitat de les Illes Balears. We examined (1) the flowering and fruiting phenology, reproductive potential and reproductive success; (2) the pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio and mating system; (3) the identities and numbers of pollinators; (4) the germination potential and the effect of temperature on the germination process; and (5) the seedling performance of this species. The results indicated that under natural conditions, an average individual produced approximately 100 seeds and cross-pollination was the most effective mating system. Pollination was myrmecophilous, and the germination potential was high (76-97%), but seedling survival after the first summer was low (7-54%). We conclude that the major threats to this species are fundamentally extrinsic in character and are related to changing climatic conditions, soil erosion and alteration, and umbel predation. Given that cross-pollination yields greater reproductive success and that pollination is myrmecophilous, lower population densities would lead to lower reproductive success for the species. Therefore, conservation efforts should focus primarily on habitat conservation and on ex-situ conservation through the establishment of an ex-situ population and the maintenance of a seed bank. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Balearic Islands; Dichogamy; Mating system; Pollination; Reproductive success; Threatened species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857368320

To search for parthenocarpic genetic resources in pear, 31 pear accessions [20 Chinese pears (13 Pyrus bretschneideri, seven Pyrus ussuriensis), five European pears (Pyrus communis), two Japanese pears (Pyrus pyrifolia), and four interspecific hybrids] were subjected to flower emasculation and left unpollinated, and then the fruit-set ratio and fruit enlargement were investigated. All European pears examined had a stable and high degree of fruit set, and 'La France' had high fruit enlargement. The possibility of stenospermocarpy was ruled out, because the emasculated flowers were left unpollinated in paper bags and the absence of seed was confirmed in the enlarged fruits. Neither Chinese nor Japanese pears treated with emasculation and no pollination showed consistently stable fruit set and fruit enlargement. An analysis of parthenocarpy in the offspring of 'La France' suggested that both high fruit set and fruit enlargement were inherited and that it should be possible to introduce parthenocarpy into Japanese pears. Although parthenocarpic 'La France' fruits weighed slightly less than those from cross-pollinated flowers, their cortex enlargement compared favorably with that seen with cross-pollinated ones. By using a customized pear cDNA microarray, we compared the gene expression profiles of highly and weakly parthenocarpic cultivars before flowering. Expression of several phenylpropanoid-related genes and photosystem-related genes differed significantly between the two groups. Some of these genes were putatively encoded in the chloroplast genome. These genes might be candidates of DNA markers for achievement of parthenocarpy in Japanese pear breeding. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Microarray; Parthenocarpy; Pear genetic resource; Pyrus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862790541

However, gene flow is a complex process that must be assessed in the context of realistic genetic, management, and environmental conditions. • We measured gene flow from hybrid poplar plantations using morphological and genetic markers, and developed a spatially explicit landscape model to simulate pollination, dispersal, establishment, and mortality in the context of historical and projected disturbance and land-use regimes. • Most pollination and seed establishment occurred within 450m of the source, with a very long tail. Modeled transgene flow was highly context-dependent, strongly influenced by the competitive effects of transgenes, transgenic fertility, plantation rotation length, disturbance regime, and spatial and temporal variation in selection. The use of linked infertility genes even if imperfect, substantially reduced transgene flow in a wide range of modeled scenarios. The significance of seed and vegetative dispersal was highly dependent on plantation size. • Our empirical and modeling studies suggest that transgene spread can be spatially extensive.

We present a three year study on tree seed survival on experimental dishes in an old-growth forest in central Europe in Austria. We addressed species specific, spatial and temporal aspects of post-dispersal seed predation. Seeds of Norway spruce Picea abies, European beech Fagus sylvatica, and silver fir Abies alba were exposed on dishes in different types of exclosures which allowed access only to specific guilds of seed predators. Removal experiments were carried out in two old-growth forests and a managed forest (macro-sites), including micro-sites with and without cover of ground vegetation. We conducted the experiment in three consecutive years with a mast year of beech and spruce before the first year of the study. The seed removal experiments were combined with live trapping of small mammals being potential seed predators. Our experiments showed a distinctly different impact of different predator guilds on seed survival on the dishes with highest removal rates of seeds from dishes accessible for small mammals. We observed differing preferences of small mammals for the different tree species. Seed survival in different macro- and micro-habitats were highly variable with lower seed survival in old growth forests. In contrast to our assumption, and in contrast to the satiation hypothesis which assumes higher seed survival in and directly after mast years, seed survival was lower in the year following the mast year of beech when a population peak of small mammals occurred and higher in intermast periods when subsequently small mammal population crashed. This suggests a higher importance of sporadic masting shortly after mast years in intermast periods for establishment of forest trees provided that pollination efficiency is high enough in such years. Combined with the high seed mortality observed after the mast year, this corroborates the important role of seed predation for forest dynamics. An altered synchrony or asynchrony of masting of different tree species and changed masting frequencies through climate change may thus lead to strong and non-linear effects on forest dynamics. © 2011 The Authors.

In previously abandoned calcareous grasslands, however, many characteristic plant species have been reported missing even decades after the reinstatement of traditional mowing or grazing management. Such grasslands are said to exhibit a colonization credit. This may be particularly true for orchid species, which often rely on highly specialized pollination strategies and mycorrhizal associations for completion of their life-cycle. In this study, we investigated whether restored calcareous grasslands exhibited an orchid colonization credit, whether this credit was associated with the degree of grassland fragmentation, and with particular species' life history traits. Applying the Beals index as a quantitative method to identify suitable habitats, several orchid species were indeed found missing from grasslands deemed suitable. There was no relation, however, between the extent of the colonization credit and the spatial isolation or size of the grasslands. Of all life history traits examined, only a high degree of pollinator specialization could be related to delayed colonization. This may suggest that restoring the pollinator community is an important bottleneck in calcareous grassland restoration.",Beals index; colonization delay; grassland management; habit fragmentation; habitat suitability; life history traits; specialized pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861364869

The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological activity of compounds present in Acmella oleracea (Asteracea) against Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), which is the main pest of tomato crops in Latin America. The selectivity of these compounds to the predator Solenopsis saevissima (Smith) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and to the pollinator Tetragonisca angustula (Latr.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) was also of interest. Results: A bioassay screening with hexane and ethanol extracts from 23 plants was performed. The hexane extract of A. oleraceae was the most active of the extracts and was selected for further study. The following three alkamides were isolated from a hexane extract of the aerial parts of A. oleracea: spilanthol, (E)-N-isobutylundeca-2-en-8,10-diynamide and (R, E)-N-(2-methylbutyl)undeca-2-en-8,10-diynamide. All of the isolated compounds showed insecticidal activity, with spilanthol being the most active (LD 50 = 0.13 ?g mg -1) against T. absoluta. The alkamides were selective to both beneficial species studied. Conclusion: The crude hexane extract of A. oleraceae showed high insecticidal activity and can be used to control T. absoluta in organic or conventional crops. Quantification of LD 50 values of isolated compounds against T. absoluta showed that alkamides could serve as potent insecticides for T. absoluta control programmes. Spilanthol was the main alkamide active isolated. This alkamide is the most promising as it has the highest insecticidal activity and is selective to non-target organisms. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",Bioactive alkamides; Botanical pesticide; Insect control; Secondary metabolites; Tomato leafminer,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856586611

A variety of butterflies, especially nymphalids visit the flowers for nectar and in doing so, they pollinate them. Other foragers include bees, a fly and wasps. Wasps are occasional nectar foragers and effect pollination. Bees are consistent foragers of pollen and/or nectar. Apis bees collect pollen and nectar while Trigona and Ceratina bees collect only pollen due to the short length of the tongue. The fly is an occasional pollen feeder.

The present study examines duration and thermal thresholds for progamic processes in six common plant species (Cerastium uniflorum, Gentianella germanica, Ranunculus alpestris, R. glacialis, Saxifraga bryoides, S. caesia) from different altitudinal zones in the European Alps. Whole plants were collected from natural sites shortly before anthesis and kept in a climate chamber until further processing. Flowers with receptive stigmas were hand-pollinated with allopollen and exposed to controlled temperatures between -2 and 40°C. Pollen performance (adhesion to the stigma, germination, tube growth, fertilisation) was quantitatively analysed, using the aniline blue fluorescence method. Pollen adhesion was possible from -2 to 40°C. Pollen germination and tube growth occurred from around 0 to 35°C in most species. Fertilisation was observed from 5 to 30-32°C (0-35°C in G. germanica). The progamic phase was shortest in G. germanica (2h at 30°C, 12h at 5°C, 24h at 0°C), followed by R. glacialis (first fertilisation after 2h at 30°C, 18h at 5°C). In the remaining species, first fertilisation usually occurred after 4-6h at 30°C and after 24-30h at 5°C. Thus, mountain plants show remarkably flexible pollen performance over a wide temperature range and a short progamic phase, which may be essential for successful reproduction in the stochastic high-mountain climate. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Alpine plants; Fertilisation; Pollen germination; Pollen tube growth; Progamic phase; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856694527

We took a three-step approach to examine if plant and pollinator speciation events were likely driven by coevolution. First, we tested whether there has been co-speciation between yuccas and pollinator yucca moths in the genus Tegeticula (Prodoxidae). Second, we tested whether co-speciation also occurred between yuccas and commensalistic yucca moths in the genus Prodoxus (Prodoxidae) in which reciprocal evolutionary change is unlikely. Finally, we examined the current range distributions of yuccas in relationship to pollinator speciation events to determine if plant and moth speciation events likely occurred in sympatry or allopatry. Co-speciation analyses of yuccas with their coexisting Tegeticula pollinator and commensalistic Prodoxus lineages demonstrated phylogenetic congruence between both groups of moths and yuccas, even though moth lineages differ in the type of interaction with yuccas. Furthermore, Yucca species within a lineage occur primarily in allopatry rather than sympatry. We conclude that biogeographic factors are the overriding force in plant and pollinator moth speciation and significant phylogenetic congruence between the moth and plant lineages is likely due to shared biogeography rather than coevolution. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Co-speciation; Mutualism; Pollination; Prodoxus; Tegeticula,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856269298

In Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis longicornu, two Mediterranean orchid sister-species, we used molecular and morphological analyses, together with estimates of pollination success and experimental crosses, to assess whether floral isolation can shelter the species genomes from genetic admixture on secondary contact. We found substantial genetic and morphological homogenization in sympatric populations in combination with an apparent lack of postmating isolation. We further detected asymmetric introgression in the sympatric populations and an imbalance in cytotype representation, which may be due either to a difference in flowering phenology or else be a consequence of cytonuclear incompatibilities. Estimates of genetic clines for markers across sympatric zones revealed markers that significantly deviated from neutral expectations. We observed a significant correlation between spur length and reproductive success in sympatric populations, which may suggest that directional selection is the main cause of morphological differentiation in this species pair. Our results suggest that allopatric divergence has not led to the evolution of sufficient reproductive isolation to prevent genomic admixture on secondary contact in this orchid species pair. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",allopatric speciation; divergent selection; genetic admixture; genetic clines; Orchidaceae; reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857233511

However, there exist very little knowledge about their spatio-temporal distribution and diversity in agricultural systems of Sub-Sahara Africa and in Uganda. There are no protocols to monitor the status of good pollinator species in these systems. The main aim of this study was to collect baseline information about indicator species of butterfly community in coffee-banana farming systems of central Uganda. Data were collected for 1year (2006) using banana fruit-bait traps, transect walk-and-counts and hand-nets sampling methods. Indicator species of farmland habitats were identified using indicator value method. Species that emerged as significant (P<0.05) suitable indicators were Catopsilia florella, Junonia sophia, Bicyclus safitza, Acraea acerata, Eurema hecabe, Ypthima albida, Zizula hylax, Acraea ventura, Eurema brigitta, Neptidopsis ophione, Junonia eonone, Zizeeria kynsna, Cupidopsis cissus, Junonia chorimene and Acrae uvui. These ubiquitous species were recommended to monitoring programmes as indicator species of butterfly communities delivering pollination services to cultivated and wild plants in farmland environments of central Uganda. Transect count was proposed as the best sampling technique to monitor butterfly species that may be involved in successful pollination activities in farmlands. There is a need to develop strategies to protect linear and nonlinear natural and semi-natural habitats to offer sufficient refugia and breeding sites to butterflies inhabiting farmlands. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Butterfly assemblages; Central Uganda; Coffee-banana agroforests; Indicator species; Lepidoptera pollination services conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855334386

In this study, was tested the hypothesis of antagonism between two solitary bee species of the family Apidae, Eulaema mocsaryi (Euglossini) and Xylocopa frontalis (Xylocopini), visiting the Brazil nut flowers (Bertholletia excelsa: Lecythidaceae) in a central Amazonia agricultural area. The visitation time was analyzed to detect the possible temporal overlap in the foraging of these bees. Furthermore, was analyzed their interspecific interactions for manipulating flower species visited by an opponent species, as well as attempts to attack this opponent. The individuals of Xylocopa frontalis visited the Brazil nut flowers before Eulaema mocsaryi, although the peak visitation of both did not presented significant differences. Neither of the species manipulated flowers recently visited by opponent species, and there were practically no antagonistic interactions between them. Thus, X. frontalis and E. mocsaryi shared the same food source in the flowers of B. excelsa due to differences in their time of visits and non-aggressive way of interacting with the opponent.

To do so, we studied wild pear (Pyrus pyraster), which possesses a gametophytic self-incompatibility system. We determined the S-genotypes in complete samplings of all adult trees from 3 populations using a PCR-RFLP approach. We identified a total of 26 different S-alleles, homologous to S-alleles of other woody Rosaceae. The functionality of S-alleles and their Mendelian inheritance were verified in artificial pollination experiments and investigations of pollen tube growth. The smallest population (N = 8) harbored 9 different S-alleles and showed a mate availability of 92.9%, whereas the 2 larger populations harbored 18 and 25 S-alleles and exhibited mate availabilities of 98.4% and 99.2%, respectively.

Male orchid bees are attracted by a wide range of aromatic substances often produced by flowers. Previous studies found that in some species the males change their aromatic preferences between seasons. In our study we documented seasonal changes of aromatic preferences in five euglossine bee assemblages along a 380-km-long seasonality and precipitation gradient and related them to climatic factors. We found that the proportion of species per site showing changes in their aromatic preference between seasons increased with climatic seasonality towards the south. Those species mainly belong to the genus Euglossa, subgenus Euglossa. We conclude that climatic seasonality mainly affects the orchid bees via the turnover of the aromatic substances provided by the plants. Further, we suggest that the ability to change the aromatic preference between seasons could be interpreted as a phylogenetic pre-adaptation that enabled some species to colonize climatically strongly seasonal habitats. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer-Verlag, France, 2011.",Climatic gradient; Distribution; Generalist; Precipitation; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861994054

The timing and pattern of floral senescence and occurrence of fruit formation were studied following self-, geitonogamous and cross-pollination in 14 epiphytic and two terrestrial orchid species to determine their breeding system and assess the occurrence of floral abscission following pollinaria removal. Both pollination and pollinaria removal caused rapid floral senescence, and the pattern and timing of the floral changes were the same in all treatments. Six Dendrobium species and Pelatantheria insectifera were self-incompatible (SI) and eight other species, including one terrestrial species, were self-compatible (SC). Capsules produced from outcrossing in four SC species, Phalaenopsis cornu-cervi, Eria pubescens, Cleisostoma appendiculatum and Arundina graminifolia, were larger and heavier than those produced after selfing. Reductions in flower life span following pollinaria removal were positively correlated with flower size and longevity of unpollinated flowers but not with position in the inflorescence or nature of the breeding system. Rapid flower senescence following pollinaria removal reported here suggests that it may be widespread in tropical species. The significant association of the response with size of flowers and inflorescences among the species studied suggests that the cost of flower maintenance outweighs the benefit of remaining open for female function after pollinaria have been removed. Both SC and SI species were found among tropical orchids, but variation in capsule size following self- and cross-pollination indicates that there may be a reduction in seed production following selfing, even in SC species, and that fruit formation alone should not be taken as reliable evidence of full self-compatibility. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Breeding system; Incompatibility; Pollinaria removal; Post-pollination; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856706506

Apart from cardiovascular and infectious diseases, allergies seem to be at the forefront of the sequelae of climate change. By increasing temperature and concomitant increased CO 2 concentration, plant growth is affected in various ways leading to prolonged pollination periods in the northern hemisphere, as well as to the appearance of neophytes with allergenic properties, e.g. Ambrosia artemisiifolia (ragweed), in Central Europe. Because of the effects of environmental pollutants, which do not only act as irritants to skin and mucous membranes, allergen carriers such as pollen can be altered in the atmosphere and release allergens leading to allergen-containing aerosols in the ambient air. Pollen has been shown not only to be an allergen carrier, but also to release highly active lipid mediators (pollen-associated lipid mediators), which have proinflammatory and immunomodulating effects enhancing the initiation of allergy.

We compared nectarin composition and abundance in selfing common tobacco (Nicotiana tobaccum) with outcrossing ornamental tobacco plants to elucidate the functional difference of nectarins in different reproductive systems. MethodsCommon tobacco (CT) nectarins were separated by SDS-PAGE and the N terminus of the most abundant nectarin was sequenced via Edman degradation. The full-length nectarin gene was amplified and cloned from genomic DNA and mRNA with hiTail-PCR and RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends), and expression patterns were then investigated in different tissues using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Additionally, high-performance liquid chromatography and enzymatic analyses of nectar sugar composition, and other biochemical traits and functions of the novel nectarin were studied. Key ResultsThe most abundant nectarin in CT nectar is an acidic ?-galactosidase, here designated NT?-Gal. This compound has a molecular mass of 40 013 Da and a theoretical pI of 5·33. NT?-Gal has a conserved ?-Gal characteristic signature, encodes a mature protein of 364 amino acids and is expressed in different organs. Compared with 27 other melliferous plant species from different families, CT floral nectar demonstrated the highest ?-Gal activity, which is inhibited by d-galactose. Raffinose family oligosaccharides were not detected in CT nectar, indicating that NT?-Gal does not function in post-secretory hydrolysis. Moreover, tobacco plant fruits did not develop intact skin with galactose inhibition of NT?-Gal activity in nectar, suggesting that NT?-Gal induces cell-wall surface restructuring during the initial stages of fruit development. Conclusions?-Gal was the most abundant nectarin in selfing CT plants, but was not detected in the nectar of strictly outcrossing sister tobacco species. No function was demonstrated in antimicrobial defence. Therefore, floral nectarins in selfing species maintain their functional significance in reproductive organ development. © The Author 2012.

Host specificity is maintained largely because pollinators are attracted to tree-specific volatiles released from their host figs, but whether the wasps can reproduce if they enter figs of non-host species is unclear. We investigated the reproductive success of Ceratosolen emarginatus (associated with Ficus auriculata) and Ceratosolen sp. (associated with F. hainanensis) in atypical hosts by experimentally introducing foundresses into host and non-host figs. F. auriculata figs entered by Ceratosolen sp. were more likely to abort than if entered by C. emarginatus, but abortion of F. hainanensis figs was not affected by pollinator species. Single C. emarginatus foundresses produced more but smaller offspring in F. hainanensis than in their normal host. Conversely Ceratosolen sp. produced fewer but larger offspring in F. auriculata than in their normal host, probably as a result of having longer to develop. Mean style length differences, relative to the lengths of the wasps' ovipositors, may have dictated the number of offspring produced, with oviposition made easier by the shorter styles in F. hainanensis figs. Our results imply that, in addition to morphological constraints and tree-specific volatiles, reduced reproductive success in atypical hosts can be another factor maintaining host specificity, but for other species only behavioural changes are required for host switching to occur. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Ficus; Fig wasp; Host specificity; Host switching; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863683699

We examined covariation between petal size and color and genetic estimates of outcrossing among populations of the yellow-flowered, bee-pollinated Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia that exhibit striking variation in the mating system. We measured brightness, chroma, and hue, using a spectrophotometer, and petal size, using image analysis for flowers sampled in the field from 25 populations across the species' geographic range. Petals were brighter with higher chroma and lower hue (less red) in large-flowered populations than in small-flowered populations.

Parallel changes in petal size and color in selfing populations from two climatically different regions plus the maintenance of differences in flower size and color between large- and small-flowered populations when grown in a common glasshouse environment suggests genetic differentiation in these traits associated with mating system evolution. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",Beach evening primrose; Flower color; Flower size; Geographic variation; Mating; Outcrossing; Self-fertilization; Spectrophotometry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859200652

The resources used by M. (Ecplectica) tintinnans and M. (Ecplectica) rufithorax were studied in a commercial plot of sunflower and its field margins in the locality of Carlos Casares, province of Buenos Aires. Surveys before, during and after the bloom of sunflower were carried out. The bees emerged synchronously with the beginning of the bloom, but continued foraging for over a month after maturation of the crop. Pollen analyses of scopal loads indicated that sunflower was a major component of the diet. Bees also collected pollen from other Asteraceae during and after the blooming of the sunflowers. Pollen from Ligustrum sp. and Eucalyptus sp., two trees common in the hedgerows, was also collected in significant amounts. The vegetation on the field margins facilitated maintenance of the populations after the blooming of the sunflower. The two species of native Melissodes used pollen of plant taxa that are frequent and widespread in the Pampean agricultural ecosystems. This fact, together with their habit of nesting in aggregations, indicates that these bees represent a valuable resource as crop pollinators. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.",field margins; Melissodes rufithorax; Melissodes tintinnans; oligolectyc; pollen resources,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859170807

Here, we used a heterostylous species with variation in reciprocal herkogamy to test this hypothesis. We measured legitimate and illegitimate pollen flow with fluorescent dyes in four selected populations of Oxalis alpina corresponding to the extremes of a previously reported evolutionary gradient from tristyly to distyly. After the breakdown of tristyly, the observed increment in reciprocal herkogamy between the long and short morphs was associated with a 30% increase in the proportion of dye received from compatible illegitimate pollinations. In all populations, the most likely effective pollen vectors were two Heterosarus bee species.

We investigated pollen dispersal patterns of the hill dipterocarp species Shorea curtisii using a modified Neighbourhood model. Seeds were collected following a sporadic general flowering (GF) event in 2002 and two mass GF events in 1998 and 2005. Seed paternity was then determined to investigate pollen dispersal patterns and the heterogeneity of male fecundity. Pollen dispersal distances were longer, and the effective number of males lower, in the sporadic GF of 2002, than in the mass GF events of 1998 and 2005. There was high between-individual variation in male fecundity, and small trees contributed less than large trees to the analysed seed pool. The results indicate that selective logging may adversely affect the reproduction of such species due to the removal of large trees from the reproductive population. Synthesis. The large number of effective male individuals during the mass GF events provides evidence of Allee effects, suggesting that the mass GF events are of evolutionary significance and may contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity. Future forestry practice needs to take into account variation in male fecundity, pollen dispersal and the mating system to ensure sustainable regeneration. © 2011 The Authors.

'wild blueberry', Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.), in Atlantic Canada. As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Insecticide toxicity; Megachile rotundata; Pollinators; Vaccinium angustifolium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857652083

Selection for MT was accompanied by improving fertility of open pollinated (OP) populations. Self-seed set (ST) was very poor. Some individual selections set seeds up to 88% in MT materials. The enigma of fertility, sterility and absence of inbreeding depressions in berseem was discussed. This was explained as inbreeding tolerance, due to selection for good vigor accompanying inbreeding. The results indicated that selection for high MT seed set could be accompanied by selection for good forage yield. An approach was suggested to develop new composite varieties characterized by high seed fertility and high forage yield. Improved selections for seed production was mainly due to profuse flowering and more flowers/ inflorescence, whereas improved forage yield was mainly due to more tillers / plant and to less degree of plant height. An approach was outlined to produce new composites with high seed setting and good forage. T. alexandrinum is self-compatible, but needs tripping to stimulate self seeds. This is mainly due to the relative position of male and female organs and the presence of bubbles on stigma.

Given the complexity of the structure, we assume that little variation is possible if functionality is to be maintained. To test this, we investigated how much floral diversity exists in the clade and whether this diversity potentially influences the breeding system and placement of pollen on the pollinator. Flowers of 66 species covering the five major phylogenetic clades of the family were analysed. All species are similar in their basic flower construction: the fleshy staminode forms the tunnel-shaped roof of the flower and narrows the tube with stiff swellings, and the hooded staminode holds the style under tension and narrows the flower entrance with its trigger appendage. Despite morphological diversity of the pollination apparatus, functionality is maintained by coordinated variation of the fleshy and hooded staminodes. Autogamy is usually avoided by herkogamy. However, in a few exceptions, subtle morphological changes alter the breeding system from allogamy to autogamy. Variable floral proportions allow for differential pollen deposition potentially causing mechanical isolation between sister taxa. This study clearly illustrates that structural variation is not only present in the highly synorganized flowers of Marantaceae, but that it also creates potentially new options for evolutionary diversification. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Breeding system; Flower morphology; Herkogamy; Ontogeny; Phylogenetics inferences; Pollen deposition; Pollination; Style movements; Tropics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857050898

The female parasitoids lay a significantly higher number of eggs on pupae (67.7 ± 16.2 female -1) compared to prepupae (20.5 ± 14.5 female -1). The parasitoids differ in their choice for oviposition sites and fecundity on different locations of B.terrestris pupae, and they show most preference for oviposition (32%) as well as fecundity (34.9 ± 15.1 female -1) on the petiole of the host. Larvae of the parasitoids overwinter at low temperatures but larval overwintering duration and post-diapause rearing on original or new hosts do not affect their pupation and adult emergence. Larvae have a higher percentage of pupation (88.0-94.4%) and adult emergence (84.4-92.9%) both on the original and the new host, thus indicate that the parasitoids are highly capable of reproduction in B.terrestris colonies. © 2011 The Authors.

Since the early 1980s, the South African forest industry has obtained genetic material of 25 pine and eucalypt species that represent more than 4 200 trees from 260 natural populations around the world through its participation in Camcore (International Tree Breeding and Conservation Program) at North Carolina State University, USA. This combined genetic testing and conservation program has identified new productive pine species, such as P. tecunumanii and P. maximinoi, that grow well and are resistant in the seedling stage to the pitch canker fungus (Fusarium circinatum). Because of the industry's foresight to assemble genetic material and test alternate species over the last three decades, it was well prepared to immediately develop more-resistant pine hybrids such as P. patula × P. tecunumanii when the pitch canker situation became problematic. The South African forest industry has collectively worked together to established special 20-40 ha conservation parks across the country to hold and protect the original genetic material collected in Central America, Mexico and South-east Asia. Species are conserved in the parks at the population level and are represented by a minimum of 10 open-pollinated families, five trees per family across two sites. The design is based on maintaining an effective population size of approximately 30 with the goal to capture alleles at high frequencies as well as to include a number of rare alleles in the ex situ plantings. The overlying goal is to maintain well-adapted genetic material for future deployment. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.",adaptability; climate change; ex situ conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860326869

The study reveals that elevation and the hour of the day are the main determinants of anthesis and microsporangium dehiscence, because both are related to temperature and humidity. The receptivity of ovulate cone strobili or female strobili occurred earlier at the lower elevation than at the higher elevation, with a longer receptivity period in the latter case. The phenology of male and female cones varied significantly between years and elevations. The determinations of pollen yield considered various sources of variability, i. e., the number of pollen strobili per branch, strobili per tree, microsporangia per tree and pollen grains per tree. Each of these parameters revealed significant year-to-year and elevation effects. Year-to-year variation in the production of pollen cone and pollen grains with mass production after a three-year period revealed a three-year cycle of masting in pollen production in P. roxburghii. The pollen dispersal decreased quickly with distance from the pollen source. As a consequence, a distance of 600 m was proposed as a minimum to prevent contamination by pollen in the management of seed orchards. The results ultimately suggest that the ample production of pollen grains per tree along with flowering synchrony and long dispersal of pollen grains results in homogeneity in large populations. © 2012 Beijing Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",chir pine; elevation; gene flow; Himalayas; pollen cone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856727630

Stamens are initially recurved when flowers open. Subsequently, within approximately 48 h, the stamens gradually turn upright and eventually enclose the gynoecium. However, the exact mechanism involved in this process is still unresolved. In this study, we found that in recurved stamens at the female stage the cell lengths in the epidermal and hypodermal tissue of the abaxial surfaces were significantly smaller than those of the adaxial surfaces. In erect stamens, however, no significant difference in cell length between the hypodermal tissues of both surfaces was found. Although the difference in cell length between the epidermal tissues for erect stamens was significant, it was smaller than that in recurved filaments. We found no variations in cell number between the epidermal tissues or between the hypodermal tissues among recurved and erect stamens. Thus, we conclude that in Chimonanthus the differential cell growth rates between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of filaments could account for the gradual inward stamen movement following flower opening rather than cell division. Furthermore, application of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA 3) to intact flowers in vitro or the wounding of stigmas significantly promoted the stamen erection rate. Surprisingly, we did not observe any effect on this movement following hand-pollination. Different patterns of stamen movement in Calycanthaceae and their implications for reproductive biology are also discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Calycanthaceae; Chimonanthus; Reproductive biology; Stamen movement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857366742

A maximum-likelihood procedure is introduced here that uses pre- and post-dispersal population samples of biparentally inherited genetic markers to jointly estimate contemporary seed and pollen immigration rates from a set of discrete external sources into a target population. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that accurate estimates and reliable confidence intervals can be obtained using this method for both pollen and seed migration rates at modest sample sizes (100 parents/population and 100 offspring) when population differentiation is moderate (F ST?0.1), or by increasing pre-dispersal samples (to about 500 parents/population) when genetic divergence is weak (F ST=0.01). The method exhibited low sensitivity to the number of source populations and achieved good accuracy at affordable genetic resolution (10 loci with 10 equifrequent alleles each). Unsampled source populations introduced positive biases in migration rate estimates from sampled sources, although they were minor when the proportion of immigration from the latter was comparatively low. A practical application of the method to a metapopulation of the Australian resprouter shrub Banksia attenuata revealed comparable levels of directional seed and pollen migration among dune groups, and the estimate of seed dispersal was higher than a previous estimate based on conservative assignment tests. The method should be of interest to researchers and managers assessing broad-scale nonequilibrium seed and pollen gene flow dynamics in plants. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Gene flow; Introgression; Long-distance dispersal; Maximum likelihood; Pollination; Recent migration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856750843

We investigated the role of (E)-?-caryophyllene in floral defense against a microbial pathogen. This sesquiterpene is a common volatile compound emitted from flowers, and is a major volatile released from the stigma of Arabidopsis thaliana flowers. • Arabidopsis thaliana lines lacking a functional (E)-?-caryophyllene synthase or constitutively overexpressing this gene were challenged with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which is a bacterial pathogen of brassicaceous plants. • Flowers of plant lines lacking (E)-?-caryophyllene emission showed greater bacterial growth on their stigmas than did wild-type flowers, and their seeds were lighter and misshapen. By contrast, plant lines with ectopic (E)-?-caryophyllene emission from vegetative parts were more resistant than wild-type plants to pathogen infection of leaves, and showed reduced cell damage and higher seed production. Based on invitro experiments, (E)-?-caryophyllene seems to act by direct inhibition of bacterial growth, rather than by triggering defense signaling pathways. • (E)-?-Caryophyllene thus appears to serve as a defense against pathogens that invade floral tissues and, like other floral volatiles, may play multiple roles in defense and pollinator attraction. © 2011 The Authors.

The Asteraceae, which is the largest family of flowering plants, is an ideal system in which to study this trait, as many species within the family exhibit a compound inflorescence containing both bilaterally symmetric (i.e., zygomorphic) and radially symmetric (i.e., actinomorphic) florets. In sunflower and related species, the inflorescence is composed of a single whorl of ray florets surrounding multiple whorls of disc florets. We show that in double-flowered (dbl) sunflower mutants (in which disc florets develop bilateral symmetry), such as those captured by Vincent van Gogh in his famous nineteenth-century sunflower paintings, an insertion into the promoter region of a CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like gene (HaCYC2c) that is normally expressed specifically in WT rays is instead expressed throughout the inflorescence, presumably resulting in the observed loss of actinomorphy. This same gene is mutated in two independent tubular-rayed (tub) mutants, though these mutations involve apparently recent transposon insertions, resulting in little or no expression and radialization of the normally zygomorphic ray florets. Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of CYC-like genes from across the family suggests that different paralogs of this fascinating gene family have been independently recruited to specify zygomorphy in different species within the Asteraceae. © 2012 Chapman et al.

We undertook this in two ways, first using scanning electron microscopy we investigate the micromorphology of petals and sepals, followed by expression studies of genes usually responsible for the formation of petaloid structures. From our data, we conclude that R. atrosanguineum petaloid sepals lack micromorphological characteristics of petals and that petaloid sepals did not evolve through regulatory evolution of B-class MADS box genes, which have been shown to specify second whorl petal identity in a number of model flowering plant species including snapdragon.

Here, we tested whether a similar tritrophic effect occurs in the African OPVs 'Nyamula' and 'Jowi'. Herbivore induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) were collected from plants exposed to egg deposition by the stemborer Chilo partellus. In a four-arm olfactometer bioassay, the parasitic wasp Cotesia sesamiae preferred samples containing HIPVs from plants with eggs to samples collected from plants without eggs. EAG-active compounds, including (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT), were released in higher amounts from the egg induced headspace samples. Our results suggest that this oviposition trait is not limited to S.

Understanding the factors that regulate pollen tube growth is critical to understanding the processes essential to sexual reproduction. Many pollen tube growth assays (PTGAs) have shorter and slower pollen tube growth when compared to pollen tube growth through the style. The identification and study of factors that regulate pollen tube growth have been impeded by a lack of an efficient and reproducible PTGA. The objective of this research is to develop a robust assay for Nicotiana tabacum pollen tube growth in an environment that supports sustained and normal growth yet is amenable to testing the effects of specific factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel PTGA, which uses pistils from N. tabacum that lack a mature transmitting tract (TT) due to tissue-specific ablation. The TT-ablated style supports normal pollen tube growth and the hollow structure of the style allows modification of the growth environment by direct injection of test material. This PTGA is robust and allows for rapid and accurate measurement of pollen tube length and pollen tube morphology, supporting pollen tube growth from 20 to 35°C and at pH ranging from 4. 8 to 7. 6. Use of the ablated style for a PTGA is a novel method for the culture of pollen tubes with sustained growth in vivo while permitting the application of treatments to the growing pollen tubes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Buffer compatibility; In vitro; In vivo; Pollen tube elongation; Temperature optimization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857361599

All the examined BC] plants were male fertile while the BC2 plants segregated into male fertile and sterile types. The BC3, BC4, BC5 and BC6 progenies, obtained from the male fertile seed parents, were also segregated into the above mentioned types, whereas backcross progenies obtained from male-sterile seed parents were all male-sterile without any segregation. Backcross and selfed progenies obtained from male fertile plants were fitted well to either 1:1 or 3:1 and 3:1 or 15:1 ratios, respectively. The progenies obtained from crossing between male fertile and sterile backcross progenies were fitted to 3:1 ratio. The segregation patterns indicated that two independent dominant fertility restorer (Rf) genes control the pollen formation of the S. melongena with the cytoplasm of S. grandifolium. It is suggested that progenies containing one or both of dominant Rf loci will allow pollen formation while recessive Rf loci will result the non pollen-forming plants.

Studies have demonstrated that pollinators have preferences according to the sugar composition presented in their diet, and these preferences may be caused by sugar assimilation capacities. However, sugar flavor could also play an important role for sugar preferences of nectar-feeding animals. We evaluated the sugar gustatory thresholds of the broad-billed hummingbird Cynanthus latirostris for sucrose, glucose, fructose and a 1:1 mixture of glucose-fructose. We presented eight C. latirostris to paired feeders containing either a sugar solution or pure water. Additionally, we conducted sugar preference tests at three different concentrations (146, 730 and 1022mmolL -1), to relate sugar preferences with sugar gustatory thresholds. C. latirostris had different gustatory thresholds for the three different sugars tested. At low sugar concentrations (146mmolL -1), sugar selection followed the gustatory thresholds. Hummingbird sugar preference patterns can be affected by different mechanisms, both pre- and post-ingestive. At low concentrations gustatory thresholds may play an important role to determine sugar selection. However, at intermediate and high concentrations, sugar assimilation rates, and velocity of food processing generated by osmotic constraints, can be the mechanisms that explain the sugar selection of these animals. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Cynanthus latirostris; Fructose; Glucose; Gustatory thresholds; Hummingbirds; Sucrose; Sugar flavor; Sugar preferences,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856095685

Five site-year locations of research were conducted in Stillwater, ME and Alburgh, VT to evaluate winter grain-short season corn (WGSSC) double crops compared to full season corn (FSC) (Zea mays L.) for dry matter yield (DMY), weed biomass, and forage quality. Small grains evaluated in the study included winter barley (WB) (Hordeum vulgare L.), triticale (TC) (X Triticosecale), and winter wheat (WW) (Triticum aestivum L.). Low degree-day open-pollinated and hybrid corns were planted following cereal boot or soft dough stage harvest and were evaluated relative to FSC. A moderately winterkilled WB stand reduced DMY by 33 to 50% relative to TC and WW, and WB was weakly competitive against weeds. In most measures, WB forage quality was signifi-cantly higher than TC or WW. Delaying harvest to soft dough stage nearly doubled small grain DMY and forage quality yield for most measures. Corn planted aft er boot stage grain harvest produced 1700 kg ha -1 greater DMY than later planted corn, but weed biomass was not significantly affected by planting date.

A previous study found that field populations of Clarkia exilis (a predominantly autogamous selfer) and its sister species, Clarkia unguiculata (a facultative outcrosser) differ in mean photosynthetic rates and instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi). Here, we investigate the strength and direction of selection on these traits in multiple populations of each taxon to determine whether natural selection may contribute to the phenotypic differences between them. • Methods: In spring 2008, we measured instantaneous gas exchange rates in nine populations during vegetative growth (Early) and/or during flowering (Late). We conducted selection gradient analyses and estimated selection differentials within populations and across pooled conspecific populations to evaluate the strength, direction, and consistency of selection on each trait early and late in the season. • Key results: The direction and relative strength of selection on photosynthetic rates in these taxa corresponds to the phenotypic difference between them; C. exilis has higher photosynthetic rates than C. unguiculata, as well as stronger, more consistent selection favoring rapid photosynthesis throughout the growing season. Patterns of selection on transpiration, WUEi, and the timing of flowering progression are less consistent with phenotypic differences (or lack thereof) between taxa. • Conclusions: We detected several examples where selection was consistent with the phenotypic divergence between sister taxa, but there were also numerous instances that were equivocal or in which selection did not predict the realized phenotypic difference between taxa. © 2012 Botanical Society of America.",Clarkia exilis; Clarkia unguiculata; Evolution of selfing; Life history evolution; Onagraceae; Photosynthesis; Transpiration; Water use efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858605957

However, this species has been attacked by a scale insect (Aulacaspis yasumatsui) and larvae of the butterfly, cycad blue (Chilades pandara peripatria), and many plants have died in the last 20 yr. To establish ex situ conservation of C. taitungensis, seeds were collected from a managed plantation and the Cycas taitungensis Nature Reserve for germination. Some of the seeds from the plantation were stored at 5°C for 8 and 16 mo and germinated at 30/20°C to test germinability. The embryo length was measured during seed incubation at 25/15 and 30/20°C. Germination of seeds from 2007 from the plantation began in weeks 17?18, and final germination was about 58?60°C at 30/20, 25/15, and 25°C incubation. Germination of seeds from 2008 from the same plantation began in week 18, and final germination percentages were 13, 64, 75, and 84% at 20/10, 25/15, 30/20, and 25°C incubation temperatures, respectively. Thus, favorable germination temperatures were 30/20 and 25°C. Initial germination of seeds from 7 individual plants from the Nature Reserve extended from weeks 3 to 18, and final germination ranged 30?88%. These differences may have been due to the wide range in time of pollination in the Nature Reserve, thus resulting in different degrees of seed maturity. Fresh seeds air-dried for 24 h and stored at 5°C for 16 mo retained their original germination, whereas seeds stored with moist moss at 5°C for 16 mo showed decreased germination from 73% (fresh seeds) to 50%. Cold storage at 5°C shortened the time to begin seed germination regardless of the storage conditions with or without moist moss. The underdeveloped embryo of C. taitungensis seeds must increase in length by about 117% before seed germination can occur. We concluded that seeds of C. taitungensis exhibit morphophysiological dormancy, a high temperature at 30/20 or 25°C increases seed germination, and air-dried seeds can be stored at 5°C for at least 16 mo.",Cycas taitungensis; Morphophysiological dormancy; Seed germination; Seed storage; Underdeveloped embryo,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873352818

Here, we had cloned and characterized a bHLH gene (DkMYC1) from 'Luotian-tianshi' persimmon. Phylogenetic analysis of the DkMYC1 protein sequence showed it shared high similarity with AtTT8 and VvMYC1. The expression profile of DkMYC1 was analyzed in two pollination-constant non-astringent (PCNA) type persimmon cultivar fruits with different molecular mechanisms for PA accumulation, and one astringent (non-PCNA) type persimmon by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis during fruits development. Results showed the expression pattern of DkMYC1 was correlated with PA accumulation in the two PCNA and the non-PCNA cultivars during fruits development and the expression of biosynthetic genes which were involved in PA biosynthesis.

The species richness of the bee genus Centris is high in South America. In Brazil, these bees occur in many types of ecosystems. Centris tarsata is an endemic species occurring only in Brazil. No previous studies considered interactions between plants and this bee species in southern Brazil, where it is the most abundant trap-nesting bee. Accordingly, the goals of this study were to investigate plants used by this species for its larval food supply and determine if this bee is polylectic or oligolectic in this region. This work was conducted in the Parque Municipal das Araucárias, Guarapuava (PR), southern Brazil, from Mar. 2002 to Dec. 2003. Samples of pollen were collected from nests of these bees and from flowering plants in grassland and swamp areas where the nests were built. All of the samples were treated with acetolysis to obtain permanent slides. The family Solanaceae was visited most often (71%). Solanum americanum Mill. (28.6%) and Sol. variabile Mart. (42.4%) were the primary pollen sources for C. tarsata in the study area. We found that although C. tarsata visited 20 species of plants, it preferred Solanum species with poricidal anthers and pollen grains with high protein levels. This selective behavior by females of C. tarsata indicates that these bees are oligolectic in their larval provisioning in this region of southern Brazil.",Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata; Provision of pollen grains; Solanum americanum; Solanum variabile,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857944330

This study allowed for the development of predictive models to calculate the main characteristics of the Olea pollen season over the last 20 years from a wide range of meteorological variables. Clear evidence of the relationship between the main features of the Olea pollen season and the temperature recorded during the months before the flowering period could be demonstrated. The mean temperature in February plays an important role in determining reproductive growth and anthesis. It seems that the mean temperature during autumn influences the pollen index of the next year's pollen season. Other environmental factors, such as global radiation and rainfall, may be of great influence in determining the onset and final date of pollination. The accumulated rainfall amount during the pollination period has a negative effect on the pollen index. This may be interpreted as the wash out of airborne pollen by raindrops. However, rainfall during the vegetative period has a positive effect on pollen production. The pollen quantities depend not only on meteorological conditions before pollen release, but also maybe on those prevailing during pollen release. Finally, we could demonstrate an upward trend in annual pollen production and a stability of the mean duration of the Olea pollen season. The increase in Olea pollen abundance coincides with a rise in air temperature over the last 20 years. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.",aerobiology; climate change; forecast; Mann-Kendall test; Oleapollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859173605

Alnus maritima (seaside alder) is a rare tree species with an extremely fragmented distribution of highly isolated populations in the Delmarva Peninsula, Georgia, and Oklahoma. We conducted a mating system study to estimate the outcrossing rate, inbreeding coefficient, biparental inbreeding rate, and correlation of paternity in progeny from a Georgia and an Oklahoma population to investigate the effects of isolation on the A. maritima mating system. Data from nine microsatellite loci showed similarly high multilocus outcrossing rates in both populations (t m = 0.94). Individual tree outcrossing rates were also high (t m = 0.873-1.047). There was no significant biparental inbreeding in either population, but there was significantly higher correlated paternity in the Oklahoma population. Results showed the high outcrossing expected for a wind-pollinated, monoecious species that can promote the maintenance of genetic variation detected in A. maritima seed pools and standing populations. Likewise, pollen flow among Oklahoma populations may promote maintenance of regional genetic variation. However, despite the genetic diversity in the seed pool generated by A. maritima's highly outcrossed mating system, failure of new individuals to be recruited into populations from seed presents an obstacle that will need to be considered when developing conservation strategies for this rare species. © 2012 Southern Appalachian Botanical Society.",Alnus; fragmented populations; Georgia; mating system; Oklahoma; paternity analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859051724

Thirty open-pollinated families, randomly selected among the 58 families used in field progeny tests in Galicia, were cultivated for 30 weeks in a climatic chamber under controlled conditions. Two water regimes (high and low water supply) combined with two nutrient regimes (high and low nutrient supply) were applied by subirrigation. Several growth, branching and dry mass traits were assessed 30 weeks after sowing and compared with field performance (height, diameter and volume) of 4-year-old progeny tests established at three different sites in Galicia (NW Spain). Both the irrigation and the fertilization treatments had a strong effect in all the assessed traits except irrigation for the number of branches. Heritabilities for growth and biomass traits were moderate to high (0.13-0.77) in individual treatments. However, when analyzing all treatments together, the impact of the family × treatment interactions led to a reduction (0.20-0.35) in the heritability estimates. The results indicated that the genotype × water and genotype × nutrient interactions may be important and could not be ignored in the Galician radiata pine breeding program.

We employed a multi-scaled approach to investigate the relative importance of feedstock selection, forb content, patch size, and landscape-scale habitat structure and composition as factors shaping the diversity and abundance of terrestrial arthropod communities and the biomass of functional groups of arthropods associated with the provisioning of ecosystem services. Compared to intensively managed annual corn fields, switchgrass and mixed-grass-forb prairie plantings were associated with a 230% and 324% increase in arthropod family diversity and a 750% and 2,700% increase in arthropod biomass, respectively. Biomass of arthropod pollinators, herbivores, predators, and parasites were similarly the highest in mixed-grass-forb prairie, intermediate in switchgrass plantings, and the lowest in cornfields. Community-wide biomass and that of several functional arthropod groups were positively linked to increasing forest cover and land cover diversity surrounding biomass plantings, while pollinator and detritivore biomass was lower in smaller fields. Results not only suggest that the choice of biomass feedstock will play an important role in shaping within-field arthropod diversity but also indicate an important role for the composition of this surrounding landscape. Collectively, our results suggest that selection of perennially based biomass feedstocks along with careful attention to crop placement have important potential to enhance biodiversity conservation and the provisioning of ecologically and economically important arthropod-mediated ecosystem services in future agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Agroecology; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Landscape ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857629232

Transient expression studies monitored by histochemical ?-glucuronidase assay in seedling segments indicated that A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 was more effective in gene delivery than LBA4404 or GV3101. Of three major selectable genes, the bialaphos resistance (bar) gene and the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) allowed effective selection of transformed cells using 2 mg l -1 glufosinate ammonium herbicide and 50 mg l -1 hygromycin, respectively; whereas the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene did not yield effective selection using 100 mg l -1 kanamycin. Herbicide- or hygromycin-resistant calluses were induced from seedling segments after 2-3 months of selection. Transformants of 'Alamo' with the bar or hpt were obtained 3-4 weeks after the resistant calluses were transferred onto regeneration medium; in contrast, no regenerant was produced from the calluses of 'CIR'. Most of transformants showed normal growth in the greenhouse. Low percentages of mature seeds ranging from 1.7 to 8.7% of husks were obtained from open pollinated plants. Southern blot analysis confirmed stable integration of the bar in selected T0 transformants. Reverse transcription PCR and herbicide/hygromycin tolerance tests indicated expression of transgenes. The optimized transformation protocol using basal parts of seedling as explants shortened the process by 4-5 weeks, and it has potential use for transformation of other switchgrass cultivars. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bioenergy crop; Biofuel plant; Seedling segments; Selectable marker gene; Switchgrass transformation; Transgenic plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856518345

To date, three different SI mechanisms have been identified, and this article focuses on the S-RNase-based mechanism using Petunia (Solanaceae) as a model. The genetic basis of this type of SI was established nearly a century ago; the polymorphic S-locus specifies the genetic identity of pollen and the pistil. Molecular genetic studies carried out since the late 1980s have led to the identification of the polymorphic genes at the S-locus that control self/nonself-recognition between pollen and the pistil. The S-RNase gene, which controls pistil specificity, was identified first, and subsequent sequencing of the S-locus region containing S-RNase led to the identification of the S-locus F-box (SLF) gene (now named SLF1). A transgenic approach was used to show that S2-SLF1 (SLF1 of S2-halotype) of Petunia inflata controls pollen specificity. The S-locus contains additional pollen-expressed F-box genes that show sequence similarity with SLF1, and initially they were thought not to be involved in pollen specificity. However, further studies of SLF1 suggested that it is not the only pollen specificity gene. Indeed, it has recently been shown that two previously identified SLF-like genes in P. inflata (now named SLF2 and SLF3) and a yet unknown number of additional SLF-like genes (named SLF4, SLF5, etc.) collaboratively function to control pollen specificity. The significance and implications of this new finding are discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877987970

Wilczek) has created an interest among plant breeders to develop hybrid mungbean cultivars. The objective of this study was to compare levels of heterosis among four F 1 hybrids of mungbeans with different genetic distance. The hybrids were developed by using Sukhothai (SKT) as the female parent and pollinated by male parents of different genetic distance as revealed by SSR markers. They were H192 (close distance), C357 (moderate distance), TC1965 (high distance) and W166 (very high distance). The results revealed that the F1 from the parents with larger genetic distance showed higher heterosis in yield per plant and number of pods per plant. Thus SSR markers combined with yield components can be used to identify parental lines with high genetic distance for hybrid seed production in mungbean.

Leaf fall and flushing events occur during premonsoon season; leaf flushing extends into the monsoon season. Flowering occurs during late dry season and early monsoon season. The flowers are bisexual and obligately outcrossed and this is enforced by selfincompatibility. Protogyny is a device to promote outcrossing, but it is weak. However, it is partly substantiated by gradual anther dehiscence over a period of six hours. Individual trees flower for a brief period of three weeks with massive floral display. The flowers offer both nectar and pollen for the foragers; the nectar provides five essential amino acids - threonine, arginine, histidine, lysine and methionine, and also some non-essential amino acids. The plant is entomophilous, and cross-pollination is effected mainly by large bees, wasps and butterflies. The natural fruit set is around 6% as against the 62% realized in manual xenogamous pollinations. Fruits fall to the ground when mature and dry, but wind is also instrumental in shedding fruits. The fallen fruits are dispersed by rain water and the seeds germinate and establish seedlings depending on the soil status. The study suggests that T. pallida does not suffer from pollinator limitation to maximize fruit set but from the limitation of compatible pollen, flower and fruit predation by a beetle, fruit predation by a rodent and fruit fungal infestation.

These two biophysical characteristics are mainly determined by pollen water content. Three years of experiments were carried out to measure biophysical characteristics of pollen at different times of emission within the day. In a first part, we proposed a simple model to predict pollen water content at emission as a function of air vapour pressure deficit. We found that by setting a constant duration of pollen dehydration in the anthers the model predicts accurately pollen water content variations at emission. In a second part, we related pollen water content and settling velocity distribution of viable and non-viable pollen grains. We used with success settling velocity distribution as a proxy to estimate fraction of spheroid pollen, water content distribution of spheroid pollen and pollen viability rate. In addition, we validated with success the estimations of viability rate. In a third part, based on above models, we estimated the effects of air humidity on cross-pollination risks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Dehydration; Emission; Pollen; Settling velocity; Viability; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856256356

Box. 80208, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Partial fruit set failure phenomenon is one of the major problems that limit tree productivity of some date palm cultivars under hot arid regions. As an attempt to understand the nature of this problem, the effects of pollinator type and pollination method with bunch bagging following pollination on fruit set and bunch weight of 'Nabbut-Ali' and 'Sabbaka' date cultivars which are suffering partial fruit set failure were studied. The results showed that fruit set was not significantly affected either by pollinator type or pollination method in both cultivars during 2010 and 2011 seasons. Fruit set was higher in 2011 than 2010 season only in 'Nabbut-Ali' cultivar. In this respect, there were significant interaction effects between season and both of pollinator type and pollination method in 'Nabbut-Ali' cultivar. The pollinator 'Hada-8' produced lower bunch weight than all the other pollinators in 'Nabbut-Ali' cultivar. Also, the bunch weight was higher in the spray than in the traditional pollination. However, in 'Sabbaka' cultivar the bunch weight was not affected by pollinator type or pollination method. Bunch weight was higher in 2011 than 2010 season only in 'Nabbut-Ali' cultivar. The physical and biochemical quality characteristics of fruit were significantly affected by pollinator type and pollination method, upon cultivar, and were greatly lower in 2011 than 2010 season. Generally, under the conditions of Hada Al-Shame valley, neither of the used pollinators nor the pollination methods gave satisfactory level of fruit set in both 'Nabbut-Ali' and 'Sabbaka' date palm cultivars. Possibly, date palms have chilling requirements, upon cultivar, for subsequent normal flowering and fruit setting and this should be considered for each individual cultivar before cultivation in a certain region. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Chilling requirement; Date palm; Fruit set; Pollination; Quality; Yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855878587

We sampled such multiple networks simultaneously in an agroecosystem. We show that the networks varied in their robustness; networks including pollinators appeared to be particularly fragile. We show that, overall, networks did not strongly covary in their robustness, which suggests that ecological restoration (for example, through agri-environment schemes) benefitting one functional group will not inevitably benefit others.

We show that herbivory by phloem-feeding aphids inhibits floral volatile emission in white mustard Sinapis alba measured by gas chromatographic analysis of headspace volatiles. The effect of the Brassica specialist aphid Lipaphis erysimi was stronger than the generalist aphid Myzus persicae and feeding by chewing larvae of the moth Plutella xylostella caused no reduction in floral volatile emission. Field observations showed no effect of L. erysimi-mediated floral volatile emission on the total number of flower visits by pollinators. Olfactory bioassays suggested that although two aphid natural enemies could detect aphid inhibition of floral volatiles, their olfactory orientation to infested plants was not disrupted. This is the first demonstration that phloem-feeding herbivory can affect floral volatile emission, and that the outcome of interaction between herbivory and floral chemistry may differ depending on the herbivore's feeding mode and degree of specialisation.

Five strawberry cultivars (from 10 initial ones) including 'Kent', 'Teresa', 'Senga Sengana', 'Chandler' and the breeding clone 1387 were examined and self-pollinated in order to obtain first (S 1), second (S 2) and third (S 3) inbreeding generations. 5 cultivars differing in pedigree which were assumed to have the inbreeding coefficient of zero (F = 0) were compared with self-pollinated populations with expected inbreeding coefficients F = 0.5 (S 1), F = 0.75 (S 2) and F = 0.87 (S 3). The effects of different inbreeding levels were estimated for the following traits: number of inflorescences, number of flowers per inflorescence, fruit yield per plant, fruit number per plant, average fruit weight, weight of leaves per plant and pollen viability. Both positive and negative inbreeding depressions were found in many progenies in terms of the analysed characters. Weight of leaves per plant in S 1, S 2 and S 3 was affected the most (inbreeding depression ID = 62.5, ID = 66.2 and ID = 67.2, respectively).

Among these groups are the Oreosycea fig trees (Ficus, Moraceae) and their Dolichoris pollinators (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae). These partners are distributed in the Paleotropics and Australasia, suggesting that their presence on New Caledonia could result from Gondwanan vicariance. To test this hypothesis, we obtained mitochondrial and nuclear markers (5.3 kb) from 28 species of Dolichoris, used all available sequences for Oreosycea, and conducted phylogenetic and dating analyses with several calibration strategies. All our analyses ruled out a vicariance scenario suggesting instead that New Caledonian colonization by Dolichoris and Oreosycea involved dispersal across islands from Sundaland ca 45.9-32.0 Ma. Our results show that successful long-distance dispersal of obligate mutualists may happen further suggesting that presence of intimate mutualisms on isolated islands should not be used as a priori evidence for vicariance. Comparing our results to a review of all the published age estimates for New Caledonian plant and animal taxa, we showed that support for a vicariant origin of the island biota is still lacking. Finally, as demonstrating a causal relationship between geology and biology requires independent evidence, we argue that a priori assumptions about vicariance or dispersal should not be used to constrain chronograms.

Implementation of agriculture at Qira Oasis is constrained by multiple environmental factors, e. g. strong sunlight, high temperature, drought, and low soil fertility. As a C 4 plant, maize shows a high photosynthetic rate, better adaptability to salinity and desertification, and stronger competitiveness. To research the adaptability of maize to different severities of desertification, field experiments were performed using Shenyu 2000 (a maize cultivated by Shenyang academy of agriculture sciences) growing in a desertification gradient outside of Qira Oasis and subjected the experimental plots to three stress treatments (mild, moderate, and severe desertification, designated D1, D2, and D3, respectively). D1 was located in marginal farmland in the oasis, D2 in the transitional zone between farmland and desert, and D3 on the desert edge of the m long and 15 m wide. The distance between each site was about 1 km, and the moderate and severe desertification sites were separated by a 1-meter-wide shrub forest belt of Calligonum mongolicum. The soil water content, plant height, biomass allocation, proline, malondialdehyde, soluble sugar, chlorophyll (Chl), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and specific leaf area of the maize plants were recorded during the pollination period. Desertification inhibited growth of the maize plants. Growth and photosynthesis parameters showed different rates of decline at different desertification severities. At D3, biomass, proline, malondialdehyde, chlorophyll, carotenoids (Car), Chl a/ b, decreased 291. 88, 110. 38, 50.64, 218. 71, 133. 26, and 21. 35%, respectively, and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters F v / F m, F v / F o, and F m / F o also decreased by 10. 01, 34. 37, and 23. 36%, respectively, compared with those at D1. The soluble sugar content was lowest in the moderate desertification treatment and highest in the severe desertification condition; at D2, it decreased 8.28%, compared with D3. The Car:Chl ratio, specific leaf area and the ratio between underground biomass and total biomass increased with increasing desertification severity. Compared with D1, these parameters increased 36. 68%, 12.86% and 53. 04%, respectively. The results indicated that implementation of agriculture at Qira Oasis is a comprehensive and complex environment. For improved adaptation to desertification, maize plants allocate greater energy to vegetative organs, and also alter their vegetative morphology to adapt to an increasingly severe environment. Although maize plants can adapt to desertification conditions by regulation of metabolic processes and metabolite accumulation, these are also primary factors that limit their normal growth and physiology.

Extending this idea, invasive species whose individuals vary in degree of self compatibility within the native range might be self compatible in invading or weedy populations, due to natural selection on the mating system. We compared mating system between native and invasive ranges for two major world invasives, one annual (Echium plantagineum) and one perennial (Solanum elaeagnifolium). For an additional annual species (Centaurea solstitialis) we compared non-weedy and weedy populations in the native range. No species was strongly spontaneously self pollinating, but the degree of self compatibility after hand pollination varied dramatically. Both annuals were self incompatible in native or non-weedy populations but self compatible in invasive or weedy ones; the reverse was true for the perennial. Individuals within populations of all three species also varied in their degree of self compatibility, suggesting a basis for natural selection, and populations of the same species sharing a status (native/non-weedy, invading/weedy) varied in average self compatibility. These results support the hypothesis that differential selection of progeny during invasion can result in self-compatible populations derived from ancestrally self-incompatible ones, but that this process may be less important in perennial species, which experience multiple opportunities for sexual reproduction. Overall, however, mating system may not operate alone and its contributions to invasiveness may be conditional on other attributes of a species including physiology, morphology, and life history. © 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.",Baker's rule; Centaurea solstitialis; Echium plantagineum; Mating system; Pollination; Self compatibility index; Solanum elaeagnifolium; Variation in self compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856793752

Since organic farming has the potential to mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity, it may also benefit crop pollination, but direct evidence of this is scant. We evaluated the effect of organic farming on pollination of strawberry plants focusing on (1) if pollination success was higher on organic farms compared to conventional farms, and (2) if there was a time lag from conversion to organic farming until an effect was manifested. We found that pollination success and the proportion of fully pollinated berries were higher on organic compared to conventional farms and this difference was already evident 2-4 years after conversion to organic farming. Our results suggest that conversion to organic farming may rapidly increase pollination success and hence benefit the ecosystem service of crop pollination regarding both yield quantity and quality. © 2012 Andersson et al.

In our study we focus on the level of cell shape and on the level of superimposed microstructuring, leading to hierarchical surfaces if both levels are present. While it has been shown that epicuticular wax crystals and cuticular folds strongly reduce insect attachment, and that smooth papillate epidermal cells in petals improve the grip of pollinators, the impact of hierarchical surface structuring of plant surfaces possessing convex or papillate cells on insect attachment remains unclear. We performed traction experiments with male Colorado potato beetles on nine different plant surfaces with different structures. The selected plant surfaces showed epidermal cells with either tabular, convex or papillate cell shape, covered either with flat films of wax, epicuticular wax crystals or with cuticular folds. On surfaces possessing either superimposed wax crystals or cuticular folds we found traction forces to be almost one order of magnitude lower than on surfaces covered only with flat films of wax. Independent of superimposed microstructures we found that convex and papillate epidermal cell shapes slightly enhance the attachment ability of the beetles. Thus, in plant surfaces, cell shape and superimposed microstructuring yield contrary effects on the attachment of the Colorado potato beetle, with convex or papillate cells enhancing attachment and both wax crystals or cuticular folds reducing attachment.

Although in recent years several efforts have been made to study pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility, little information is available about the molecular mechanisms regulating these processes. Here we report the identification of candidate genes involved in pollen-pistil interaction and self-incompatibility in clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.). These genes have been identified comparing the transcriptomes of laser-microdissected stylar canal cells (SCC) isolated from two genotypes differing for self-incompatibility response ('Comune', a self-incompatible cultivar and 'Monreal', a self- compatible mutation of 'Comune').Results: The transcriptome profiling of SCC indicated that the differential regulation of few specific, mostly uncharacterized transcripts is associated with the breakdown of self-incompatibility in 'Monreal'. Among them, a novel F-box gene showed a drastic up-regulation both in laser microdissected stylar canal cells and in self-pollinated whole styles with stigmas of 'Comune' in concomitance with the arrest of pollen tube growth. Moreover, we identify a non-characterized gene family as closely associated to the self-incompatibility genetic program activated in 'Comune'. Three different aspartic-acid rich (Asp-rich) protein genes, located in tandem in the clementine genome, were over-represented in the transcriptome of 'Comune'. These genes are tightly linked to a DELLA gene, previously found to be up-regulated in the self-incompatible genotype during pollen-pistil interaction.Conclusion: The highly specific transcriptome survey of the stylar canal cells identified novel genes which have not been previously associated with self-pollen rejection in citrus and in other plant species. Bioinformatic and transcriptional analyses suggested that the mutation leading to self-compatibility in 'Monreal' affected the expression of non-homologous genes located in a restricted genome region. Also, we hypothesize that the Asp-rich protein genes may act as Ca 2+""entrapping"" proteins, potentially regulating Ca 2+homeostasis during self-pollen recognition. © 2012 Caruso et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857006352

Much effort has been made in order to improve our understanding of berry development, particularly from veraison to post-harvest time. However, the period of berry formation has been poorly investigated, despite its importance. Phytohormones are involved in the control of fruit formation; hence it is important to understand the regulation of their content at this stage. Grapevine is an excellent fleshy-fruit plant model since its fruits have particularities that differentiate them from those of commonly studied organisms. For instance, berries are prepared to cope with stress by producing several antioxidants and they are nonclimacteric fruits. Also its genome is fully sequenced, which allows to identify genes involved in developmental processes. In grapevine, no link has been established between pollination and phytohormone biosynthesis, until recently. Here we highlight relevant findings regarding pollination effect on gene expression related to phytohormone biosynthesis, and present results showing how quickly this effect is achieved.© 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Anthesis; Berry formation; Fruit set; Grapevine; Parthenocarpy; Phytohormones; Pollination; Vitis vinifera; VvGA20ox; VvNCED1,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856718076

However, the learning mechanisms behind such information use can allow animals to be flexible in the cues that are used. This raises the question of whether conspecific cues are inherently more influential than cues provided by heterospecifics, or whether animals can simply use any cue that predicts fitness enhancing conditions, including those provided by heterospecifics. To determine how freely social information travels across species boundaries, we trained bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to learn to use cues provided by conspecifics and heterospecific honey bees (Apis mellifera) to locate valuable floral resources. We found that heterospecific demonstrators did not differ from conspecifics in the extent to which they guided observers' choices, whereas various types of inorganic visual cues were consistently less effective than conspecifics. This was also true in a transfer test where bees were confronted with a novel flower type. However, in the transfer test, conspecifics were slightly more effective than heterospecific demonstrators. We then repeated the experiment with entirely naïve bees that had never foraged alongside conspecifics before. In this case, heterospecific demonstrators were equally efficient as conspecifics both in the initial learning task and the transfer test. Our findings demonstrate that social learning is not a unique process limited to conspecifics and that through associative learning, interspecifically sourced information can be just as valuable as that provided by conspecific individuals. Furthermore the results of this study highlight potential implications for understanding competition within natural pollinator communities. © 2012 Dawson, Chittka.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856692722

However, since individual mango flowers are quite small, no more than 1 cm in diameter, a large number of skilled workers is necessary for artificial pollination, thus making it difficult to obtain a sufficient number of progenies for breeding. We therefore evaluated a methodology whereby progenies were obtained by open pollination and their male parent was subsequently determined by DNA markers. Two mango cultivars ('Irwin' and 'Beni-Keitt') were arranged in a plastic house and honeybees were released as a pollen vector for open pollination. Harvested fruits were characterized and their seeds were sown in a bed. The male parent of the germinated seedlings was then identified by five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. As a result of SSR genotyping, the male parents of 185 of 239 'Irwin' seedlings were revealed; 79 were obtained by self-pollination and 106 from out-crossing. For 'Beni-Keitt', the male parent of 14 of the 20 seedlings was determined with two self-pollinated and 12 out-crossed. Preferential out-crossing in 'Irwin' was revealed using the chi-square test, although the considerable number of self-pollinated fruit obtained shows that a sufficient number of fruit can be set in a single-planted orchard. The effect of the male parent on fruit characteristics was subsequently examined, revealing that in 'Irwin' the Brix value of self-pollinated fruits was significantly higher than that of cross-pollinated fruits. Certain color values were, however, lower in self-pollinated 'Irwin' fruits. © 2012.",Breeding; Mangifera indica; Pollen parent; Pollination; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856256812

Aroma composition of fig [Ficus carica L.] fruits when ripe has not been thoroughly investigated. Caprification, as a traditional practice in fig tree growing, is until now unfamiliar about its influence on sensory quality of the fruit. In this work, figs of three Tunisian cultivars (Bouhouli 'BHL', Zidi 'ZD': coloured figs and Thgagli 'THG': non coloured figs) ripened under semi-arid conditions were analysed for their volatile compounds according to their pollination status. Fifty one compounds were identified in the fruit samples with a total of 13,308?gkg -1 FM belonging mostly to esters and ketones. Major compounds belong to the class of esters, which reached more than 45% in BHL fruits. Esters, ketones and alcohols are the most important classes developed by fruits and acetoin, butyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and hexyl acetate are the major compounds identified in mature figs. Pollination does not affect significantly volatile concentrations of fig samples. Non-pollinated fruits showed practically the same volatiles concentration reaching a total of 13,849?gkg -1 FM. Differences were rather quantitative and concern some chemical classes to the detriment of others. This was clearly described in ZD figs. However, comparison between cultivars showed notable variance using multivariate GLM analysis (??0.05).Pollination increased volatile production in proportion to fruit weight in ripened figs; it allows yield increase without quality loss. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",ASE-GC-MS; Caprification; Esters; Ficus carica; Fruit quality; Volatile compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855594337

M, Germany","Land-use intensification is a major cause for the decline in species diversity in human-modified landscapes. The loss of functionally important species can reduce a variety of ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, but the intricate relationships between land-use intensity, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still contentious. Along a gradient from forest to intensively used farmland, we quantified bee species richness, visitation rates of bees and pollination success of wild cherry trees (Prunus avium). We analysed the effects of structural habitat diversity at a local scale and of the proportion of suitable habitat around each tree at a landscape scale. We compared these findings with those from previous studies of seed-dispersing birds and mammals in the same model system and along the same land-use gradient. Bee species richness and visitation rates were found to be highest in structurally simple habitats, whereas bird species richness-but not their visitation rates-were highest in structurally complex habitats. Mammal visitation rates were only influenced at the landscape scale. These results show that different functional groups of animals respond idiosyncratically to gradients in habitat and landscape structure. Despite strong effects on bees and birds, pollination success and bird seed removal did not differ along the land-use gradient at both spatial scales. These results suggest that mobile organisms, such as bees and birds, move over long distances in intensively used landscapes and thereby buffer pollination and seed-dispersal interactions. We conclude that measures of species richness and interaction frequencies are not sufficient on their own to understand the ultimate consequences of land-use intensification on ecosystem functioning. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Biodiversity; Ecosystem function; Land-use change; Mutualism; Plant-animal interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856002152

Such effects should be particularly important in wind-pollinated plants because they commonly possess uniovulate flowers. In several dioecious species, competition between female-and male-determining microgametophytes has been proposed as a cause of female-biased sex ratios. Here, we examine functional relations among pollination intensity, seed set, sex ratios, and sporophyte vigor in Rumex hastatulus, a wind-pollinated, dioecious plant. Using controlled pollinations, we applied a range of pollen grain numbers (1-71) to female flowers. Pollination intensity significantly predicted percent seed set, which was >80% when more than 15 pollen grains were added to stigmas. We estimated that the proportion of pollen grains participating in fertilization was 0.28 and the proportion of fertilized ovules developing into seed was 0.89. Overall, progeny sex ratios were female biased (0.62), with an increased probability of female offspring over the range of 1-15 pollen grains. We detected no effect of pollination intensity on sporophytic vigor. Our study is the first to investigate the relation between pollination intensity and female fertility in a wind-pollinated species and provides support for the contribution of gametophytic competition to sex ratio variation in plants. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

We studied the effect of the invasive Impatiens glandulifera Royle on the process of reproduction in the indigenous Lythrum salicaria L. and Alisma plantago-aquatica L. and the naturalized Oenothera biennis L. The latter three species (target species) were transplanted into pots and placed in invaded and non-invaded areas. During flowering season of each of these species, we measured species composition and abundance of pollinators, pollinator behaviour, pollen deposition and female reproductive output of the target species. Competitive effects were found for L. salicaria, in which fewer pollinator species and number of foraging individuals were observed, and also, lower pollen deposition and seed set were measured in these invaded populations. In contrast, the reproductive success of A. plantago-aquatica and O. biennis was not affected by the presence of I. glandulifera. Our data indicate that when invasive and indigenous species show a large overlap in pollinator community, which is the case for I. glandulifera and L. salicaria, competition between these species can occur. When both species have a different pollinator community, pollination success and reproductive output is not affected, even when the indigenous populations are densely and abundantly invaded. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Alisma plantago-aquatica; Competition; Impatiens glandulifera; Invasion; Invasive plants; Lythrum salicaria; Oenothera biennis; Pollen deposition; Pollination; Pollinator behaviour; Pollinator community; Pollinator service; Riparian species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856230676

Our results showed that Bt-pollen drift has little impact on the evolution of Bt resistance in O. nubilalis.

The capacity of unmanaged pollinators to replace services currently provided by honeybees depends on the spatial and temporal variability of these services, but few quantitative assessments currently exist. We investigated spatial variation in pollinator importance by comparing pollinator efficiency and effectiveness in stigmatic pollen loads, stigmatic contact and visitation rate between honeybees and the seven most abundant unmanaged taxa in 2007. We assessed temporal variability in pollinator visitation using floral visits recorded three times a day over four consecutive years (2005-2008) in 43 'Pak Choi'Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis mass flowering fields in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Further, we compared the aggregate effect of the unmanaged pollinator assemblage to the managed honeybee. Pak Choi was visited by many insect species that vary in abundance and effectiveness as pollen transfer agents. There was spatial variation in the four measures of pollinator importance. Pollen deposited on stigmas and flower visits per minute were not significantly different comparing the unmanaged assemblage to honeybees, although stigmatic contact and visitor abundance per number of open flowers were greater in honeybees. Unmanaged taxa were frequent visitors to the crop in all 4years. The pooled services provided by the unmanaged assemblage did not differ within a day and were equal to or greater than those provided by honeybees in 2 of the 4years. Pollinator importance changed little irrespective of the spatial and temporal variations among taxa. Synthesis and applications. The results of this study suggest that some unmanaged insect taxa are capable of providing consistent pollination services over a 4-year period in a commercial mass flowering crop. As these taxa already contribute substantially to the pollination of food crops, they offer a safety net in the case of sudden collapse of managed honeybee hives. To optimize pollination services, we recommend pollinator-specific farm management practices that consider the needs of both managed and unmanaged pollinator taxa. © 2011 The Authors.

Birds can be alternative pollinators for these plants, but experimental evidence for the pollination role of birds in winter-flowering plants is scarce. Methods Pollinator visitation to the loquat, Eriobotrya japonica (Rosaceae), was observed across the flowering season from November to January for two years in central China. Self-and cross-hand pollination was conducted in the field to investigate self-compatibility and pollen limitation. In addition, inflorescences were covered by bird cages and nylon mesh nets to exclude birds and all animal pollinators, respectively, to investigate the pollination role of birds in seed production. ResultsSelf-fertilization in the loquat yielded few seeds. In early winter insect visit frequency was relatively higher, while in late winter insect pollinators were absent and two passerine birds (Pycnonotus sinensis and Zosterops japonicus) became the major floral visitors. However, seed-set of open-pollinated flowers did not differ between early and late winter. Exclusion of bird visitation greatly reduced seed-set, indicating that passerine birds were important pollinators for the loquat in late winter. The whitish perigynous flowers reward passerines with relatively large volumes of dilute nectar. Our observation on the loquat and other Rosaceae species suggested that perigyny might be related to bird pollination but the association needs further study. Conclusions These findings suggest that floral traits and phenology would be favoured to attract bird pollinators in cold weather, in which insect activity is limited. © 2011 The Author.",bird pollination; generalist pollination system; ornithophily; perigyny; Pycnonotus sinensis; self-incompatibility; Winter flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863080760

We examined the spatial genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae) adults (N Adults = 452) and offspring (N Offspring = 736) across two mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small (s m = 0. 035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s b;open canopy = 0. 16, s b;closed canopy = 0. 11) and correlated paternity (r p;open canopy = 0. 21, r p;closed canopy = 0. 07) were significantly influenced by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance. The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy (e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy), and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and quality of intervening canopy cover. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conditional genetic distance; Connectivity; Cornus florida; Gene flow; Pollination Graph,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856232144

The large, bisexual flowers are protogynous, nocturnal, thermogenic and emit a strong scent in two consecutive evenings. In the first night of anthesis, the flowers are in the pistillate stage and thermogenesis starts at about sunset and lasts about 3. h. In the second night, the flowers enter the staminate stage and produce heat for 4. h. Heat is generated by the petals, gynoecium and anthers. Temperatures measured inside the petals reach 26.7°C and 31.9°C in the pistillate and staminate stages, 6.0 and 10.6°C above ambient air, respectively. In the pistillate stage, the perianth opens after sunset and closes tightly a few hours later, and remains closed until the next evening. The initial opening and closing, however, is not synchronous for all flowers during the night. In the following evening, flowers in the staminate stage again open and remain so until the petals drop. Scent compounds, analyzed by GC-MS, contain C5-branched chain compounds, aliphatics, benzenoids and monoterpenoids. Emission of the most prominent compound, C5-branched methyl 2-methyl butyrate, commences before flower opening and continues throughout anthesis, but is accentuated in the thermogenic pistillate and staminate stages. Female and male individuals of only one beetle species, the dynastid scarab Cyclocephala literata, are attracted to the scented flowers in both pistillate and staminate stages. Once inside the flowers they feed on the petals and mate. Tests with synthetic methyl 2-methyl butyrate indicate that this compound is a strong attractant for the beetles. Because this scent compound is strongly emitted in both pistillate and staminate stages, the beetles fly indiscriminately between flowers of both stages. This behavior enhances pollen mixing and effective cross-pollination of the self-compatible species. The evolutionary history of Magnolia appears to be influenced by an ancestral condition of dynastid scarab beetle pollination. Large magnolia flowers are best explained as an archaic structure resulting from the initial association of tropical American species of section Talauma with large and voracious dynastid beetles. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Anthesis; Cantharophily; Dynastinae; Floral heating; Floral scent; Magnolia evolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856499452

We combined selection analysis and phenotypic manipulations to measure the effect of petal colour on visitation and pollen export at two spatial scales in Wahlenbergia albomarginata. This species is representative of many New Zealand alpine herbs that have secondarily evolved white or pale flowers. The major pollinators, solitary bees, exerted phenotypic selection on flower size but not colour, quantified by bee vision. When presented with manipulated flowers, bees visited flowers painted blue to resemble a congener over white flowers in large, but not small, experimental arrays. Pollen export was higher for blue flowers in large arrays. Pollinator preference does not explain the pale colouration of W. albomarginata, as commonly hypothesized.

In the non-obligate interaction between Greya moths and the host Lithophragma sp., the relative density of nursery pollinators and copollinators, which do not use plant tissues for larval development, is a key determinant of the interaction's outcome. Silene (Caryophyllaceae) nursery pollination by Hadena moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), studied primarily in Europe, is considered antagonistic because copollinators comprise a substantial proportion of the pollinator community. However, there are few studies that ascertain the direction of the Silene-Hadena interaction by taking into account both pollinator service and seed predation. Here, we report a novel comprehensive evaluation of the direction of the interaction between North American Hadena ectypa on Silene stellata, by comparing the relative contributions of nursery and copollinators to S. stellata pollination and relate this to variation in fruit predation and reproductive success of S. stellata across multiple sites and years. Hadena ectypa pollinator importance (pollen deposited/visit/h) varied between years, resulting from variable visitation rate. Copollinator importance was higher than H. ectypa in 1 year and equivalent in another. In two of three sites, lowered H. ectypa activity was not correlated with a significant decrease in plant reproductive success, indicating a negative interaction. Although pollinator service by H. ectypa is substantial in this system, copollinators' service is at least as great, and when the cost of fruit predation is factored in, the net effect of the interaction is parasitism of host plants. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Antagonism; Copollinator; Hadena; Mutualism; Silene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856008691

A particularly intriguing aspect of these systems is their high diversity. However, earlier studies have concluded that the specific mechanisms of plant-pollinator interactions are destabilizing and should lead to a loss of diversity. Here we present a mechanistic model of plant and pollinator population dynamics with the ability to represent a broad spectrum of interaction structures. Using this model, we examined the influence of pollinators on the stability of a plant community and the relationship between pollinator specialization and stability. In accordance with earlier work, our results show that plant-pollinator interactions may severely destabilize plant coexistence, regardless of the degree of pollinator specialization. However, if plant niche differentiation, a classical stabilizing mechanism, is sufficiently strong to overcome the minority disadvantage with respect to pollination, interactions with pollinators may even increase the stability of a plant community. In addition to plant niche differentiation, the relationship between specialization and stability depends on a number of parameters that affect pollinator growth rates. Our results highlight the complex effects of this particular type of mutualism on community stability and call for further investigations of the mechanisms of diversity maintenance in plant-pollinator systems.",Community; Mutualism; Pollination; Specialization; Stability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855366565

However, little is known about the influence of urbanization on pollination ecosystem services.Here, we assessed the pollination service on Lotus corniculatus (L.), a self-sterile, strictly entogamous Fabaceae commonly observed in urban and suburban areas. We assessed the pollination success of artificial Lotus corniculatus populations at three levels: at large scale, along an urbanization gradient; at intermediate scale, based on landscape fragmentation within a 250 m radius and at local scale based on floral resource abundance and local habitat type.The main findings were that the pollination success, when assessed with the number of fruit produced per inflorescence, was lower in urban areas than in suburban ones, and was negatively affected by the number of impervious spaces in the neighborhood. The relationship between the number of fruits and the distance to the nearest impervious space was either positive or negative, depending on the gray/green ratio (low vs. high). Finally, on a local scale, floral resource abundance had a negative effect on pollination success when L. corniculatus populations were located in paved courtyards, and a positive one when they were located in parks.Pollination success seems to be explained by two intertwined gradients: landscape fragmentation estimated by the number of impervious spaces in a 250 m radius around L. corniculatus populations, and the behavior of bumblebees toward birdsfoot trefoil and floral displays, which appears to differ depending on whether a neighborhood is densely or sparsely urbanized. An abundance of attracting floral resources seems to enhance pollination success for L. corniculatus if it is not too isolated from other green spaces.These results have important implications for the sustainability of pollination success in towns by identifying local and landscape factors that influence reproductive success of a common plant. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Bombus spp.; Fragmentation; Lotus corniculatus; Pollination service; Urbanization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856611565

The identification and quantification of the pollination service provided by different taxa within the pollinator guild is a prerequisite for the successful establishment of nature conservation and crop management regimes. 2 Wild bees and hoverflies are considered to be valuable pollinators in agricultural and natural systems. Although some information on pollination efficiency of individual pollinator species is available, comparative studies of both taxa at different densities are rare. In the present study, the efficiency of the solitary mason bee Osmia rufa and two hoverfly species (Eristalis tenax and Episyrphus balteatus) as pollinators of oilseed rape Brassica napus was examined in a standardized caged plant breeding regime. Honeybee Apis mellifera colonies were used as a reference pollinator taxon. 3 Yield parameters responded differently to pollinator density and identity. Fruit set and number of seeds per pod increased with increasing pollinator density, although these were stronger in the mason bee than the hoverfly treatment. Weight per 1000 seeds did not respond to any pollinator treatment, indicating that seed quality was not affected. Oilseed rape yield in the highest tested densities of both pollinator taxa resulted in yield values close to the efficiency of small honeybee colonies. 4 Hoverflies required approximately five-fold densities of the red mason bees to reach a similar fruit set and yield. Thus, mason bees are more efficient in plant breeding and managed pollination systems. Both natural pollinator taxa, however, are of potential value in open and closed crop production systems. © 2011 The Authors.

Under these conditions, chronic outcross pollen limitation is expected to select for floral characters that maintain seed production, including autonomous selfing. In this study, the impact of anthropogenic disturbances of the pollinator environment of the short-lived Centaurium erythraea on mating patterns was investigated. First floral traits and the capacity for autonomous selfing were compared between two contrasting pollinator environments. In addition, transplantation experiments were combined with hand-pollination and emasculation treatments to assess the extent of pollen limitation and the contribution of autonomous selfing to total seed production in these pollinator environments. Under severe pollinator impoverishment, C. erythraea produced fewer and smaller flowers that showed no herkogamy and strongly reduced P/O ratios. The capacity for autonomous selfing was 36·1% higher in these pollinator-limited environments than in more natural, pollinator-rich environments, where plants developed more, larger and markedly herkogamous flowers. When assigned to the pollinator-rich environments, plants from pollinator-limited populations showed significantly higher outcross pollen limitation compared with the original plants. In contrast, plants from pollinator-rich environments assigned to pollinator-poor populations did not experience higher pollinator-mediated seed production and showed lower total seed production than plants originally occurring in these pollinator-limited environments. These results demonstrate that human-induced pollen limitation selects for selfing as a means of reproductive assurance, whereas in the pollinator-rich environments, traits that support outcrossing are favoured. © 2011 The Authors.

Floral biology of Paypayrola blanchetiana and Amphirrhox longifolia were studied in Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Petals of both species form a corolla tube, restricting access to floral rewards to visitors with long mouth parts. Flowers lack a spur, common in zygomorphic Violaceae, to store nectar. Both species' flowers open in the evening and continue flowering during daytime. They emit a sweet scent dominated by benzenoid and monoterpenoid compounds. While A. longifolia flowers are nectarless, flowers of P. blanchetiana produce nectar throughout anthesis. A wide range of night-and day-active visitors, including moths, bees, and butterflies, were observed at P. blanchetiana; 68% of all nocturnal visits took place at dawn. Fruit set of P. blanchetiana was extraordinarily low. Nectar production and pollen presentation occur in close proximity, and pollen dissolves in accumulating nectar. After contact with nectar, experimental pollen germination rates were near 0. Amphirrhox longifolia flowers received few visits by diurnal and nocturnal bees and pollen-collecting Heliconius butterflies. Fruit set was still low (11%) but was ten times higher than that in P. blanchetiana (1%). Low fruit set seems to result from diminished pollen viability through nectar contact in P. blanchetiana and pollinator limitation in A. longifolia. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Severe honey bee colony losses worldwide have raised concerns about the sustainability of these pollination services. In many cases, bee mortality appears to be the product of many interacting factors, but there is a growing consensus that the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor plays the role of the major predisposing liability. We argue that the fight against this mite should be a priority for future honey bee health research. We highlight the lack of efficient control methods currently available against the parasite and discuss the need for new approaches. Gaps in our knowledge of the biology and epidemiology of the mite are identified and a research road map towards sustainable control is drawn. Innovative and challenging approaches are suggested in order to stimulate research efforts and ensure that honey bees will be able to sustainably fulfil their role in the ecosystem. © IBRA 2012.",Apis mellifera; Colony losses; Future perspectives; Honey bee; Pollination; Sustainable control; Varroa destructor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859615961

However, although co-existence of native and alien congeners may provide an opportunity to refute the RI hypothesis, few studies have examined such a case. Using a native Japanese dandelion, Taraxacum longeappendiculatum, and a co-existing alien congener, Taraxacum officinale, we tested the hypothesis that differences in RI by the alien between native recipient congeners explain whether a native will co-exist with or be displaced by an alien. We conducted a field survey to investigate the effects of alien relative abundance on T. longeappendiculatum seed set, and a hand-pollination experiment to identify the extent of pollen interference by the alien on T. longeappendiculatum. We compared these results with those obtained previously for another Japanese native species, Taraxacum japonicum, which was displaced by the alien. In our field survey, alien relative abundance had little effect on seed set in nearby T. longeappendiculatum, and hand-pollination with mixed pollen grains produced no substantial decrease in seed set of the native species. Model selection supported these tendencies; the effect of RI by the alien differed between the two native species. Other potential factors, such as resource competition or habitat changes, could not explain the co-existence of T. longeappendiculatum with and exclusion of T. japonicum by the alien in the same explanatory framework. Considering the consistent explanatory power, the findings suggest that RI is a critical mechanism that can determine both co-existence with and displacement of native dandelions by an alien congener. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Alien congener; Distributional relationships; Reproductive interference; Taraxacum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856219667

Therefore, population declines have potentially negative impacts for both crop and wildflower pollination. Although heavy metal pollution is recognized to be a problem affecting large parts of the European Union, we currently lack insights into the effects of heavy metals on wild bees. We investigated whether heavy metal pollution is a potential threat to wild bee communities by comparing (i) species number, (ii) diversity and (iii) abundance as well as (iv) natural mortality of emerging bees along two independent gradients of heavy metal pollution, one at Olkusz (OLK), Poland and the other at Avonmouth (AVO), UK. We used standardized nesting traps to measure species richness and abundance of wild bees, and we recorded the heavy metal concentration in pollen collected by the red mason bee Osmia rufa as a measure of pollution. The concentration of cadmium, lead and zinc in pollen collected by bees ranged from a background level in unpolluted sites [OLK: 1·3, 43·4, 99·8 (mgkg -1); AVO: 0·8, 42·0, 56·0 (mgkg -1), respectively] to a high level on sites in the vicinity of the OLK and AVO smelters [OLK: 6·7, 277·0, 440·1 (mgkg -1); AVO: 9·3, 356·2, 592·4 (mgkg -1), respectively]. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a steady decrease in the number, diversity and abundance of solitary, wild bees. In the most polluted sites, traps were empty or contained single occupants, whereas in unpolluted sites, the nesting traps collected from 4 to 5 species represented by up to ten individuals. Moreover, the proportion of dead individuals of the solitary bee Megachile ligniseca increased along the heavy metal pollution gradient at OLK from 0·2 in uncontaminated sites to 0·5 in sites with a high concentration of pollution. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the negative relationship between heavy metal pollution and populations of wild bees and suggest that increasing wild bee richness in highly contaminated areas will require special conservation strategies. These may include creating suitable nesting sites and sowing a mixture of flowering plants as well as installing artificial nests with wild bee cocoons in polluted areas. Applying protection plans to wild pollinating bee communities in heavy metal-contaminated areas will contribute to integrated land rehabilitation to minimize the impact of pollution on the environment. © 2011 The Authors.

Despite their wide distribution in plants and differences in position, structure, and topography, their biological and systematic significance has been underutilized. This study investigated the macro- and micromorphology of floral and extrafloral nectaries in the epiphytic cactus Rhipsalis teres and reports unusual bristle-like structures (bracteoles) functioning as extrafloral nectaries in the cactus family. The floral nectary is disc-shaped embedded in the hypanthial floral cup with anomocytic stomata as secreting structures present on the epidermal nectarial tissue. Small multicellular bristle-like extrafloral nectar-secreting structures, homologues to bracts, were observed on the plants' stems and function as bracteolar nectaries having a relatively long and continuous secretory activity throughout several stages of the reproductive structures. Both the floral and bracteolar nectaries are functional. It is possible that in the latter nectar discharge occurs though epidermal cells, which build up pressure inside as nectar accumulates, thereby ending with rupture of the cuticle to release the liquid. The nectar in both secreting structures is scentless and colorless, and the concentration from floral nectaries is slightly lower than that of the bracteolar nectaries, 70.6% and 76.4%, respectively. The relatively higher concentration in the latter might be correlated with exposure, relative humidity and water evaporation, leading to crystallization of sugars on the stem surface in a short period of time. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Bracteolar nectary; Cactaceae; Floral nectary; Nectar concentration; Nectary disc; Rhipsalis teres,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856435619

Itzimná, 97100, Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico","•Background and Aims Mixed reproductive strategies may have evolved as a response of plants to cope with environmental variation. One example of a mixed reproductive strategy is dimorphic cleistogamy, where a single plant produces closed, obligately self-pollinated (CL) flowers and open, potentially outcrossed (CH) flowers. Frequently, optimal environmental conditions favour production of more costly CH structures whilst economical and reliable CL structures are produced under less favourable conditions. In this study we explore (1) the effect of light and water on the reproductive phenology and (2) the effect of pollen supplementation on resource allocation to seeds in the cleistogamous weed Ruellia nudiflora.•Methods Split-plot field experiments were carried out to assess the effect of shade (two levels: ambient light vs. a reduction of 50 ) and watering (two levels: non-watered vs. watered) on the onset, end and duration of the production of three reproductive structures: CH flowers, CH fruit and CL fruit. We also looked at the effect of these environmental factors on biomass allocation to seeds (seed weight) from obligately self-pollinated flowers (CL), open-pollinated CH flowers and pollen-supplemented CH flowers.•Key Results CH structures were produced for a briefer period and ended earlier under shaded conditions. These conditions also resulted in an earlier production of CL fruit. Shaded conditions also produced greater biomass allocation to CH seeds receiving extra pollen.•Conclusions Sub-optimal (shaded) conditions resulted in a briefer production period of CH structures whilst these same conditions resulted in an earlier production of CL structures. However, under sub-optimal conditions, plants also allocated more resources to seeds sired from CH flowers receiving large pollen loads. Earlier production of reproductive structures and relatively larger seed might improve subsequent success of CL and pollen-supplemented CH seeds, respectively. © 2011 The Author.",Cleistogamy; invasive plants; phenology; pollen supplementation; resource allocation; Ruellia nudiflora,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856717657

Restrictiveness of flower corollas may influence heterospecific pollen receipt, but the impact of floral morphology on heterospecific pollen transfer has received little attention. We characterized patterns of pollinator visitation and quantities of conspecific and heterospecific pollen receipt for 29 species with a range of floral morphologies in a prairie community dominated by the introduced plant Euphorbia esula (leafy spurge) which has an unrestrictive morphology. Pollinator overlap was significantly greater between Euphorbia and other unrestrictive flowers than restrictive flowers. Compared to flowers with restrictive morphologies, unrestrictive flowers received significantly more Euphorbia pollen, more heterospecific pollen from other sources, and a greater diversity of pollen species, but not more conspecific pollen. However, stigmatic surface area was significantly larger for flowers with unrestrictive morphologies, and the density of Euphorbia and other heterospecific pollen per stigmatic area did not significantly differ between flower types. These findings suggest that the smaller stigma size in restrictive flowers partly accounts for their decreased heterospecific pollen receipt, but that restrictiveness also allows species to increase the purity of pollen loads they receive. Given that restrictive flowers receive fewer heterospecific pollen grains but at a higher density, the effect of restrictiveness on fecundity depends on whether absolute quantity or density of heterospecific pollen affects fecundity more. Our results also indicate that abundant neighbors are not necessarily important heterospecific pollen sources since Euphorbia pollen was rarely abundant on heterospecifics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Competition for pollination; Floral morphology; Interspecific pollen transfer; Pollinator overlap; Stigma area,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855986805

Nicotine is highly toxic to most herbivores, and nicotine-based insecticides may contribute to current pollinator declines. We examined the effects of nectar nicotine on honeybee foraging choices and worker longevity. Free-flying honeybee (Apis mellifera scutellata) workers from six colonies were given a choice between multiple nicotine concentrations (0-1000 ?M) in artificial nectar (0.15-0.63. M sucrose). The dose-dependent deterrent effect of nicotine was stronger in lower sugar concentrations, but even the highest nicotine concentrations did not completely repel honeybees, i.e. bees did not stop feeding on these diets. Nicotine in nectar acts as a partial repellent, which may keep pollinators moving between plants and enhance cross-pollination. In the second part of the study, newly emerged workers from 12 colonies were caged and fed one of four nicotine concentrations (0-300 ?M) in 0.63. M sucrose for 21. days. Moderate (?30 ?M) nicotine concentrations had no significant detrimental effect, but high nicotine concentrations reduced the survival of caged workers and their nectar storage in the honey comb. In contrast, worker groups that survived poorly on sugar-only diets demonstrated increased survival on all nicotine diets. In the absence of alternative nectar sources, honeybees tolerate naturally occurring nectar nicotine concentrations; and low concentrations can even be beneficial to honeybees. However, high nicotine concentrations may have a detrimental effect on colony fitness. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Apis mellifera scutellata; Deterrence; Feeding preference; Nectar storage; Secondary metabolite; Sucrose concentration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855551107

Very few studies have experimentally evaluated the costs and benefits of fragrance emission with explicit consideration of how plant fitness is affected by both pollinators and florivores. To determine the reproductive consequences of increasing the apparency of reproductive parts, we manipulated fragrance, pollination, and florivores in the wild Texas gourd, Cucurbita pepo var. texana. With enhanced fragrance we found an increase in the attraction of florivores, rather than pollinators, and a decrease in seed production.

This is achieved by timing the initiation of spring bee incubation so that adults will emerge ?2 wk before peak bloom. If weather conditions change so as to delay the bloom, bee managers will commonly expose the developing bees to a period of low-temperature incubation to slow their development. We have previously demonstrated survival during low-temperature incubation can be significantly increased by using a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) where the bees receive a daily pulse at 20°C. A FTR incubation protocol is composed of a number of different components, such as the base and pulse temperatures, and the duration and frequency of the pulse. In this investigation, the effect of the duration of the pulse (5120 min) and the frequency of a pulse (twice daily to weekly) on the survival of developing M. rotundata was examined. A pulse as short as 5 min at 20°C increased survival of the developing bees as compared with the constant 6°C controls. Increasing the pulse duration induced a further increase in tolerance to 6°C. As with the pulse duration, increasing the pulse frequency from once weekly to twice daily had a significant effect on improving the bees tolerance to low-temperature incubation. This investigation further strengthens the argument that a FTR protocol is superior to using a constant low-temperature exposure for interrupting the spring incubation of M. rotundata. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.",ßuctuating thermal regime; alfalfa; pollinator; spring incubationn,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856836756

The transition from outcrossing to highly selfing is less well understood in self-compatible (SC) mixed-mating (MM) species where potentially subtle interactions between floral phenotypes and the environment are at play. We examined floral morphological and developmental traits across an entire SC MM genus, Collinsia, to determine which, if any, predict potential autonomous selfing ability when pollinators are absent (AS) and actual selfing rates in the wild, sm, and to best define the selfing syndrome for this clade. Methods Using polymorphic microsatellite markers, we obtained 30 population-level estimates of sm across 19 Collinsia taxa. Species grand means for the timing of herkogamy (stigmaanther contact) and dichogamy (stigmatic receptivity, SR), AS, floral size, longevity and their genetic correlations were quantified for 22 taxa. Key Results Species fell into discrete selfing and outcrossing groups based on floral traits. Loss of dichogamy defines Collinsias selfing syndrome. Floral size, longevity and herkogamy also differ significantly between these groups. Most taxa have high AS rates (>80 ), but AS is uncorrelated with any measured trait. In contrast, sm is significantly correlated only with SR. High variance in sm was observed in the two groups. Conclusions Collinsia species exhibit clear morphological and developmental traits diagnostic of 'selfing' or 'outcrossing' groups. However, many species in both the 'selfing' and the 'outcrossing' groups were MM, pointing to the critical influence of the pollination environment, the timing of AS and outcross pollen prepotency on sm. Flower size is a poor predictor of Collinsia species field selfing rates and this result may apply to many SC species. Assessment of the variation in the pollination environment, which can increase selfing rates in more 'outcrossing' species but can also decrease selfing rates in more 'selfing' species, is critical to understanding mating system evolution of SC MM taxa. © The Author 2011.",Collinsia; floral development; floral traits; flower size; genetic correlations; Mating system evolution; mixed mating; outcrossing rate; reproductive assurance; selfing rate; selfing syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857486910

Because dioecy can arise from gynodioecy, characterization of gynodioecy in close relatives of dioecious and sub-dioecious species can provide insight into this transition. Thus, we sought to determine whether Fragaria vesca ssp. bracteata, a close relative to F. chiloensis and F. virginiana, exhibits the functional and population genetic hallmarks of a gynodioecious species. Methods We compared reproductive allocation of females and hermaphrodites grown in the greenhouse and estimated genetic diversity (allelic diversity, heterozygosity) and inbreeding coefficients for field-collected adults of both sexes using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. We estimated mating system and early seed fitness from open-pollinated families of both sex morphs. Key Results Under greenhouse conditions, females and hermaphrodites allocated similarly to all reproductive traits except flower number, and, as a consequence, females produced 30 fewer seeds per plant than hermaphrodites. Under natural conditions, hermaphrodites produce seeds by self-fertilization approx. 75 of the time, and females produced outcrossed seeds with very little biparental inbreeding. Consistent with inbreeding depression, seeds from open-pollinated hermaphrodites were less likely to germinate than those from females, and family-level estimates of hermaphrodite selfing rates were negatively correlated with germination success and speed. Furthermore, estimates of inbreeding depression based on genetic markers and population genetic theory indicate that inbreeding depression in the field could be high. Conclusions The joint consideration of allocation and mating system suggests that compensation may be sufficient to maintain females given the current understanding of sex determination. Fragaria vesca ssp. bracteata exhibited similar sex morph-dependent patterns of mating system and genetic diversity, but less reproductive trait dimorphism, than its sub-dioecious and dioecious congeners. © The Author 2011.",Dioecy; Fragaria chiloensis; Fragaria vesca ssp. bracteata; Fragaria virginiana; gynodioecy; inbreeding depression; selfing rate; SSR; strawberry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863116376

Large floral displays often attract more pollinator visits, increasing outcross pollen receipt. However, pollinators frequently probe more flowers in sequence on large displays, potentially increasing self-pollination and reducing pollen export per flower. To better understand how floral display size influences male and female fitness, we manipulated display phenotypes and then used paternity analysis to quantify siring success and selfing rates. Methods To facilitate unambiguous assignment of paternity, we established four replicate (cloned) arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In each array, we trimmed displays to two, four, eight or 16 flowers. When fruits ripened, we counted the number of seeds per fruit and assigned paternity to 1935 progeny. Key Results Siring success per flower declined sharply with increasing display size, while female success per flower did not vary with display. The rate of self-fertilization increased for large floral displays, but siring losses due to geitonogamous pollen discounting were much greater than siring gains through increased self-fertilization. As display size increased, each additional seed sired through geitonogamous self-pollination was associated with a loss of 9·7 seeds sired through outcrossing. Conclusions Although total fitness increased with floral display size, the marginal return on each additional flower declined steadily as display size increased. Therefore, a plant could maximize fitness by producing small displays over a long flowering period, rather than large displays over a brief flowering period. © The Author 2011.",Bumble-bee; floral display size; functional gender; geitonogamy; male selfing rate; mating system; Mimulus ringens; paternity analysis; pollen discounting; pollination; self-fertilization; siring success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857488319

The ecosystem services of pollination, biological control, seed predation, and decomposition are also included in this review. So far, organic farming seems to enhance the species richness and abundance of many common taxa, but its effects are often species specific and trait or context dependant. The landscape surrounding the focal field or farm also seems to be important. Landscape either enhances or reduces the positive effects of organic farming or acts via interactions where the surrounding landscape affects biodiversity or ecosystem services differently on organic and conventional farms.

However, lack of knowledge about critical aspects of their reproductive ecology currently limits their use, particularly optimal seed collection times and potential interruption of their highly specialized pollination mechanisms. Therefore, the reproductive phenology of seven dioecious Ficus species (Ficus auriculata, F. fulva, F. hispida, F. oligodon, F. semicordata, F. triloba and F. variegata) was studied at Doi Suthep-Pui National Park, Northern Thailand, in order to provide useful data to support forest restoration projects. The fig crops on male and female trees of each species were quantified monthly over a full annual cycle (March 2008-February 2009), using the canopy density method. At the population-level, most species produced figs all year round, but fig abundance varied seasonally. Maximum production of ripe figs by female (i.e. seed-producing) trees of most species occurred in the rainy season (May-August, except for F. triloba), while the main fig crop of male (i.e. wasp-producing) trees peaked 1-3. months before female trees. Four species F. auriculata, F. fulva, F. oligodon, and F. variegata presented critical bottleneck periods for wasp survival, especially during the rainy season, when the wasp-producing figs of male trees were least abundant. The study generated scientifically-based recommendations that will be useful for development of efficient forest restoration programs that maintain keystone resources in tropical forest ecosystems such as (i) optimum time and place for seed collection, (ii) recommendations on the propagation of dioecious fig species, (iii) optimum planting sites for each species and (iv) forest restoration plans to sustain the obligate ecological relationships between fig-trees and their pollinators. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Dioecy; Northern Thailand; Phenological patterns; Tropical forest restoration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82055191678

Here we propose that mate density should only capture the number of male-phase flowers in a defined area and ignore female-phase flowers. Sex ratio is the ratio of male and female-phase flowers in a defined area and captures female-female competition. We use a spatially explicit simulation model to quantify the effect of variation in mate density and sex ratio for plant-pollinator systems characterized by combinations of high or low rates of pollen loss and deposition from pollinator to stigma and then assess the size of pollination neighbourhoods. In efficient systems with relatively little pollen loss, female-female competition is of overriding importance. In contrast, in wasteful systems with high pollen loss rates, mate density becomes the dominant factor and sex ratio is no longer consequential. These patterns were observed at both landscape and local scales. Systems with low deposition and low pollen loss rates are associated with large pollination neighbourhoods, which decline with increasing deposition and pollen loss rates. These results show that mate density and sex ratio should carefully be distinguished and highlight the complex way in which pollen loss interacts with deposition rate, which has not previously been appreciated. © 2011 The Authors.

It is used medicinally, provides a highly nutritious supplement to Bedouin diets, provides fodder for livestock, and is used for fire wood. M. peregrina seeds have been a source of high-quality oil for cosmetics and perfumes since antiquity. Due to unmanaged grazing and over-collection, M. peregrina has become one of the most endangered tree species in the Egyptian desert ecosystem. A long-term conservation program is urgently needed to maintain or increase the number and size of M. peregrina populations. Ten populations harboring a total of 130 adult M. peregrina were sampled from three disjunct Wadis in South Sinai (W. Me'ar, W. Fieran and W. Zaghra). Open-pollinated seedlings were electrophoretically analyzed to address two basic questions: (1) how is genetic diversity distributed within and among populations within these three Wadis; and (2) what is the mating system of this species. M. peregrina has a mixed mating system with a selfing rate up to 16% and has limited genetic diversity within and significant genetic differentiation among its populations, the majority of which occurs among Wadis. Direct protection is urgently needed to decrease genetic deterioration within M. peregrina populations and to improve their ability to maintain or improve their population numbers. The priority of in situ conservation should be to conserve a few large well-distributed populations representing different Wadis. Ex situ germplasm collections should be made across the species' range to ensure a representative sample of its genetic variation. Seed orchards designed to maximize cross-fertilization among unrelated individuals should be established to generate propagules to supplement natural populations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conservation; Genetic diversity; Mating system; Medicinal plants; Moringa peregrina; Sinai,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856223078

Pollen limitation and loss of self-incompatibility genotypes can both act independently to reduce seed set and these effects are commonly observed in fragmented landscapes. This study used a simulation modelling approach to assess the interacting effects of these two processes on plant reproductive performance and population viability for a range of pollination likelihood, self-incompatibility systems and S-allele richness conditions. Methods A spatially explicit, individual-based, genetic and demographic simulation model parameterized to represent a generic self-incompatible, short-lived perennial herb was used to conduct simulation experiments in which pollination probability, self-incompatibility type (gametophytic and sporophytic) and S-allele richness were systematically varied in combination to assess their independent and interacting effects on the demographic response variables of mate availability, seed set, population size and population persistence. Key Results Joint effects of reduced pollination probability and low S-allele richness were greater than independent effects for all demographic response variables except population persistence under high pollinator service (>50 ). At intermediate values of 1525 pollination probability, non-linear interactions with S-allele richness generated significant reductions in population performance beyond those expected by the simple additive effect of each independently. This was due to the impacts of reduced effective population size on the ability of populations to retain S alleles and maintain mate availability. Across a limited set of pollination and S-allele conditions (P 0·15 and S 20) populations with gametophytic SI showed reduced S-allele erosion relative to those with sporophytic SI, but this had limited effects on individual fecundity and translated into only modest increases in population persistence. Conclusions Interactions between pollen limitation and loss of S alleles have the potential to significantly reduce the viability of populations of a few hundred plants. Population decline may occur more rapidly than expected when pollination probabilities drop below 25 and S alleles are fewer than 20 due to non-additive interactions. These are likely to be common conditions experienced by plants in small populations in fragmented landscapes and are also those under which differences in response between gameptophytic and sporophtyic systems are observed. © The Author 2011.",habitat fragmentation; Mating system; plant demography; pollinator limitation; population viability; self-incompatibility; simulation modelling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857490239

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) are known to be produced in the pistil and pollen during pollination but their contribution to PCD has so far remained elusive. The possible role of ROS and NO was investigated in olive pollen-pistil interaction during free and controlled pollination and it was found that bidirectional interaction appears to exist between the pollen and the stigma, which seems to regulate ROS and NO production. Biochemical evidence strongly suggesting that both O 2 ?- and NO are essential for triggering PCD in self-incompatibility processes was also obtained. It was observed for the first time that peroxynitrite, a powerful oxidizing and nitrating agent generated during a rapid reaction between O 2 ?- and NO, is produced during pollination and that this is related to an increase in protein nitration which, in turn, is strongly associated with PCD. It may be concluded that peroxynitrite mediates PCD during pollen-pistil interaction in Olea europaea L. both in self-incompatible pollen and papillar cells. © 2012 The Author.",Nitric oxide; Olea europaea L.; peroxynitrite; pollen-pistil interaction; programmed cell death; reactive oxygen species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856837516

Genetic variability in morphological and physiological seedling characteristics of 75 open-pollinated white spruce families was estimated to determine whether genetic selection for improved seedling root systems is possible. Seedlings were grown for 2 years under standard cultural practices in a forest nursery. Gas exchange measurements and seedling morphological characteristics (height, diameter, shoot and root dry mass, root to shoot ratio) were measured at the end of the two growing seasons whereas seedling mineral (N, P, and K) status was assessed at the end of the first growing season. Genetic parameters (heritabilities-h 2-and genetic correlations) were estimated for every seedling characteristic and a strong genetic control associated with a large genetic variation was observed at both family (0.20 ? h f 2 ? 0.88) and individual (0. 21 ? h i 2 ? 0. 97) levels. A single, late-season measurement of physiological characteristics did not reveal physiological basis for family variability in seedling root growth. Nevertheless, the family variation was large enough to permit genetic improvement of 2-year-old seedling juvenile morphological characteristics.

The maternal parents are heterozygous (Rr) for one or two of nine known pathotype-specific Fr genes (fusiform rust resistance genes). Progeny were genotyped to identify carriers of known R and r alleles inherited from the maternal parents. The R alleles condition resistance to specific genotypes of the fungal pathogen, while r alleles do not condition for resistance. Interactions were tested among different host genotypes and different bulked inocula. Significant differences in virulence against R genotypes were observed in the bulked inocula. Likewise, the inocula were significantly different with regard to their ability to incite disease at the family level and in r genotypes. Across the inocula, disease levels differed significantly among families. Within each family, r genotype seedlings typically exhibited higher disease rates than did R genotype seedlings. The magnitude of difference (odds ratio) between the R versus r genotypes for disease incidence within each family varied from 1 to 32 times. Significant interactions between host and pathogen genotypes were observed in four of the seven families.

Box 110620, Gainesville, FL 32611-0620, United States","Since 2006, it has been hard to ignore news related to Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) and their fluctuating populations globally. Reports on losses of managed honey bee colonies (colonies kept by beekeepers) have been covered by major international news agencies, discussed on the internet and in popular/trade journals, and investigated by scientists around the world. Regarding the latter, there has been a significant increase in the number of refereed publications concerning honey bee diseases, parasitology, and other stressors that may be contributing to colony losses globally. Research dollars have poured into bee laboratories around the world as scientists scramble try to find the ""answer"" to why bee populations are declining. With a giant spotlight on honey bees, the general public is beginning to understand human reliance on pollinators and the role they play in the global food chain. Yet, many wonder if anything can be done to save a species on which much of agriculture relies. Herein, I discuss the crisis facing the honey bee and what is being done to address this vexing problem. There are roughly 2.6 million managed honey bee colonies in the US and the vast majority of those colonies belong to commercial beekeepers. The definition of commercial beekeeper is somewhat vague, but the term typically refers to an individual who owns/manages 500+ honey bee colonies and whose primary source of income is derived from keeping bees. Unlike in much of the world where a beekeeper's main use of honey bees is to make honey, commercial beekeeping in the US is largely centered on crop pollination at a value of over $14 billion. This involves the movement of honey bee colonies on large trucks around the country (often >3000 km). Farmers who grow crops that need pollination (blueberries, cucumbers, squashes, etc.) pay beekeepers ""rent"" for their colonies. The beekeepers then place their colonies adjacent to the farmer's crop during the 3-6 week bloom period. Honey bees (and all bees for that matter) have an insatiable appetite for pollen and collect it from flowers and use it as required nutritional support for the production of new bees. The collection of pollen from flowers and movement of that pollen from flower to flower results in a crop that has increased fruit set (i.e. a higher percentage of flowers that produce fruit), larger fruit size, and enhanced fruit quality. Almonds are a driving force in the US honey bee/crop pollination industry. Almond growers recognize that their crops will fail if honey bees are not present during the late winter/early spring bloom. Because of this, almond growers rent bee colonies at a price higher than that offered by growers of any other crop, thus luring beekeepers from around the US to California (where most of the almonds are grown) in February. Due to the value in almond pollination and the unusually early bloom period for a US crop, many US beekeepers overwinter their colonies in southern states to take advantage of favorable winter climates. Colonies can be kept stronger during warm winters and are ready to pollinate almond crops earlier than are colonies in the northern US. © 2012 Research Information Ltd.

Through interspecific reciprocal crosses between B. fruticulosa and three cultivated Brassica allotetraploids (AABB, AACC, and BBCC where A = 10, B = 8, and C = 9), four trigenomic hybrids (F.AC, 2n = 27; F.AB, 2n = 26; F.BC, 2n = 25; BC.F, 2n = 25) were produced.

In pollen mother cells (PMCs) of the trigenomic hybrids, 1-2 autosyndetic bivalents were detected within A, B, and C genomes but only one within F genome; 1-3 allosyndetic bivalents between any two genomes were observed, and a closer relationship of F and B genomes than F and A genomes or F and C genomes was revealed. The allohexaploids showed a generally low but different pollen fertilities. The chromosomes in PMCs were predominantly paired as bivalents but some univalents and multivalents at variable frequencies were observed. The bivalents of homologous pairing for each genome prevailed, but allosyndetic quadrivalents and hexavalents involving any two genomes were observed, together with autosyndetic quadrivalents for A, B, and C genomes but not the F genome.

In gynodioecious species, in which hermaphrodites and females coexist, the relative effect of these processes on the maintenance of sex polymorphism is still up for debate. The aim of this study was to document sex ratio and cytonuclear genetic variation at a very local scale in wind-pollinated gynodioecious Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima and attempt to elucidate which processes explained the observed variation. The study sites were characterized by geographically distinct patches of individuals and appeared to be dynamic entities, with recurrent establishment of distinct haplotypes through independent founder events. Along with substantial variation in sex ratio and unexpectedly low gene flow within study sites, our results showed a high genetic differentiation among a mosaic of genetically distinct demes, with isolation by distance or abrupt genetic discontinuities taking place within a few tens of metres. Overall, random founder events with restricted gene flow could be primary determinants of sex structure, by promoting the clumping of sex-determining genes. Such high levels of sex structure provide a landscape for differential selection acting on sex-determining genes, which could modify the conditions of maintenance of gynodioecy in structured populations. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Founder events; gene flow; gynodioecy; pollen and seed dispersal; polymorphic mating systems; spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856289842

In certain condition, the cells skip M-phase and undergo endoreduplication. Endoreduplication, occurring during a modified cell cycle, duplicates the entire genome without being followed by M-phase. A cycle of endoreduplication is common in most of the differentiated cells of plant vegetative tissues and it occurs extensively in cereal endosperm cells. Endoreduplication occurs when CDK/Cyclin complex low or inactive caused by ubiquitin-mediated degradation by APC and their activators. In this study, rice cell cycle switch 52 A (OsCCS52A), an APC activator, is functionally characterized using the reverse genetic approach. In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels. Localization studies revealed that OsCCS52A is a nuclear protein. OsCCS52A interacts with OsCdc16 in yeast. In addition, overexpression of OsCCS52A inhibits mitotic cell division and induces endoreduplication and cell elongation in fission yeast. The homozygous mutant exhibits dwarfism and smaller seeds. Further analysis demonstrated that endoreduplication cycles in the endosperm of mutant seeds were disturbed, evidenced by reduced nuclear and cell sizes. Taken together, these results suggest that OsCCS52A is involved in maintaining normal seed size formation by mediating the exit from mitotic cell division to enter the endoreduplication cycles in rice endosperm. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",APC activator; CCS52; Endoreduplication; Endosperm; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856230229

Our studies of background extinction concentrated on small relict populations occurring in the eastern Santa Monica Mountains where reproduction is genetically compromised by uniquely high rates of embryonic/endosperm abortion (97-99%) resulting largely from self-pollination in highly heterozygous populations. Environmental factors further reduce reproductive fitness. The relatively few viable seeds produced are not well adapted to survive wildfires that are a regular (approximately 21 years) occurrence in chaparral. Seedling recruitment after burning is rare and any established seedlings ultimately die from the annual 4-9-month summer droughts typical of Mediterranean climates. Adult mortality is manifest from wildfire (approximately 6%) and occasional multiple-year droughts (approximately 15%). Given the virtual absence of new post-fire reproduction and a low but persistent rate of adult mortality, slow population demise resulting in background extinction is inevitable. We posit that A.sparsifolium is ecologically 'out of place' in the present chaparral environment and appears best adapted to a moister climate with summer rains and few wildfires that prevailed before the increasing aridity and warming from mid-Holocene to the present. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Adult mortality; Allozymes; Chaparral; Embryonic abortion; Inbreeding depression; Reproductive fitness; Seed/ovule ratios; Seedling survivorship,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855798270

Recently, some have also been shown to interact with iron-sulphur clusters. These can be classified in two subgroups: class II Grx are found in all living organisms and are implicated in assembly of iron-sulphur clusters, while class I Grx are represented by only two members known to form a holodimer structure containing a cluster in vitro, but with an unknown function different from class II. Here, we report that in eukaryotic plants, GRXC1 (class I) orthologs are exclusively present in dicotyledonous plants, suggesting a specific function. Indeed, in Arabidopsis thaliana, reducing activity of recombinant GRXC1 is regulated by redox-dependent stability of the cluster. In planta, GRXC1 has been found predominantly in a holodimeric form, indicating the presence of the cluster in vivo. This suggests that GRXC1 acts as a redox sensor, reducing downstream pathways under oxidative conditions. GRXC2, the closest homolog of GRXC1, is unable to form a cluster in vitro. Knock-out mutants in grxc1 or grxc2 are aphenotypic, but the double mutant produces a lethal phenotype at an early stage after pollinization, suggesting that GRXC1 and GRXC2 share redundant and vital functions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Arabidopsis; Iron-sulphur,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855350829

Gender plasticity (GP), whereby hermaphrodites alter female and male functions depending on resources, and sex-differential plasticity (SDP) between hermaphrodites and unisexuals are predicted to affect sexual system stability. Here, GP and SDP are evaluated in cosexual and gynodioecious Wurmbea biglandulosa and sub-dioecious and dioecious W. dioica. Methods GP was evaluated under two resource conditions, compared among sexual systems and assessed as to whether (1) males produced perfect flowers and (2) hermaphrodites altered investment in perfect (female function) and total (male function) flowers. SDP was assessed within sexual systems as differences between sex functions of hermaphrodites vs. unisexuals. Males and hermaphrodites were compared to assess whether size thresholds for female function differed among sexual systems. Plasticity costs were evaluated using correlations between female function and male traits in hermaphrodites, and in W. dioica by comparing hermaphrodite and male regressions between plant size and pollen production. Key Results In dioecious W. dioica no males exhibited GP, whereas 100 did in gynodioecious and cosexual W. biglandulosa. In sub-dioecious W. dioica, resources affected GP (high, 66 ; low, 42 ). Hermaphrodites in all sexual systems reduced perfect but not total flowers under low resources. Unisexuals were unaffected, demonstrating SDP for female function only. Thresholds for female function were greater in sub-dioecious W. dioica than in W. biglandulosa. Plasticity costs were detected only in sub-dioecious W. dioica. Conclusions SDP for female function could assist female establishment in cosexual populations and maintain females in gynodioecious and sub-dioecious populations. Although the absence of male SDP should stabilize sub-dioecy, plasticity costs would render sub-dioecy unstable, favouring canalized males over hermaphrodites.

Populations classified as race G that overcome all known resistance genes have recently appeared. The objective of this research was to study the inheritance of resistance to broomrape race G in a resistant accession of Helianthus debilis subsp. tardiflorus. Heads of H. debilis subsp. tardiflorus were emasculated and pollinated with pollen of the Helianthus annuus-susceptible line HA 89. BC 1F 1, BC 1F 2, BC 1F 3, BC 2F 1, BC 2F 2 and BC 2F 3 generations were developed and evaluated for broomrape resistance. F 1 plants were resistant, indicating dominance of resistance. BC 1 populations segregated in a ratio of one resistant to one susceptible plant, whereas BC 1F 2 and BC 2F 2 populations segregated in a ratio of three resistant to one susceptible plant, which was confirmed in the evaluation of the BC 1F 3 and BC 2F 3 populations. The results indicated that resistance to broomrape race G in H. debilis subsp. tardiflorus is controlled by dominant alleles at a single locus.

Despite the vast amount of publications on nectar properties, the role of nectar as a natural bacterial habitat is yet unexplored. To gain a better understanding of bacterial communities inhabiting floral nectar, culture-dependent and -independent (454-pyrosequencing) methods were used. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial communities in nectar are abundant and diverse. Using culture-dependent method we showed that bacterial communities of nectar displayed significant variation among three plant species: Amygdalus communis, Citrus paradisi and Nicotiana glauca. The dominant class in the nectar bacterial communities was Gammaproteobacteria. About half of the isolates were novel species (<97% similarities of the 16S rRNA gene with known species). Using 454-pyrosequencing we demonstrated that nectar microbial community are distinct for each of the plant species while there are no significant differences between nectar microbial communities within nectars taken from different plants of the same species. Primary selection of the nectar bacteria is unclear; it may be affected by variations in the chemical composition of the nectar in each plant. The role of the rich and diverse nectar microflora in the attraction-repulsion relationships between the plant and its nectar consumers has yet to be explored. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856763448

We also measured three physical variables at each site: paleotopographic level, grain size, and total organic content. Paleoenvironmental conditions and paleofloral composition at Big Cedar Ridge covary strongly and are highly heterogeneous on small spatial scales. The reconstructed vegetation has some similarities with extant topogenous fens, but also important differences. Non-monocot angiosperms were abundant only on wet, mineral substrates that had been disturbed shortly before preservation, consistent with the weedy life histories that are inferred for their Early Cretaceous ancestors. Many non-monocot angiosperms grew in small, dispersed populations, consistent with the hypothesis that they were biotically pollinated. Overall, non-monocot angiosperm abundance was low compared with many modern wetlands. A single species of coryphoid palm was the dominant on moist, stable, moderately organic-rich sites, a pattern seen in some subtropical to tropical wetlands in the present day. Fern thickets at Big Cedar Ridge occupied highly organic, possibly low-nutrient substrates, and were dominated by Dipteridaceae, Gleicheniaceae, Schizaeaceae, and Matoniaceae. The overall high diversity and abundance of pteridophytes is unusual in the context of modern vegetation, regardless of climate zone, and probably represents a late occurrence of pteridophyte-dominated vegetation that was common earlier in the Mesozoic. Plant distributions at Big Cedar Ridge combine aspects of pre-angiosperm and modern vegetation in a way that suggests both niche conservatism and niche evolution on geological time scales. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.",Angiosperms; Big cedar ridge; Disturbance; Ferns; Nutrient stress; Paleoecology; USA; Wyoming,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859560836

To create male-sterile tall fescue, we applied Chimeric REpressor gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) based on rice APETALA3 (AP3) and AGAMOUS (AG) orthologues that specify the formation of stamens. We fused the coding regions of rice AP3 orthologue SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1), and rice AG orthologues, Os12g0207000, Os01g0886200 and OsMADS58, respectively with the artificial sequence encoding the modified EAR-like motif repression domain (SRDX). We first introduced Os12g0207000SRDX, Os01g0886200SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX into rice for evaluation of their abilities to induce male sterility. The transgenic rice expressing OsMADS58SRDX had reiterated formation of lodicule-like organs instead of stamens and carpel, a typical phenotype of ag mutant. Thus, we found that OsMADS58SRDX was most suitable for our purpose. Next, we introduced SPW1SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX into tall fescue. Although the transgenic tall fescue did not have the stamen alterations seen in SPW1SRDX and OsMADS58SRDX rice, they either produced no pollen or produced immature pollen; thus, the anthers were not dehiscent and the plants were male-sterile. In addition to the male sterility, SPW1SRDX tall fescue showed a cleistogamous (closed) phenotype in which anthers were not observed outside the glumes, with thin, abnormally elongated lodicules. Some lines of OsMADS58SRDX tall fescue showed a cleistogamous phenotype in which the lodicules were homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs. In both cases, cleistogamous phenotype was associated with morphological changes to the lodicules. We also obtained a mild phenotype of OsMADS58SRDX tall fescue, which exhibited only the male sterility. In this study, we produced novel male-sterile phenotypes using chimeric repressors and thus suggest CRES-T as a tool for transgenic improvement of forage and turf grasses. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Cleistogamous phenotype; CRES-T; Male sterility; OsMADS58; SUPERWOMAN1; Tall fescue,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155181021

We quantified the pattern of variation and covariation in floral traits and the proportion of seeds outcrossed (t) to better understand the evolutionary processes involved in mating system differentiation among and within populations of the short-lived Pacific coastal dune endemic Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia across its geographic range in western North America. Methods We quantified corolla width and herkogamy, two traits expected to influence the mating system, for 48 populations sampled in the field and for a sub-sample of 29 populations grown from seed in a glasshouse. We also measured several other floral traits for 919 populations, estimated t for 16 populations using seven allozyme polymorphisms, and measured the strength of self-incompatibility for nine populations. Key Results Floral morphology and self-incompatibility varied widely but non-randomly, such that populations could be assigned to three phenotypically and geographically divergent groups. Populations spanned the full range of outcrossing (t 0·0010·992), which covaried with corolla width, herkogamy and floral life span. Outcrossing also correlated with floral morphology within two populations that exhibited exceptional floral variation. Conclusions Populations of C. cheiranthifolia seem to have differentiated into three modal mating systems: (1) predominant outcrossing associated with self-incompatibility and large flowers; (2) moderate selfing associated with large but self-compatible flowers; and (3) higher but not complete selfing associated with small, autogamous, self-compatible flowers. The transition to complete selfing has not occurred even though the species appears to possess the required genetic capacity. We hypothesize that outcrossing populations in this species have evolved to different stable states of mixed mating. © The Author 2011.",Allozymes; Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia; corolla width; flower size; geographic variation; herkogamy; mating system; Onagraceae; outcrossing; self-fertilization; self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857467759

Two cycles of recurrent selection were used to develop populations 'AB-medium Syn-1', 'AB-medium Syn-2', 'CD-tall Syn-1' and 'CD-tall Syn-2'. Cycle 1 consisted of germinating 3500 open-pollinated seeds of each Syn-0 population in a -0.8MPa D-mannitol solution for seven days. All germinated seeds (approximately 250 of each population) were selected to create the Syn-1 populations. Cycle 2 selection was similar to Cycle 1, except that Syn-1 populations were used to create Syn-2 populations. To test the effects of selection, four 50-spikelet samples of the six populations were germinated at -0.8MPa for seven days. Germination of Syn-1 seeds was 6.7% higher than that of Syn-0 seeds, and Syn-2 seeds were 10.2% higher than that of Syn-1 seeds.

Many mechanisms remain poorly understood, among them the evolution and maintenance of male flowers in andromonoecy. Here, we studied the role of morphologically male flowers ('male morph') in andromonoecious Passiflora incarnata. • We measured morphological differences between hermaphroditic and male morph flowers in P. incarnata and explored the fruiting and siring ability of both flower types. • Male morph flowers in P. incarnata were of similar size to hermaphroditic flowers, and there was little evidence of different resource allocation to the two flower types. Male morph flowers were less capable of producing fruit, even under ample pollen and resource conditions. By contrast, male morph flowers were more successful in siring seeds. On average, male morph flowers sired twice as many seeds as hermaphroditic flowers. This difference in male fitness was driven by higher pollen export from male morph flowers as a result of greater pollen production and less self-pollen deposition. • The production of male morph flowers in P. incarnata appears to be a flexible adaptive mechanism to enhance male fitness, which might be especially beneficial when plants face temporary resource shortages for nurturing additional fruits. © 2011 The Authors.

Pathogens have been suggested as causal factors, however, baseline data on pathogen distributions in a large number of bumble bee species have not been available to test this hypothesis. In a nationwide survey of the US, nearly 10,000 specimens of 36 bumble bee species collected at 284 sites were evaluated for the presence and prevalence of two known Bombus pathogens, the microsporidium Nosema bombi and trypanosomes in the genus Crithidia. Prevalence of Crithidia was ?10% for all host species examined but was recorded from 21% of surveyed sites. Crithidia was isolated from 15 of the 36 Bombus species screened, and were most commonly recovered from Bombus bifarius, Bombus bimaculatus, Bombus impatiens and Bombus mixtus. Nosema bombi was isolated from 22 of the 36 US Bombus species collected. Only one species with more than 50 sampled bees, Bombus appositus, was free of the pathogen; whereas, prevalence was highest in Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus, two species that are reportedly undergoing population declines in North America. A variant of a tetranucleotide repeat in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the N. bombi rRNA gene, thus far not reported from European isolates, was isolated from ten US Bombus hosts, appearing in varying ratios in different host species. Given the genetic similarity of the rRNA gene of N. bombi sampled in Europe and North America to date, the presence of a unique isolate in US bumble could reveal one or more native North American strains and indicate that N. bombi is enzootic across the Holarctic Region, exhibiting some genetic isolation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Bombus species; Crithidia species; Microsporidia; Nosema bombi; Pollinator decline; RRNA; Trypanosomatida,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856221550

The Arabidopsis transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 6 (ARF6) and ARF8 regulate this complex process by promoting petal expansion, stamen filament elongation, anther dehiscence, and gynoecium maturation, thereby ensuring that pollen released from the anthers is deposited on the stigma of a receptive gynoecium. ARF6 and ARF8 induce jasmonate production, which in turn triggers expression of MYB21 and MYB24, encoding R2R3 MYB transcription factors that promote petal and stamen growth. To understand the dynamics of this flower maturation regulatory network, we have characterized morphological, chemical, and global gene expression phenotypes of arf, myb, and jasmonate pathway mutant flowers. We found that MYB21 and MYB24 promoted not only petal and stamen development but also gynoecium growth. As well as regulating reproductive competence, both the ARF and MYB factors promoted nectary development or function and volatile sesquiterpene production, which may attract insect pollinators and/or repel pathogens. Mutants lacking jasmonate synthesis or response had decreased MYB21 expression and stamen and petal growth at the stage when flowers normally open, but had increased MYB21 expression in petals of older flowers, resulting in renewed and persistent petal expansion at later stages. Both auxin response and jasmonate synthesis promoted positive feedbacks that may ensure rapid petal and stamen growth as flowers open. MYB21 also fed back negatively on expression of jasmonate biosynthesis pathway genes to decrease flower jasmonate level, which correlated with termination of growth after flowers have opened. These dynamic feedbacks may promote timely, coordinated, and transient growth of flower organs. © 2012 Reeves et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859192032

Pollinizer requirements and seedy fruit production are therefore a limiting factor for Hyuganatsu growers. 'Nishiuchi Konatsu', a bud mutation of Hyuganatsu, can set fruit by self-pollination and aborts most seeds. To obtain a better understanding of the reproductive mechanisms of 'Nishiuchi Konatsu', its pollen was characterized by pollen observation and viability testing in vitro in addition to pollen tube observation of the pistil following various pollination combinations. Furthermore, the ploidy level of 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' and the progenies obtained after controlled pollination were analyzed using a flow cytometer. As a result, 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen was shown to be functional in vitro, as indicated by both the pollen germination test and FDA staining. A curious feature of 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen is that a giant pollen of about 42-44 ?m in diameter, which is about 1.3-fold the average diameter of original Hyuganatsu pollen (33.4 ?m), was partially produced. Observation of in vivo pollen germination and pollen tube elongation revealed that Hyuganatsu (or 'Nishiuchi Konatsu') × 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' showed imperfect incompatibility; that is, some pollen tubes were able to enter the style while others could not. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' is diploid while all of its self-pollinated progenies, which were rarely obtained as normal seeds, were tetraploid. Progenies from other combinations were diploid. These results strongly suggest that unreduced 2n pollen production occurred in 'Nishiuchi Konatsu'. In addition to self-compatibilty and seed abortion of 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' self-pollination, it has been reported that the proportion of normal to aborted seeds differs according to the cultivar of the seed parent crossed with 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen (Honsho et al., 2009). Taking into account the unreduced pollen production as well as the effect of polyploidization on self-incompatibility and embryo development, we finally discussed why such a phenomenon was induced by pollination with 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' pollen and why 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' became self-compatible. © 2012.",Citrus; Diploid; Flow cytometry; Giant pollen; Unreduced male gamete,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856282202

Secondary-lateral branch removal practices were examined in horizontally trained two watermelon cultivars (Citrullus lanatus), 'Sambock-gul' and 'Speed-honey' to determine the comparative differences in labor input as well as to understand their impact on plant and fruit growth and fruit sugar accumulation. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 consisted of two treatments for plants trained with one main stem and two lateral branches: removal of the entire secondary-lateral branch or removal of the secondary-lateral branch below the fruit set node (partial removal). Experiment 2 consisted of three treatments for plants trained with either two or three lateral branches after topping the main stem: removal of the entire secondary-lateral branch, removal of the secondary-lateral branch below fruit set node, or removal of the secondary-lateral branch below the 5th node above fruit set node. Results showed that removal of the secondary-lateral branch below the fruit set node lowered human labor input by 50% compared with removal of the entire secondary-lateral branch. Additionally, some physiological benefits were also found for the plant treated by partial removal of the secondary-lateral branch. While fruit growth rate and fruit sucrose accumulation were much slower than those under other treatments until 3 weeks after pollination, 4 weeks after pollination sucrose accumulation started to increase steeply, and reached the highest concentration observed, 18. 2 mg·mL-1. A greater increase in the length of fine roots, 0. 2 mm in diameter, was observed under the partial removal treatment than for the entire removal treatment. During the fruit ripening period, the younger and developing leaves on secondary-lateral branches had a higher growth rate and higher photosynthetic activity than those of leaves on lateral branches. The integrated data indicate that active leaves on the secondary-lateral branch are likely to compete with the fruit as a sink during the fruit growing period, leading to slow fruit growth. However, during fruit ripening, the leaves on the secondary-lateral branch are likely to become a supportive source of carbon, leading to enhancement of sucrose accumulation in fruit. © 2012 Korean Society for Horticultural Science.",Citrullus lanatus; leaf area; root morphology; sucrose accumulation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864438975

The 91 polymorphic amplicons generated were statistically analyzed using WinDist and PopGene software to calculate various diversity indices. Contrary to the general concept of low genetic variation associated with inbreeders, R. serpentina exhibits high genetic diversity as the similarity index value based on Nei and Li's similarity coefficient ranges from 0.44 to 0.92 with mean value of 0.70.

From the beginning of the 21st century, beekeepers have reported a progressive increase in the overwintering mortality of honey bee colonies worldwide. Despite the failure to reach a consensus regarding the cause of this phenomenon, pathogens are thought to be strongly implicated. In the present work, we provide evidence of the negative effects of colony parasitization by Nosema spp. - primarily by N.ceranae- on the effectiveness of acaricide strips to treat Varroa destructor. The effectiveness of the Varroa mite strip treatment (Apivar ®) was greater in colonies in which Nosema spp. parasitization had been controlled. Several studies report that infection by Nosema spp. may affect the behaviour of worker bees. As the effectiveness of Varroa strip treatment depends on bees contacting the strips and their subsequent interaction within the colony, such behavioural and social alterations could interfere with the treatment and allow more severe effects to develop in the colonies infected by Nosema. These results should be considered when assessing acaricide treatments in field conditions due to the high prevalence of both pathogens worldwide. © 2011 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856747256

The diversity of pollen and ovule production was surveyed in 128 species and ten varieties. Taxa were assigned to Cruden's mating system categories based on their pollen-ovule ratios. Variation and correlations among floral characters were analyzed using regression and ANOVA, while the mating system categories were subjected to a linear discriminant and canonical variates analysis to assess their cohesiveness. Our data strongly suggest that most Cuscuta species possess a wide range of mixed-mating systems. Whereas four ovules develop in each flower, pollen production varies over three orders of magnitude. Several Cuscuta taxa are highly outcrossing, but no species could be identified that are exclusively selfing. The transition from the one-style flowers of subg. Monogynella to the two-style flowers of subgenera Cuscuta and Grammica, and from simultaneous to sequential maturation of the two stigmas in the latter subgenus, has decreased the role of herkogamy as a facilitator of outcrossing. These evolutionary changes are associated with an increase of species richness in subgenus Cuscuta, and especially in subgenus Grammica. Morphological features were not individually found to have a strong correlation to the mating system, but in general, larger corollas and stigmas were associated with greater pollen-ovule ratios. Cuscuta presents some puzzling results when considered in light of the sex allocation theory, as only some infrageneric lineages demonstrate the predicted pollen size-number tradeoff, while Cuscuta gracillima complex (in subgenus Grammica) displays an unexpected negative relationship between pollen size and style length. The relationship between host range and mating system is discussed, prompting further research into the co-evolution of pollination systems and life history traits between parasites and their host species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Convolvulaceae; Cuscuta; Dodder; Evolution; Flower morphology; Herkogamy; Mating system; Parasitic plants; Phylogeny; Pollen-ovule ratios; Reproductive assurance; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856221265

The flowers present diurnal anthesis, have a sweet and mild scent, and are pollinated by bees in search of the nectar secreted by evident nectaries. The flowers of Clusiaceae bear nectaries of staminodial origin. In Garcinia, the nectaries have been interpreted as being of receptacular origin or as sterile reproductive organs. Our aim in this study was to analyze the nature of the indefinite perianth, the differential development of the androecium in relation to the sexual system, and the origin of the nectaries from the perspective of floral biology and evolution. Floral anatomy and ontogeny were analyzed using both LM and SEM. The species has bracteoles that surround the flower buds. The perianth consists of tepals that are very similar to the bracteoles and that show a centripetal and gradual decrease of mesophyll and cuticle thickness. Developmental irregularities in the anthers lead to a reduction of pollen production in staminate flowers and complete male sterility in pistillate flowers because of peri- and postmeiotic cell degeneration.

Lindl.), one of the firstly harvested fruit in spring is important fruit for Turkey and other Mediterranean countries because it can be supplied to market during shortage of fresh fruit. Genetic diversity within the loquats comes from seeds obtained from open pollinated trees or budspots which occur very often within the genus. The objectives of this study were to determine variations for some fruit quality characters and genetic markers among 10 foreign cultivars, 3 selected local cultivars and two change seedlings. For fruit weight the largest cultivar was 'Kanro' with 46.2 g. Concordantly with its large fruits the highest fruit length and width also were measured in 'Kanro'. Seed number of accessions studied varied between 1.22 and 3.17. The highest flesh ratio was obtained from 'Baffico' (90%) whereas 'Seedling 1' had the lowest flesh ratio (75%). There were high level of variation for total soluble solids (TSS) and acidity of accessions studied. Total soluble solids (TSS) of cultivars were determined between 14.0 and 9.9%, acidity varied between 0.39 and 1.99%. Molecular analysis, as assessed with 21 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers indicated that all of accessions were distinguished. Using unweighted pair group method arithmetic average (UPGMA) analysis of RAPD data detected that similarity values among the loquats were between 0.69 and 0.92. In the dendrogram the accessions nested in two main groups. First group consisted of 'Hafif Cukurgobek', 'Uzun Cukurgobek', 'Tanaka' and 'Sayda' whereas rest of 11 accessions nested in other group.

The extent to which self-fertilization is favoured directly vs. arising indirectly through correlations with other adaptive life history traits is unclear. Trait responses to selection depend on genetic variation and covariation, as well as phenotypic and genetic responses to altered environmental conditions. We tested predictions of the hypothesis that self-fertilization in Mimulus arises through direct selection on physiological and developmental traits that allow seasonal drought escape. Methods Phenotypic selection on mating system and drought escape traits was estimated in field populations of M. guttatus. In addition, trait phenotype and phenotypic selection were compared between experimental wet and dry soil in two greenhouse populations each of M. guttatus and M. nasutus. Finally, genetic variation and covariation for traits were compared between wet and dry soil treatments in a greenhouse population of M. guttatus. Key Results Consistent with predictions, selection for early flowering was generally stronger than for mating system traits, and selection for early flowering was stronger in dry soil. Inconsistent with predictions, selection for water-use efficiency was largely absent; selection for large flowers was stronger than for drought escape in the field; and most drought escape and mating system traits were not genetically correlated. A positive genetic correlation between flowering time and flower size, which opposed the adaptive contour, emerged only in wet soil, suggesting that variation in water availability may maintain variation in these traits. Plastic responses to soil moisture treatments supported the idea that taxonomic divergence could have been facilitated by plasticity in flowering time and selfing. Conclusions The hypothesis that plant mating systems may evolve indirectly via selection on correlated life history characteristics is plausible and warrants increased attention. © The Author 2011.",Developmental rate; drought escape; floral evolution; flowering time; genetic correlation; heritability; mating system; Mimulus; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; phenotypic selection; water-use efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857497927

The species is an important ornamental plant, and is cultivated throughout the world. Lilium longiflorum has long been regarded as a self-incompatible species but the existence of selfing in some natural populations was suggested by isozyme analysis in a previous study. To confirm the occurrence of self-compatible individuals and to clarify the evolutionary shift of floral traits associated with degree of self-compatibility in L. longiflorum by comparative analysis, we used 17 populations of L. longiflorum, and two populations of L. formosanum, the genetically closest species of L. longiflorum, covering the entire species distribution. Artificial self-pollination revealed that not all L. longiflorum individuals are self-incompatible and there is substantial quantitative variation of self-incompatibility among L. longiflorum individuals and populations. Self-compatible dominant populations allopatrically and independently evolved at the periphery of the species distribution area, the northern Ryukyu Archipelago and Taiwan. Increasing degree of self-compatibility in L. longiflorum correlated with reduced corolla length, corolla width, corolla volume, and anther length for the Ryukyu Archipelago, in contrast to only reduced corolla width and volume for Taiwan. Approach between anther and stigma was not observed in any populations. Our data indicate that in the Ryukyu Archipelago increasing degree of self-compatibility evolved floral traits related to mating system evolution, to selfing, that does not depend on adjacency between anther and stigma position, but not in Taiwan. © 2012.",AFLP; Floral trait; Lilium longiflorum; Self-compatibility; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863011172

Homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants of AtVPS15 could not be obtained from the progenies of self-pollinated heterozygous mutants. Reciprocal crosses between atvps15 mutants and wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that the T-DNA insertion was not able to be transmitted by male gametophytes. DAPI staining, Alexander's stain and scanning electron microscopic analysis showed that atvps15 heterozygous plants produced pollen grains that were morphologically indistinguishable from wild-type pollen, whereas in vitro germination experiments revealed that germination of the pollen grains was defective. GUS staining analysis of transgenic plants expressing the GUS reporter gene driven by the AtVPS15 promoter showed that AtVPS15 was mainly expressed in pollen grains. Finally, DUALmembrane yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that AtVPS15 might interact directly with AtVPS34. These results suggest that AtVPS15 is very important for pollen germination, possibly through modulation of the activity of PI3-kinase. © 2012.",Arabidopsis; AtVPS15; PI3-kinase; Pollen germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863135557

Three high-yielding ToLCV-resistant tomato varieties were developed initially using conventional breeding and screening techniques involving inoculation by ToLCV-viruliferous whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. In 2003 and 2004, respectively, these varieties were released officially by the Karnataka State Seed Committee and the Indian Ministry of Agriculture through notification in the Gazette of India. From 2003 to 2005, eleven seed companies bought breeder seed of the ToLCV-resistant varieties and used them to begin breeding F1 hybrids from them. Socio-economic studies carried out to assess the benefits obtained from growing the ToLCV-resistant varieties found that farmers could gain up to 10 times the profit by growing the ToLCV-resistant varieties compared to the pre-existing ToLCV-susceptible varieties. Adoption of ToLCV-resistant tomatoes was also associated with reduced pesticide use. Extra income from tomato sales was prioritised by farmers to pay for children's education, better nutrition and medicines. In a joint effort with the commercial seed sector in India, a promotional field day was organised in 2007. As well as the three ToLCV-resistant varieties, 62 ToLCV-resistant hybrid tomatoes were exhibited during a farmer-field day by 17 commercial seed companies and several public institutes. Tomatoes with ToLCV-resistance are now grown widely in South India and seeds of the three open-pollinated varieties have been distributed to more than 12 countries. In 2007, a conservative estimate of the financial-benefit to cost of the research ratio was already more than 837:1. © 2012 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",Begomovirus; Bemisia tabaci; International development; Resistance; Tomato; Tomato leaf curl virus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862490437

Several studies on pollination and reproductive biology have been conducted, but generally information on flowering phenology and annual variation in total pollen production per tree is lacking. The reproductive phenology as well as flower- and pollen grain production of individuals in a population is important to theoreticians, field biologists and plant breeders, as they determine the distribution of genotypes within populations and influences the degree of differentiation among populations. This study reports flowering phenology and variation in total flower, fruit- and pollen production per tree in teak in a 25-year-old plantation across three consecutive years (2006-2008). The results show that the date of onset and end of flowering was highly variable across years. The longest flowering period of 93 days was observed in 2006. There was an asynchrony in the number of open flowers due to differences in time of anthesis among individuals (± 2 days) and inflorescences within individuals (± 6 h). The production of pollen grains per tree in 2007 was 33%, i.e. 16% more compared to 2006 and 2008. The fruit production per tree was 42% and 27% higher in 2007 compared to 2006 and 2008. Concentration of pollen grains (both on jelly-coated microscopic slides and stigmas) were highest between noon and 2 pm. At this time, the stigmatic pollen load ranged between 4-8 pollen grains per stigma, which is sufficient for fruit development. The study concludes that the asynchronization of the flower opening might give rise to a high amount of self-pollination in the stand, ultimately leading to poor fruit setting. Also, the large production of flowers and pollen per tree induced geitonogamy and decreased female fitness, as T. grandis is preferentially an out-crossing species. © 2012 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858281346

It is unknown, however, how different small- and large-scale habitat patches interact as pollinator sources. In the intensively managed Argentine Pampas, we studied the additive and interactive effects of large expanses (up to 2200 ha) of natural habitat, represented by untilled isolated ""sierras"", and narrow (3-7 m wide) strips of semi-natural habitat, represented by field margins, as pollinator sources for sunflower (Helianthus annus). We estimated visitation rates by feral honey-bees, Apis mellifera, and native flower visitors (as a group) at 1, 5, 25, 50 and 100 m from a field margin in 17 sunflower fields 0-10 km distant from the nearest sierra. Honey-bees dominated the pollinator assemblage accounting for > 90% of all visits to sunflower inflorescences. Honey-bee visitation was strongly affected by proximity to the sierras decreasing by about 70% in the most isolated fields. There was also a decline in honey-bee visitation with distance from the field margin, which was apparent with increasing field isolation, but undetected in fields nearby large expanses of natural habitat. The probability of observing a native visitor decreased with isolation from the sierras, but in other respects visitation by flower visitors other than honey-bees was mostly unaffected by the habitat factors assessed in this study. Overall, we found strong hierarchical and interactive effects between the study large and small-scale pollinator sources. These results emphasize the importance of preserving natural habitats and managing actively field verges in the absence of large remnants of natural habitat for improving pollinator services. © 2012 Sáez et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856379045

Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees, but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators, or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees, five species of bumblebee, three species of wasp, four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the UK for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses, Ascosphaera fungi, Microsporidia, and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp. Further work is needed to establish the identity of some of the parasites, their spatiotemporal variation, and whether they are infecting the various pollinator species or being vectored.

They are shaped like a hollow ball, lined on their inner surface by numerous tiny female flowers. Pollination is carried out by host-specific fig wasps (Agaonidae). Female pollinators enter the figs through a narrow entrance gate and once inside can walk around on a platform generated by the stigmas of the flowers. They lay their eggs into the ovules, via the stigmas and styles, and also gall the flowers, causing the ovules to expand and their pedicels to elongate. A single pollinator larva develops in each galled ovule. Numerous species of non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFW, belonging to other families of Chalcidoidea) also make use of galled ovules in the figs. Some initiate galls, others make use of pollinator-generated galls, killing pollinator larvae. Most NPFW oviposit from the outside of figs, making peripherally-located pollinator larvae more prone to attack. Style length variation is high among monoecious Ficus spp. and pollinators mainly oviposit into more centrally-located ovules, with shorter styles. Style length variation is lower in male (wasp-producing) figs of dioecious Ficus spp., making ovules equally vulnerable to attack by NPFW at the time that pollinators oviposit. We recorded the spatial distributions of galled ovules in mature male figs of the dioecious Ficus hirta in Southern China. The galls contained pollinators and three NPFW that kill them. Pollinators were concentrated in galls located towards the centre of the figs, NPFW towards the periphery. Due to greater pedicel elongation by male galls, male pollinators became located in more central galls than their females, and so were less likely to be attacked. This helps ensure that sufficient males survive, despite strongly female-biased sex ratios, and may be a consequence of the pollinator females laying mostly male eggs at the start of oviposition sequences. © 2012 Yu, Compton.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856303633

Agricultural intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However, deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin strips, a typical "" honeybee-friendly"" floral scheme. A foraging survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m × 2. m) from 17 Phacelia strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral enhancement schemes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Agro-ecosystem; Foraging pattern; Honeybee conservation; Phacelia tanacetifolia; Pollinators; Resource selection function,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455225643

In the present work, we put forward a bio-inspired strategy, that is, directly bring in biological systems capable of self-assembly to fabricate functionalized hierarchical structures for effective gas sensing. For advanced pollination, biomolecules in pollen coats could self assemble to form bio-structures with effective mass transportablity, and herein were used to guide the self assembly of SnO 2-precusors, which finally transferred to SnO 2 materials by calcination. Gaining the 3D hierarchical porous structrues formed in the self-assembly of biomolecules, the as-fabricated SnO 2 has high connective porous networks from macro- to micro-, and even nanoscale. The specific structures could facilite target gases to quickly transport towards, and then fully react with, the SnO 2 nanoparticles, and thus endow the SnO 2 with excellent gas response to both reducing gases (C 2H 5OH and CH 3CH 2CH 3) and oxidising gas (Cl 2). This present strategy provides a novel and facile way towards the development of functionallized hierarchical structures by learning from natural self-assembled systems. The resultant hierarchical structures can be extended to other applications in filters, adsorbents, catalysis, thermal, acoustic and electrical insulators, and so on. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84055182848

Ecological risk assessment (ERA) aims to estimate possible adverse effects of human activities on ecosystems and their parts. Current ERA practices, however, incorporate very little ecology and base the risk estimates on the results of standard tests with several standard species. The main obstacles for a more ecologically relevant ERA are the lack of clear protection goals and the inherent complexity of ecosystems that is hard to approach empirically. In this paper, we argue that the ecosystem services framework offers an opportunity to define clear and ecologically relevant protection goals. At the same time, ecological models provide the tools to address ecological complexity to the degree needed to link measurement endpoints and ecosystem services, and to quantify service provision and possible adverse effects from human activities. We focus on the ecosystem services relevant for agroecosystem functioning, including pollination, biocontrol and eutrophication effects and present modeling studies relevant for quantification of each of the services. The challenges of the ecosystem services approach are discussed as well as the limitations of ecological models in the context of ERA. A broad, multi-stakeholder dialog is necessary to aid the definition of protection goals in terms of services delivered by ecosystems and their parts. The need to capture spatio-temporal dynamics and possible interactions among service providers pose challenges for ecological models as a basis for decision making. However, we argue that both fields are advancing quickly and can prove very valuable in achieving more ecologically relevant ERA. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..",Assessment endpoints; Biological control; Eutrophication; Extrapolation; Pollination; Protection goals,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855845468

The level of free IAA in the developmental ovaries increased gradually from the stages of ovular primordium to the functional megaspore, but slightly decreased when the embryo sacs formed. Immunoenzyme labeling clearly showed that both IAA and ABP1 were distributed in the ovules, the edge of the placenta, vascular tissues and the ovary wall, while PM H +-ATPase was mainly localized in the ovules. By using immunogold labeling, the subcellular distributions of IAA, ABP1 and PM H +-ATPase in the ovules were also shown.

These are however crucial for designing appropriate risk assessment schemes. The process followed by the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) as well as examples of resulting SPGs obtained so far for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of pesticides is presented. The ecosystem services approach was used as an overarching concept for the development of SPGs, which will likely facilitate communication with stakeholders in general and risk managers in particular. It is proposed to develop SPG options for 7 key drivers for ecosystem services (microbes, algae, non target plants (aquatic and terrestrial), aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial non target arthropods including honeybees, terrestrial non-arthropod invertebrates, and vertebrates), covering the ecosystem services that could potentially be affected by the use of pesticides. These SPGs need to be defined in 6 dimensions: biological entity, attribute, magnitude, temporal and geographical scale of the effect, and the degree of certainty that the specified level of effect will not be exceeded. In general, to ensure ecosystem services, taxa representative for the key drivers identified need to be protected at the population level. However, for some vertebrates and species that have a protection status in legislation, protection may be at the individual level. To protect the provisioning and supporting services provided by microbes it may be sufficient to protect them at the functional group level. To protect biodiversity impacts need to be assessed at least at the scale of the watershed/landscape. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..",Ecosystem services; Ecotoxicology; Environmental risk assessment; Guidance documents; Pesticides; Protection goals,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855830385

The Hi II, a highly embryogenic genotype, has been extensively used in transformation protocols. However, this is not an inbred line; instead, it has a proportion of the undesirable A-188 background, and the progeny segregates for phenotypic characteristics and shows poor agronomic performance. In an effort to identify genotypes that combine a high somatic embryogenic response and good agronomic performance, we evaluated 48 advanced inbred lines developed at INTA. Callus development and somatic embryogenesis capacity were measured in 200 immature embryos per line. Embryogenic capacity [EC (mature somatic embryos/callus evaluated) x 100], Regeneration Capacity (RC) and Fertile Plant Recovery in greenhouse (FPR, fertile plants/regenerated plants) were recorded.

Also, we selected three promising lines with high agronomic performance, as alternatives to Hi II, in order to be included in a maize transformation scheme via somatic embryogenesis. In addition, we report the usefulness of Single Sequences Repeat (SSRs) in the determination of genetic diversity among 14 divergent lines for somatic embryogenesis response.

In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ?0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ?1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides. © 2012 Schneider et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855704065

A protocol is described for measuring gloss in petal samples collected in the field, using a glossmeter. Repeatability of the technique is assessed. We demonstrate a simple yet highly accurate and repeatable method that can easily be implemented in the field.

Recent studies have shown that species have shifted from high-elevation areas to low ones because the rise in temperature has increased rainfall. These outcomes challenge the existing hypothesis about the responses of species to climate change. Methodology/Principal Findings: With the use of data on the biological characteristics and reproductive behavior of Cephalantheropsis obcordata in Luofu Mountain, Guangdong, China, trends in the population size of the species were predicted based on several factors. The response of C. obcordata to climate change was verified by integrating it with analytical findings on meteorological data and an artificially simulated environment of water change. The results showed that C. obcordata can grow only in waterlogged streams. The species can produce fruit with many seeds by insect pollination; however, very few seeds can burgeon to become seedlings, with most of those seedlings not maturing into the sexually reproductive phase, and grass plants will die after reproduction. The current population's age pyramid is kettle-shaped; it has a Deevey type I survival curve; and its net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, as well as finite rate of increase are all very low. The population used in the artificial simulation perished due to seasonal drought. Conclusions: The change in rainfall patterns caused by climate warming has altered the water environment of C. obcordata in Luofu Mountain, thereby restricting seed burgeoning as well as seedling growth and shortening the life span of the plant. The growth rate of the C. obcordata population is in descending order, and models of population trend predict that the population in Luofu Mountain will disappear in 23 years. © 2012 Xiao et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855570855

Previous reports found that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, SIZ1, participated in many processes depending on particular target substrates and suppression of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation. Here, we report that SIZ1 mediates the reproductive process. SIZ1 showed enhanced expression in female organs, but was not detected in the anther or pollen. A defect in the siz1-2 maternal source resulted in reduced seed-set regardless of high SA concentration within the plant. Moreover, aniline blue staining and scanning electron microscopy revealed that funicular and micropylar pollen tube guidance was arrested in siz1-2 plants. Some of the embryo sacs of ovules in siz1-2 were also disrupted quickly after stage FG7. There was no significant affects of the siz1-2 mutation on expression of genes involved in female gametophyte development- or pollen tube guidance in ovaries. Together, our results suggest that SIZ1 sustains the stability and normal function of the mature female gametophyte which is necessary for pollen tube guidance. © 2012 Ling et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855480101

This may represent an important problem for future almond growing, since the use of a very limited germplasm base as source of self-compatibility in breeding programmes has presumably led to a considerable increase of the inbreeding degree in subsequent progenies, from which new cultivars will be released. In the present study, the effects of inbreeding depression on flower morphology, pollen viability, pollen tube growth and fruit set were evaluated after self- and cross-pollination of two self-compatible almond cultivars and 12 descendants obtained from successive self-fertilizations. Moreover, in those descendants with very low or null fruit set values and in the cultivar 'Tuono' (first generation), the embryo sac development was studied. The self-compatible cultivar 'Antoñeta' was included as external control in the experimental assays. In general, there were no differences between both types of pollination, and only those individuals with higher inbreeding levels were affected by inbreeding depression, which was manifested by lower pollen germination, decelerated growth of pollen tubes through the style, delayed ovule development at the prezygotic phase, and high fruit drop. This high fruit drop seemed to be due to the presence of many aborted fruits with an anomalous postzygotic development of the embryo sac, finally resulting in necrosis at the chalazal end and lack of endosperm cellularization. Therefore, data presented here indicate that the low or null fruit set observed after fertilization in highly inbred almond genotypes seems to be a consequence of inbreeding depression, and highlight the importance of avoiding successive self-fertilizations as strategy of breeding in this species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Embryo sac development; Flower morphology; Fruit set; Inbreeding depression; Prunus dulcis; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82455210934

Central to such efforts is the ability to correctly recognise and diagnose species. The B. lucorum complex (Bombus lucorum, B. cryptarum and B. magnus) comprises one of the most abundant and important group of wild plant and crop pollinators in northern Europe. Although the workers of these species are notoriously difficult to diagnose morphologically, it has been claimed that queens are readily diagnosable from morphological characters. Here we assess the value of colour-pattern characters in species identification of DNA-barcoded queens from the B. lucorum complex. Three distinct molecular operational taxonomic units were identified each representing one species. However, no uniquely diagnostic colour-pattern character state was found for any of these three molecular units and most colour-pattern characters showed continuous variation among the units. All characters previously deemed to be unique and diagnostic for one species were displayed by specimens molecularly identified as a different species. These results presented here raise questions on the reliability of species determinations in previous studies and highlights the benefits of implementing DNA barcoding prior to ecological, taxonomic and conservation studies of these important key pollinators. © 2012 Carolan et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855464252

In this association a species host range is fundamental and often measured using an estimate of phylogenetic concordance between species. Pollinating fig wasps display extreme host species specificity, but the intraspecific variation in empirical accounts of host affiliation has previously been underestimated. In this investigation, lineage delimitation and codiversification tests are used to generate and discuss hypotheses elucidating on pollinating fig wasp associations with Ficus. Results: Statistical parsimony and AMOVA revealed deep divergences at the COI locus within several pollinating fig wasp species that persist on the same host Ficus species. Changes in branching patterns estimated using the generalized mixed Yule coalescent test indicated lineage duplication on the same Ficus species. Conversely, Elisabethiella and Alfonsiella fig wasp species are able to reproduce on multiple, but closely related host fig species. Tree reconciliation tests indicate significant codiversification as well as significant incongruence between fig wasp and Ficus phylogenies. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate more relaxed pollinating fig wasp host specificity than previously appreciated. Evolutionarily conservative host associations have been tempered by horizontal transfer and lineage duplication among closely related Ficus species. Independent and asynchronistic diversification of pollinating fig wasps is best explained by a combination of both sympatric and allopatric models of speciation. Pollinator host preference constraints permit reproduction on closely related Ficus species, but uncertainty of the frequency and duration of these associations requires better resolution. © 2012 McLeish and van Noort; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855238197

A variety of stressors have been implicated as potential causes, including agricultural pesticides. Neonicotinoid insecticides, which are widely used and highly toxic to honey bees, have been found in previous analyses of honey bee pollen and comb material. However, the routes of exposure have remained largely undefined. We used LC/MS-MS to analyze samples of honey bees, pollen stored in the hive and several potential exposure routes associated with plantings of neonicotinoid treated maize. Our results demonstrate that bees are exposed to these compounds and several other agricultural pesticides in several ways throughout the foraging period. During spring, extremely high levels of clothianidin and thiamethoxam were found in planter exhaust material produced during the planting of treated maize seed. We also found neonicotinoids in the soil of each field we sampled, including unplanted fields. Plants visited by foraging bees (dandelions) growing near these fields were found to contain neonicotinoids as well. This indicates deposition of neonicotinoids on the flowers, uptake by the root system, or both. Dead bees collected near hive entrances during the spring sampling period were found to contain clothianidin as well, although whether exposure was oral (consuming pollen) or by contact (soil/planter dust) is unclear. We also detected the insecticide clothianidin in pollen collected by bees and stored in the hive. When maize plants in our field reached anthesis, maize pollen from treated seed was found to contain clothianidin and other pesticides; and honey bees in our study readily collected maize pollen. These findings clarify some of the mechanisms by which honey bees may be exposed to agricultural pesticides throughout the growing season. These results have implications for a wide range of large-scale annual cropping systems that utilize neonicotinoid seed treatments. © 2012 Krupke et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855310180

Studies conducted in 1995-1998 and published in 2001 showed that B. impatiens was a good pollinator of lowbush blueberry. Stocking density was estimated at 3/4-1 quad (set of four, 250-bee colonies) per acre. Subsequent research reported here has shown that on an individual bee basis, B. impatiens is 2.5 times more efficient per floral visit in placing pollen on the stigma. Foraging behavior suggests that bumble bees may be more consistent at producing outcrossing among clones than honey bees, although individual honey bees are more likely to be floral constant than bumble bees. By 2004, some blueberry growers questioned the efficacy of commercial bumble bees. To address these concerns, a three-year validation experiment was conducted from 2005-2007. Seven to nine isolated individual small blueberry fields (2-25 acres) were selected each year to compare bumble bees with honey bees or no commercial pollinators (n = 3 to 5 fields per treatment) It was verified that 2.5 quads/ha was a suitable stocking density and did not differ in pollination level from 7.5-10 honey bee hives per ha. A central place foraging behavior could not be demonstrated with bumble bees in these smaller fields. It was established that as the foraging force of bumble bees increased, which varied between hives and fields, better fruit set resulted. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",blueberry; bumble bee; pollination; stocking density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859492790

This study compares two South American species, Morrenia odorata and Morrenia brachystephana, with respect to morphology and anatomy of flower structures, dynamic aspects of the pollination mechanism, diversity of visitors and effectiveness of pollinators.•Methods: Floral structure was studied with fresh and fixed flowers following classical techniques. The pollination mechanism was studied by visiting fresh flowers in the laboratory with artificial pollinator body parts created with an eyelash. Morphometric and nectar measurements were also taken. Pollen transfer efficiency in the flowers was calculated by recording the frequency of removed and inserted pollinia. Visitor activity was recorded in the field, and floral visitors were captured for subsequent analysis of pollen loads. Finally, pollinator effectiveness was calculated with an index.•Key Results: The detailed structure of the flowers revealed a complex system of guide rails and chambers precisely arranged in order to achieve effective pollinaria transport. Morrenia odorata is functionally specialized for wasp pollination, and M. brachystephana for wasp and bee pollination. Pollinators transport chains of pollinaria adhered to their mouthparts.•Conclusions: Morrenia odorata and M. brachystephana present differences in the morphology and size of their corona, gynostegium and pollinaria, which explain the differences in details of the functioning of the general pollination mechanism. Pollination is performed by different groups of highly effective pollinators. Morrenia species are specialized for pollination mainly by several species of wasps, a specialized pollination which has been poorly studied. In particular, pompilid wasps are reported as important pollinators in other regions outside South Africa. A putative new function of nectar in asclepiads is presented, as it would be contributing to the pollination mechanism. © The Author 2011.",asclepiads; functional morphology; Morrenia brachystephana; Morrenia odorata; pollination mechanism; pollinator effectiveness; wasps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555178083

However, long-term exploitation and habitat destruction have threatened these plants in nature. Knowledge of the reproductive biology of S. sphenanthera is essential to help formulate a conservation strategy for these plants. Field studies were conducted at Jigong Mountain (JGM) and Jinji Valley (JJV) in Henan and Hubei Provinces, China. The reproductive biology of S. sphenanthera was analyzed at these sites, including population structure, pollination, floral morphology, and natural fruit set. The 11 populations at two sites were male biased. The primary floral visitors were gall midges (Resseliella sp., Cecidomyiidae; Diptera) and thrips (Thrips flavidulus; Thysanoptera). Floral visitor exclusion experiments and pollen load analysis indicate that gall midges are the primary pollinators. Pollen was the only floral reward for the gall midges. Female flowers attracted pollinators using deceit. The natural fruit set ratio in the cut forest site (JJV) was significantly lower than that at the JGM site, where habitats of S. sphenanthera were well preserved.

The study of plant-pollinator interactions in a network context is receiving increasing attention. This approach has helped to identify several emerging network patterns such as nestedness and modularity. However, most studies are based only on qualitative information, and some ecosystems, such as deserts and tropical forests, are underrepresented in these data sets. 2. We present an exhaustive analysis of the structure of a 4-year plant-pollinator network from the Monte desert in Argentina using qualitative and quantitative tools. We describe the structure of this network and evaluate sampling completeness using asymptotic species richness estimators. Our goal is to assess the extent to which the realized sampling effort allows for an accurate description of species interactions and to estimate the minimum number of additional censuses required to detect 90% of the interactions. We evaluated completeness of detection of the community-wide pollinator fauna, of the pollinator fauna associated with each plant species and of the plant-pollinator interactions. We also evaluated whether sampling completeness was influenced by plant characteristics, such as flower abundance, flower life span, number of interspecific links (degree) and selectiveness in the identity of their flower visitors, as well as sampling effort. 3. We found that this desert plant-pollinator network has a nested structure and that it exhibits modularity and high network-level generalization. 4. In spite of our high sampling effort, and although we sampled 80% of the pollinator fauna, we recorded only 55% of the interactions. Furthermore, although a 64% increase in sampling effort would suffice to detect 90% of the pollinator species, a fivefold increase in sampling effort would be necessary to detect 90% of the interactions. 5. Detection of interactions was incomplete for most plant species, particularly specialists with a long flowering season and high flower abundance, or generalists with short flowering span and scant flowers. Our results suggest that sampling of a network with the same effort for all plant species is inadequate to sample interactions. 6. Sampling the diversity of interactions is labour intensive, and most plant-pollinator networks published to date are likely to be undersampled. Our analysis allowed estimating the completeness of our sampling, the additional effort needed to detect most interactions and the plant traits that influence the detection of their interactions. © 2011 The Authors.

For species pollinated by grooming pollinators, such as bees, the amount of pollen carried between a donor flower and potential recipient flowers depends on how grooming influences pollen transfer. To investigate the relationship between grooming and pollen-mediated gene dispersal, we studied bumblebee (Bombus fervidus) foraging behavior and resulting gene dispersal in linear arrays of Mimulus ringens. Each of the 14 plants in an array had a unique multilocus genotype, facilitating unambiguous assignment of paternity to 1050 progeny. Each plant was trimmed to a single flower so that pollinator movements could be linked directly to resulting gene dispersal patterns. Pollen-mediated gene dispersal was very limited. More than 95% of the seeds sired by a donor flower were distributed over the first three recipient flowers in the visitation sequence. However, seeds were occasionally sired on flowers visited later in the pollinator's floral visitation sequence. Intensive grooming immediately following pollen removal from a donor flower significantly increased the decay rate of the donor flower's gene dispersal curve. These results suggest that the frequency and relative intensity of grooming can have significant effects on patterns of pollen-mediated gene dispersal from individual pollen donors. © 2011 The Authors.

Focusing on the Mediterranean basin, we review the literature and propose conceptual models to explain the direct and indirect effects of fire on plant-pollinator interactions, seed dispersers, and predators, as well as the temporal changes in these systems along post-fire succession and ecosystem recovery processes. Post-fire plant communities change in their composition, structure, floral resources, as well as seed and fruit resources. Fire directly affects communities of pollinators, seed dispersers, and seed predators mainly by mortality, and indirectly through changes in the quality and quantity of food and nesting resources. Pollinators, seed-dispersers, and seed predators depend on plant community composition and on the flower, seed, and fruit resources they produce. As a consequence, their community composition, structure, and function are expected to vary in response to post-fire temporal and spatial changes in plant communities, which in turn depend on fire severity, frequency, scale, and the distance from fire-edge, as well as their foraging range. In return, the changes resulting from fire in pollinator, seed-disperser and seed predator communities may affect plant fecundity and plant community composition.",ants; bees; birds; diversity; nectar; nesting sites; seed-bank,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879678566

However, there have been few studies of their functional significance and effects on plant fitness. Most previous studies focused on pollinator behaviour and used artificial flowers in laboratory settings. We experimentally investigated the role of putative nectar guides in a natural system: the South African iris Lapeirousia oreogena, whose flowers have a clearly visible pattern of six white arrow-markings pointing towards the narrow entrance of the long corolla tube, and its sole pollinator, a long-proboscid nemestrinid fly. We painted over none, some or all of the white arrowmarkings with ink that matched the colour of the corolla background. Although arrow-marking removal had little effect on the approaches by flies to flowers from a distance, it dramatically reduced the likelihood of proboscis insertion. Export of pollen dye analogue (an estimate of male fitness) was reduced to almost zero in flowers from which all nectar guides had been removed, and fruit set (a measure of female fitness) was also significantly reduced. Our results confirm that the markings on L. oreogena flowers serve as nectar guides and suggest that they are under strong selective maintenance through both male and female fitness components in this pollination system. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Long-tongued fly; Nectar guide; Plant fitness; Pollination; Pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855708255

Currently, they are considered as a separate section within genus Lotus, distinct from other herbaceous Canarian congeners which are yellow-flowered and bee-pollinated. A combined analysis of four nuclear regions (including ITS and three homologues of CYCLOIDEA) and three plastid regions (CYB6, matK and trnH-psbA) nests the four bird-pollinated species within a single extant species of bee-pollinated Lotus (L. sessilifolius), in a very extreme example of species paraphyly. Therefore, our data compellingly support the hypothesis that the Macaronesian Lotus species with a bird pollination syndrome are recently derived from entomophilous ancestors. Calibration of the phylogenetic trees using geological age estimates of the most recent islands (La Palma and El Hierro) together with oldest ages of Fuerteventura indicates that bird pollination evolved ca. 1.7. Ma in the Canarian Lotus. These four bird-pollinated species share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with L. sessilifolius that dates to about 2.2. Ma. Our analyses further suggest that the evolution of the bird pollination syndrome was likely triggered by the availability of new niches in La Palma and Tenerife as a result of recent volcanic activity. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Bird pollination; Canary Islands; CYCLOIDEA; Dating; Macaronesia; Molecular phylogeny; Pedrosia; Rhyncholotus; Species paraphyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83655180978

In this species, the flowers are helically arranged around the stem, and the degree of twisting varies greatly among individuals. The large variation in inflorescence architecture in S. sinensis results from variation in a single structural parameter, the helical angle (the angular distance between neighbour-flower directions). • The numbers of visits per inflorescence and successive probes per visit by leaf-cutting bees decreased with helical angle, indicating that individual flowers of tightly twisted inflorescences received less visitations. As expected from pollinator behaviour, pollinia removal and fruit set of individual flowers decreased with helical angle. Meanwhile, geitonogamy decreased in tightly twisted inflorescences. • Our novel findings demonstrate that natural variation in inflorescence architecture significantly affects pollinator behaviour and reproductive success, suggesting that inflorescence architecture can evolve under pollinator-mediated natural selection in plant populations.

We monitored pollinator visits to this fruit shrub in a Brazilian savanna and identified the pollinator's other food resources. Twenty-three species of pollinators were sampled. Although there were temporal variations in visitor frequency, satisfactory levels of fruit set were obtained. This temporal variation promoted a compensatory effect on plant reproduction as the pollinator species were replaced during the course of flowering. The analysis of pollen loads showed grains of 16 plant species and four pollen types belonging to seven families that formed a network with a nested pattern. Such a network suggests that generalist plants must be available in the crop vicinity.

It is generally assumed that bees are responsible for the vast majority of lowbush blueberry pollination, and producers usually augment the natural pollination force with managed bees. Little is known, however, of the potential role of nocturnal pollinators in lowbush blueberry production. We conducted a field experiment where patches of blooming blueberry were exposed to flying insects 24 h a day, only during the day (sunrise to sunset), only at night (sunset to sunrise), or 0 h a day. We found that significant fruit set occurred on blueberry stems that were exposed only at night, although it was higher on stems exposed during the day or 24 h a day. However, ripe fruit produced on stems exposed only at night weighed just as much as those exposed 24 h.

We investigated the mating system and reproductive traits that facilitate its spread in the Marlborough Sounds. Flower observations revealed that visitors were almost exclusively introduced honeybees and bumblebees, indicating an invasive mutualism. We investigated the pollination system of banana passionfruit by comparing fruit set, fruit size, seed set, and germination success between hand-selfed, hand-crossed, bagged and open flowers, and inbreeding depression in seedlings grown in competition. Fruit set was reduced by 83% when pollinators were excluded (3.0% fruit set, compared with 18.0% for unmanipulated flowers) indicating reliance on pollinators for reproduction. While banana passionfruit is partially self-compatible, fruit set was significantly reduced in hand-selfed flowers (17.5%) compared with crossed flowers (29.5%), and we found significant pollen limitation (hand-crossed vs unmanipulated, Pollen Limitation Index = 0.39). There was no significant inbreeding depression found in fruit size, seeds per fruit, germination success, seedling growth or seedling survival. Combining these data showed that natural unmanipulated flowers produce more seedlings per flower (1.7) than bagged flowers (0.9), but fewer than hand-selfed (3.0) and hand-crossed (5.3) flowers.

In this study, we used eight microsatellite loci to investigate the effect of fragmentation on the mating system and pollen dispersal within one large and eight small population remnants of Banksia sphaerocarpa var. caesia, a bird-pollinated shrub in the southern agricultural region of Western Australia. The large population had a much larger neighbourhood size and lower selfing rate, maternal pollen pool differentiation and within-plot mean pollen dispersal distance than the small populations. Outcrossing was consistently high and ranged from 85.7% Â± 2.6 to 98.5% Â± 0.9, and mating patterns suggested nearest-neighbour pollination. Pollen immigration into small populations ranged from 2.8% Â± 1.8 to 16.5% Â± 3.2. Using the small populations, we tested for correlations between various fragmentation variables and mating system and pollen dispersal parameters. We found significant negative linear relationships between population isolation and outcrossing rate; population shape and neighbourhood size; and conspecific density and mean pollen dispersal distance. There were significant positive linear relationships between population shape and pollen pool differentiation and between population size and number of different fathers per seed crop. Our results suggest that birds may use a series of fragmented populations as a vegetation corridor while foraging across the landscape and that population connectivity is a critical determinant of pollinator visitation. Our results also suggest that the effect of a linear population shape on the mating system and pollen dispersal is routinely underestimated. © 2011 State of Western Australia.",Banksia sphaerocarpa; fragmentation; mating system; pollen dispersal; population shape,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855454741

Animal-mediated pollination is an essential ecosystem function and service provided to mankind. However, little is known how pollinator diversity could affect pollination services. Using a substitutive design, we experimentally manipulated functional group (FG) and species richness of pollinator communities to investigate their consequences on the reproductive success of an obligate out-crossing model plant species, Raphanus sativus. Both fruit and seed set increased with pollinator FG richness. Furthermore, seed set increased with species richness in pollinator communities composed of a single FG. However, in multiple-FG communities, highest species richness resulted in slightly reduced pollination services compared with intermediate species richness. Our analysis indicates that the presence of social bees, which showed roughly four times higher visitation rates than solitary bees or hoverflies, was an important factor contributing to the positive pollinator diversity-pollination service relationship, in particular, for fruit set. Visitation rate at different daytimes, and less so among flower heights, varied among social bees, solitary bees and hoverflies, indicating a niche complementarity among these pollinator groups. Our study demonstrates enhanced pollination services of diverse pollinator communities at the plant population level and suggests that both the niche complementarity and the presence of specific taxa in a pollinator community drive this positive relationship. © The Royal Society 2012.",Biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship; Complementary resource use; Ecosystem services; Plant-pollinator interactions; Positive selection effect; Social bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868130490

Reina Mercedes 9, 41012 Sevilla, Spain","It is widely recognized that pollinators vary in their effectiveness in pollination mutualisms, due both to differences in flower-pollinator morphological fit as well as pollinator behaviour. However, pollination webs typically treat all interactions as equal, and we contend that this method may provide misleading results. Using empirical and theoretical data, we present the case study of a self-incompatible herb in which the number of flowers visited by a pollinator cannot be used as a surrogate for the total effect of a pollinator on a plant due to differences in per-visit effectiveness at producing seeds. In self-incompatible species, the relationship between interaction frequency and per-interaction effect may become increasingly negative as more flowers per plant are visited due to geitonogamous pollen transfer. We found that pollinators making longer bouts (i. e. visiting more flowers per plant visit) had an overall higher pollination success per bout. However, per-interaction effects tended to decrease as the bout progressed, particularly for pollinators that cause higher pollen deposition. Since the same interaction frequency may result from different combinations of number of bouts (plant visits) and bout length (flowers visited/bout), pollinators making repeatedly shorter bouts may contribute more to plant reproduction for the same number of flowers visited. Consequently, the magnitude of the differences in number of interactions of different insect types may be overridden by the magnitude of the differences in effectiveness as pollinators, even if the same pollinators consistently interact more frequently. We discuss two predictions regarding the validity of using interaction frequency as a surrogate for plant seed production (as a measure of total effect), depending on the degree of self-compatibility, plant size and floral display. We suggest that the role of interaction frequency must be tested for different species, environments, and across wider scales to validate its use as a surrogate for total effect in plant-pollinator networks. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Bout length; Mutualistic networks; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollen deposition; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855572804

In the case of sunbird-pollinated plants, data on nectar traits originate almost exclusively from the South African region and are very scarce for tropical Africa, where paradoxically the highest sunbird diversity occurs. Here we present a study on the nectar properties of a sunbird-pollinated plant, Impatiens sakeriana, growing in the West African mountains, including the nectar production, diurnal changes in the nectar standing crop, the nectar concentrations, the nectar volumes, total sugar amounts and sugar composition. Moreover we compare the nectar traits of I. sakeriana with six other co-flowering insect-visited plant species.Our results showed that many nectar properties, including high volume (approx. 38?L in flowers unvisited by sunbirds), low sugar concentration (approx. 30% w/w) and high sucrose content (95%), are specific to I. sakeriana, compared to the insect-visited plants. These are in accordance with the most recent theory that nectar properties of the sunbird-pollinated plants are similar to those pollinated by hummingbirds. © 2011 South African Association of Botanists.",Cameroon; Impatiens sakeriana; Nectar; Pollination; Sunbird,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855914854

After more than 100 years since its original description by R. A. Philippi (1884), the species was rediscovered exclusively in two locations of the Maule Region. One of them, Fundo San Pedro-Las Cañas, is close to extinction with a low number of shrubs, occurring in a disturbed habitat due to plantations of Pinus radiata. This study examined the pollination biology and breeding system of A. bijuga in order to explain their small number of shrubs. We estimated composition of pollinator species attracted to flowers and visitation rates. In order to describe its breeding system in A. bijuga we used manipulated treatments to estimate autonomous self-pollination, level of reproductive assurance and pollen limitation. The results of this study indicate that only pollinators from the order Hymenoptera visit A. bijuga. The pollinator assemblage did not show temporary variation during the flowering season, with Bombus dahlbomii as its most frequent visitor. A. bijuga showed a mixed mating system that involves both cross- and self- pollination. The fruit set ranges from 20% to 60% in the absence or presence of pollinators, respectively. This selfing ability would provide reproductive assurance when pollinators fail. The taxon showed ability of asexual formation of seeds without the occurrence of fertilization by agamospermy. Supplemental outcross pollen did not increase female reproductive success, suggesting that the species is not pollen limited. All these factors may help to explain how this species has been able to survive over time in a small and isolated population. Finally, this work discusses how the results of our study can be applied to future A. bijuga conservation measures. © 2012, Universidad de Concepcion.

Using Pedicularis lachnoglossa from Yulong (Jade Dragon) Snow Mountain in Lijiang (Yunnan Province, southwest China), we investigated the effects of high altitude habitats on the process of pollination and seed production. Floral biology, pollinator foraging behavior, breeding system, and pollination efficiency were examined using observation and exclusionary techniques. Pedicularis lachnoglossa was found to be entomophilous and exclusively pollinated by Bombus friseanus and B. yunnanicola. Our results indicated that pollination limitation in P. lachnoglossa was not significant. Under open pollination, approximately 80% of flowers were successfully pollinated and developed to fruits, and about 38% of ovules developed to mature seeds. Bumblebee pollination is highly precise and efficient in P. lachnoglossa, because its flowering phenology and floral characters enhance the foraging of bumblebees on flowers. This study supports that animal pollination plays a crucial role in the outbreeding of the early flowering Pedicularis.

We studied the pollination system of four species which stand out for their large and showy flowers: S. sambucifolia and S. grandiflora (endemics of the western Mediterranean region), S. trifoliata (an endemic of the Tyrrhenian islands) and S. calliantha (an endemic of the Canary Islands). Our principal aim was to test whether these species were pollinated by birds or showed a mixed pollination system between insects and birds.•Methods: Censuses and captures of insects and birds were performed to obtain pollen load transported and deposited on the stigmas. Also, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the flowers and inflorescences was carried out.•Key Results: Flowers were visited by Hymenoptera and by passerine birds. The Canarian species was the most visited by birds, especially by Phylloscopus canariensis, and its flowers were also accessed by juveniles of the lizard Gallotia stehlini. The most important birds in the other three species were Sylvia melanocephala and S. atricapilla. The most important insect-functional groups in the mixed pollination system were: honey-bees and wasps in S. sambucifolia; bumble-bees and wasps in S. grandiflora; wasps in S. trifoliata; and a small bee in S. calliantha. •Conclusions: The species studied show a mixed pollination system between insects and passerine birds. In S. calliantha there is, in addition, a third agent (juveniles of Gallotia stehlini). The participation of birds in this mixed pollination system presents varying degrees of importance because, while in S. calliantha they are the main pollinators, in the other species they interact to complement the insects which are the main pollinators. A review of different florae showed that the large showy floral morphotypes of Scrophularia are concentrated in the western and central Mediterranean region, Macaronesia and USA (New Mexico). © The Author 2011.",Bird-pollination; Europe; Gallotia stehlini; insect-pollination; largest-flowered Scrophularia; lizard-pollination; Macaronesia; Mediterranean region; ornithophily; Phylloscopus; Sylvia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555188915

Under greenhouse conditions, squash flowers exhibit consistent diel changes in nectar volume and concentration through anthesis. These temporal patterns are robust, persisting under field conditions as well as simulated drought conditions in the greenhouse. In the presence of active pollinators, diel patterns are evident but with highly variable, severely reduced volumes.

In the present study, we compared pollination processes between Lilium japonicum var. abeanum and var. japonicum to clarify how the two varieties are adapted to different pollinators. Lilium japonicum var. japonicum is known to be pollinated by moths, and we hypothesized from its flower traits that var. abeanum is pollinated by diurnal insects. Using waterproof digital cameras set to a recording interval of 10-30s, we recorded flower visitors for 7-9 flowers of var. japonicum and 4-6 flowers of var. abeanum over 24-h periods. We also recorded the number of versatile (T-shaped) and rigid (I-shaped) anthers per flower. For var. abeanum, we observed flowers at 05.00 and 17.00hours to determine flower opening time and measured the intensity of floral scent using a metal-oxide semi-conductor odor sensor. Both diurnal and nocturnal insects visited flowers of the two varieties, but visitation of diurnal insects was more frequent in var. abeanum. Anthers of var. abeanum are usually rigid, as in many bee-pollinated flowers, whereas those of var. japonicum are mostly versatile. Although flowers of var. japonicum are known to open in the evening, 32% of the flowers of var. abeanum started to flower during the day. Lilium japonicum var. abeanum emitted scent at night, with a maximum intensity at 20.00hours, just as in var. japonicum. These findings suggest that the floral traits of the two varieties are adapted to the different relative availabilities of nocturnal versus diurnal pollinators. The flower of var. abeanum is more adapted to diurnal pollinators, but retains adaptations to nocturnal pollinators, particularly with regard to its scent. © 2011 The Authors.

We examined whether the network of a tropical high-altitude grassland contained groups of plants and pollinators that interact preferentially with each other. A general binary matrix was created. To assess the robustness of myophily, in all analyses we considered: 1) the whole network, 2) the network after the wasps were removed, and 3) the network after the flies were removed. For each network we evaluated whether: 1) the observed interactions were more related to syndromes than expected by chance, compared to an expected matrix; 2) there was a modular structure; 3) the modules found were more related to syndromes than expected by chance, compared to another expected matrix; 4) the syndromes were equally robust. For this analysis, the general matrix was subdivided into smaller matrices that included each pollination syndrome separately. To test the influence of the functional groups of pollinators and the phylogeny of plants, in addition to the general matrix, we also considered the first expected matrix, a quantitative functional group and a plant phylogeny matrix. The pollination syndromes determined the pattern of interactions in the network: 69% of the total interactions resulted from the functional group of pollinators predicted by the plant syndrome. The network showed greater modularity (13 modules) than expected by chance, mostly consisting of the expected functional groups of pollinators and plant syndromes. The modules were associated with pollination syndromes more than was predicted by chance. Most of the variation in interactions was explained by functional groups of pollinators or by plant syndromes. Plant phylogeny did not account for a significant amount of variation in the interactions. Our findings support the concept of pollination syndromes. However, the interactions were not equally predicted by different pollination syndromes, and the accuracy of the prediction was strongest for ornithophily and melittophily. © 2011 The Authors.

Phenologies can evolve, but the role of evolution in the response of mutualisms to climate change is poorly understood. We developed a model that explicitly considers both the evolution and the population dynamics of a plant-pollinator mutualism under climate change. How the populations evolve, and thus whether the populations and the mutualism persist, depends not only on the rate of climate change but also on the densities and phenologies of other species in the community. Abundant alternative mutualist partners with broad temporal distributions can make a mutualism more robust to climate change, while abundant alternative partners with narrow temporal distributions can make a mutualism less robust. How community composition and the rate of climate change affect the persistence of mutualisms is mediated by two-species Allee thresholds. Understanding these thresholds will help researchers to identify those mutualisms at highest risk owing to climate change. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Climate change; Coevolution; Natural selection and contemporary evolution; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857074604

Roosevelt 50 CP 160/12, 1050 Brussels, Belgium","Pollination by sexual deception is arguably one of the most unusual liaisons linking plants and insects, and perhaps the most illustrative example of extreme floral specialization in angiosperms. While considerable progress has been made in understanding the floral traits involved in sexual deception, less is known about how this remarkable mimicry system might have arisen, the role of pre-adaptations in promoting its evolution and its extent as a pollination mechanism outside the few groups of plants (primarily orchids) where it has been described to date. In the Euro-Mediterranean region, pollination by sexual deception is traditionally considered to be the hallmark of the orchid genus Ophrys. Here, we introduce two new cases outside of Ophrys, in plant groups dominated by generalized, shelter-mimicking species. On the basis of phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral pollination strategies, we provide evidence for independent and bidirectional evolutionary transitions between generalized (shelter mimicry) and specialized (sexual deception) pollination strategies in three groups of flowering plants, and suggest that pseudocopulation has evolved from pre-adaptations (floral colours, shapes and odour bouquets) that selectively attract male pollinators through shelter mimicry. These findings, along with comparative analyses of floral traits (colours and scents), shed light on particular phenotypic changes that might have fuelled the parallel evolution of these extraordinary pollination strategies. Collectively, our results provide the first substantive insights into how pollination sexual deception might have evolved in the Euro-Mediterranean region, and demonstrate that even the most extreme cases of pollinator specialization can reverse to more generalized interactions, breaking 'Cope's rule of specialization'. © The Royal Society 2012.",Evolutionary transitions; Floral evolution; Floral scent; Mimicry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868118742

However, the extent to which separate traits that attract different mutualist guilds display negative or positive relationships remains largely unstudied. We asked whether correlations exist among extrafloral nectary traits to attract arthropod bodyguards and floral traits to attract pollinator mutualists. For 37 species in the cotton genus (Gossypium), we evaluated correlations among six extrafloral nectary traits and four floral traits in a common greenhouse environment, with and without correction for phylogenetic non-independence. Across Gossypium species, greater investment in extrafloral nectary traits was positively correlated with greater investment in floral traits. Positive correlations remained after accounting for the evolutionary history of the clade. Our results demonstrate that traits to maintain multiple mutualist guilds can be positively correlated across related species and build a more general understanding of the constraints on trait evolution in plants. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ant; Evolutionary constraint; Extrafloral nectar; Floral nectar; Mutualism; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83555174497

We sought to determine whether such variation has occurred in an invasive orchid, Oeceoclades maculata, across its naturalized range. We compared its reproductive biology in a Brazilian population with that published for a population on the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. In the state of São Paulo, O. maculata flowers between December and February, at the height of the rainy season. Similar fruit sets were observed in manual self (76%) and cross (70.4%) pollination treatments. The fruit set of plants protected from both pollinators and rainfall was 6.1%, whereas plants exposed only to rainfall had a fruit set of 41.4%, slightly less than the controls (48.3%). Like the Puerto Rico population, reproduction is primarily through rain-assisted autogamy, but unlike observations made on the island, outcrossing can eventually occur. We observed two butterfly species (Heliconius ethilla narcaea and Heliconius erato phyllis) pollinating O. maculata. Secretory epidermal cells and trichomes of the spur lumen produced 0.7?L of 25% (sucrose equivalents) nectar per flower each morning, which was stored in a dilated basal portion of the spur and reabsorbed by the afternoon. Thus, geographical variation in reproductive biology exists across the broad invasive range of O. maculata. © 2011 The Authors.

Seedling height and diameter at root collar (DRC) were measured in the family tests at 0, 10, and 15 months of age. Age 0 means the measurement just before the planting of the trial. The averages of seedling height and DRC at age 15 months were 134.4 cm and 1.86 cm. Family survival rates were, on average, 65.6% and 62.8% at age 10 and 15 months, respectively. Family genetic variance and replication variance at age 15 months were higher than those at age 10 months. Seedling height was positively correlated with DRC growth and statistically significant at the same ages. The coefficients of genetic variation for seedling height and DRC were ranged from 0.01 to 12.69 and from 1.97 to 13.70, respectively. Heritability estimates obtained were 0.44, 0.04, 0.01, and 0.31, 0.01, and 0.02 for seedling height and DRC at age 0, 10, and 15 months, respectively. Family averages of the 10 best and the 10 poorest families for each trait indicated that there were large differences of seedling height and DRC growth among individual families and between ages.

This is the first time for this type of autogamy to be reported in Dendrobium biflorum. Pollen grains germinated directly from the locules, bypassing the stigma or falling or sliding down onto the stigmatic surface. The pollen tubes were long and reached the stylar canal. On The Society Islands, differences in exposure of the habitats to weather conditions and altitude gradients influence both composition and form of the vegetation, as well as the occurrence of pollinators.

We then applied two alternative restoration strategies in silico (restoring for functional complementarity or redundancy) to data from our early successional plots to examine whether different strategies affected the restoration trajectories. Changes in network structure were explained by a combination of age, tree density and variation in tree diameter, even when variance explained by undergrowth structure was accounted for first. A combination of field data, a network approach and numerical simulations helped to identify which species should be given restoration priority in the context of different restoration targets.

Plant chemical defences occur in flowers, suggesting pollinators may be agents of selection on defence. We hypothesised that floral defences would deter pollinators, and therefore, pollinators would select for lower defences in outcrossing than self-pollinating species. We measured pollinator reliance and alkaloid levels in 32 greenhouse-grown Nicotiana species. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we found significantly lower nectar, floral and leaf nicotine concentrations in outcrossing than selfing species, with a 15-fold decrease in leaf nicotine levels. Nicotine concentrations were positively correlated across tissues, suggesting that selection against floral defences could constrain the evolution of leaf defences. Thus, pollinators could shape the evolution not only of floral defences but also of defences in other tissues where herbivores have traditionally been considered the dominant agent of selection. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Alkaloids; Defence evolution; Floral chemistry; Herbivory; Mating system; Mutualism; Nicotiana; Nicotine; Pleiotropy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931749077

In New Zealand, Douglas-fir is the prominent alternative species to radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.Don) and is planted widely. Original provenances were obtained from Washington USA, but after the introduction of Swiss needle cast (Phaeocryptopus guaemannii [T.Rohde] Petr.), provenances needed to be re-evaluated. Trials planted in 1957 and 1959 demonstrated that the best provenances for New Zealand sites were from coastal locations in California, USA and Oregon, USA. While selections were made from these provenance trials, the need for more genotypes was also identified. Seed, comprising of 222 open-pollinated families from 19 coastal and one inland provenance from north-western USA, was collected in 1993. This seed was planted in 1996 along with eight New Zealand land-race seedlots as controls. The latitude of the provenances ranged from 35° 07 'N in California to latitude 44° 10 'N in Oregon. The trial layout was a sets-in-replicates design of seven sets of progenies with 30 replicates of single-tree plots, planted on three sites: one in the central North Island; one at the top of the South Island; and one and the bottom of the South Island. Average tree height, assessed at age four years from planting, was 2.5 metres in the central North Island, and 2.2 metres at both South Island sites, with the tallest trees reaching 4.9 metres in the central North Island. The tallest provenances came from between latitudes 38°and 39°N, especially the Fort Ross and Navarro River provenances in California. The height of provenances from locations going north and south of this latitude range was generally reduced, although individual provenances varied unpredictably. The New Zealand control seedlots all grew well. The seedlots originally from Fort Bragg, California were the most vigorous, followed by seedlots of Washington origin. Seedlots that grew fastest were three controlled-pollinated seedlots involving inter-provenance crossing, planted in Southland only. Height, stem straightness and needle retention at age four years had moderate estimated narrow-sense heritabilities (0.2 - 0.35). Tree form in these trials was highly variable, while most of the variation in growth was at the provenance level with somewhat less variation at the level of families within provenances. Some interaction variance for height growth was found between families and sites and also between provenances and sites, but there were stable families that ranked well across all sites. Family means showed moderate correlation (r = 0.6) between height growth in the nursery and height at each site at age four. The trees in these trials form a very valuable resource for future breeding work. © 2012 New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited, trading as Scion.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907370966

The flowering and harvesting time, fruit growing interval, and fruit quality parameters of northern and southern highbush and rabbiteye blueberries cultivars were tested. Three- or four-year-old potted plants grown outdoors were brought into an unheated plastic house on February 10, 2008 (experiment 1) and 2009 (experiment 2). Standard watering, fertilizing, and bee pollination methods were used. In experiment 2, the average temperature of air and pot soil in the unheated plastic house was higher than that of the open culture. Flowering time was about 26-40 days earlier, and ripening time was about 7-40 days earlier in an unheated plastic house culture compared to an open culture. This resulted in 80% of all southern highbush and some northern highbush cultivars being almost completely harvested before the rainy season began (the beginning of June). Harvest time for rabbiteye cultivars, however, extended into the rainy season. The fruit growing period (days from 50% flowering time to 50% harvesting time) of all three types of blueberries in the unheated plastic house culture were longer than that in the open culture.

Th ese Arcto-Tertiary plants are included in the Red Data Book of the Georgian SSR. As germinable seeds are the main factor determining species distribution and the complete transfer of genetic information, the aim of our research was to establish the self-regeneration capacity of the species under study and choose optimum conditions for seed germination, the further development of seedlings, and their ex situ conservation. It has been stated that abnormalities taking place at different stages of sexual reproduction are responsible for the low capacity for seed formation found in the studied species. In particular, these factors are as follows: a limited capacity for allogamy; a low percentage of pollen tube development, at 20%-30% for Arbutus andrachne and 15%-20% for Osmanthus decorus, despite the high fertility of pollen grain of both species (approximately 70%-80%); and the frequent occurrence of embryo degeneration. The germination of Arbutus andrachne seeds on petri dishes on agar reached 80%.

Directseeded (no-till) experiments were conducted from 2008 to 2010 at four western Canada locations [Lacombe AB (2007-2010), Lethbridge AB, Indian Head SK, and Scott SK] to determine the influence of cultivar (hybrid vs. openpollinated), seeding speed (6.4 vs. 11.2 k h-1), and seeding depth (1 vs. 4 cm) on the emergence, maturity, yield, and seed quality of glyphosate-resistant canola. Canola emergence density was positively associated with precipitation levels surrounding the time of seeding; other site and environmental predictors such as soil temperature, soil texture, soil organic matter, latitude and longitude did not consistently influence canola emergence density. The agronomic performance of hybrid canola, including seed yield and quality, was usually superior to open-pollinated canola, but there was no difference in emergence density between the two cultivars. However, the hybrid cultivar emerged 1 d earlier, grew faster and covered the ground more quickly than the open-pollinated cultivar; important results from a crop-weed competition standpoint. Although seeding depth did not influence average canola yield, it often had a major impact on canola emergence density. Under moist conditions, average canola emergence improved from 37 to 62% as seeding depth decreased from 4 to 1 cm, respectively. Seeding at a depth of 1 vs. 4 cm also decreased days to emergence, increased canola ground cover, decreased days to flowering and days to maturity and tended to decrease green seed levels. Relatively high canola emergence rates can reduce the need for additional herbicide applications, herbicide input costs and selection pressure for herbicide resistance. Relatively high canola stand densities can improve the ability of canola to successfully tolerate and accommodate biotic and abiotic stress.",Canopy cover; Direct-seeding; Frost; Green seed; Integrated weed management; Weed resistance to herbicides,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862019035

This includes plant responses to trophic interactions such as herbivory and mycorrhizal symbiosis which are concurrent in most plants. We explored fitness costs of 50% manual defoliation and mycorrhizal inoculation in Datura stramonium at different light availability and soil fertility environments in a greenhouse experiment. Overall, we showed that non-inoculated and mycorrhiza-inoculated plants did not suffer from 50% manual defoliation in all the tested combinations of light availability and soil fertility treatments, while soil nutrients and light availability predominately affected plant responses to the mycorrhizal inoculation. Fifty percent defoliation had a direct negative effect on reproductive traits whereas mycorrhiza-inoculated plants produced larger flowers than non-inoculated plants when light was not a limiting factor. Although D. stramonium is a facultative selfing species, other investigations had shown clear advantages of cross-pollination in this species; therefore, the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on flower size observed in this study open new lines of inquiry for our understanding of plant responses to trophic interactions.

Objective: We evaluated the humoral and cellular mechanisms that may be associated with the presence of allergic rhinitis symptoms. Methods: We selected 26 subjects with positive grass pollen skin tests and IgE antibodies to Timothy (g6) and the major grass allergens rPhl p 1, 5b. Fourteen of those patients reported a history of allergic rhinitis. During winter, we performed a grass pollen CD63 basophile activation test using four log allergen concentrations, followed by a grass nasal provocation test (NPT). We obtained symptom scores in the subsequent pollination season. Results: We showed that subjects with a positive NPT have significantly higher CD63 basophile grass pollen responsiveness than NPT-negative subjects, preferably at submaximal allergen concentrations, which represent cellular sensitivity. Moreover, basophile sensitivity positively correlated with the size of the grass-specific IgE fraction in relation to total IgE, and it was highly predictive of allergic rhinitis symptoms in the following pollination season. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: Allergic rhinitis symptoms are significantly associated with allergen-specific basophile sensitivity. In vitro evaluation of basophile sensitivity should prove useful for distinguishing clinical phenotype of allergic sensitization. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Allergic rhinitis; Basophil activation; CD63; Grass pollen; IgE fraction; Symptom scores,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555187023

It has been shown that plant breeding systems are associated with particular floral traits. In this study, we determined the P/O in 21 Leguminosae species from Argentina and explored relationships between P/O and taxonomic position, flower size, floral rewards, pollen presentation and pollination mechanisms. According to the results, 15 out of the 21 species classified were obligate xenogamous, although some of them have been recorded as facultative xenogamous in previous studies. There was a significant effect of taxonomic position (genus), reward type and pollination mechanism on P/O. Species offering only nectar as a floral reward (which were species with a brush mechanism) had a significantly lower P/O than species offering pollen or pollen and nectar. Species with the brush pollination mechanism had the lowest P/O, while species with valvular and pump mechanism had the highest P/O. However, pollen presentation (primary and secondary) and flower size did not have a significant effect on P/O.

A correlation between pollen size and pollinator type has been hypothesized by some authors but not confirmed. To assess these associations, pollen grain number, pollen grain diameter and style length were measured in 53 species of Caryophylloideae that had been classified beforehand as being diurnal, nocturnal or self-pollinated. Surprisingly, many species showed two, and a few even three, distinct pollen grain size classes per individual anther. Therefore, further analyses were based on the different pollen size classes and respective pollen grain numbers. Firstly, we found no indication of a trade-off between pollen size and number. Secondly, a positive linear correlation between style length and pollen grain diameter was found using conventional analysis methods and phylogenetically independent contrasts. Thirdly, when using conventional analysis methods a strong relationship between style length and pollination mode was found, with nocturnal species having significantly longer styles and larger pollen grains than diurnal and selfing species. These results were not supported, however, when calculating comparisons of phylogenetically independent pairs. We discuss our findings in relation to intra-specific pollen polymorphism and pollen degeneration, both of which have been associated with different pollen grain sizes in Caryophylloideae. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that pollen polymorphism might be a mixed strategy to optimise the success of pollen grains deposited at different pollen-ovule distances on long styles. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Caryophyllaceae; Pollen number; Pollen size; Pollination mode; Silene; Style length,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855306882

At age 3.5 y (about half the average rotation length for eucalypt plantations in south-eastern China) these were assessed for tree growth, stem straightness, branching habit and self-pruning ability, whilst cold tolerance was assessed at the coolest site at about age 3 y. Significant differences were observed in some of the trials variously between provenances and families-within-provenances for growth (average tree volume), stem and branch form traits and cold tolerance. Average individual-tree volume was sensitively dependent on both genetics and environment—tree volume among trial sites varied up to six-fold, but within any one trial, average tree volume of the best provenance was only about 30% above that of the poorest provenance. The magnitude of variation between families-within-provenances was generally greater and more often significant than the variation between provenances—especially for average tree volume. The magnitude of variations observed for stem and branch form traits were generally minor. At the coldest site, some significant provenance differences were also found for cold tolerance. Estimates of within-provenance individual-tree heritability for individual-tree volume ranged from 0.00 to 0.21 ± 0.12 and those for stem straightness, branching habit and self-pruning ability ranged from 0.00 to 0.10±0.09. A number of provenances tested ranked highly for average tree volume at one or more sites but performance across sites was generally not consistent and significant site x provenance interactions were found for both volume and stem straightness. For volume the site x family-within-provenance interaction was also significant. Consequently, definitive conclusions regarding provenance potential could not made, though a provenance from Blackdown Tableland in Queensland was notable for combining good growth and cold tolerance. It was concluded that the best path for genetic improvement of E. saligna in such environments would involve vegetative clonal propagation of the best individual trees, regardless of provenance or family, for commercial plantation deployment; acquiring a wider sample of provenances and families of this species from higher-elevation, summer-rainfall areas (e.g. tablelands of northern NSW and Queensland) to expand the breeding population; and initiating sublines within the breeding population for markedly different target environments. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Eucalyptus saligna; Genetic variation; Growth rate; Heritability; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873554556

In the Northern Hemisphere, previous work has revealed a close fit between the optimal discrimination capabilities of hymenopteran pollinators and the flower colours that have most frequently evolved. We collected spectral data from 111 Australian native flowers and tested signal appearance considering the colour discrimination capabilities of potentially important pollinators. The highest frequency of flower reflectance curves is consistent with data reported for the Northern Hemisphere. The subsequent mapping of Australian flower reflectances into a bee colour space reveals a very similar distribution of flower colour evolution to the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, flowering plants in Australia are likely to have independently evolved spectral signals that maximize colour discrimination by hymenoptera. Moreover, we found that the degree of variability in flower coloration for particular angiosperm species matched the range of reflectance colours that can only be discriminated by bees that have experienced differential conditioning. This observation suggests a requirement for plasticity in the nervous systems of pollinators to allow generalization of flowers of the same species while overcoming the possible presence of non-rewarding flower mimics. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Australia; Bee; Flower; Gondwana; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864328446

We recently established that the relative self-fertility of the bearing plant is a significant predictor of its outcross yield. Further, although the species has historically been characterized as largely self-infertile, we, and others, have documented large variation in this trait among individuals within fields, and, thus, relative self-fertility stands as a partial explanation of yield variation in addition to other genetic factors, such as significant general and specific combining abilities. Here, we extend our scope by experimentally addressing whether pollen neighborhood affects yield. Lowbush blueberry is not sown, rather individuals have colonized fields by natural processes. Commercial fields of lowbush are generally pollinated by rented honey bees, which tend to pollinate nearby flowers. Our hypothesis is that clones may have become situated in differentially suitable pollen environments, at least partly explaining yield differences. We identified two high and two low natural yielders from each of two managed fields and collected pollen mixes from five donors surrounding each (n = 8). Under field conditions, each recipient received four pollination treatments including its' own neighborhood and the other three donor neighborhoods within the same field. Results showed that one of the low producers in each field had significantly higher yields when pollinated by any but their own neighborhood, thus substantiating our hypothesis that pollen neighborhood has an effect on yield. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Expressed Sequence Tag-Polymerase Chain Reaction (EST-PCR); genetic similarity; hand pollination; yield variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859500133

Investigations aimed at elucidating the reproductive characters as well as establishing a set of breeding parameters for genetic improvement of B. orellana was carried out. Records on pollen/ovule ratios of annatto showed that this species is xenogamous. The acetolyzed pollen of B. orellana was tricolporate. The fluorochromatic test showed 95% pollen viability. The viability of the pollen grains decreased sharply after 4 h from anther dehiscence. The optimum time range for artificial pollination was standardized between 12:00 and 13:00 h. A high in vitro germination rate (92%) of freshly collected pollen was recorded in modified Brewbaker's medium with 15% sucrose. Resource allocation studies showed that the construction of each flower cost 1. 162 g. The floral vegetative cost was 75%. Of the total allocation, 21% was spent by the stamens. Based on identified reproductive characters, controlled pollination experiments were conducted by selecting four morphologically distinct parent plants: (1) green-fruited with reddish spines, (2) red-fruited, (3) brown large-fruited, and (4) with brown distorted fruits. In artificial cross-pollination experiments, wide variation ranges in fruit set (0-95%) and fruit maturation (0-85%) were observed in different crosses. The number of seeds per capsule also showed variation (0-40 per capsule). Germination studies of seeds raised from different crosses showed a maximum 93% germination.

The course explores the physiology leading to the physical mechanisms and engineering principles that endow the astonishing navigation abilities and sensory mechanisms of animal systems. The course also emphasizes how biological systems are inspiring novel engineering designs. Two (among many) examples are how the adhesion of the gecko foot inspired a new class of adhesives based on Van der Waals forces; and how the iridophore protein plates found in mimic octopus and squid act as tunable 1/4 wave stacks, thus inspiring the engineering of optically tunable block copolymer gels for sensing temperature, pressure, or chemical gradients. A major component of this course is the integration of a 6-8 week long research project. To date, projects have included engineering: a soft-body robot whose motion mimics the inchworm; an electrical circuit to sense minute electric fields in aqueous environments based on the shark electrosensory system; and cyborg grasshoppers whose jump motion is controlled via an electronic-neural interface. Initial feedback has indicated that this course has served to increase student interaction and ""cross-pollination"" of ideas between the physical and life sciences.

The present study examined an autonomous self-fertilization mechanism in a perennial ginger, Hedychium yunnanense. Methods - We measured the relative stigma-anther positional changes, throughout the flower's lifespan, in an effort to understand the floral mechanism that leads to autonomous seed production. Pollination treatments were carried out and pollen-ovule ratio was estimated to test its breeding system. Preliminary observations on floral biology and flower visitors were also conducted. Key results - Hedychium yunnanense is a protogynous species and anther dehiscing occurred at night on the first day of flowering. The growth discrepancy between filament and style induces a contact between stigma and anthers favoring pollen deposition onto the stigmatic surface, thus facilitating self-pollination. Fruit set and seed set from pollinator-exclusion treatment showed similar results to open pollination treatment but lower than that of cross-pollination treatment. P/O ratio was 132.7 ± 13.4 indicating facultative autogamy. Effective pollinators were not observed in three consecutive years of observation. Conclusions - The reproductive success of H. yunnanense via autogamy seems to be an adaptive strategy under the condition of effective pollinator limitation. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Autonomous self-fertilization; Growth discrepancy; Hedychium yunnanense; Pollinator limitation; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864819617

Even though the two habitats differed substantially in the composition of pollinator assemblages and visitation rate, the flower damage performed on different petals had no impact on seed production neither within nor between habitats, indicating that change in pollinator assemblages have no indirect reproductive impact via discrimination of damaged flowers. There was a strong habitat effect, however, for seed production, being higher in the pine plantation than in the native habitat. Seed production on a per flower basis increased at a higher rate with the number of flowers in the pine plantation, which suggests a numerical response of pollinators to changes in food availability in this habitat. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.",Flower herbivory; Habitat loss; Maulino forest; Pinus radiata; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874622430

In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of combining fine-scale SGS analyses with isotropic and anisotropic spatial autocorrelation techniques to infer the impact of wind patterns on plant dispersal processes. We genotyped 1304 Azorella selago (Apiaceae) specimens, a wind-pollinated and wind-dispersed plant, from four populations distributed across sub-Antarctic Marion Island. SGS was variable with Sp values ranging from 0.001 to 0.014, suggesting notable variability in dispersal distance and wind velocities between sites. Nonetheless, the data supported previous hypotheses of a strong NW-SE gradient in wind strength across the island. Anisotropic autocorrelation analyses further suggested that dispersal is strongly directional, but varying between sites depending on the local prevailing winds. Despite the high frequency of gale-force winds on Marion Island, gene dispersal distance estimates (?) were surprisingly low (<10 m), most probably because of a low pollen dispersal efficiency. An SGS approach in association with isotropic and anisotropic analyses provides a powerful means to assess the relative influence of abiotic factors on dispersal and allow inferences that would not be possible without this combined approach. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",anisotropic spatial autocorrelations; Azorella selago; Marion Island; SGS; wind-dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155163219

Nectar parameters varied considerably during the flower life span, and was probably affected by the temperature variation during the day. Hummingbird exclusion experiments showed no effect in the fruit-set of the plant. The inability of hummingbirds to deplete all of the nectar produced in this mass-flowering plant, and the existence of another resource (pollen) for the primary pollinator (large bees), are possible reasons why there was no perceptible hindrance of plant reproduction by the hummingbirds.

It is an ancient relict plant that mainly grows in extreme environments, such as on low mountains and hills, on stony slopes, and in dry beds in the desert and desert steppe regions. P. mongolica has distinct xeromorphic adaptations, such as hard shoot spines at the ends of the branchlets. P. mongolica is an important woody oil crop with a high oil content in the seed kernel, and oil extracted from the seed kernel can be eaten. In addition, because of its long flowering period (a single flower can last eight days, and a community flowers for 50 days), flamboyant flowers, and extreme tolerance to harsh conditions, P. mongolica can be used as garden plant in the northwest of China. Zhao Yizhi proposed that P. mongolica is an Alax desert species that is mainly distributed in the Alax desert regions of the Mongolian Plateau, although scattered populations can be found in the southwest regions of the eastern Gobi Desert. Because the shrubs are limited by environmental conditions, P. mongolica cannot form large desert populations; it is only found scattered in the mountains and gullies. Such habitat fragmentation may influence the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the species. In recent years, a number of researchers have studied the geographic distribution, physiological and ecological characteristics, tissue culture, flower morphology, and insect pollinators of P. mongolica. However, no studies on the genetic diversity of its populations have yet been reported. The fragmented distribution could cause genetic differences among individuals or populations. Our field observations of P. mongolica in different areas of western Inner Mongolia indicated that P. mongolica had abundant morphological diversity, such as differences in shoot spine number, leaf size, and plant height, that suggested genetic diversity. We analyzed the genetic variation, genetic diversity, and genetic structure of different natural populations of P. mongolica, in order to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms and evolutionary potential of P. mongolica in arid and nutrient-poor environments and to provide data for its effective protection. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity of six P. mongolica populations in Inner Mongolia using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The results were as follows: (1) Twelve ISSR primers amplified 200 DNA fragments, of which 199 (99. 5%) showed polymorphisms among the populations. The percentage of polymorphic bands at the population level ranged from 43% to 67%, with an average of 55. 3%. Nei's index and Shannon's information index were 0. 3241 and 0. 4875, respectively, at the species level, and 0. 3105 and 0. 4722, respectively, at the population level. Gene flow (Nm) among the populations was 0. 8266, based on the genetic differentiation coefficient. (2) UPGMA analysis shows that the Wuhai Qianligou and Dongshengmiao Narenwula populations were the most genetically similar of all the populations. The Baotou Salaqi population should be given priority for conservation, because it had the highest genetic diversity among all the six populations investigated. (3) We compared the leaf length/ width ratio, and the results generally agreed with the UPGMA analysis. (4) A comparison of the morphological characteristics of the six populations showed that plant height and crown width were affected by the degree of aridity of the habitats. In particular, plant height (0. 45 m and 0. 26 m, respectively) and crown width (0. 74 m and 0. 43 m, respectively) of the Wuhai Qianligou and Dongshengmiao Narenwula populations were distinctly less than in the other four populations.",Genetic diversity; ISSR marker; Prunus mongolica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866510173

In this paper we study the impact of urbanization on a guild of nectar-feeding birds in a biodiversity hotspot at the Cape of Africa. The guild of four bird species provides important ecosystem services by pollinating 320 plant species in the Cape Floral Region. Functional diversity within the guild is related to differences in bill length. The long-billed Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa) plays an irreplaceable role as the exclusive pollinator of plant species with long nectar tubes. We analyzed the composition of the guild in suburban gardens of Cape Town along a gradient of increasing distance from the nearest natural habitat. Urbanization reduces the functional diversity of the nectarivore guild. Malachite Sunbirds did not penetrate more than 1 km into the city, whereas only the short-billed Southern Double-collared Sunbirds (Cinnyris chalybea) occurred throughout the urbanization gradient. The lack of data precludes conclusions regarding the detailed responses of Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) and Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), however their absence across the entire gradient is suggestive of high sensitivity. The functional diversity of this guild of pollinators can potentially be restored, but the pros and cons of this conservation action need to be considered. © 2012 by the author(s).",Bird pollination; Citizen science; Ecosystem services; Hummingbird feeders; Mobile link organism; Mutualism disruption; Nectarivore; Resilience; Urban ecology; Urban planning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864484241

In the present study, we investigated the temporal pattern of floral color change and time required for pollen tube growth in the shrub Weigela japonica var. sinica. Over the 4-day anthesis, the color of the corolla in this species changes from white to red and the color cue changes from yellow to purple. The duration of both the white phase and the intermediate phase is approximately 1 day and the duration of the red phase is approximately 2 days. Our studies showed that color change in Weigela japonica var. sinica is age-dependent but independent of pollinator visits and flower pollination. Post-change flowers lost most of both the male and female residual reproductive ability and retained no rewards for pollinators. It took at least 3 days for a pollen tube to grow to the ovules and achieve fertilization. Thus, retention of post-change flowers is necessary for the completion of pollen tube growth. Our results indicate that the temporal pattern of color change and time requirement for pollen tube growth are most likely related events. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Floral color change; Geitonogamous pollination; Temporal pattern; Time retention; Weigela japonica var. sinica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871332772

Pollination with artificial unreduced (2n) pollen was inefficiency, owing to weak competition of 2n pollen. To induce 2n megaspores and improve the efficiency of triploid production, female buds of Populus pseudo-simonii × Populus nigra 'Zheyin3#' were exposed to high temperature during megasporogenesis. Results: A relationship between megasporogenesis and morphological changes of female buds was established to guide the high-temperature treatments. In the progeny, 146 triploids were obtained and the highest efficiency of triploid production was 66.7%. Both 41°C and 44°C were suitable for megaspore chromosome doubling. Cytological analysis showed that meiotic stages from pachytene to diplotene may be the optimal period for megaspore chromosome doubling at high temperature in the 'Zheyin3#.' Because megasporocytes both in the first meiotic division and the second division were treated, the first meiotic division restitution typed and the second meiotic division restitution typed 2n megaspores could be obtained. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that hybridization with high-temperature-induced 2n megaspores is an ideal approach for triploid production. Offspring with different heterozygosity are valuable for genetic research and breeding programs of Populus. © 2011 INRA and Springer-Verlag, France.",FDR; High temperature; Populus; SDR; Triploid; Unreduced megaspore,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863048755

In the Neotropical region, oil-collecting bees belong to the tribes Centridini, Tapinotaspidini, and Tetrapediini (Apidae: Apinae). The floral oils collected by females of these groups are used as larval food or in nest construction. The interaction of these bees with oil flowers is characterized by the presence of specialized structures for oil collection on the legs that morphologically match the location and type of the oil-producing glands on flowers they visit. In addition, these bees have specialized arrays of setae (including the scopae) for oil transport. In a few genera, both sexes display such specialized structures, although floral oil collection has hitherto been regarded as an exclusively female task. Here, we report floral oil collection by males of Tetrapedia, a Neotropical genus of oil-collecting bees. We describe behavioral aspects of oil foraging by males, present data on morphological structures associated with the collection of this resource, and discuss potential hypotheses to explain the significance of floral oils in the mating system of Tetrapedia. © 2011 INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag, France.",Cerrado; Mating; Neotropical; Oil flowers; Oil-collecting bees; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856661253

From an empirical point of view, mutualisms are ubiquitous and of major importance to ecosystems, suggesting the existence of mechanisms that enhance the maintenance of such relationships. We focused on the obligatory myrmecophytic association between the Neotropical plant Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae) and the ant Allomerus decemarticulatus (Myrmicinae). The plant shelters the ants in leaf pouches in exchange for protection from phytophagous insects. We experimentally demonstrated that the ants partially castrate their host plant by destroying almost two-thirds of its floral buds. The ants also impede pollination through their presence and interactions with pollinators. These results reveal that ant activity negatively affects the plant's reproduction both directly and indirectly. This dual negative effect does not result in the complete castration of the plant. We also highlight major limitations to plant reproduction due to the spontaneous abscission of flowers and to the limited quantity and/or poor quality of the pollen. These limitations must not be overlooked since they can alter the outcome of the association of H. physophora with its ant partner.

The relative commonness of different species with shared ecological traits can play a pervasive role in determining ecosystem functioning, but information on changes in abundances of pollinators over time is lacking. We gathered data on relative abundances of bumble-bee species in Swedish red clover fields during three periods in the last 70 years (1940s, 1960s and present), and on clover seed yields since 1921. We found drastic decreases in bumble-bee community evenness, with potential consequences for level and stability of red clover seed yield. The relative abundances of two short-tongued bumble-bees have increased from 40 per cent in the 1940s to entirely dominate present communities with 89 per cent. Average seed yield declined in recent years and variation in yield doubled, suggesting that the current dependence on few species for pollination has been especially detrimental to stability in seed yield. Our results suggest a need to develop management schemes that promote not only species-rich but also more evenly composed communities of service-providing organisms. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Bombus spp.; Ecosystem service; Pollination; Red clover; Trifolium pratense,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053157699

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 ?g L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",Bombus terrestris microcolonies; Demographic toxicology; Fecundity; Neonicotinoid pesticides; Ovary development; Sublethal effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868128229

The selection of floral and reproductive traits is influenced by the plants abiotic environment, florivores and pollinators. However, evidence that variations in floral traits result from mutualistic interactions with insects other than pollinators is lacking in the published literature and has rarely been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the association with either Camponotus femoratus or Pachycondyla goeldii (both involved in seed dispersal and plant protection) mediates the reproductive traits and allocation of Aechmea mertensii, an obligatory ant-garden tank-bromeliad, differently.•Methods: Floral and reproductive traits were compared between the two A. mertensii ant-gardens. The nitrogen flux from the ants to the bromeliads was investigated through experimental enrichments with stable isotopes ( 15N).•Key Results: Camponotus femoratus-associated bromeliads produced inflorescences up to four times longer than did P. goeldii-associated bromeliads. Also, the numbers of flowers and fruits were close to four times higher, and the number of seeds and their mass per fruit were close to 1·5 times higher in C. femoratus than in P. goeldii-associated bromeliads. Furthermore, the 15N-enrichment experiment showed that C. femoratus-associated bromeliads received more nitrogen from ants than did P. goeldii-associated bromeliads, with subsequent positive repercussions on floral development. Greater benefits were conferred to A. mertensii by the association with C. femoratus compared with P. goeldii ants.•Conclusions: We show for the first time that mutualistic associations with ants can result in an enhanced reproductive allocation for the bromeliad A. mertensii. Nevertheless, the strength and direction of the selection of floral and fruit traits change based on the ant species and were not related to light exposure. The different activities and ecological preferences of the ants may play a contrasting role in shaping plant evolution and speciation. © The Author 2011.",? 15N; Aechmea mertensii; Bromeliaceae; bromeliad; Camponotus femoratus; floral traits; fruit-set; mutualistic ants; Pachycondyla goeldii; reproductive allocation; stable isotopes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555188916

Over a 300 km range in the Indian Western Ghats, we investigated the correlation between the EFN composition of the myrmecophytic ant-plant Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae) and the number and species of ants visiting EFN. EFN composition varied among H. brunonis populations and between plant organs (floral bud vs. young leaf EFN). In general, EFN was rich in sugars with small quantities of amino acids, especially essential amino acids, and had moderate invertase activity. In experiments at the study sites with sugar and amino acid solutions and with leaf or floral bud EFN mimics, dominant EFN-feeding ants differentiated between solutions as well as between mimics. The castration parasite Crematogaster dohrni (northern study site) was the least selective and did not exhibit any clear feeding preferences, while the largely trophobiont-tending non-protective Myrmicaria brunnea (middle study site) preferred higher sucrose concentrations and certain essential/non-essential amino acid mixtures. The mutualistic Technomyrmex albipes (southern study site) preferred sucrose over glucose or fructose solutions and consumed the leaf EFN mimic to a greater extent than the floral bud EFN mimic. This young leaf EFN mimic had low sugar concentrations, the lowest viscosity and sugar:amino acid ratio, was rich in essential amino acids, and appeared ideally suited to the digestive physiology of T. albipes. This preference for young leaf EFN may explain the greater protection afforded to young leaves than to floral buds by T. albipes, and may also help to resolve ant-pollinator conflicts. The differential response of dominant ants to sugar, amino acids, or solution viscosity suggests that plants can fine-tune their interactions with local ants via EFN composition. Thus, EFN can mediate local partner-choice mechanisms in ant-plant interactions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Amino acids; Dolichoderinae; Extrafloral nectar; Extrafloral nectar sugars; Invertase; Myrmecophyte; Partner-choice mechanism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856387091

It is, however, also considered to be an alien invader of indigenous vegetation and for this reason the production of a sterile variety would be highly desirable for commercial forestry in South Africa. Previous research on crosses between diploid and tetraploid parent plants to produce triploid progeny has resulted in poor seed set. One possible barrier preventing seed set could be the viability of the pollen used in the cross pollination operations. Thus a study was conducted to test the pollen viability. In vitro agar media germination tests (ACIAR and Brewbaker and Kwack media) were optimised on Acacia podalyriifolia pollen and then used together with vital stain tests (Sigma® DAB peroxidase and p-phenylendiamine) to test pollen germination and viability of A. mearnsii pollen. These were then compared to in vivo pollen germination on the stigma, and were conducted on both diploid and tetraploid pollen mixes. Results showed that the vital stain tests gave significantly (p< 0.05) higher pollen viability than the agar germination tests and were more in agreement with the results from the pollen germination rate on the stigma. For both the diploid and tetraploid pollen mixes tested, there were no significant differences (p> 0.05) between the two agar media germination tests and between the two vital stain tests. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Acacia podalyriifolia; Black wattle; Pollen viability; Polyad,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855937167

The flowering and fruiting period extends from May to October. Few flowers per plant open each night, producing up to 0.4 ml nectar, but 30% of them are nectarless. Probably pollen is also offered as a resource. Fruiting efficiency of C. laniflorus (47%) is close to that found in other Cactaceae species. Pollen of this species was detected in Anoura geoffroy, Soricina glossophaga and Pygoderma bilabiatum bats. Amongst the characteristics related to bat-pollination syndrome found in C. laniflorus, the cream-white colouring of the internal part of the flower, the numerous stamens and the nocturnal anthesis of short duration can be highlighted. Flowers of C. laniflorus are also visited by Nitidulidae beetles, Trigona fulviventris bees and hummingbirds, however bats are the main pollinators of this species.

The genus currently consists of two sections: Capanemia Cogn. and Planifolia Pabst, distinguished on the basis of leaf shape. We compare the floral morphology and anatomy of all species to determine whether separation into sections is supported by floral characters.•Methods: Both fresh flowers and herbarium specimens were investigated, and column and pollinarium features, together with the presence or absence of floral rewards, recorded. Anatomical features were examined using both light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.•Key Results and Conclusions: With the sole exception of Capanemia therezae, all species shared a distinctive set of floral characters. Flowers were mostly white or yellowish-white and fragrant, and column wings were positioned parallel to the labellum, concealing the stigmatic cavity. Pollinaria had proportionally long tegular stipes and clavate to reniform pollinia, whereas the labellum possessed a conspicuous indument of trichomes, but was devoid of nectar or any other secretion that might function as a food-reward. Capanemia therezae, however, was exceptional in having greenish, unscented flowers with short, rounded and divergent column wings and an exposed stigmatic cavity. Its pollinaria had proportionally short tegular stipes and round pollinia, whereas the labellum lacked trichomes. Droplets of nectar were evident on the adaxial surface of the labellum, adjacent to the callus. Floral features did not support the currently accepted sectional division of Capanemia. If ongoing phylogenetic studies demonstrate that both sections are indeed monophyletic, then these taxa should be distinguished solely on the basis of foliar features. © The Author 2011.",Anatomy; column; labellum; morphology; nectary; orchids; pollinarium; pollination; trichomes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555178170

Subsequently, the coppicing traits of number of sprouts per stump and DBH and height of the largest sprout per stump were assessed at 12 months after felling. Significant differences were observed among seed sources for almost all traits. At each site, average individual tree volume of the best seed source was more than 60% above that of the poorest. The magnitude of variation among families within seed sources was generally greater and more often significant than the variation among seed sources—especially for average tree volume. The magnitude of the variations observed in stem form, though significant statistically, were small. Significant seed source differences were found also for cold tolerance at the central site and for all three coppice traits at the southern site. Estimates of within—seed-source individual-tree heritability for individual-tree volume in 2007 at the southern site and in 2006 at the central Hunan site were 0.11 ± 0.07 and 0.17 ± 0.15 respectively and that for stem straightness at the southern site was 0.17 ± 0.07. Heritabilities for coppice traits, assessed only at the southern site, ranged from 0.14 ± 0.11 for number of sprouts per stump and up to 0.42 ±0.17 for DBH of the largest coppice on each stump. Heritability for cold tolerance at the central Hunan site was 0.11 ± 0.10. These heritabilities and favourable phenotypic and genetic correlations indicate selection would be effective to improve both volume and growth of subsequent coppice development. These results indicate emphasis should be placed on selecting the best candidate trees of E. dunnii regardless of their seed source for inclusion in future breeding and propagation populations of this species in Hunan. Together, the results presented support the value of investing in E. dunnii's genetic improvement; significant gains could be delivered to commercial growers and investors including enhanced financial prospects and decreased risks for commercial plantations of this species. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",China; Cold tolerance; Coppice; Eucalyptus dunnii; Genetic correlation; Genetic variation; Growth rate; Heritability; Plantations; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873562127

The disease is caused by the sacbrood virus (SBV), a positive-, single-stranded RNA virus in the order Picornavirales. Because of the economic importance of honey bees for both pollination and honey production, it is vital to understand and monitor the spread of viruses such as SBV. This virus has been found in many places across the globe, including recently in some South American countries, and it is likely that it will continue to spread. We performed a preliminary study to search for SBV in two apiaries of Africanized honey bees in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, using RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing and found the first evidence of SBV in honey bee colonies in Brazil. The virus was detected in larvae, foraging and nurse bees from two colonies, one of which had symptoms of sacbrood disease, at the beginning of the winter season in June 2011.

An understanding of this plant species' reproductive biology is required for its effective propagation and conservation. P. delenatii has a bisporic pattern of embryo sac development with a six-celled number in a mature embryo sac. Prior to pollination, the nucellar filaments are present within the ovary. The archesporial cell at the tip of the nucellar filament differentiates into a megasporocyte fifteen days after pollination. As the megasporocyte matures, the nucleus becomes located at the micropylar end of the cell, resulting in an uneven distribution of the cytoplasm with the starch granules becoming more abundant at the chalazal end. After the first meiotic division, a distinct callose layer separates the micropylar dyad from the chalazal one. Soon after, a callose wall completely encloses the functional dyad at the chalazal end. As the functional dyad increases its size, the callose remains in the common wall separating the two dyads as well as in the chalazal end wall of the functional dyad. One notable finding of this study is the presence of cuticular material in the lateral walls of the mature embryo sac. The deposition of the cuticular material may serve to strengthen the fairly large embryo sac and helps to conserve water for the developing embryo after fertilization.",Callose; Embryology; Lady's slipper orchid; Nile red; Ovule,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863252190

These systems prevent self-fertilization by the recognition and rejection of self-pollen and pollen from closely related individuals. The most widespread SI system is based on the action of a pistil ribonuclease, the S-RNase, which recognizes and rejects incompatible pollen. S-RNases are endocyted by pollen tubes and stored into vacuoles. By a mechanism that is still unknown, these vacuoles are selectively disrupted in incompatible pollen, releasing S-RNases into the cytoplasm and allowing degradation of pollen RNA. Recently, we have studied the timing of in vivo alterations of pollen F-actin cytoskeleton after incompatible pollinations. Besides being essential for pollen growth, F-actin cytoskeleton is a very dynamic cellular component. Changes in F-actin organization are known to be capable of transducing signaling events in many cellular processes. Early after pollination, F-actin showed a progressive disorganization in incompatible pollen tubes. However by the time the F-actin was almost completely disrupted, the large majority of vacuolar compartments were still intact. These results indicate that in incompatible pollen tubes F-actin disorganization precedes vacuolar disruption. They also suggest that F-actin may act as an early transducer of signals triggering the rejection of incompatible pollen.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891601983

Using PCR with S- RNase gene-specific primers, the S-genotype (S-haplotype combination) of 'Methley' was determined to be SbSg.This S-genotype was confirmed by cloning of the partial genomic DNA for both the S-RNase genes. After self-pollination of 'Methley',the resultant progenies segregated into three S-genotypes,SbSb,SbSg,SgSg,suggesting that both the Sb- and Sg-haplotypes were inherited in the progenies from the male parent. Thus, both S-haplotypes seemed to be non- functional and responsible for self-compatibility. Expression analyses in 'Methley' showed that both the Sb- and Sg- RNase genes were transcribed in the style.Therefore, it appeared that inhibition of transcription of the S-RNase genes was not responsible for self-compatibility in the Sb- and Sg-haplotypes of this cultivar. When flowers of the self- incompatible cultivars, 'Sordum' (SaSb) and 'White Plum' (SfSg) were fertilised with pollen from 'Methley', the progenies segregated into four S-genotypes, SaSb, SaSg, SbSb, SbSg and SbSf, SbSg, SfSg, SgSg, respectively. This result indicated that growth of the Sb- or Sg-pollen tubes of 'Methley' was not arrested in styles with functional Sb- or Sg- RNase alleles. Thus, the pollen components in both the Sb- and Sg-haplotypes of 'Methley' may be dysfunctional and involved in the breakdown of self-incompatibility. However, no alterations in the SFBb or SFBg gene (S-haplotype-specific F-box gene) sequences of 'Methley' were detected, and both the SFBb and SFBg genes were transcribed in pollen of this cultivar.

Obligate out-crossing (dioecy) is expected to enhance genetic diversity, reduce genetic differentiation, and avoid inbreeding depression through frequent gene flow. However, in highly fragmented populations dioecy has only diminishing effects upon genetic structure as pollination limitations (e.g. flight distance of pollinators) most often restrict inter-population gene flow in insect pollinated species. In fragmented dry grasslands in northeastern Germany, we analysed genetic structure, fitness, and habitat quality of the endangered dioecious Silene otites (Caryophyllaceae). Using AFLP markers, a high level of differentiation among ten populations was found (F st = 0.36), while the intra-population genetic diversities (H E = 0.165-0.240) were similar as compared to hermaphroditic species. There was neither a correlation between geographic and genetic distance nor between genetic diversity and population size, which indicates reduced gene flow among populations and random genetic drift. Plant size was positively correlated with genetic diversity. Seed set and number of juveniles were positively related to population size. Higher total coverage resulted in reduced plant fitness, and the number of juveniles was negatively correlated to cryptogam cover. Additionally, we found a sex ratio bias towards more male plants in larger populations. Overall, our results indicate that on a regional geographic scale dioecy does not necessarily prevent genetic erosion in the case of habitat fragmentation, especially in the absence of long distance seed and pollen dispersal capacity. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",AFLP; Isolation by distance; Mating system; Population size; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855297912

Therefore, the genomic distribution of environmentally sensitive transposable elements may vary measurably across a species area. In the present research, we aimed to detect and evaluate the level of LTR retrotransposon intraspecific variability in Aegilops speltoides (2n = 2× = 14), a wild cross-pollinated relative of cultivated wheat. The interretrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) protocol was applied to detect and evaluate the level of retrotransposon intraspecific variability in Ae. speltoides and closely related species. IRAP analysis revealed significant diversity in TE distribution. Various genotypes from the 13 explored populations significantly differ with respect to the patterns of the four explored LTR retrotransposons (WIS2, Wilma, Daniela, and Fatima). This diversity points to a constant ongoing process of LTR retrotransposon fraction restructuring in populations of Ae. speltoides throughout the species' range and within single populations in time. Maximum changes were recorded in genotypes from small stressed populations. Principal component analysis showed that the dynamics of the Fatima element significantly differ from those of WIS2, Wilma, and Daniela. In terms of relationships between Sitopsis species, IRAP analysis revealed a grouping with Ae. sharonensis and Ae. longissima forming a separate unit, Ae. speltoides appearing as a dispersed group, and Ae. bicornis being in an intermediate position. IRAP display data revealed dynamic changes in LTR retrotransposon fractions in the genome of Ae. speltoides. The process is permanent and population specific, ultimately leading to the separation of small stressed populations from the main group. © 2012 by the Genetics Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855418290

The honey bee, Apis mellifera, has been managed by humans for centuries for both honey and wax production and crop pollination. Human management and selective breeding are believed to have caused reductions in genetic diversity in honey bee populations, thereby contributing to the global declines threatening this ecologically and economically important insect. However, previous studies supporting this claim mostly relied on population genetic comparisons of European and African (or Africanized) honey bee races; such conclusions require reassessment given recent evidence demonstrating that the honey bee originated in Africa and colonized Europe via two independent expansions. We sampled honey bee workers from two managed populations in North America and Europe as well as several old-world progenitor populations in Africa, East and West Europe. Managed bees had highly introgressed genomes representing admixture between East and West European progenitor populations. We found that managed honey bees actually have higher levels of genetic diversity compared with their progenitors in East and West Europe, providing an unusual example whereby human management increases genetic diversity by promoting admixture. The relationship between genetic diversity and honey bee declines is tenuous given that managed bees have more genetic diversity than their progenitors and many viable domesticated animals.

Several fundamental aspects of communication between plants and their mutualists are poorly understood. It remains unclear whether plant signals are accurate and reliable, that is, whether they recruit mutualists by informing them about the nutritional rewards provided by flowers and fleshy fruits. 2. We evaluated fruit characteristics of 105 vertebrate-dispersed species from an Atlantic rainforest community to examine the relationship between visual fruit stimuli and fruit quality. We combined morphological, biochemical and spectrophotometric methods and employed comparative analyses to assess the evolutionary association among morphological, biochemical and visual characters. 3. We detected a significant phylogenetic signal in most morphological and nutritional traits but not in colour traits, which suggests that fruit colours are evolutionarily labile. We also found that two properties of fruit coloration (brightness and chroma) explain 24-29% of variation in protein and sugar contents, respectively. High sugar content in fruit is associated with dark colour and low chroma (colour saturation). However, fruit brightness is not strongly correlated to protein content and its signalling role remains unknown. 4. We suggest that the negative relationship between chroma and sugar content in fruit can be explained by the fact that sugars up-regulate the synthesis of anthocyanins, the pigments primarily imparting achromatic coloration in fruits. Biochemical pathways could consequently explain the covariance between visual fruit traits and nutritional fruit traits. In this scenario, information could arise as by-product rather than as an adaptation to signal to seed dispersers. 5. Synthesis. We show that fruit visual traits are evolutionary labile and that fruit chroma and brightness can reliably indicate sugar and protein content, respectively. We propose that shared biochemistry is a likely mechanism inducing the covariance between colour (the stimulus) and nutritional quality (as the unseen quality). We hypothesize that by-product information represents a widespread and so far neglected mechanism leading to reliable visual traits in mutualistic and possibly also antagonistic plant-animal interactions. © 2011 The Authors.

However, there are countries where honey production is augmenting. Romania is among the countries where honey production has considerably increased over the last decade. Based on this fact, the present research aims to investigate how this spectacular development meets the criteria of sustainability. In order to attain this objective, the research focused on the North West Region of Romania as one of the top performing regions in terms of beekeeping development. The research methods used were both quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus group). The information that best meets the criteria of sustainability was selected out of the data collected and processed. From the economic point of view, beekeeping is a profitable business, but it is dependent on climatic conditions. Nevertheless, it does not exist a powerful system of promotion and distribution of bee products in the region under study. From a social perspective, beekeeping contributes to rural development by creating jobs, as practicing this activity ensures a decent living for vulnerable groups. The implications of beekeeping upon the environment are particularly beneficial due to the pollination services and for determining the conservation of biodiversity. The study could have favourable implications for beekeepers, honey processors and consumers as it identifies solutions that determine the optimization of the economic performance of beekeepers and the increase of honey consumption, which is very low. The originality of the study lies in the fact that there has not been so far in Romania an analysis of the sustainable development of beekeeping.",Beekeeping; Development; Evaluation; Romania; Sustainable,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873501653

Insects can detect them from a longer distance and then make host orientation, oviposition, aggregation and pollination. The plant volatiles mainly include two categories; one emits during plant growth process while the other is produced and emitted after insect herbivory (herbivore-induced plant volatiles, HIPVs). Moreover, some volatiles have an attractive or repellent effect on the herbivorous insects while others show mutualism, attraction and orientation to the carnivores. However, studies on HIPVs mainly focus on how to attract carnivores, and rarely on the effect on insects themselves. Numerous researches stumble with the phenomenon that different pests often damage the same plant at the same time, but this phenomenon does not lead to a stronger attack by carnivores sometimes; on the contrary, it leads to attraction or repellency to interspecific and intraspecific herbivorous insects, which influences the damage degree of host plants. For this reason, the paper focuses on giving a comprehensive and in-depth summary of the behaviors caused by HIPVs, especially the attraction or repellency to interspecific and intraspecific herbivorous insects. The paper further derives new theoretical basis of making a thorough study of HIPV mechanisms and explicating how insects make a host selection. In short, the discussion is aimed to enrich the theoretical basis and scientific foundation for IPM of pests by studies of HIPVs. © 2011 E.

A trade-off between the size and number of flowers produced is an assumption of models of floral display evolution, but this trade-off is often not observed. We tested three hypotheses for why a trade-off between flower size and number is not observed, using 32 populations of Mimulus guttatus and 83 genera from the California flora. We found support for the hypothesis that high variance in resource acquisition masks a trade-off between flower size and number. In contrast, we did not find support for the hypothesis that trade-offs between current and future reproduction mask negative correlations between flower size and number in lineages with a perennial life history. We also did not find support for the hypothesis that negative flower size-number correlations are less likely to be observed in lineages with lower variation in flower number because the correlation between two variables is weaker when the range of values is narrower. Overall, our results support the life history evolution literature in suggesting that high variance in resource acquisition relative to allocation can often explain why traits that are predicted to trade off are instead positively correlated. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.",Constraint; Floral display evolution; Independent contrasts; Mimulus guttatus; Pollination; Trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855838168

The literature on the costs that species inflict or the benefits they provide has evolved largely independently with few attempts to synthesize information across studies. However, managing cost–benefit trade-offs to maximize agricultural productivity while ensuring native species conservation is vital to the future of ecologically sustainable agriculture. Using birds as a case study, we review the two bodies of literature on the costs and benefits attributed to bird activity in agricultural landscapes. In each case, we examine the major types of costs (e.g. consumption of crops) and benefits (e.g. pollination of crops) and assess approaches to quantifying these in terms of changes in crop yield or monetary value. We then synthesize this information to examine options for balancing cost–benefit trade-offs through coordinated and integrated management strategies that consider all aspects of species activity in agricultural landscapes.

The improvement programs of fig trees using conventional procedures in order to obtain new cultivars are rare in many countries, such as Brazil, especially due to the little genetic variability and to the difficulties in obtaining plants from gamete fusion once the wasp Blastophaga psenes, responsible for the natural pollinating, is not found in Brazil. In this way, the mutagenic genetic improvement becomes a solution of it. For this reason, in an experiment conducted earlier, fig plants formed by cuttings treated with gamma ray were selected based on their agronomic characteristics of interest. We determined the genetic variability in these fig tree selections, using RAPD and AFLP molecular markers, comparing them to each other and to the Roxo-de-Valinhos, used as the standard. For the reactions of DNA amplification, 140 RAPD primers and 12 primer combinations for AFLP analysis were used. The selections did not differ genetically between themselves and between them and the Roxo-de-Valinhos cultivar.

The magnitude of the physiological costs of reproduction depends on both the factors limiting seed production (pollen, ovules or resources) and the capacity of plants to compensate for high resource demand.•Methods: To assess the magnitude and consequences of reproductive costs, we used shading and defoliation to reduce photosynthate production by fully pollinated plants of a perennial legume, Oxytropis sericea (Fabaceae), and examined the resulting impact on photosynthate allocation, and nectar, fruit and seed production.•Key Results: Although these leaf manipulations reduced photosynthesis and nectar production, they did not alter photosynthate allocation, as revealed by 13C tracing, or fruit or seed production.

The recessive genic male sterile line (RGMS) 7-7365A (Bnms3ms3ms4ms4) has been widely applied to hybrid seed production because it can generate a completely male sterile population by crossing with the 7-7365C temporary line (Bnms3ms3rfrf). In this study, the sterile genes of 7-7365A were transferred to the new Brassica napus lines 7-749 and 7-750 with a high content of subgenomes by backcross breeding. We used the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique combined with bulk segregant analysis (BSA) to identify markers linked to the BnMs4 gene. Twelve AFLP markers linked to the BnMs4 gene were identified. Of them, SA06MG09 and P08MG16 were the closest makers, which were on either side of the gene at a distance of 0.9 and 0.8 cM, respectively. Twenty AFLP primer combinations were used to screen the F2, BC1F3, and BC2F4 populations from the breeding program, and the markers linked to the BnMs3 and BnMs4 genes were used to screen the BC2F4 populations. As a result, we obtained two types of improved sterile lines, 7-749A and 7-750A, and their indexes of subgenomic components (ISG) were 44.2-49.8 and 20.2-26.6%, respectively. The combining ability analyses of seed yield character were conducted in the crosses from the three sterile lines and ten restorers within a random block design in three environments for two successive years. The general combining ability (GCA) of the two improved sterile lines were significantly higher than the GCA of 7-7365A in every environment tested. The two improved sterile lines had stability in seed yield, and they will be used in the future for hybrid seed production. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brassica napus; Combining ability; Marker-assisted selection; Subgenomic heterosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855533317

The aim of this study is to analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of farm trees and woodlands in an agricultural landscape in Eastern Germany from 1964 to 2008, based on aerial photographs and digital orthophotos. Taking a landscape ecological perspective, we quantify farm tree dynamics, disentangle processes of gain and loss in the socialist and post-socialist periods of Eastern Germany, and assess differences in ecosystem services provided by farm trees. A substantial increase of overall tree cover by 24.8% was observed for the selected time period, but trajectories have been disparate across different farm tree classes. The increase in tree cover was stronger in steep valleys than on hills and plateaus, indicating a significant interdependence between topography and trajectories of change. Patch numbers of farm trees did not increase, which suggests that the expansion of tree cover is mostly due to a spatial expansion of previously existing tree patches. Overall net gains in tree cover were rather similar during the socialist and post-socialist eras. The general increase in tree cover was accompanied by increase in agriculture-related ecosystem service provision, but the increase in pollination and pest control services was much lower than that in water purification services. These findings present the first empirical evidence from an industrialized country that there is also an ongoing 'forest transition' outside closed forests. Potential, partially counteracting drivers of change during the socialist and post-socialist periods have mainly been related to farm policies and the environmental consciousness of land users and society as a whole. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Agricultural intensification; Driving forces; GIS; Land-use transitions; Landscape ecology; Trees outside forests,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051565551

Different methods are used to overcome pre-fertilization and post-fertilization barriers in incongruous interspecific crosses of lilies. Compatibility between female pistil and pollen play an important role on fertility of crosses. Results are presented showing that pollen incongruous to female pistil can perform fertilization if they are used in mixtures with other incompatible pollen. To overcome pre-fertilization barriers cut-style pollination and pollination of stigma by mixed incompatible pollen were performed. In some cases recalcitrant crosses were more efficient when stigma was pollinated by mixed pollen of incongruous species than when cut-style was pollination by separated pollen of one incongruous male. However, cut-style pollination was efficient in cases when long style possessing females were pollinated by short style possessing male species. Though it is known that crosses of Asiatic hybrid (Asiatic hybrids (A) with Lilium longiflorum or Oriental hybrids (O) possible perform only in one direction where Asiatic hybrid participate as male, the pollen of L. longiflorum and O stimulated fertilization of Asiatic hybrid when they were added in mixtures with pollen of L. candidum, L. henryi, L. monadelphum or Trumpet and Aurelian hybrids (T). However, any stimulation of fertilization was observed when pollen of L. longiflorum and O were added in mixtures with pollen of L. concolor or L. pumilum to pollinate native pistil of Asiatic hybrid. Pollination of Asiatic hybrid by mixed pollen of incongruous species resulted progeny among which hybrids Asiatic hybrid × L. regale and Asiatic hybrid × L. candidum were screened by inheritance of molecular markers characteristic to male species. ©2012 Global Science Books.",Interspecific hybridization; Lilium ssp.; Pre-fertilization barriers; RAPD; SOD,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905368254

No significant differences in seed setting rate were observed among the clones following unbagged treatment, but significant differences in seed setting rate were observed among the clones following bagged treatment. Breeding experiments indicated that both reproductive systems (selfing and outcrossing) coexisted in each tested C. tinctorius clone. It exhibited reproductive assurance through automatic self-pollination, which might be an important factor in enhancing the amount of seeds. Among 17 species of visitors, the main effective pollinators were Apis cerana Fabricius, Apis mellifera Linnaeus and Eristalis tenax Linnaeus. All floral morphology traits (corolla length, corolla diameter, pistil length, anther length, stigma length, and stigma-anther separation) showed significant variations among the clones. However, only corolla diameter showed a significant negative correlation with the frequency of pollinator visits and a positive correlation with seed set following unbagged treatment. There was a negative correlation between stigma-anther separation and seed set, and although this was not significant, it could be argued that if a pistil developed that was too long, seed set would decline under natural conditions. Corolla length was significantly positively correlated with stamen and anther length, and corolla diameter was significantly negatively correlated with pistil length. Stigma length was also significantly positively correlated with stamen length. These findings indicate that corolla diameter could significantly affect seed set in C. tinctorius under the conditions in Ya'an, China, and corolla diameter affects seed set by the combined effect of multiple traits. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Carthamus tinctorius L.; Floral morphology; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855328319

However, limited information on male cone development in the species is available. In this study, we observed the morphological and anatomical changes that occur during male cone development in M. glyptostroboides using semi-thin sections and scanning electron microscopy. The male cones were borne oppositely on one-year-old twigs that were mainly located around the outer and sunlit parts of crown. Male cones were initiated from early September and shed pollen in the following February. Each cone consisted of spirally arranged microsporophylls subtended by decussate sterile scales, and each microsporophyll commonly consisted of three microsporangia and a phylloclade. The microsporangial wall was composed of an epidermis, endothecium, and tapetum. In mid-February, the endothecium and tapetum layers disintegrated, and in the epidermal layer the cell walls were thickened with inner protrusions. Subsequently, dehiscence of the microsporangia occurred through rupturing of the microsporangial wall along the dehiscence line. These results suggest that the structure, morphology, architecture and arrangement of male cones of M. glyptostroboides are mainly associated with the production, protection and dispersal of pollen for optimization of wind pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891619468

Gene flow in most plants can result from either seed or pollen dispersal, but detailed investigations of pollen and seed flow among populations that have diverged following local adaptation are lacking. In this study, we compared pollen and seed flow among 10 populations of sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) on the Park Grass Experiment. Overall, estimates of genetic differentiation that were based on chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and, which therefore resulted primarily from seed flow, were lower (average FST = 0.058) than previously published estimates that were based on nuclear DNA (average FST = 0.095). Unlike nuclear DNA, cpDNA showed no pattern of isolation by adaptation; cpDNA differentiation was, however, inversely correlated with the number of additions (nutrients and lime) that each plot had received. We suggest that natural selection is restricting pollen flow among plots, whereas nutrient additions are increasing seed flow and genetic diversity by facilitating the successful germination and growth of immigrant seeds. This study highlights the importance of considering all potential gene flow mechanisms when investigating determinants of spatial genetic structure, and cautions against the widespread assumption that pollen flow is more important than seed flow for population connectivity in wind-pollinated species. © The American Genetic Association. 2011.

We show that scents emitted by male figs show seasonal variation within individual trees. Scents of summer male figs resemble those of the co-flowering females, and are different from those of the same male trees in spring, when female figs are absent. These differences hold even if only compounds electrophysiologically active for pollinators are considered.

TaGL9 has an amino acid sequence distinct from other reported members of the HD-Zip IV family. The 3' untranslated region of TaGL9 was used as a probe to isolate a genomic clone of the TaGL9 homologue from a BAC library prepared from Triticum durum L. cv. Langdon. The full-length gene containing a 3-kb-long promoter region was designated TdGL9H1. Spatial and temporal activity of TdGL9H1 was examined using promoter-GUS fusion constructs in transgenic wheat, barley and rice plants. Whole-mount and histochemical GUS staining patterns revealed grain-specific expression of TdGL9H1. GUS expression was initially observed between 3 and 8days after pollination (DAP) in embryos at the globular stage and adjacent to the embryo fraction of the endosperm. Expression was strongest in the outer cell layer of the embryo. In developed wheat and barley embryos, strong activity of the promoter was only detected in the main vascular bundle of the scutellum, which is known to be responsible for the uptake of nutrients from the endosperm during germination and the endosperm-dependent phase of seedling development. Furthermore, this pattern of GUS staining was observed in dry seeds several weeks after harvesting but quickly disappeared during imbibition. The promoter of this gene could be a useful tool for engineering of early seedling vigour and protecting the endosperm to embryo axis pathway from pathogens during grain desiccation and storage. © 2011 Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics, University of Adelaide.

Causes of these declines are still unclear but the loss of habitat quality across the wider countryside is thought to be a major factor. Nectar supply constitutes one of the main resources determining habitat quality. Yet, data on changes in nectar abundance are lacking. In this study, we provide the first analysis of changes in floral nectar abundance on a national scale and link these data to trends in butterfly species richness and abundance. We used transect data from the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme to compare two time periods: 1994-1995 and 2007-2008. The results show that butterfly decline can indeed be linked to a substantial decline in overall flower abundance and specific nectar plants, such as thistles. The decline is as severe in reported flower generalists as in flower specialists. We suggest that eutrophication is a main cause of the decline of nectar sources. © 2012 Current Zoology.",Butterflies; Eutrophication; Habitat quality; Land use; Nectar resources; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869823466

Specific molecular markers were used for detection of SC/SI plants in current breeding program. We studied three genes for their structure, function, role in SI reaction and dominance relationships, having effect on self-incompatibility expression in plant phenotype with the aim to find effective molecular markers for selection of SI plants to accelerate hybrid breeding process. Molecular markers based on analysis of SLG I, II, SCR I and SRK I can be successfully used for selection of SI plants and undesirable SC plants are eliminated at early ontogenetic stage from breeding population. Additionally comparative analysis of all of these molecular markers for individual genes can achieve successful selection of functional carriers of recessive S alleles during breeding programmes.",Brassica napus; S locus; SCR; Self-incompatibility; SLG; SRK,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904213260

Traditionally the peach palm is propagated by seeds, which yield segregating progenies due to cross-pollination. To guarantee the uniformity and quality of elite selections, the alternative is the propagation of superior genotypes from off-shoots (tillers), because an efficient in vitro cultivation protocol does not exist. The objective of the present study was the development of a more appropriate technique of vegetative propagation by division of the clump, in order to multiply plants selected in the improvement program. A peach palm clump contains between 2 and 20 off-shoots after cutting for palm heart; these can be separated one from the other with iron wedges, and extracted immediately or left for recovery for subsequent extraction. The experimental design was randomized blocks with three replications, using a 3x5 factorial, where the factors were: height of the off-shoots (<30, 30-60, >60 cm) and recovery time after the separation of the off-shoots from the clump (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days). The off-shoots between 30 and 60 cm and left around a month of recovery in the field after separation from the clump presented 65% of survival, while those left around four months presented 80% of survival.",Bactris gasipaes; Clump division; Field recovery time; Off-shoot height; Vegetative propagation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860877785

The flowers of Alcea rosea are protandrous and herkogamous, with style curvature at anthesis. Methods - We measured: (1) floral morphology, including style curvature, (2) stigma receptivity and pollen viability, (3) breeding system, and (4) outcrossing rate estimated by ISSR markers. Key results - Results indicate that when stigmas were in contact with anthers via style curvature, stigma receptivity and pollen viability was 89.7 and 42.33%, respectively, indicating the potential of delayed selfing. Delayed selfing in A. rosea did not provide obvious contribution to seed production, because there was no significant difference in seed set between intact and emasculated open flowers (P = 0.765). However, successful reproduction of 23.98% flowers in the absence of pollinators suggested that selfing provides reproductive assurance during a year, in which pollinators were limiting. The multilocus outcrossing rates in different populations varied from 0.972 to 0.981, with a mean of 0.977. Conclusion - Our data provide an empirical demonstration of a predominantly outcrossing species with potential delayed selfing when pollinators are absent or scarce. © 2012 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Alcea rosea; Delayed selfing; ISSR markers; Outcrossing rate; Reproductive assurance; Style curvature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863952311

Information concerning the role of these molecules in self-incompatible pollination is scarce especially in non-model species studied in vivo. We recently reported that in the olive tree, compatible and self-incompatible pollen have different levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and that PCD is induced in self-incompatible pollen. Levels of O2·- and NO are higher in pollen after self-incompatible pollination than after compatible pollination. The presence of these reactive species was concomitant with the presence of peroxynitrite. Similar results were obtained on pollen-germination experiments both in vivo and in vitro. These data, together with observations made after treating pollinated flowers with scavengers, suggest that peroxynitrite plays a role in PCD induced after self-incompatible pollination and we propose here a model to describe the way in which it might work. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.",Nitric oxide; Peroxynitrite; Programmed cell death; Self-incompatibility; Superoxide anion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863804415

Many popcorn strains carry these genes and cannot be fertilized by pollen of dent and flint maize strains although the reciprocal crosses are successful. A Chinese popcorn strain SDGa25 carries the strongest allele of Ga1 (Ga1-S) and the majority of Chinese dent and flint maize germplasm are incompatible with SDGa25. The incompatibility is due to pollen tube growth obstruction 2 h after pollination. The pollen tube is arrested in the silk segment 5. 5 cm distal to the pollination area and never reaches the ovule. The Ga1-S carried by SDGa25 behaves as a single dominant gene. This gene was mapped between markers SD3 on BAC AC200747 0. 827 cM apart on the telomere side and SD12 on BAC AC204382 0. 709 cM apart on the centromere side. The genetic region mapped spanning the Ga1-S locus was estimated to be 1. 5 cM in length and the physical distance is 2,056,343 bp on ctg156 based on the B73 RefGen_v2 sequence. Gametophyte factors influence gene flow direction and the strongest Ga1-S allele is useful for isolating one category of commercial varieties from another. The eight tightly linked markers to Ga1-S developed in this study would greatly improve marker-assisted introgression efficiency and the fine mapping would facilitate the isolation of the Ga1-S. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857679408

Little is known, however, about the interaction between floral fragrances and the foraging behavior of meliponine species. Thus we investigated the chemical composition of the extracts of citric (lemon and orange) flowers and their effects on the foraging behavior of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona pectoralis. We found that each type of flower has its own specific blend of major compounds: limonene (62.9%) for lemon flowers, and farnesol (26.5%), (E)-nerolidol (20.8%), and linalool (12.7%) for orange flowers. In the foraging experiments the S. pectoralis workers were able to use the flower extracts to orient to the food source, overlooking plates baited with hexane only. However, orange flower extracts were seemingly more attractive to these worker bees, maybe because of the particular blend present in it. Our results reveal that these fragrances are very attractive to S. pectoralis, so we can infer that within citric orchards they could be important visitors in the study area; however habitat destruction, overuse of pesticides and the competitive override by managed honeybees might have put at risk their populations and thus the ecological services they provide to us.",Citrus; Flower volatiles; Foraging; Scaptotrigona pectoralis; Stingless bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861749401

In contrast, the wild fig species F. erecta Thunb. is resistant to this fungus. We performed interspecific hybridization between the common fig (seed parent) and F. erecta (pollen parent) through artificial pollination. Even though hybrid seeds showed high germination rates, the seedling survival rates were low. All of the seedlings contained the expected simple sequence repeat (SSR) alleles from both common fig and F. erecta at each of the three loci tested, thus confirming the parent-offspring relationships of the interspecific hybrids. The leaf morphological characters of hybrid seedlings were intermediate between those of the parents. Cuttings of cultivars of common fig, F. erecta, and hybrid seedlings were inoculated with C. fimbriata by direct wounding of the shoot. All of the common fig cultivars tested withered and died within 10 weeks. Leaves and shoots of the hybrids and F. erecta were healthy 100 days after inoculation.

The best way to choose pollinisers is to experiment numerous crosses in a diallel design. Here, the genetic mode of inheritance of SI in the olive is deciphered and it does not correspond to the GSI type, but to the SSI type. It leaves S-allele dominance relationship expression in the male (pollen and pollen tube), but not in the female (stigma and style). Thus, a pair-wise combination of varieties may be inter-compatible in one direction (male to female, or female to male) and inter-incompatible in the other direction. Dominance relationships also explain different levels of self-pollination observed in varieties. Little efficient pollinisers were found and predicted in varieties; nevertheless, some new efficient pair-wise allele combinations are predicted and could be created.

The effect of soil moisture and florivory on two sexual morphs in a gynodioecious orchid, Satyrium ciliatum, was investigated in seven gynodioecious (with both female and hermaphrodite individuals) and 15 hermaphroditic (with only hermaphrodite individuals) populations. Our result showed that, compared to hermaphrodites, females tended to occur in drier sites in which soil water content was consistently lower than that of hermaphrodites in all gynodioecious populations. The soil water content where hermaphrodites grew was not significantly different between gynodioecious and hermaphroditic populations. We observed that females experienced less attack by insect florivores than hermaphrodites in gynodioecious populations, and hermaphroditic populations had higher insect attack than gynodioecious populations.

Degradation of ES can pose a number of risks to businesses and the well-being of rural populations. At the same time these ecosystem-based risks create new business opportunities. In this work, three land-based organizations were evaluated using case study approaches comprising a dairy processing company, a grain company, and a wine-making company. In-depth interviews with environmental managers of these organizations were used to elicit the current organizational approaches to identifying key environmental risks associated with ecosystem degradation and the ways they deal with these risks. After initial analysis of the interview data, the production component of these organizations was further examined using an Ecosystem Services Review (ESR) model with their respective environmental management teams. This resulted in the development of an ecosystem-based impact and dependence profile for each case study company. From these profiles, risks and opportunities were identified by developing the Ecosystem Based Business Risk Analysis Tool (EBBRAT).

The trial involved seed from 11 native populations in coastal California, three Californian seed orchards, one Oregon seed orchard and two Washington seed orchards. Open-pollinated progeny seedlots were bulked by native population. Seed from seven New Zealand seed stands of Washington, Oregon or Californian origin was also included. This trial was conducted at five sites with a range of climatic features.The purpose of this trial was to test the performance of bulked Californian seedlots on four cold, high-elevation sites prone to snow and exposed to strong winds compared to a mild, low-elevation site. Overall, there were significant differences in height growth of trees from different seedlots but little difference was observed in the growth performance of trees from individual Californian provenances of varying latitude at the four trial sites with harsh climates. Also, the three New Zealand seedlots of California origin grew at about the same rate as the three seed-orchard seedlots of southern Oregon and Washington origin. At the four harsh-climate sites, the severe effect of environment on stem straightness, malformation and acceptability appear to have largely obliterated any provenance differences at the assessment age (eight – nine years).At the sheltered site, trees from northern Californian seedlots clearly grew best and trees from the New Zealand seedlots originating from California substantially outgrew trees from the New Zealand seedlots of Oregon and Washington origin.

The regulatory mechanisms leading to accumulation of other carotenoids and flesh colors, however, are poorly understood. The variety of flesh colors available in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai) fruit makes it ideal for investigating the regulation of the full pathway. Carotenoid accumulation was measured in seven watermelon varieties, representing four flesh colors and two ploidy levels, throughout fruit maturation. We found that the putative regulatory mechanisms controlling lycopene accumulation in red-fleshed fruit follows the same regulatory patterns as the other flesh color mutants with differing predominant carotenoids. In general, products downstream of the predominant carotenoid for each color mutant accumulate until a «breaker stage» (approx. 20 days post pollination) at which time the major carotenoid and its precursors accumulate and downstream products diminish. Consistent with other reports, triploid varieties generally had higher concentrations of carotenoids than diploids (an average of 1.5 and 4.0 times in red and orange flesh, respectively). Interestingly, triploid watermelon demonstrated different carotenoid developmental patterns, suggesting the increased carotenoid content is controlled early on in fruit development. Analyzing the carotenoid accumulation in developing fruit suggests that canary yellow-fleshed watermelon have a fully functional carotenoid pathway, red fruit have a nonfunctional ?-cyclase gene, and orange and salmon yellow fruit have reduced- or non-functional phytoene desaturase and/or carotenoid isomerase genes. This improved understanding of the biosynthetic pathway regulation will help when planning traditional breeding and biotechnological techniques to improve carotenoid content in watermelon and other carotenoid-containing species. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877965990

Sanctions have been demonstrated empirically in several mutualisms. However, if multiple individual symbionts interact with each host, the precision with which individual cheating symbionts are targeted by host sanctions is critical to their short- and long-term effectiveness. No previous empirical study has directly addressed this issue. Here, we report the precision of host sanctions in the mutualism between fig trees and their pollinating wasps. Using field experiments and molecular parentage analyses, we show that sanctions in Ficus nymphaeifolia act at the level of entire figs (syconia), not at the level of the individual flowers within. Such fig-level sanctions allow uncooperative wasps, which do not bring pollen, to avoid sanctions in figs to which other wasps bring pollen.

In plants providing pollen as the only reward for pollinators, it is usually difficult to unravel the dual roles of reward presentation and the realization of male and female functions (pollen removal and deposition). Exploiting the two types of anther in the androecia of Melastoma malabathricum L., we examined whether the removal of pollen for reward is regulated primarily to favor male function or female function. Pollen removal by carpenter bees from the feeding and pollination anthers, as well as pollen deposition on the stigmas, were quantified during anthesis of M. malabathricum. There was no significant difference in pollen removal rates from the feeding and pollination anthers of M. malabathricum between the onset of anthesis and flower wilting. The stigmatic pollen loads exceeded the ovule number after three sonication bouts, and female function was satisfied earlier than male function. The results support the hypothesis that the presentation of pollination reward in this species is regulated primarily to favor the expression of male function, rather than female function, in agreement with the pollen-donation hypothesis. A cooperative relationship between the feeding and pollination anthers was demonstrated in heterantherous flowers, which optimizes the balance in investments between pollinator rewards and ""functional pollen"" for gene transfer. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Division of labor; Heteranthery; Melastoma malabathricum L.; Pollen deposition; Pollen removal; Pollen-only flower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871301021

In order to develop successful conservation strategies, a total of 604 wild soybean accessions from 43 locations sampled across its range in China, Japan and Korea were analyzed using 20 nuclear (nSSRs) and five chloroplast microsatellite markers (cpSSRs) to reveal its genetic diversity and population structure. Relatively high nSSR diversity was found in wild soybean compared with other self-pollinated species, and the region of middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MDRY) was revealed to have the highest genetic diversity. However, cpSSRs suggested that Korea is a center of diversity. High genetic differentiation and low gene flow among populations were detected, which is consistent with the predominant self-pollination of wild soybean. Two main clusters were revealed by MCMC structure reconstruction and phylogenetic dendrogram, one formed by a group of populations from northwestern China (NWC) and north China (NC), and the other including northeastern China (NEC), Japan, Korea, MDRY, south China (SC) and southwestern China (SWC).

Meiosis in diploids is regular, with bivalent pairing and uniform and viable pollen. In contrast, meiosis in triploids is characterized by high trivalent pairing, with irregularly shaped pollen and variation in cytoplasm content and stainability, which is in agreement with an unbalanced segregation occurring in anaphases I and II. However, different triploid plants/individuals showed various degrees of pollen fertility, which may be attributed to particular genotypes. Research on reproductive biology events indicates sexual cross-pollinated reproduction enhanced by protogyny in both cytotypes.

Breeding deep-seeding tolerant cultivars is becoming increasingly important in arid and semi-arid regions. To dissect the quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling deep-seeding tolerance traits, we selected a tolerant maize inbred line 3681-4 and crossed it with the elite inbred line-X178 to generate an F 2 population and the derivative F 2:3 families. A molecular linkage map composed of 179 molecular markers was constructed, and 25 QTL were detected including 10 QTL for sowing at 10 cm depth and 15 QTL for sowing at 20 cm depth. The QTL analysis results confirmed that deep-seeding tolerance was mainly caused by mesocotyl elongation and also revealed considerable overlap among QTL for different traits. To confirm a major QTL on chromosome 10 for mesocotyl length measured at 20 cm depth, we selected and self-pollinated a BC 3F 2 plant that was heterozygous at the markers around the target QTL and homozygous at other QTL to generate a BC 3F 3 population. We found that this QTL explained more phenotypic variance in the BC 3F 3 population than that in the F 2 population, which laid the foundation for fine mapping and NIL (near-isogenic line) construction. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856030089

Early angiosperms had minimum seed sizes, an order of magnitude smaller than their contemporaries. It has been proposed that changes to reproductive features at the base of the angiosperm clade reduced accessory costs thus removing the fitness disadvantage of small seeds. We measured accessory costs of reproduction in 25 extant gymnosperms and angiosperms, to test whether angiosperms can produce small seeds more economically than gymnosperms. Total accessory costs scaled isometrically to seed mass for angiosperms but less than isometrically for gymnosperms, so that smaller seeds were proportionally more expensive for gymnosperms to produce. In particular, costs of abortions and packaging structures were significantly higher in gymnosperms. Also, the relationship between seed:ovule ratio and seed size was negative in angiosperms but positive in gymnosperms. We argue that the carpel was a key evolutionary innovation reducing accessory costs in angiosperms by allowing sporophytic control of pre- and postzygotic mate selection and timing of resource allocation. The resulting reduction in costs of aborting unfertilized ovules or genetically inferior embryos would have lowered total reproductive costs enabling early angiosperms to evolve small seed sizes and short generation times. © 2011 The Author(s).

Some times herkogamy caused failure of spontaneous self-pollination. Fruit set was significantly reduced when insects were excluded. However, geitonogamy+xenogamy had increased fruit/seed set via external vector, which was required to expose concealed pistil and stamens and finally to transfer self pollen as well as geitonogamous/xenogamous pollen onto the stigma.

The two hypotheses were extensively studied and both hypotheses were partly supported by previous studies. However, the relative importance of resource competition and architectural effect may vary with stages of floral ontogeny in a species. To detect the effects of ontogenetic stages on floral variation,we manipulated the 6-flowered inflorescences of Adenophora jasionifolia (Campanulaceae) by early, late, and non-thinning flowers. Our results indicated that pollen and ovule production of the remaining flowers were not significantly different between early and late thinning manipulations, suggesting that floral sex allocation was determined far before flowering, in support of the architectural effect hypothesis. Under hand-pollination treatments, early thinning but not late thinning resulted in a significant increase in seed number and seed set of the remaining flowers. Therefore, the increase in seed production of the remaining flowers related to the floral ontogeny.

This study investigated the effects of ESN and weed management on N 2O emissions from soil under a canola (Brassica napus L.) no-till cropping system. The experiment was conducted from 2005 to 2008 at three sites: Lethbridge, Lacombe, and Beaverlodge, located in southern, central and northern Alberta, Canada. Treatments included a hybrid and an open-pollinated canola cultivar, with ESN and urea applied at 1 and 1.5 times (×) the recommended rate, and herbicide at 50 and 100% of registered in-crop application rates. Canola was grown in rotation with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and both phases of crop rotation were present each year. The N 2O fluxes from soil were measured using vented static chambers at 2-week intervals during the growing season from 2006 to 2008. Except for a few occasions with higher fluxes from urea than ESN earlier in the growing season and higher fluxes from ESN than urea later on, N 2O fluxes were similar among all treatments for all three years and three sites. The N 2O fluxes also varied over the growing season, and peak flux occurred in response to rainfall events. Similarly, cumulative N 2O emissions, expressed as either per land area or per canola seed yield, over the three growing seasons were low (0.15-2.97kgNha -1yr -1 or 0.05-1.19gNkg -1 seed) for all treatments and sites, and unaffected by weed management or crop variety (P&gt;0.05). The N 2O emission across the three sites from ESN averaged 20% lower (P=0.040) than from urea although the differences between fertilizer types or application rates were not significant (P&gt;0.05) at each site. Elevated N 2O emissions (72% higher; P=0.028) from 1.5×ESN (0.83kgNha -1yr -1 or 0.33gNkg -1 seed) relative to 1×ESN (0.26kgNha -1yr -1 or 0.16gNkg -1 seed) were only observed at Beaverlodge while emissions were similar (P&gt;0.05) at the other two sites. The higher N 2O emissions at 1.5×ESN at Beaverlodge were due to excess N accumulation in soil caused by unfavourable weather conditions that reduced canola N uptake and yield. Our results suggest that ESN fertilizer could reduce N 2O emissions in Alberta, Canada, but reductions will depend on rainfall events and canola N utilization. © 2011.",Environmentally Smart Nitrogen; N 2O; Polymer-coated urea; Semi-arid climate; Urea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155172974

We used a full-diallel design with 12 sunflower parents, including confectionary and nonconfectionary types, to assess (i) combining ability for SF, (ii) the relationship between SF and other traits, and (iii) microsatellite markers for tracking self-incompatible S alleles. Twelve parents and their 132 F1s were evaluated for SF in two environments. Self-fertility was correlated with final seed length (r = -0.57, P &lt; 0.01), suggesting that SF was possibly influenced by floret characteristics. A genetic analysis of SF showed that both general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were significant, although after seed length was used as a covariate, the contribution of SCA effects increased to 65% of the variance and narrow-sense heritability was almost zero. The SCA effects were in part explained by the interaction of various combinations of S alleles. These results suggest that for programs targeting high-SF confectionary sunflower it would be difficult to predict the SF of hybrids based on the performance of their parents; therefore, F1 hybrid evaluation would be necessary. Our study suggested that factors controlling SF included GCA/SCA effects, S alleles, and floret characteristics. It also demonstrated the value of combining molecular and quantitative genetics for elucidating the inheritance of a complex trait. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955184466

Genetic variability is evident in differential susceptibility to an herbicide because the population can show continuous phenotypic variation. Recent, recurrent selection studies have revealed that phenotypic variation in response to low herbicide rates is heritable and can result in rapid evolution of herbicide resistance in genetically variable cross-pollinated rigid ryegrass. In this study, the heritable genetic variation in an herbicide-susceptible rigid ryegrass population was exploited to shift the population toward greater herbicide susceptibility by recurrent selection. To enhance herbicide susceptibility, herbicide-susceptible rigid ryegrass plants were divided into two identical clones, and one series of cloned plants was treated with a low rate of herbicide (diclofop). The nontreated clones of individuals that did not survive the herbicide treatment were selected and bulk-crossed to obtain the susceptible progeny. After two cycles of selection, the overall susceptibility to diclofop was doubled. The results indicate that minor genes for resistance are present in an herbicide-susceptible rigid ryegrass population, and their exclusion can increase susceptibility to diclofop.

In this study, the possibility of intergeneric hybridization between Alstroemeria and Bomarea Mirb. was examined through the development of pollination procedures and ovule culture based on the histological observation of embryo and endosperm development after intergeneric pollination. Three methods of pollination (stigmatic, cut-style, and non-style) were combined with four different pollen types (fresh, frozen, non-germinated, and pre-germinated). We observed that the pollen tubes of Bomarea coccinea (Ruiz & Pav.) Baker could reach to the ovules of Alstroemeria aurea Graham 48 hours after stigmatic pollination with frozen pollen. Histological observations revealed that a primary embryo was formed, but subsequently aborted during development.

America. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain this regression. Some of the hypothetical factors act at a continental level, as the general restructuration of the agriculture toward the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisation, in place of leguminous crops. The landscape fragmentation is typically a local factor the fusion of which also leads to large-scale effects. Since 2002, we observed a great number of situations where local droughts and heat waves occurred in France, UK, Scandinavia, Turkey, leading to very strong local reductions of the bumblebee’s fauna. We observed so many local cases in 2007–2009 that we could hypothesise that a merger of these local effects could lead to a new general threat.

Here we describe in detail Raiguenrayun cura gen. & sp. nov., an exceptionally well preserved capitulescence of Asteraceae recovered from Eocene deposits of northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. •Methods: The fossil was collected from the 47·5 million-year-old Huitrera Formation at the Estancia Don Hiplito locality, Ro Negro Province, Argentina.•Key Results: The arrangement of the capitula in a cymose capitulescence, the many-flowered capitula with multiseriateimbricate involucral bracts and the pappus-like structures indicate a close morphological relationship with Asteraceae. Raiguenrayun cura and the associated pollen Mutisiapollis telleriae do not match exactly any living member of the family, and clearly represent extinct taxa. They share a mosaic of morphological features today recognized in taxa phylogenetically close to the root of Asteraceae, such as Stifftieae, Wunderlichioideae and Gochnatieae (Mutisioideae sensu lato) and Dicomeae and Oldenburgieae (Carduoideae), today endemic to or mainly distributed in South America and Africa, respectively.•Conclusions: This is the first fossil genus of Asteraceae based on an outstandingly preserved capitulescence that might represent the ancestor of MutisioideaeCarduoideae. It might have evolved in southern South America some time during the early Palaeogene and subsequently entered Africa, before the biogeographical isolation of these continents became much more pronounced. The new fossil represents the first reliable point for calibration, favouring an earlier date to the split between Barnadesioideae and the rest of Asteraceae than previously thought, which can be traced back at least 47·5 million years. This is the oldest well dated member of Asteraceae and perhaps the earliest indirect evidence for bird pollination in the family. © The Author 2011.",capitulescence; Compositae; Eocene; fossil taxon; Patagonia; Raiguenrayun cura gen. & sp. nov.; southern South America,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555187227

The four testers evaluated are cultivars with narrow or wide genetic base (single-cross hybrids and open pollinated varieties) and two kernel types (flint or dent). SynD and SynF testers are open pollinated varieties with dent and flint kernels, respectively, and FSH and DSH testers are single-cross hybrids with flint and dent kernels, respectively. SynD tester showed the biggest genetic variance among the maize inbreed lines in crosses. The effects of general combining ability (GCA) for lines and specific combining ability (SCA) for lines x testers were significant, whereas GCA effects for testers were not significant. SynD and SynF testers identified the largest number of lines with higher GCA. The DSH and FSH testers showed suitable to identify lines with high SCA. It was concluded that SynD and SynF testers are adequate to identify inbreed lines with high GCA effects, and it's possible to identify new lines with high heterotic potential in each one of the four testers.",Combining ability; Diallel; Testcross; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863573727

To identify the best period for harvesting eggplant fruits, associated with ideal resting period of the fruit for extracting seeds, an eggplant production field was installed in municipality of Ijaci, in the State of Minas Gerais, Southwestern Brazil. The fruits were harvested at periods of 49, 56, 63, 70, and 77 days after pollination (DAP). The seeds of fruits harvested in each period were manually extracted immediately after harvest or after a post-harvest resting period of seven days, under a shed. The physiological quality of seeds was assessed by tests of: germination percentage; germination and emergence speed indexes; and electrical conductivity; which were carried out in the Central Seed Laboratory, Federal University of Lavras. Electrophoretic analyses of isoenzymes: catalase (CAT); esterase (EST); superoxide dismutase (SOD); and peroxidase (PO), were also therein performed. Results of germination and vigor of seeds have showed that the best period for harvesting the fruit is around 70 DAP; and that seeds should be extracted immediately after harvest. Electrophoretic analysis of enzymes has showed immaturity for eggplant seeds, harvested after 49 DAP.",Germination; Harvest; Resting period; Solanum melongena,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872251028

Most cultivars are self-incompatible. It is essential to identify S-genotypes for production and breeding. The S-genotypes of 17 Japanese apricot cultivars native to China were determined using the Prunus S-RNase consensus primer pair, Pru-C2 and PCE-R, which were designed from the second and third conserved regions of Prunus S-RNases, respectively. Eleven S-RNase alleles (S1 S2, S7, S12, S14, S15, S18, S20, S22, S23 and S26) and four new S-RNase alleles (S30, S31, S32 and S33) with GenBank Accession Numbers JN232975, JN232976, JN232977, JN232978 were identified. Furthermore, the S-genotypes of four Japanese apricot cultivars were confirmed by field-testing for cross-pollination. The results of this study enrich the information available on S-genotypes in Japanese apricot and provide a reasonable basis for the appropriate arrangement of pollination trees in orchard practice.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864102401
