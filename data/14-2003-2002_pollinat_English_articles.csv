Although specific mechanisms of guidance for pollen tubes through the pistil are not known, the female tissues play a critical role in this event. Many studies have documented the existence of diffusible chemotropic factors in the lily stigma that can induce pollen tube chemotropism in vitro, but no molecules have been isolated to date. In this study, we identified a chemotropic compound from the stigma by use of biochemical methods. We purified a lily stigma protein that is active in an in vitro chemotropism assay by using cation exchange, gel filtration, and HPLC. Tryptic digestion of the protein yielded peptides that identified the protein as a plantacyanin (basic blue protein), and this was confirmed by cloning the cDNA from the lily stigma. Plantacyanins are small cell wall proteins of unknown function. The measured molecular mass by electrospray ionization ion source MS is 9,898 Da, and the molecular mass of the mature protein (calculated from the cDNA) is 9,900.2 Da. Activity of the lily plantacyanin (named chemocyanin) is enhanced in the presence of stigma/stylar cysteine-rich adhesin, previously identified as a pollen tube adhesin in the lily style.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346734107

Pollen sterility of S. melongena x S. aethiopicum Gilo Group [F1 (Mel x Aet)] was restored by chromosome doubling, while the reciprocal hybrid S. aethiopicum Gilo Group x S. melongena [F1 (Aet x Mel)] and its amphidiploid did not produce any pollen grains; their microspores degenerated without being released from tetrads. Hence the cytoplasm of S. aethiopicum Gilo Group seems to be responsible for their pollen-non-formation type sterility of the hybrid.

Quantitative analysis of mating system parameters was performed using progeny arrays assayed for eight allozyme markers.

The multilocus outcrossing rate ranged from 0. 69 to 1.00 among eight varieties. The high value found for the outcrossing rate indicates that the ethnovarieties studied are preferentially allogamous.

In the second experiment testing the ""pollinia"" hypothesis, we used only conspecific pollinia, but varied the number of pollinia received per stigma. Pollen source (self-pollination, cross-pollination within population, cross-pollination between populations, and interspesific pollination) did not affect female reproductive success of flowers. Increase in the number of pollinia received per stigma had a positive effect on reproductive success. Thus, a plant could benefit from repeated pollinator visits. Our results suggest that pollinator visitation rates may be more important for reproductive success than the pollinia source, and that neither the ""outcrossing"" nor the ""pollinia"" hypothesis was clearly supported.",Crossing distance; Deceptive pollination; Orchids; Pollination biology; Pollinia; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344083662

The method involves Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of hypocotyl explants, followed by the production of antibiotic- or herbicide-resistant embryogenic callus and the subsequent induction of somatic embryos and plants. Key elements of the improvement are the use of buffering agents to stabilise medium pH and bottom-cooling of the cultures. Transformation was verified by PCR and Southern blot hybridisation. Transcription of transgenes was confirmed by RT-PCR and product sequencing. Expression of transgenes was detected by histochemical GUS staining, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) enzyme assays for bar and pat genes, and western analysis of transgenic sunflower seed albumin protein. Expression of various transgenes was detected in stem, leaf, seed, capsule and latex. The pat gene was demonstrated to be stably inherited to the T 2 generation and to confer phosphinothricin (PPT) herbicide resistance. Most T0 plants showed normal morphology, were self-fertile and the transgenes displayed the expected Mendelian segregation. The percentage of explants producing somatic embryos that developed into plantlets able to be transplanted to soil, ranged from 6-11% in two Tasmanian cultivars. A field trial using pat transgenic plants was designed to estimate the frequency of hybridisation at various distances into buffer rows of non-transgenic poppies and to related weed species, P. somniferum spp. setigerum and P. dubium. The frequency of hybridisation to completely compatible poppy fell sharply with distance, being 2.6% at 20 cm, 2.13% at 0.5 m and falling to 0% at 2.5 and 5 m. No hybridisation could be detected to two weed species under open pollination conditions, including the compatible P. somniferum spp. setigerum, when grown as close as 20 cm, despite flowering at the same time as the transgenic plants in the presence of foraging bees.",Agrobacterium; Opium poppy; Papaver somniferum; Risk assessment; Somatic embryogenesis; Transformation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345393123

(Combretaceae). The long and medium length inflorescences yielded fruit by autogamy and geitonogamy and, the short length ones are entirely apomictic. This behaviour is in contrast with the breeding behaviour of other species of Terminalia distributed wild in the Indian forests, in that these species are obligately outcrossed. In T. catappa it is thought that the random genetic drift or apomixis might have favoured the evolution of microspecies or biotypes differing in inflorescence length and in breeding system. The trees are andromonoecious and the flowers, are promiscous producing traces of nectar and large quantities of pollen. The flower visitor complement included bees, flies, wasps and ants, of which the bee genera Trigona and Apis and the fly genera Chrysomya and Sarcophaga are proved important pollinators by virtue of frequency of their visits, foraging speed and pollen pick-up. Individually, the stingless bee Trigona is proved more important as pollinator.

Scanty and unrewarding forage offered by cashew was blamed for the neglect of this crop by honeybees. As a result, wide gap was noticed between the realized and the potential yields of cashew nuts. However, our country earns more than 25 billion rupees worth of foreign currency on cashew exports and possibility is there to increase earnings by overcoming the pollinator limitation problem. Knowing that there is ample scope to boost cashew yields, the idea of managing fly pollinator species was recommended to cashew farmer. Several management techniques have been developed and tested in order to increase fly populations in cashew orchards. But, the use of Euphorbia antiquorum as hedge to the cashew crop was proved economic and environmentally acceptable.

Philipson is an andromonoecious liane with >0.40 of the total flower buds maturing as bisexual flowers. Male and bisexual flowers are strongly scented with pollen, anther sacs and receptacle scars testing positively for volatile emissions. Scent analyses detect over 20 components. The major fatty acid derivative is 8-heptadecene, and 2-phenylethanol dominates the benzenoids. While hover-flies in the genera Melangyna and Triglyphus contact the stigma with their probosces, the stigma secretes no free-flowing, edible fluids. Copious pollen is the only edible reward consumed by hover-flies (Syprhidae), sawflies (Pergidae) and bees in the families Apidae, Colletidae and Halictidae. All these insects carried pollen of T. moorei on their heads, legs and thoraces and female bees in the genera Apis, Exoneura, Leioproctus and Lasioglossum stored pollen on their hind legs. Pollen traps also indicate that pollen is shed directly into the air, permitting wind pollination. When bisexual flower buds are bagged (isolated from insect foragers) on the liane then subjected to a series of hand-pollination experiments after perianth segments open, the structural analyses of pollen-carpel interactions indicate that T. moorei has a trichome-rich dry-type stigma with an early-acting self-incompatibility (SI) system. Bicellular pollen grains deposited on stigmas belonging to the same plant germinate but fail to penetrate intercellular spaces, while grains deposited following cross-pollination reach the ovule within 24 h. Fluorescence analyses of 76 carpels collected at random from unbagged (open-pollinated) flowers on five plants indicates that at least 64 % of carpels are cross-pollinated in situ. Trimenia moorei is the first species within the ANITA group, and second within reilictual-basal angiosperm lineages, to exhibit stigmatic SI in combination with dry-type stigma and bicellular pollen, a condition once considered to be atypical for angiosperms as a whole but now known to be present in numerous taxa. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Andromonoecy; Dry stigma; Insect pollination; Self-incompatibility; Transmitting tissue; Trimeniaceae; Volatiles; Wind-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141574404

The exposed appendix exhibits a strong, unimodal episode of thermogenesis associated with scent production, reaching a maximum of 30°C at 15°C ambient temperature. The male florets in the floral chamber are highly thermogenic throughout the second night and generally maintain stable floret temperatures of about 24°C at ambient temperatures down to 13°C. 3.

This paper reconsiders the relative importance of birds and insects as pollinators to eight native flowering plants, representing a range of pollination syndromes, on two offshore island refuges. Experimental manipulations were made on five of these plant species to assess the relative effectiveness of bird and insect visitors as pollinators. In addition, foraging behaviour and the respective morphologies of flowers and visitors were measured at all eight plants to identify the main pollinators. The experimental measures showed that percentage fruit set was significantly higher in flowers exposed to birds than flowers from which birds were excluded in all manipulated plants. The observational measures revealed that for six of the flowering species (Sophora microphylla, Vitex lucens, Pittosporum crassifolium, Pittosporum umbellatum, Pseudopanax arboreus and Dysoxylum spectabile) the endemic honeyeaters were most likely to meet the conditions necessary for successful pollination. For the remaining two species (Metrosideros excelsa and Geniostoma ligustrifolium) the contribution by honeyeaters and insects to pollination was equivalent. The results suggest that the role of the endemic honeyeaters in pollination of the New Zealand flora, and the subsequent regeneration of native forest ecosystems, should be important considerations in ecosystem management.",Birds; Ecosystem; Effectiveness; Flora; Honeyeaters; Insects; Management; New Zealand; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041551314

The two species were visited in common by such insects as diurnal hawkmoths, bees, swallowtails and nocturnal hawkmoths, and were pollinated nocturnally as well as diurnally. Interspecific pollen transfer can occur by sharing pollinators; however, they did not hybridize when artificially pollinated. Flower size, including stamen and style lengths, is larger in C. trichotomum with an overlap in range. The style of C. izuinsulare in the sympatric population was significantly shorter than that in the allopatric population, while there was no significant difference in style length between the allopatric and the sympatric C. trichotomum.

This postpollination decrease in emission is not triggered by pollen deposition on the stigma. Petunia and snapdragon both synthesize methylbenzoate from benzoic acid and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM); however, they use different mechanisms to downregulate its production after pollination. In petunia, expression of the gene responsible for methylbenzoate synthesis is suppressed by ethylene. In snapdragon, the decrease in methylbenzoate emission is the result of a decrease in both S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT) activity and the ratio of SAM to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (""methylation index"") after pollination, although the BAMT gene also is sensitive to ethylene.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346750616

The asclepiads are of particular interest because of their characteristically highly evolved floral morphology. During 3 months of fieldwork (November 2000 to January 2001) the flower visitors and pollinators to an assemblage of nine asclepiads at an upland grassland site were studied. These observations were augmented by laboratory studies of flower morphology (including scanning electron microscopy) and flower colour (using a spectrometer). Two of the specialized pollination systems that were documented are new to the asclepiads: fruit chafer pollination and pompilid wasp pollination. The latter is almost unique in the angiosperms. Taxa possessing these specific pollination systems cluster together in multidimensional phenotype space, suggesting that there has been convergent evolution in response to similar selection to attract identical pollinators. Pollination niche breadth varied from the very specialized species, with only one pollinator, to the more generalized, with up to ten pollinators. Pollinator sharing by the specialized taxa does not appear to have resulted in niche differentiation in terms of the temporal or spatial dimensions, or with regards to placement of pollinaria. Nestedness analysis of the data set showed that there was predictability and structure to the pattern of plant-pollinator interactions, with generalist insects visiting specialized plants and vice versa. The research has shown that there is still much to be learned about plant-pollinator interactions in areas of high plant diversity such as South Africa. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Apocynaceae; Asclepiadaceae; Community structure; Floral morphology; Grassland; Mutualism; Nestedness; Niche; Plant assemblage; Pollination; SEM; South Africa; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347352277

It consists of the two most active metabolites, designated spinosyn A and D. Both spinosyns are readily degraded in moist aerobic soil, and field dissipation, which is quite rapid (half-life, 0.3-0.5 d) can be attributed to photolysis or a combination of metabolism and photolysis. Spinosad causes neurological effects in insects that are consistent with the general activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but by a mechanism that is novel among known insecticide compounds. Spinosad has a high level of efficacy for lepidopteran larvae, as well as some Diptera, Coleoptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera, but has limited to no activity to other insects and exhibits low toxicity to mammals and other wildlife. Although Spinosad has low toxicity to most beneficial insects, initial acute laboratory tests indicated that Spinosad is intrinsically toxic to pollinators. The hazard of Spinosad to bees was evaluated using a tiered approach. Initial acute laboratory exposures were conducted, followed by toxicity of residues of spinosad on treated foliage, greenhouse studies to assess acute as well as chronic toxicity, confined field assessments, and finally full field studies using a variety of crops under typical use conditions. These data were used to assess the potential of adverse effects on foraging bees following the use of spinosad. This research has clearly demonstrated that spinosad residues that have been allowed to dry for 3 hr are not acutely harmful to honeybees when low-volume and ultralow-volume sprays are used. Further, glasshouse and semifield studies have demonstrated that dried residues are not acutely toxic, and although pollen and nectar from sprayed plants may have transient effects on brood development, the residues do not overtly affect hive viability of either the honeybee or the bumblebee. Field studies in which typical application methods of spinosad were used on a variety of crops have demonstrated that spinosad has low risk to adult honeybees and has little or no effect on hive activity and brood development. The collective evidence from these studies indicates that once spinosad residues have dried on plant foliage, generally 3 hr or less, the risk of spinosad to honeybees is negligible. © Springer-Verlag 2003.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242371130

This process is critical for the conservation and sustainability of the world's flora and fauna. The decline of pollination services caused by chemicals, pests, extreme weather, habitat destruction and/or fragmentation, reduces the reproductive output of plants. In extreme cases this could cause extinction of plants and animals and ultimately lead to changes in the landscape and in ecosystem function. Conservation concerns for pollination have started to take on a greater profile over the past decade. However, there is still a need for policies that are sensitive to the importance of pollinators.

Self-sterility in the genus has been previously posited - but not confirmed - to be the result of late-acting ovarian self-incompatibility (OSI) functioning within nucellar tissue of the ovule to prevent self pollen tubes from entering the embryo sac. Structural and functional aspects of pollen-carpel interactions and early seed development following cross- and self-pollination were investigated in P. axillaris to determine the site, timing and possible mechanisms of self-sterility. No significant differences were observed between pollen tube growth, ovule penetration and double fertilization following cross- and self-pollination. Pollen tubes exhibited phasic growth in an extracellular matrix composed of proteins and carbohydrates, as well as arabinogalactans/arabinogalactan proteins. A uniform failure in embryo sac development prior to division of the zygote was apparent within 15 d following double fertilization by self gametes. Results indicate that SI mechanisms in P. axillaris do not prevent double fertilization from occurring. Instead, mechanisms of self-sterility affect post-zygotic development of the embryo sac. Although self-sterility may be attributed to inbreeding depression, given the post-zygotic nature of failure in embryo sac development, the possibility of late-acting OSI is discussed. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Early-acting inbreeding depression; Embryo sac; Late-acting self-incompatibility; Ovarian self-incompatibility; Pollination-regulated development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042423491

This species has a mainly clumped distribution and its aggregated individuals are likely to be clones. From October to January, during the flowering period, the distal third of its leaves becomes red. The inflorescence produces 1-15 flowers per day over a period of 20-25 d. The flowers are inconspicuous, greenish-white coloured, tubular shaped with a narrow opening, and the stigma is situated just above the anthers. Anthesis begins at 0400 h and flowers last for about 13 h. The highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur between 0600 and 1000 h, and decrease throughout the day. Aechmea pectinata is self-incompatible and therefore pollinator-dependent. Hummingbirds are its main pollinators (about 90 % of the visits), visiting flowers mainly in the morning. There is a positive correlation between the number of hummingbird visits per inflorescence and the production of nectar, suggesting that the availability of this resource is important in attracting and maintaining visitors. The arrangement of the floral structures favours pollen deposition on the bill of the hummingbirds. Flowers in clumps promote hummingbird territoriality, and a consequence is self-pollination in a broader sense (geitonogamy) as individuals in assemblages are genetically close. However, trap-lining and intruding hummingbirds promote cross-pollination. These observations suggest that successful fruit set of A. pectinata depends on both the spatial distribution of its individuals and the interactions among hummingbirds. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Aechmea pectinata; Atlantic forest; Hummingbird-pollination; Inconspicuous flowers; Nectar production; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-23244441719

Prog. University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States","In pines, self-pollination rates can be as high as 34% yet only 5% of viable seed is a product of self-fertilization. This decline in selfed seed viability is the consequence of post-fertilization exclusion mechanisms operating via the embryo lethal system. Recent molecular marker dissection studies suggest that the embryo lethal system is composed of semilethal factors dispersed across the genome, but it is not clear whether overdominant lethal factors are rare or representative. The study objective was to determine if overdominance was rare for the embryo lethal system in conifers. Three cohorts of selfed offspring from a single Pinus taeda parent were genotyped for nuclear microsatellites. Maximum likelihood tests based on distorted segregation ratios for single markers and for interval mapping were used to infer the degree of dominance. Four hypotheses about overdominance lethal factors were tested: (1) overdominant lethal factors rarely occur within the embryo lethal system, (2) overdominant lethal factors are rarely detected because they are transient and display stage-specific expression, (3) overdominant lethal factors are rarely detected due to tight linkage with rare marker alleles and (4) dominance estimation is unbiased by gametic selection. Four out of the seven chromosomal segments were linked to an overdominant lethal factor. One of these four segments had symmetric overdominance, an effect which persisted from embryo maturity through germination. Four overdominant lethal factors were linked to common and rare marker alleles. Gametic selection was not a source of bias in dominance estimation. Overdominant or pseudo-overdominant lethal factors are a common component of the conifer embryo lethal system.",Balanced lethals; Gymnosperms; Pinus taeda L.; Prezygotic selection; Pseudo-overdominance; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346361630

Dyssochroma viridiflorum (Solanaceae), an epiphyte endemic to the Atlantic rainforest in south-eastern Brazil, was found to be visited by phyllostomid bats for nectar as well as for fruits, with the pollination and seed dispersal of the plant ensured by these flying mammals. The greenish flowers open at night and are visited by the nectar-feeding bat Glossophaga soricina, whereas the yellowish-white fruits are consumed by two species of fruit-eating bats, Carollia perspicillata and Sturnira lilium. Only clinging visits, an uncommon behavioural pattern for glossophagine bats while feeding on flowers, were recorded. The small seeds of D. viridiflorum are swallowed along with the fruit pulp and later defecated on the bats' flying pathways.

The results showed that the number of pollen grains/flower decreased from January to March, and pollen germination decreased to its lowest level in January. Despite the decrease in the number of pollen grains/flower and the pollen germination percentage, bumblebee pollination was found to have a positive effect on the fruit yield, fruit quality, and seed set.

Compared to disturbed habitats, undisturbed ones have been previously characterized by higher abundance and diversity of euglossine bees. Most past studies have relied on chemically baiting male bees at single sites within habitats. Over a two-year period, we employed a repeated-measures design in which we sampled bees at multiple sites within three different habitat types, reflecting a mosaic of human disturbance (farm, secondary forest, and old logged forest). After 22 monthly samples, a total of 2008 male bees were captured, representing 31 species in five genera: 1156 at the farm (57.6%, 21 spp.), 505 in the secondary forest (25.1%, 27 spp.), and 347 in the old logged forest (17.2%, 21 spp.). Eighty-one percent of the bees captured belonged to the five most abundant species: Eulaema cingulata, El. chocoana, Euglossa hansoni, Eg. ignita, and Eg. imperialis. These species differed significantly in capture frequencies among habitats. Eulaema cingulata, El. chocoana, and Eg. ignita were captured most frequently at the farm, while Eg. imperialis was most abundant in the secondary forest. In contrast, Eg. hansoni, the sole short-tongued species among the five, was equally abundant in the two forest habitats but occurred rarely on the farm. Additionally, habitats differed in bee composition. The high capture rates for long-proboscis species at the farm may have been due to their ability to extract nectar from flowers with long floral tubes, which probably occurred at a greater density on the farmed land than in the adjacent forests.",Chocó; Colombia; Euglossa; Euglossine bees; Eulaema; Human intervention gradient; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642579558

This probably helps reward only specialized long-tongued pollinators, and a narrow pollinator/flower relationship is thought to accelerate diversification rates (a key innovation). To test the pattern of diversification of Halenia against the unspurred sister group we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships among 22 species plus outgroups using nuclear ITS and chloroplast rpl16 intron sequence data. We show that Halenia originated in East Asia and migrated via North America into Central America. From there, it colonized South America three times independently, probably within the last million years. Significant changes in diversification rates were found during the evolution of Halenia using a sister group method, a likelihood method, and a diversity-through-time plot. In contrast to other studies, we could not observe a direct speciation rate effect of the evolution of nectar spurs in comparison with the unspurred sister group of Halenia. Rather, increases in diversification occurred following the colonization of Central and South America by spurred progenitor taxa. This later switch in diversification may have resulted from the availability of new geographical and ecological opportunities, or from the availability of more and different pollinators in these regions. Following the latter hypothesis, the nectar spurs were a preadaption and functioned as a key innovation only in this new biotic environment. After an initial rapid increase, a reduction in diversification rate was observed in Central America, probably illustrating density dependence of speciation rates. Finally, we found preliminary evidence for the key innovation hypothesis in geologically young spurred and unspurred lineages of Halenia in South America.",Biogeography; Extinction; Halenia; Key innovation; Nectar spur; Preadaption; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344663951

Phenological studies indicated that although the species shows a regular flowering season, all trees do not flower every year. Flowers are typically papilionaceous; the stigma is wet papillate and the style is hollow. The flowers show characteristics of bird pollination being large and bright orange-red in colour with copious amounts of nectar, and exhibiting diurnal anthesis. Although the flowers are frequented by as many as seven species of birds belonging to six families, only one species, the purple sunbird (Nectarinia asiatica), is the effective pollinator. The flowers are also pollinated by the three-striped squirrel (Funambulus tristiatus). Unlike other flower visitors, these two pollinators forage the nectar from the open side of the keel (legitimate path) during which pollen grains are deposited on their body parts. After the first visit of a sunbird or a squirrel, virgin flowers showed pollen load on the stigma and developed into fruits. B. monosperma shows a weak form of self-incompatibility. Fruit set following manual self-pollination (5.25 %) was comparable with open-pollination (approx. 5 %) but was significantly lower than manual cross-pollination (22.51 %). This indicates that there is a high degree of geitonogamous pollination in this species, which may lead to a weakening of self-incompatibility as a means of reproductive assurance. The results are analysed in the light of prevailing discussions on specialized vs. generalized pollination systems. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Breeding system; Butea monosperma (Lam.)

Nowadays, A. angustifolia has become one of the most endangered Brazilian plant species. For this reason, some areas are kept intact to preserve the remained genetic resources of the species. In this study, the genetic variability of three subpopulations of A. angustifolia was compared by RAPD markers. The study includes a natural area with little human action, a managed area, where trees were selected and cut, and a progeny test, where the ""mother trees"" were sampled among those trees harvested in the managed area. The objective of this study was to verify the level of reduction in genetic variability of the managed area and the progeny test. The mean genetic diversity for the natural area, the managed area, and the progeny test were 0.26, 0.26, and 0.22, respectively. The polymorphism index showed a sharp reduction in the genetic variability among the three populations. The percentages of polymorphism were 82.0% for the natural area, 72.5% for the managed area and 59.7% for progeny test. The values of genetic diversity for the total and within populations were, 0.26 and 0.25, respectively. The coefficient of genetic differentiation among populations was 0.06. The results suggested that the management used in the area slightly reduce the genetic variability in the remained population.

The Spearman test was used to analyse the statistical correlation between Urticaceae pollen and certain meteorological factors in different main pollination periods. Maximum values are reached in June and July, minimum levels are recorded in January and December. The parameters bearing the greatest positive influence on the occurrence of Urticaceae pollen grains are: temperature (maximum. minimum and mean), humidity (absolute, wet-bulb temperature, dew point and mixing ratio) and south western wind direction; negative parameters are: relative humidity, rainfall and period without wind. The highest correlation coefficients were obtained with temperature and wet-bulb. Absolute humidity and wet-bulb temperature yielded better correlation than relative humidity; hence, these two parameters must be included in this type of study.

Isozyme analysis was used to identify undesirable outcrosses in the planted progenies. Outcrossing rates were found to be highly variable, ranging from 0 to 0.86. Short accidental breaches in the net's integrity were suspected to be the main cause for the haphazard appearance of hybrids. Indeed, when 'Tova', which consistently had progenies with a high rate of hybrids (averaging 0.58) was caged very meticulously, outcrossing rate was consistently low, averaging only 0.07. Apparently, short periods of accidental exposure to open pollination can result in a high percentage of outcrossed progeny, due to the higher survival rate of outcrossed fruitlets compared to selfed ones. The residual low outcrossing rate found with meticulous caging probably occurred through the penetration of floating foreign pollen from adjacent trees. Thus, the production of pure selfed progeny in avocado requires meticulous caging and the absence of foreign cultivars around the caged trees. In general, the fact that net caging was not fully effective in excluding foreign pollen should encourage the performance of parentage analysis to confirm the purity of progenies produced in net cages.",Isozyme analysis; Persea americana; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842302351

Here, we report the results of experiments designed to examine whether inbreeding depression is influenced by the frequency of inbred plants in the competitive neighborhood.

Competition experiments were conducted in artificial stands composed of different mixtures of inbred and outbred progeny. The fitnesses of progeny were found to be significantly influenced by the composition of the competing neighborhood. The fitness of target plants, however, did not vary monotonically with the frequency of inbred plants in the neighborhood. Rather, for A. gloriosa, maximum performance was observed when there was an intermediate frequency of inbred neighbors. For A. douglasiana, the opposite pattern was found.

The ZmEBE (embryo sac/basal endosperm transfer layer/embryo surrounding region) genes were isolated by a differential display between the upper and the lower half of the kernel at 7 days after pollination (DAP). Sequence analysis revealed ORFs coding for two closely related proteins of 304 amino acids (ZmEBE-1) and 286 amino acids (ZmEBE-2). This size difference was due to differences in the splicing of the two genes. Both protein sequences showed significant similarity to the DUF239 family of Arabidopsis, a group of 22 proteins of unknown function, a small number of which are putative peptidases. ZmEBE genes had a novel cell type-specific expression pattern in the central cell before and the resulting endosperm after fertilization. RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of both genes started before pollination in the central cell and continued in the kernel up to 20 DAP with a peak at 7 DAP. In situ hybridization revealed that the expression in the kernel was restricted to the basal transfer cell layer and the embryo surrounding region of the endosperm. The expression of ZmEBE-1 was at least 10 times lower than that of ZmEBE-2. Similarly to other genes expressed in the endosperm, ZmEBE-1 expression was subject to a parent-of-origin effect, while no such effect was detected in ZmEBE-2. Sequence analysis of upstream regions revealed a potential cis element of 33 bp repeated 7 times in ZmEBE-1 and ZmEBE-2 between positions -900 and -100. The 1.6 kb ZmEBE-2 upstream sequence containing the seven R7 elements was able to confer expression in the basal endosperm to a Gus reporter gene. These data indicate that ZmEBE is potentially involved in the early development of specialized domains of the endosperm and that this process is possibly already initiated in the central cell, which is at the origin of the endosperm.",Basal endosperm transfer layer; Embryo sac; Embryo surrounding region; Endosperm; Maize; ZmEBE,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2442534551

There are approx. 250 populations in a 110 km north-south distribution and populations are usually small with fewer than 50 plants/clumps. The reproductive ecology of the species was studied to determine why seed-set is reportedly rare. Flowers are bisexual, odourless and nectarless. Flowers are presented dependentally and there are eight stamens recurved around the pistil. Anthers are poricidal, contain viable pollen and basally contain a deep-red tapetal fluid that is slightly oily. Thus flowers are presented for buzz pollinators, although none were observed at flowers during our study. The species was found to be facultatively xenogamous with only one in 50 glasshouse flowers setting seed autogamously, i.e. without pollinator assistance. Field studies revealed fertile fruit in 24 populations but production varied significantly across sites from exceedingly low (0-6 fruits per plant clump) to low (17 fruits per plant clump). Fruit-set ranged from 0 to 65 %, suggesting that pollen vectors exist or that autogamy levels in the field are variable and higher than glasshouse results. Fruit production did not vary with population size, although in three of the five populations in the south-west region more than twice as much fruit was produced as in populations elsewhere. A moderately strong relationship between foliage volume and fruit : flower ratios suggests that bigger plants may be more attractive than smaller plants to pollinators. A review of Tetratheca pollination ecology revealed that several species are poorly fecund and pollinators are rare. The habitat requirements for Tetratheca, a genus of many rare and threatened species, is discussed. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Plant size; Population size; Poricidal anthers; Range decline; Reproductive success; Tetratheca juncea; Threatened species; Tremandraceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542443493

Pro-vitamin A is a precursor to vitamin A in maize grain. Two classes of carotenoid pigments in maize are carotenes and xanthophylls which impart yellow or orange color to endosperm. Pro-vitamin A activity results from ?-carotene and to a lesser degree ?-cryptoxanthin in maize. Yellow endosperm maize color is partly controlled by the yellow endosperm-1 locus (chromosome 6). Dominant Y1 allele results in yellow endosperm pigment and recessive y1 results in a lack of endosperm color. Increased levels of carotenoids in maize grain, because of their antioxidant activity, should increase the nutritive value of maize. Research information is needed for breeding programs with the objective to increase carotenoid levels in maize. To obtain some of this information two experiments were conducted: 1. Determine dosage effects at die Y1 locus on five carotenoids using one white, four yellow, three orange and one pale-yellow endosperm inbreds; 2. Estimate maternal and paternal genotype effect on the concentration of five carotenoids using a set of five genotypes. Results from the dosage study showed a consistent increase in the concentration of lutein, zeaxanthin, ?-cryptoxanthin and total carotenoids when each additional dominant Y1 allele was added to the endosperm with the highest concentration at three doses. ?-carotene had the highest concentration at two doses of the Y1 allele. Orange endosperm genotypes had a considerably higher concentration of zeaxanthin than yellow or pale-yellow inbreds. Reciprocal crosses of three generations, F1, backcross-1, and F2, for five genotypes were evaluated for maternal and paternal effects for two years (1998, 1999). In general, carotenoid levels of the different generation crosses are closer to the high parent in value for all the carotenoids evaluated. However, some variation in carotenoid levels among the different genotypes was observed. This variation among different genotypes was due to different concentration levels in the parents. Results using this set of genotypes show that when comparing hybrids with different carotenoid concentrations good estimates of carotenoid levels can be obtained from open pollinated seed because of the larger maternal effect on carotenoid levels.",Carotenes; Carotenoids; Endosperm dosage; Provitamin A; Xanthophylls,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346398481

In order to understand the genetic variation along altitudinal gradients and to generate guidelines for the conservation of forest genetic resources, we investigated isoenzymatic genetic variation among populations of P. oocarpa Schiede along an altitudinal gradient. Open-pollinated seeds from individual trees were collected from five natural populations along an altitudinal transect from 1500 m to 1100 m, one population every 100 m of altitude, near of Uruapan city, in Michoacan. We found polymorphism in eleven of twelve examined loci. The average observed heterozygosity value (Ho = 0.1147) was above the average expected heterozygosity value (He = 0.1020), but it did not deviate significantly from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Genetic differentiation among populations (over loci FST = 0.0011) was not significantly different from zero (p &gt; 0.05). Comparisons for allele frequencies indicated no significant difference for all the tested pairs of populations. Average genetic distance was very low: 0.0054, and genetic flow among populations very high (Nm = 227). Results suggest a small excess of heterozygotes within populations, and a lack of genetic differentiation among the five populations, which can be considered a single panmitic unit. Considering the alarming deforestation rate in the region of Uruapan, Michoacan, we suggest the selection of at least one stand for conversion to a gene resource management unit. We suggest to select the population at 1200 m of altitude, which has the highest number of polymorphic loci (9 of 12) and the highest average number of alleles per loci (1.92).",Deforestation; Genetic resources conservation; Isoenzymes; Mexico; Michoacan; Pinus oocarpa; Population genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042601114

The study included: (1) a reproductive phenology survey to determine the duration of pollination season, (2) controlled selfing trial to determine clonal propensity to selfing, (3) seed yield comparison between seed orchards designs and among clones within seed orchards, and (4) determination of selfing and correlated matings rates using allozyme markers. Results indicated that the orchard has an extended, 22-day, pollination period and clones were characterized based on their reproductive activity as early, medium, and late. The majority of the 25 self-pollinated clones yielded very low seed set, however, few clones showed higher selfing propensity with percent of filled seed ranging from 8 to 29%. Seed orchard design had no significant effect on seed yield (p = 0.27). Outcrossing rate estimates were significantly different between the clonal-row (t = 0.899) and random (t = 0.970) seed orchards, and both estimates significantly departed from complete outcrossing (i.e., t = 1.0), indicating that selfing is higher in the clonal-row design. Estimates of correlated mating substantially varied between the two seed orchard designs with 35 and 8% for the clonal-row and random seed orchards, respectively, demonstrating genetic quality differences of seed produced from the two seed orchard designs. It was concluded that if clonal-row design is considered for advanced generation seed orchards, then a slight modification involving staggering the clonal-rows will allow each clone to be flanked by four other clones.

This study was conducted to determine whether both stamen and pistil are affected by glyphosate treatments by measuring seed set from reciprocal reproductive crosses made between glyphosate-treated GR, untreated GR, and conventional nontransgenic cotton. Pollen viability was 51 and 38% lower for the first and second week of flowering, respectively, in GR plants treated with a four-leaf postemergence (POST) treatment and an eight-leaf POST-directed treatment of glyphosate than in GR plants that were not treated. Seed set per boll was significantly reduced when the pollen donor parent was glyphosate treated vs. untreated for the first 2 wk of flowering. There were no significant differences between treatments applied to male parents as measured by seed set at Weeks 3 and 4 of flowering. Seed set was not influenced by glyphosate treatments applied to female parents at any time. Retention of bolls resulting from crosses was reduced by glyphosate treatment of male parents during the first and third week of flowering but was not affected by glyphosate treatment of female parents. The application of gibberellic acid (GA), which has been shown to reverse male sterility in tomato (Lycopersicon esctilentum L.) and to enhance boll retention in cotton, was investigated for similar effects in glyphosate-treated GR cotton. The GA treatments to glyphosate-treated plants increased the anther-stigma distance 12-fold, stigma height, and pollen viability in the second week of flowering but decreased the number of seeds in second-position bolls on Fruiting branches 1 through 3, decreased the number of first-position bolls per plant, and increased the number of squares in comparison with glyphosate-treated GR plants not receiving GA. Although GA applications to glyphosate-treated GR cotton have some remedial effect on pollen viability, the GA-induced increase in the anther-stigma difference exacerbates the increase in anther-stigma distance caused by glyphosate, resulting in low pollination.",Gametogenesis; Gibberellic acid; Herbicide-resistant crops; Male-sterile; Pollen; Transgenic crops,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346646130

Very little variation was found within species at the loci studied in contrast to the considerable interspecies genetic differentiation at several loci. The gene differentiation between species was ranged from 61 to 91%. The observed genetic structure of the X. strumarium complex was consistent with that found for predominantly autogamous species. The values of maximum outcrossing rates estimated in original sampling sites and in a field test ranged from 8 to 17%, confirming previous observations that Xanthium species are predominantly self-pollinated. Gene duplications were evident in the three Xanthium species because of their likely polyploid origin. The percentage of duplicate loci exhibiting ""fixed heterozygosity"" was 25, 25, and 16% in X. italicum, X. strumarium, and X. orientale, respectively. Data presented supported that both mating system and ploidy level were fundamental features in adaptation process of investigated Xanthium species. Some evidence suggested that polyploidization occurred before speciation of X. italicum, X. strumarium, and X. orientale. As a consequence, a common ancestral progenitor could be postulated for the three species. During geographical adaptation, the three species fixed alternative alleles in some loci, and the process was favored by the predominantly autogamous mating system. On the contrary, fixed heterozygosity in duplicated loci allowed maintenance of a sufficient level of gene diversity in the three Xanthium species to ensure wide adaptability in different microhabitats (i.e., abandoned land, roadsides, and field crops) and to avoid the negative effect of inbreeding depression.",Genetic diversity; Mating system; Polyploidism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33144489361

The main environmental effects include obstruction and diversion of streams and hence erosion, extensive displacement of native vegetation with loss of biodiversity, and reductions in the quantity and quality of water. So far, only a few thousand kilometres of streams have been infested badly; that is less than 10% of potential willow habitat. Except for some of the S. cinerea infestations, it is still possible and worthwhile to control the willows in Australia. The following biological features help to explain the spread and provide a basis for control. 1. The original cause of spread has been importation and planting, usually as cuttings of just one or two clones at a time. 2. The bases of the small branches of most of the tree willows in Australia are easily broken. These willows thus tend to spread by broken branches taking root in wet areas downstream. The shrub willow species are far less fragile and thus unlikely to spread by broken branches. 3. Male and female flowers are usually on separate trees. Female trees will usually produce viable seed with pollen from a male of the same species or of any other species of its botanical group (i.e. either tree willows or shrub willows), provided that the trees occur within pollinating distance of each other (up to at least 1000 m) and flower at the same time (most do). 4. In Australia, most of the resulting seedlings are hybrids and are able to grow vigorously and to breed with each other and with both their parents. 5. Except for S. cinerea and S. purpurea, regeneration from seed is virtually restricted to more or less bare sediment that is kept wet for weeks or months from the time of seed shed (about October/November) because the seed lives for only 1-7 weeks when dry, and germinates in about one day when wet, and because the tiny seedling needs much light and has slow root growth. 6. Seed is easily carried by wind for more than 1 km, and some travels up to 50 or even 100 km. Transport of seed or live branches by streams also serves to spread willows, but is less effective, and only downstream. 7. Probably the main barriers to the survival of seedlings are lack of suitable seed bed, rising or rapidly falling water levels, and floods that uproot or bury the seedlings. 8. Conditions suitable for the establishment of large numbers of seedlings probably occur in most southeastern streams at perhaps 5 to 20 year intervals. Major disturbances, such as wildfire or the collapse of a swamp may also promote massive regeneration from seed. National and regional strategies for willow management are being developed and implemented. They range from prohibitions on the importation, sale, and planting of nearly all willows to the total eradication of the most aggressive species; S. nigra and S. cinerea. Regional strategies aim to eliminate naturally regenerated willows and to reduce their sources to manageable levels. That means, 1. Control fragile willows where their broken branches are very likely to take root, and 2. Keep seeding females to minimal numbers and at least 3000 m away from suitable seedbed, and (preferably) keep males at least 2,000 m from compatible females. In the coming centuries, alien willows are in a position to change much of the natural environment in Australia and elsewhere. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016423854

Variations in per se performance is better realized under optimal growing conditions, and further widened with increase in level of stresses. We examined sub-tropical/mid-altitude germplasm, including promising hybrids, OPVs and inbred lines under different growing conditions, including optimal conditions, mild-stress (double population density) and severe drought stress. At vegetative growth stage, dry mater partitioning between vegetative and reproductive plant parts, proportion of dry matter allocated to leaf growth in relation to stem, and within reproductive parts the amount of dry matter available for ear development varied significantly among the types of germplasm, across the growing conditions. The best performing genotypes, both within a germplasm type and across the germplasm, showed relatively more biomass allocation to leaf at the cost of stem dry weight, and more dry matter accumulation for ear development at the cost of both tassel and stem biomass. Apart from relatively more leaf area, the longevity of active leaf area duration was one of the important characteristics of superior germplasm, across the types of germplasm and growing conditions. Comparatively more cob weight at anthesis was positively correlated with grain yield under drought stress. However, under unstressed or mild stress conditions the relationship was significant only with inbred lines. Across the environments, striking difference was observed for percent kernel abortion during early stage of grain filling (lag phase), both among the germplasm, and also between the best and worst entries within a germplasm type. Rate of kernel growth clay -1 and length of grain filling period were comparatively higher with hybrids than with inbred lines and OPVs. Our findings indicate that these variations in constitutive traits might be the factors responsible for distinct differences in field performance of different types of germplasm.

Seedlings of cultivated species were hardier and had better performance than those of wild species for characters important to transplant survival. Among various root and shoot characters studied, seedling vigour was the major contributor to hardiness. Circinnate and inverted ""U"" shaped embryos were present in more than 90% seeds of both hybrid and open-pollinated families, and these two classes of seeds were at par to each other and better than rod shaped embryos for all characters including transplant survival and tuber yield.

The nearest upwind source for this pollen is populations growing in southern Oklahoma and central Texas, at distances of 200 km and 600 km respectively. Long-distance dispersal of J. ashei pollen into the Tulsa area shows a strong correlation with the trajectories of wind blowing across southern populations before traveling north towards eastern Oklahoma. The strong tie between climatic conditions and the occurrence of this aeroallergen within the Tulsa, Oklahoma, atmosphere provided a unique opportunity to forecast the dispersal, entrainment, and downwind deposition of this significant aeroallergen. Forecasts of long-distance J. ashei pollen dispersal began during the winter of 1998/1999. Each forecast uses defined climatic parameters to signal pollination at each source site. Coupled to these estimates of pollen release, forecast weather conditions and modeled wind trajectories are used to determine the threat of dispersal to downwind communities. The accuracy of these forecasts was determined by comparing the forecast ""threat"" to aerobiological records for the same period collected in the ""Tulsa region"". Analysis of the two seasons revealed only a single occurrence of ""high"" or ""very high"" pollen concentrations in Tulsa not directly linked to ""moderate"" or ""severe"" forecast threats from the southern source areas.","Forecasting; Great plains, USA; Juniperus ashei; Pollen; Wind trajectories",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842311285

The expansion of farm production and intensification of input use are considered a major cause of the loss of biodiversity, while at the same time certain agro - ecosystems can serve to maintain biodiversity. Farming is also dependent on many biological services, such as the provision of genes to develop improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, crop pollination, and soil fertility provided by micro - organisms. In some cases non - native species cause damage to crops from alien pests and competition for livestock forage. The main focus of policy actions in the area of biodiversity has been to protect and conserve endangered species and habitats, but some countries have also begun to develop more holistic national biodiversity strategy plans. These plans usually incorporate the agricultural sector in biodiversity conservation. At the international level a range of agreements are also important in the context of agriculture and biodiversity, most notably, the Convention on Biological Diversity. This chapter examines recent efforts across OECD countries over the past 15 years to provide policy makers with indicators on the current state and changes in biodiversity associated with agricultural activities. Agri-environmental indicators are becoming an important tool for national policy makers to help them with policy monitoring, evaluation and forecasting. The chapter outlines in Section 1 the environmental context of the agribiodiversity issue, followed in Section 2 by reviewing the national and international policy context. Section 3 defines agribiodiversity indicators, covering genetic, wild species and ecosystem diversity. The chapter concludes in Section 4 by examining future challenges to further research in this area. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum and Nakai] cultivar Crimson Tide was grafted onto 10 different rootstocks. Cucurbita moschata, Cucurbita maxima and Lagenaria siceraria were open pollinated cultivars, and Strong Tosa, Gold Tosa, P360 (Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata), Skopje, Emphasis, 216 and FRG (Lagenaria spp.) were hybrid cultivars. The ungrafted Crimson Tide watermelon cultivar was used as the control. Plants were grown under low tunnel conditions until the outdoor temperature was suitable (22-25°C) for watermelon growth. Our results showed that while survival rate was low (65%) in Cucurbita type rootstocks, it was high (95%) in Lagenaria type rootstocks. Grafted plants flowered about 10 days earlier and showed more vigorous vegetative growth than the control plants. Grafted plants had up to 148% higher fresh weights than control plants. Similarly, grafted plants showed 42-180% higher dry weight, 58-100% more leaves and larger leaf area as compared with the control. In total yield, Lagenaria type rootstocks produced a higher yield but Cucurbita type rootstocks produced a lower yield than the control. While control plants had 6.43 kg/m2 yield, Lagenaria type rootstocks produced 27-106% higher yield than the control. In contrast, Cucurbita type rootstocks had 127-240% less yield than the control. This could be attributed to incompatibility of Cucurbita rootstocks because some of the plants died before harvest. The study showed that rootstock choices influence plant growth as well as yield and quality of scion fruit, suggesting an important consideration in the potential use of grafting applications in watermelon.",Fresh and dry weight; Grafting; Growth rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347622485

This paper is a report on the influence and significance of fungicide treatments and other factors on the germination of hybrid plantain seeds. Bunches of hybrid plantain crosses were harvested 90-120 days after hand pollination, then ripened for 4 days in a room with acetylene. Fifty extruded air-dried seeds were planted in duplicate polyethylene bags containing moistened fungicide-drenched composted soil mix. Carbendazim applied as a soil drench at 5 ppm, yielded a peak germination of 24.8%. Mancozeb significantly increased seed germination in January 1996 (4.2 ppm) and February 1996 (1.8-1.3 ppm). Application of copper oxychloride resulted in significantly higher germination than control values only at a lower concentration (0.9-0.6 ppm) of fungicide applied in the February 1996. The time of seed treatment was also identified as a significant factor influencing the germination of the seeds. Percent germination in the control treatment positively correlated with average weather measurements: sunshine r = 0.995, p < 0.01; air temperature r = 0.986, p < 0.05). These results confirm the potential of the relevant fungicides as germination stimulators of plantain hybrid seeds in soil when applied at the appropriate concentration. A favorable environmental condition may also be crucial to meet optimum requirements for specific critical metabolic processes. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Carbendazim; Copper oxychloride; Fungicide; Germination; Hybrid plantain seeds; Mancozeb; Potassium metabisulphite; Soil,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18644372227

In the pollen supplementation experiments, the degree of pollen limitation, in terms of fruit set and seed set, decreased with floral density. Further, in the experimental sites, plant reproductive success increased asymptotically with floral density. These results demonstrate the value of simultaneously conducting experiments in both experimental sites and natural populations to understand how population density influences plant reproductive success.

Seeds collected at different days after pollination (DAP) were stored under accelerated ageing conditions (15% moisture content; 35°C). The study was conducted in two years with contrasting rainfall amount during the maturation period: 1993 (98.5 mm fallen between -5 to +20 days from PM) and 1995 (223.1 mm fallen between -5 to +20 days from PM). Care was taken in using seeds with no evident sign of sprouting (i.e visible radicle) for the ageing experiments. During 1993 estimates of Ki (potential longevity) gave similar values for both varieties and almost did not change significantly with time of harvest. During 1995, estimates for Ki in IS 9530 seeds resembled those obtained during 1993. Estimates in Redland B2 seeds, in contrast, were markedly lower during 1995 than those obtained during 1993. The initiation of the germination process in the mother plant in Redland B2 seeds during the 1995 season, was evidenced by an alpha-amylase activity in unsprouted grains that was, from PM onwards, 100-fold higher than that found in IS 9530 seeds. In both varieties, maximum longevity was achieved in seeds harvested 5 days (1993) to 10 days (1995) after physiological maturity, which would determine the harvest time to obtain Sorghum seeds of high quality. These results suggest that the initiation of the germination process derived from a low dormancy level prior to crop harvest combined with heavy rains during that period, leads to a decrease in potential longevity of Sorghum seeds.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842579049

We selected sites with different lengths of time since the last major disturbance (typically fire): 6, 9, 15 and 20 years. In addition, we also included a patch of mature forest that had experienced selective logging and other human activity in the past 100 years. Genetic diversity was assessed using five polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci. We found a total of 21 alleles in the five loci examined, in which the number of alleles present varied among the five sites studied. Allelic diversity varied between sites ranging from 20 to 14 alleles, and our data revealed that earlier successional sites have more alleles than older sites. There was significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies between sites; however, genetic differentiation between populations was low (FST = 0.063) indicating that most of the variation was found within sites and extensive gene flow between sites. In addition, our analysis also showed that genetic diversity of adult trees does not solely determine the diversity of seedlings and saplings found around them, also supporting the existence of extensive gene flow. The impact of these findings for the design of conservation strategies for tropical dry forests trees is discussed.",Change in land use; Dispersal; Ecological succession; Gene flow; Mahogany; Metapopulation; Microsatellite markers; Over-exploitation; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17544404002

However, sometimes the character that one wants to improve segregates at a low frequency and it is difficult to fix it in the population. Such form of characters may include plant height and drought resistance. In this situation, the breeder would like to self the plant, make a composite with the selfed progenies, intermate the composite by random pollination, and repeating the cycle by selfing again. This method of recurrent selection would be called Selfing and Recombination. Two forms of pollination are used to make random mating: full-sib pollination by plant-to-plant crossing (FS-pollination), and half-sib pollination by crossing one male to several female plants (HS'-pollination). In this paper we try to calculate the inbreeding coefficient under this, goes selfing and recombination recurrent selection. The recurrent equations for inbreeding with FS-pollination and HS'-pollination are obtained. The results recommend using selection plot sizes higher than 200 plants and HS'-pollination.",Inbreeding; Recurrent selection; Selfing and recombination; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842581663

A few studies have shown a substantial difference between population variation in phenotypes for adaptive traits and morphology suggesting geographic and ecotypic differentiation within the species. The present work, which is based on 49 open pollinated families of eight stands of Aleppo pine from the western coastal region of Algiers, is intended for getting information on within-population variation. There were small differences between stands for most traits suggesting that little genetic differentiation between stands exists within the studied region. Parameters as size and location of stands may play a role in shaping genetic variation within stands. This variation was generally of lesser importance in small and/or coastal stands. Given the size of the studied area, it was not expected to find marked links between traits and geographic variables such as altitude or longitude; nevertheless, it was observed west-east clines of variation for 100-seed weight and wing width, parallels with an increase in annual rainfall from western to eastern parts of the zone. As a direct implication for selection, it may not be of interest to retain for seed use purposes stands or restricted areas when prospecting at a local scale; rather, priority should be given to selecting families and/or individuals. And, at the whole population level, because of the weak level of differentiation among stands, it would be sufficient to preserve only a few of stands for ensuring efficient gene conservation.",Aleppo pine; Cone; Plantlet traits; Seed; Stand variation within a region of provenance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042596868

These trophic groups were influenced by season, crop species and GMHT management. Many groups increased twofold to fivefold in abundance between early and late summer, and differed up to 10-fold between crop species. GMHT management superimposed relatively small (less than twofold), but consistent, shifts in plant and insect abundance, the extent and direction of these effects being dependent on the relative efficacies of comparable conventional herbicide regimes. In general, the biomass of weeds was reduced under GMHT management in beet and spring oilseed rape and increased in maize compared with conventional treatments. This change in resource availability had knock-on effects on higher trophic levels except in spring oilseed rape where herbivore resource was greatest. Herbivores, pollinators and natural enemies changed in abundance in the same directions as their resources, and detritivores increased in abundance under GMHT management across all crops. The result of the later herbicide application in GMHT treatments was a shift in resource from the herbivore food web to the detritivore food web. The Farm Scale Evaluations have demonstrated over 3 years and throughout the UK that herbivores, detritivores and many of their predators and parasitoids in arable systems are sensitive to the changes in weed communities that result from the introduction of new herbicide regimes.",Arable systems; Functional groups; Invertebrates; Resource limitation; Trophic interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242654339

Two different modelling approaches for pollen dispersal are used to simulate the cross-pollination rate of pollen emerged from an adjacent transgenic crop field. The models are applied to cross-pollination data from field experiments with transgenic maize (Zea mays). The data were generated by an experimental setup specifically designed to suit the demands of mathematical modelling. First a Gaussian plume model is used for the simulation of pollen transport in and from plant canopies. This is a semiempirical approach combining the atmospheric diffusion equation and Lagrangian methodology. The second model is derived from the localised near field (LNF) theory and based on the physical processes in the canopy. Both modelling approaches prove to be appropriate for the simulation of the cross-pollination rates at distances of about 7.5 m and more from the transgene source. The simulation of the cross-pollination rate is less precise at the edge of the source plot especially with the LNF theory. However, the simulation results lie within the range of variability of the observations. Concluding can be pointed out that both models might be adapted to other pollen dispersal experiments of different crops and plot sizes. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Most commercial cultivars of leek are open pollinated. One of the major problems with the crop is poor uniformity. Leek is an outbreeding species with up to 20% self-fertilisation. Much of the variation of open pollinated cultivars is explained by the strong sensitivity to inbreeding depression after selfing. In this study we attempt to analyse in a systematic way the relationship between degree of selfing and agricultural performance in leek. The results obtained confirm a negative correlation between selfing and some agricultural aspects important for vigour such as seedling emergence, plant growth and plant fresh yield. Also negative correlations between degree of selfing and seed individual weight and between selfing and seed individual size were found. The negative relationship between inbreeding and plant weight at harvest is further confirmed in an experiment in which the origin (cross-pollination or self-pollination) of each individual offspring plant analysed was determined using AFLP-markers. Finally, the correlation between chlorophyll deficiency genes and the loss of vigour that follows selfing was investigated.

It appears to be principally pollinated by the honey possum, Tarsipes rostratus. This tiny (7-10 g) marsupial is the most abundant and widespread mammal in one large heathland where 97% of honey possums trapped near B. nutans were found to carry its pollen. An experiment was conducted that regulated access to flowers by different groups of pollinators. Exclosures around bushes removed access to flowers by flying animals, but still allowed honey possums to visit the flowers. This treatment resulted in fruit set that was not significantly different from bushes to which all animals had access.

The classical view is that adaptive mutations are nearly infinite in number with infinite-simally small phenotypic effect, but recent theory suggests otherwise. To provide empirical estimates of the magnitude of adaptive mutations in wild plants, we conducted field studies to determine the adaptive value of alternative alleles at a single locus, YELLOW UPPER (YUP). YUP controls the presence or absence of yellow carotenoid pigments in the petals of pink-flowered Mimulus lewisii, which is pollinated by bumblebees, and its red-flowered sister species, M. cardinalis, which is pollinated by hummingbirds. We bred near-isogenic lines (NILs) in which the YUP allele from each species was substituted into the other. M. cardinalis NILs with the M. lewisii YUP allele had dark pink flowers and received 74-fold more bee visits than the wild type, whereas M. lewisii NILs with the M. cardinalis yup allele had yellow-orange flowers and received 68-fold more hummingbird visits than the wild type.

Instead, bumblebee densities were positively related to the availability of highly rewarding mass flowering crops (i.e. oilseed rape) in the landscape. In addition, mass flowering crops were only effective determinants of bumblebee densities when grown extensively at the landscape scale, but not at smaller local scales.

In addition to physical mechanisms such as the spatial (herkogamy) and temporal (dichogamy) separation of male and female functions, plasticity in sex expression by means of mate-recognition (flexible mating) could be important in plants with variable access to cross-pollen. This applies particularly to clonal plants because of their modular growth form. We experimentally tested for the effects of pollen source and vegetative neighbourhood on instantaneous sex ratio and seed production in the self-compatible clonal marine angiosperm Zostera marina L. To this end, we exposed the (monoecious) flowering shoots to self and cross-pollen and to neighbourhoods of their own and a mix of foreign vegetative shoots. Flowering shoots that had been exposed to cross-pollen showed (1) a significantly lower female/male ratio at peak flowering, evidence for mate-recognition, and (2) a significantly higher seed set by the end of the season. Both effects were independent of the genetic composition of their vegetative neighbourhood. The results suggest that Z. marina maintains a cryptic self-incompatibility system not previously described for angiosperms with sub-aqueous pollination. In Z. marina, and possibly other self-compatible clonal plant species, mate-recognition could be a means of increasing the out-crossing probability for flowering shoots with central positions within their clone.",Clonal plant; Eelgrass; Flexible mating; Hermaphrodite; Inbreeding; Self-incompatibility; Zostera marina,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043050312

However, quantifying useful estimates of pollinator visitation rates can be nearly impossible when pollinator visitation is infrequent. We examined the utility of an indirect measure of pollinator visitation, namely pollen receipt by flowers, using the hummingbird-pollinated plant, Ipomopsis aggregate (Polemoniaceae). Our a priori hypothesis was that increased pollinator visitation should result in increased pollen receipt by stigmas. However, the relationship between pollinator visitation rate and pollen receipt may be misleading if pollen receipt is a function of both the number of pollinator visits and variation in pollinator efficiency at depositing pollen, especially in the context of variable floral morphology. Therefore, we measured floral and plant characters known to be important to pollinator visitation and/or pollen receipt in I. aggregata (corolla length and width and plant height) and used path analysis to dissect and compare the effect of pollinator visitation rate vs. pollinator efficiency on pollen receipt. Of the characters we measured, pollinator visitation rate (number of times plants were visited multiplied by the mean percentage of flowers probed per visit) had the strongest direct positive effect on pollen receipt, explaining 36% of the variation in pollen receipt. Plant height had a direct positive effect on pollinator visitation rate and an indirect positive effect on pollen receipt. Despite the supposition that floral characters would directly affect pollen receipt as a result of changes in pollinator efficiency, corolla length and width only weakly affected pollen receipt. These results suggest a direct positive link between pollinator visitation rate and pollen receipt across naturally varying floral morphology in I. aggregata. Understanding the relationship between pollinator visitation rate and pollen receipt may be of critical importance in systems where pollinator visitation is difficult to quantify.",Floral morphology; Hummingbird pollination; Ipomopsis aggregata; Path analysis; Polemoniaceae; Pollen receipt; Pollinator efficiency; Pollinator visitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344961933

In both pollinations, the phytohormones were present in various proportions in the stigma, style and ovary: the stigma was the main site of ethylene synthesis and contained 90% of the ABA, while the style contained 80% of the total cytokinin content in the pollinated pistil. Relatively low levels of hormones in the ovary did not influence the hormonal status of the pollen-pistil system. The interaction of the male gametophyte with the stigmatic tissues was accompanied by a 7- to 10-fold increase in ethylene production and a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in IAA content in the pollen-pistil system over 0-4 h. Pollen tube growth after self-incompatible pollination, in contrast to compatible pollination, was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in the ABA content in the stigma and style and by a 5-fold higher cytokinin content in the stylar tissues. Thus, the ethylene/ABA status of the stigma may play a role in controlling the processes of adhesion, hydration, and germination of pollen grains during pollination while the auxin/cytokinin status of the style may be involved in controlling pollen tube growth.",Cytokinins; Ethylene; Petunia hybrida; Pollen-pistil interactions; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344961803

Various species flowered sequentially from February to October. The principal pollinators were bumblebees, honey-bees, flies and/or beetles and birds; bumblebees and flies/beetles pollinated most trees. The duration of flowering was shorter for species that bloomed in the middle of the season than it was for species that bloomed earlier or later in the season. The timing of flowering was more synchronous within species that had a shorter flowering duration; this was also detected when phylogenetically independent contrasts were calculated. This could be important for the effective pollination of species with a short flowering duration because such species bloom sequentially over a short period of less than 1 month around May. Fruit set was related not to pollinator type, sex expression, flowering sequence (in order of the date of peak flowering) or flowering duration, but to the relative abundance of the species in the forest. This correlation was detected for fly- and beetle-pollinated species but not for bumblebee-pollinated species. Thus, relatively rare plant species with opportunistic pollinators might experience limited fruit set because of insufficient pollinator services. Bagging experiments conducted on eight hermaphrodite species revealed that the fruit set of bagged flowers was nearly zero, lower than that of control flowers.

Frequency of visitors to each part of the inflorescence was also quantified. Hand self-and cross-pollinations were performed in complete racemes and fruit set used to determine breeding system. The racemes produced a mean of 329 flowers, more densely packed in the central portion. Hermaphrodite and male flowers occur along the inflorescence but hermaphrodite flowers are more common in the centre. Fruit set was markedly low but does not seem to be limited by pollination service, since free open-pollinated racemes and hand cross-pollinated ones do not differ in fruit production rates. Fruits resulted mostly from cross-pollinated flowers and fruit production was biased to the central portion of the raceme. Nectar yield was higher in the central portion of the raceme and visitors arrived more commonly on this portion of the inflorescence. However, most flowers did not produce nectar. The pattern of fruit production seems to be a consequence of the hermaphrodite flower distribution in the raceme and it is not constrained by pollen flow or flower opening sequence.",Andromonoecy; Flowering pattern; Fruiting pattern; Mimosoideae; Savanna,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042290797

We found no differences in colony worker populations, brood production, or queen and drone production between supplemented and nonsupplemented treatments, suggesting that B. occidentalis colonies obtain adequate nutrition from the tomato pollen available in greenhouses. Adult populations did not increase in any treatment, but either remained stable or declined after colonies were placed in greenhouses. Because brood-rearing increased in all treatments but adult populations did not, adult mortality due to a non-nutritional factor such as disease or disorientation appears to be an important problem limiting the size of bumble bee colonies, and thus the effectiveness of bumble bees for greenhouse tomato pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042279773

Expression analyses of S6-RNase and SFB6, a candidate gene for pollen-S, in the S6m-haplotype showed that SFB6 was transcribed in EB pollen, but S 6-RNase was not transcribed in EB styles. These results were consistent with data from the inheritance and pollination studies. Inverse PCR for the flanking regions of S6-RNase in the S6- and S 6m-haplotypes revealed an approximately 2600 bp insertion present at approximately 800 bp upstream of the S6-RNase in the S 6m-haplotype, which is responsible for the alternation of the HindIII cut site and a possible cause of inhibition of the transcription of S6-RNase. SFB6 was present downstream of S 6-RNase in both the S6- and S6m-haplotypes and expressed in the same way, supporting the idea that SFB is a good candidate for pollen-S in Prunus.",Pistil determinant; Pollen determinant; Polyploidy; Prunus avium; Rosaceae; S-RNase; SFB,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242628091

Re-emergence was independent of fig diameter, indicating that permeability is not because of fig age at entry. Rather, as some foundresses also pollinate two female figs we suggest permeability is selected for because it increases pollinator production and/or efficiency (although, potentially opposing these hypotheses, we also found between-tree differences in permeability in male figs). In addition, we show that re-emergence is much more common than previously suspected, and more common from gynodioecious than monoecious fig species.

Various insect species including Lepidoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera visited the flowers. However, geitonogamous pollination was common because of the short flying distance of the pollinators.

The evolution of facultative manipulation of sex ratio depends on the ability of the parents to track the conditions favouring skewed sex allocation and on the mechanism controlling sex allocation. In animals, which have well-developed sensorial mechanisms, facultative adjustment of sex ratios has been demonstrated on many occasions. In this paper, we show that plants have mechanisms that allow them to evaluate the population OSR. We simulated three different conditions of population OSR by manipulating the amount of pollen received by the female flowers of a monoecious herb, and examined the effect of this treatment on the allocation to male vs. female flowers. A shortage of pollen on the stigmas resulted in a more male-skewed sex allocation, whereas plants that experienced a relatively pollen rich environment tended to produce a more female-skewed sex allocation pattern. Our results for Begonia gracilis demonstrate that the individuals of this species are able to respond to the levels of pollination intensity experienced by their female flowers and adjust their patterns of sex allocation in accordance to the expectations of sex allocation theory.",Begonia; Deceit pollination; Facultative sex allocation; Sex choice; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242627673

The average transgene zygosity and genetic structure of transgenic hybrid populations change with the progression of generations, and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene is an ideal marker to quantify transgene expression in advancing populations. The homozygous T1 single-locus insert GFP/Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenic canola (Brassica napus, cv Westar) with two copies of the transgene fluoresced twice as much as hemizygous individuals with only one copy of the transgene. These data indicate that the expression of the GFP gene was additive, and fluorescence could be used to determine zygosity status. Several hybrid generations (BC1F1, BC2F1) were produced by backcrossing various GFP/Bt transgenic canola (B. napus, cv Westar) and birdseed rape (Brassica rapa) hybrid generations onto B. rapa. Intercrossed generations (BC2F2 Bulk) were generated by crossing BC2F1 individuals in the presence of a pollinating insect (Musca domestica L.). The ploidy of plants in the BC2F2 Bulk hybrid generation was identical to the weedy parental species, B. rapa. AFLP analysis was used to quantify the degree of B. napus introgression into multiple backcross hybrid generations with B. rapa. The F1 hybrid generations contained 95-97% of the B. napus-specific AFLP markers, and each successive backcross generation demonstrated a reduction of markers resulting in the 15-29% presence in the BC2F2 Bulk population. Average fluorescence of each successive hybrid generation was analyzed, and homozygous canola lines and hybrid populations that contained individuals homozygous for GFP (BC2F2 Bulk) demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence than hemizygous hybrid generations (F 1, BC1F1 and BC2F1). These data demonstrate that the formation of homozygous individuals within hybrid populations increases the average level of transgene expression as generations progress.

For most crosses the 10-parameter model was the best descriptor of the data to account for the variability in generation means of this trait but in cross HI 8062 x JNK-4W-128 the 6-parameter model was the best (normal sown) while in cross Raj 911 x DWL 5002 the 3-parameter model was the best (late sown). Of the epistatic interactions, dominance x dominance (l) and dominance x dominance x dominance (z) played significantly greater roles in controlling the inheritance of this trait. Absolute totals of non-fixable gene effects were much higher than the fixable gene effects in all the crosses in both the environments, indicating the greater roles of non-additive effects in controlling the inheritance of flag leaf length in durum wheat cultivars. Significant partial dominance was observed frequently in most of the crosses. Significant heterosis was attributed to combined effects of dominance x dominance (l), additive x additive x dominance (x) and dominance x dominance x dominance (z) epistatic interactions in the cross Cocorit 71 x A-9-30-1 under late sown environment.

Number of carpels per flower and number of pollen grains per anther were the most important traits affecting between-plant variation in structural gender. There was no evidence of significant plant-level trade-offs or correlations between the various male and female traits, which covaried differently across populations.

Watermelon plants, grafted on bottle gourd, were grown in a glasshouse at different planting densities. Two vines per plant were allowed to grow and trained vertically. One hand-pollinated fruit per plant was set around the 15th node on either vine. The solar radiation and photosynthetic rate of individual leaves during fruit development period were determined by an integrated solarimeter film and a portable photosynthesis system, respectively. Fruit size was significantly decreased as the planting density increased, whereas soluble solids content of the fruits was affected little. The solar radiation and the photosynthetic rate of the individual leaves gradually decreased as the leaf position became lower at all planting densities on account of shading; those at lower leaves tended to decrease as the planting density increased. Fruit size was closely related to both the total solar radiation and the photosynthetic production per plant. In conclusion, the difference in fruit size among the planting densities is attributed to the photosynthetic productivity of the whole plant, which is mainly a function of the total solar radiation.

Grevillea macleayana is a rare, fire-dependent Australian shrub with large seeds lacking adaptations for dispersal; yet it produces inflorescences adapted to pollination by highly mobile vertebrates (eg birds). Interpreting finescale genetic structure in the light of these two processes is confounded by the recent imposition of anthropogenic disturbances with potentially contrasting genetic consequences: (1) the unusual foraging behaviour of exotic honeybees and 2. widespread disturbance of the soil-stored seedbank by road building and quarrying. To test for evidence of finescale genetic structure within G. macleayana populations and to test the prediction that such structure might be masked by disturbance of the seed bank, we sampled two sites in undisturbed habitat and compared their genetic structure with two sites that had been strongly affected by road building using a test for spatial autocorrelation of genotypes. High selfing levels inferred from genotypes at all four sites implies that pollen dispersal is limited. Consistent with this, we observed substantial spatial clustering of genes at 10 m or less in the two undisturbed populations and argue that this reflects the predicted effects of both high selfing levels and limited seed dispersal. In contrast, at the two sites disturbed by road building, spatial autocorrelation was weak. This suggests there has been mixing of the seed bank, counteracting the naturally low dispersal and elevated selfing due to honeybees. Pollination between near neighbours with reduced relatedness potentially has fitness consequences for G. macleayana in disturbed sites.",Disturbance; Microsatellites; Seed dispersal; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242578213

Knowledge on the level and distribution of their genetic variation can help to develop appropriate strategies, in order to suistainably manage in situ these germplasm resources at risk of genetic erosion. C. annuum is an herbaceous diploid species and is considered to be self-pollinating, although different rates of out-crossing have been recorded. We used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to assess genetic diversity within and between five populations of a landrace of Capsicum annuum L., grown in a limited area in north-west Italy and locally known as 'Cuneo' pepper. Partitioning the genetic variation with Shannon's diversity index revealed that 41.6% occurred between and 58.4% within populations. Analogous results were obtained when the analysis was based only on RAPD or AFLP markers. However, AFLP was more reliable, since a lower range of variation was observed among primer combinations in detecting the two components of genetic variation. Notwithstanding the rather high level of within genetic variation detected, the five populations were clearly differentiated and differed in the frequency of alleles exclusive and/or present at very low frequencies. Our results show the need for accurate estimation of allele frequencies, in order to identify populations to which priority should be given for dynamic conservation of landraces.",AFLP; Capsicum annuum; Genetic variability; In situ germplasm conservation; Landrace; RAPD,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043262916

The genetic effects of forest fragmentation were examined in the common understorey herb Viola pubescens, a species that produces self-pollinated cleistogamous (CL) flowers and potentially outcrossing chasmogamous (CH) flowers. Using allozymes, we measured genetic variation in different sized populations. These were located in woodlots of various sizes (0.5-40.5 ha) and distances from one another (0.3-46 km) within the agricultural landscape of central Ohio in the Midwestern United States. Changes in forest cover of each woodlot within the past 180 years were determined from historical sources and aerial photographs. Woodlot and population sizes were significantly and positively correlated with measures of genetic variation (A, P, HO and HE), with variation highest in populations in the largest woodlot population and lowest in the smallest woodlot population. Most large woodlots resulted from fluctuations in forest cover over the past 60 years, while smaller fragments remained the same size. Overall, populations in Crawford County were genetically differentiated from one another (? = 0.34), but there was no relationship between genetic and geographical distance. Preliminary evidence for a single year indicated a high rate of outcrossing in most populations. Despite the CH/CL reproductive advantage and apparent outcrossing, populations of V. pubescens in small woodlots remain susceptible to potentially detrimental effects of fragmentation such as genetic drift and reduced levels of genetic variation.",Chasmogamy; Cleistogamy; Deciduous forest; Genetic variation; Habitat fragmentation; Viola pubescens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242625379

Flowering order and flower position are thus partially decoupled, and this provides an opportunity to separately investigate the effects of these two factors upon fruit formation. We recorded natural patterns of fruit set and seed production, and found that fruit set patterns were determined by what appears to be a form of apical dominance. The first, apical flower had the highest fruit set and seed production. Fruit set decreased towards the base of the inflorescence, with later-opening flowers having a higher fruit set. This is contrary to the pattern usually observed in other acropetally flowering plants, which is a higher fruit set for basal, early flowers. By performing additional hand pollinations and counting pollen grains on naturally pollinated flowers, we found that pollen deposition was not a major factor limiting fruit set, and that it could not explain the large difference in fruit set between the apical and basal flowers. Removing the first flower after it had wilted increased fruit set in the remaining flowers, but mainly in the more apical flowers. Only by removing the two topmost flowers could we obtain an increase in fruit set for the basal flower. The fact that the basal flower rarely sets fruit, despite being closer to resources, suggests that the apical meristem is either a strong sink for resources or produces hormones that form a gradient along the inflorescence, which is comparable with apical dominance.",Architectural effects; Flower removal; Fruit set; Pollen limitation; Reproductive allocation; Seed production; Stigmatic pollen loads,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1042290802

We have shown that, in the case of carrot regeneration, 70 equally harvested plants should provide an effective size (Ne) of at least 50 plants.

However, these do not seem to be the only reasons for seed infertility because hand-pollination fails to restore seed set in ovaries where a fraction of the ovules are still morphologically normal. Therefore, it is conceivable that other unreported defects occur during the reproductive process in the mutant. In this research, we show that the mutation does not affect pollen or embryo sac development and viability, but generates sporophytic effects that reduce seed production and seed size. While pollen germination and stylar growth were normal in mutant pistils, fertilization does not take place because of abnormalities in the pollen tube-ovary interaction in this genotype. Inside the ovary of pat plants, pollen tubes appeared to be disorientated; they wandered about in the ovarian cavity and often lost their adherence to the placental surface. Interestingly, in pat ovaries fertilization was strongly impaired even in those ovules that appeared normal. It may be that apparently 'normal' ovules cannot guide pollen tubes to their micropyle in the altered pat ovary because adhesion molecules are not properly arrayed on a placenta that is already preparing for cell division or, alternatively, chemotropic signals in the pat ovary may be altered by the presence of aberrant ovules, which are not simply devoid of attractivity, but disrupt pollen tube guidance overall.",Lycopersicon esculentum; Parthenocarpy; Pollen-pistil interaction; Seed set; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344961812

One experiment (in 1998) with one hybrid in Switzerland and two experiments (in 2000 and 2001) with two hybrids in Thailand were conducted to estimate the influence of different pollination dates on the pollination success for male-fertile and male-sterile maize.

Research was performed in order to evaluate responses of early maize germplasm to several planting density rates and to determine if selection changed germplasm responses to plant density. Synthetic varieties developed at North Dakota State University were selected for grain yield, kernel depth, and growth rate at 20,000, 50,000 and 200,000 plants ha -1. Genotypes were evaluated at five population rates ranging from 38,000 to 62,000 plants ha -1 across four North Dakota environments for Experiment 1 and at two population rates (44,000 and 66,000 plants ha -1) across five environments for Experiment 2. Genotypes x density interactions were not significant at P ? 0.05 in both experiments. Average grain yield means reached their maximum at final stands of approximately 56,000 plants ha -1 and did not improve at higher plant densities in Experiment 1. The maximum grain yield mean for Experiment 2 was obtained at final stands of approximately 66,000 plants ha -1. The selection environment (high vs. low plant density) was not a determinant factor for grain yield improvement. Selection has improved grain yield (P ? 0.05) in most of the synthetic populations studied regardless of plant density utilized. Mass selection was usually associated with higher grain moisture. Taller plants with higher ears were observed as plant density increased. The use of progeny testing in the most promising genetic materials seems desirable. Medium to high-density rates (56 to 66,000 plants ha -1) are recommended for open-pollinated seed production; however, higher plant densities are encouraged for germplasm improvement in order to facilitate the breeder's ability to discard genotypes.

Ten isozyme systems encoded by 19 loci were used to classify 404 maize open-pollinated populations from six European countries. The average number of alleles per locus in the collection was 3.1. Allele richness was quite homogeneous across countries. The distribution of rare alleles supports the historical conclusion that Spain was the main entrance of maize to Europe. Alleles shared by maize from Mediterranean countries and Mexico or Guatemala suggest that the source of Mediterranean maize could have been these areas of Central America. Some rare alleles absent in Spain suggest that maize was also introduced through other countries. The collection of European populations was classified into two main groups, the smaller containing those of Northern Europe and the larger divided into Mediterranean and miscellaneous subgroups. Several singularities were seen that might be explained by drift or particular introductions. The results suggest that maize from North America came to Europe via the European Atlantic coast, and from Central America to the Mediterranean region, though introduction through other ways cannot be discarded on the basis of the present isozyme data.",Allozyme; History; Numerical taxonomy; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142103462

Ten open pollinated flint maize varieties were crossed to four inbred testers representing Reid Yellow Dent, Lancaster Surecrop and European flint heterotic groups. Testcrosses were evaluated in four environments in northwestern Spain. Variability for many traits was mainly due to general combinig ability (GCA) of varieties or tester; thus, additive effects were more important in the differences among varieties and testers. For yield, most of the variability was due to the GCA of testers, indicating homogeneous performance of the flint populations included in this study. Varieties yielded more in crosses to A632, a Reid Yellow Dent-type inbred line. The flint varieties had a higher yield in crosses to dent testers than to the European flint tester.

Moench) production at altitudes higher than 2200 m, where early morning temperatures close to 8°C prevails during the growth cycle, is restricted by its susceptibility to male sterility induced by low temperatures. Cold-tolerant (CT) lines and hybrids have already been developed in Mexico. Three field experiments, each one with 64 genotypes were initially established, to evaluate the potential of CT germplasm in the adaptation and adaptability of grain sorghum in the Mexican High Valleys (OSUNA et al., 2000). From each experiment, we selected three B and three R cold-tolerant lines, from the Sorghum Improvement Breeding Program of the Colegio de Postgraduados; and a similar number of cold-susceptible (CS) sorghum lines from the Sorghum Program of the National Research Institute of Forestry, Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry (INIFAP in Spanish), as well as 35 F1 crosses representing the combinations CTxCT, CTxCS, CSxCT, and CSxCS, plus three controls. Data from these 50 genotypes were analized under a randomized complete block design with two replications.The objectives were to determine the effect of low temperatures on production of fertile and sterile pollen, stigma receptivity, and seed production in selfed and open pollinated panicles. The relationships among these variables were also evaluated. Results show that low temperatures affected the quality and reduced the amount of pollen produced, and possibly modified stigma receptivity. The severity or extent of such effects depended on the degree of cold tolerance of the genotypes. Open pollinated panicles produced more seed than selfed panicles, so cross pollination should be considered as a frequent phenomenon in sorghum grown under low temperature environments. Cold-tolerant lines produced more pollen, higher percentage of fertile pollen, lower percentage of sterile pollen, and higher amount of seed under self and open pollination than CS ones. Partially CT hybrids tended to behave as CT ones. Genotypes did not show a significant correlation between production of fertile pollen and grain yield, because of the high proportion (more than 50%) of cross pollination observed in some CS genotypes, under low temperature conditions during the pre-boot growth stage.",Low temperature responses; Pollen viability; Sorghum breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142039965

In the model developmental system Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon), the closely related genes CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and DICHOTOMA (DICH) are needed for the development of zygomorphic flowers and the determination of adaxial (dorsal) identity of floral organs, including adaxial stamen abortion and asymmetry of adaxial petals. However, it is not known whether these genes played a role in the divergence of species differing in flower morphology and pollination mode. We compared A. majus with a close relative, Mohavea confertiflora (desert ghost flower), which differs from Antirrhinum in corolla (petal) symmetry and pollination mode. In addition, Mohavea has undergone a homeotic-like transformation in stamen number relative to Antirrhinum, aborting the lateral and adaxial stamens during flower development. Here we show that the patterns of expression of CYC and DICH orthologs have shifted in concert with changes in floral morphology. Specifically, lateral stamen abortion in Mohavea is correlated with an expansion of CYC and DICH expression, and internal symmetry of Mohavea adaxial petals is correlated with a reduction in DICH expression during petal differentiation. We propose that changes in the pattern of CYC and DICH expression have contributed to the derived flower morphology of Mohavea and may reflect adaptations to a pollination strategy resulting from a mimetic relationship, linking the genetic basis for morphological evolution to the ecological context in which the morphology arose.",Antirrhinum; CYCLOIDLA/DICHOTOMA; Evolution of development; Floral evolution; Mohavea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242363157

Floral size dimorphism reported for this species was confirmed by differences in floral biomass. At the level of the inflorescence, there were significantly greater numbers of male versus female flowers/inflorescence. No differences were observed between male and female plants in height, stem number, and diameter at the ground level. Male flowers bear 6 to 21 stamens and female flowers 3 to 6 spirally arranged carpels and staminodes that mimic the fertile androecia in male flowers. Flowering within a population was synchronous, and flowers of Amborella trichopoda are both insect- and wind-pollinated. A wide variety of insects ranging in size from ca. 1 mm to 7 cm in length pollinate the flowers, indicating a generalist pollination system. Beetles involved in pollination dwell in the forest litter but also spend hours on the leaves, flowers, and branches feeding on pollen. Pollen is the reward for insects as there is an absence of detectable floral volatiles and nectars, and anthers lack secretions or food bodies. A free-flowing stigma secretion was occasionally present, but it was not consumed by pollinators. Structural studies indicate that the stigma is of the dry-type, and the pollinators probably visit female flowers because of the mimetic role of the staminodes. The combination of wind and insect pollination exhibited in A. trichopoda is rare in basal angiosperms. Gall midges, parasitoid wasps, and thrips utilize floral tissue as a breeding site, impeding reproduction. Two species of gall-inducing midges (Cecidomyiidae) insert egg(s) into the gynoecia of developing flower buds, converting one or more ovaries into galls. Parasitoid wasps (Chalcidae) lay eggs in the galls that develop into larvae that prey upon the midge maggots. The Cecidomyiidae expanded with the angiosperms, but the earliest fossils of gall-inducing gall midges occur in the Miocene. Deceptive mechanisms involving numerous floral traits in small bisexual and unisexual flowers are common in the ANITA group and other basal angiosperms.",Amborella trichopoda; Amborellaceae; ANITA group; Beetles; Dioecy; Gall midges; Insect/wind pollination; New Caledonia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142104408

Biotechnology patent systems and intellectual property rights intrinsic with genetically engineered rices weigh in at odds, competing with these good grain qualified traditional rices. Genetic analyses have been made to uncover the supremacy of gene action and combining ability for certain grain quality related physicochemical traits in seven diverse ecogeographical genotypes of 'indica' rice using a 7 × 7 half-diallel cross following Griffing's Model-1, Method-2. Comparative results obtained from 7 parents + 21 F1s + 21 F2s revealed the involvement of both additive (polygenic) and non-additive (epistasis or interallelic) gene action(s) in the governance of grain quality traits. However, the ratio of ?2g/?2s exhibited greater importance of non-additive genes for all the traits except kernel length in F1. This suggests the plausibility of exploitation of heterosis in rice as a self-pollinated crop. Epistasis gene action (interallelic interaction) was found to be more pronounced for all the traits. The genotypes NS 19 (for grain weight), T 21 and IR 24 (for both kernel length and L/B ratio) and Jal Lahri (for protein content) emerged as good general combiners with high 'gca' values. The six specific crosses, viz., Mahsuri/IR 24, NDR 359/Jal Lahri, Sarjoo 52/Jal Lahri, Mahsuri/T 21, Sarjoo 52/NS 19 and Sarjoo 52/T 21, revealed significant 'sca' effects suggesting their role in improvising for certain physico-chemical grain quality traits. These crosses were found to retain at least one parent with high 'gca' value and the other parent having either high, average or low 'gca' effects indicating for the occurrence of both additive as well as non-additive genetic interactions. These findings may be of greater relevance in shuffling and combining the genes/traits between traditional and modern rice varieties (e.g., semi-dwarf, good to moderate tillering, medium maturity and good grain quality with high protein content) in almost all rice growing ecosystems. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Although maize pollination has proven reliable and broadly applicable to wheat, its success is determined by the wheat and maize genotypes employed. A wheat genotype consisting of nuclear and cytoplasm components predisposing it to parthenogenesis was compared with three other genotypes, each possessing only one or neither component necessary for parthenogenesis. In a glasshouse experiment, each genotype was pollinated with maize and subsequently treated with a 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D) solution to determine if parthenogenesis affected embryo formation frequency (EFF) and haploid formation efficiency (HFE). Wheat genotypes were also treated with the 2,4-D solution alone to determine if embryos and haploid plants could be produced in vivo without maize pollination. 'Salmon(K)', a parthenogenetic genotype consisting of a Salmon 1BL.1RS nucleus in a Ae. kotschyii cytoplasm, had a mean EFF of 32%; whereas, the non-parthenogenetic genotypes had mean EFF calculations ranging from 7 to 21%. Mean HFE for Salmon(K) was not significantly different than the mean HFE for non-parthenogenetic Salmon; however, EFF and HFE calculations for Salmon(K) and Salmon, each with a 1BL.1RS translocation, were generally higher than calculations for genotypes without the translocation. Salmon(K) was the only genotype to produce a 3% or higher EFF and HFE after treatment with 2,4-D alone.

Ten genotypes of sorghum suitable for post rainy season were crossed to cytoplasmic male sterile line 104A and three genotypes to 116A producing 13 hybrids. Two sets of 13 hybrids with and without pollen selection were produced. PEG at 36 per cent was applied to stigma and stylar tissue one hour before pollination for pollen selection (selective fertilization) and no treatment for control (nonselective fertilization). Hybrids thus produced through selective and non-selective fertilization were tested in moisture stress environment during post rainy season. The hybrids obtained through selective fertilization produced significantly higher mean grain yield compared to hybrids obtained through non-selective fertilization. The results indicate that selective fertilization through in vivo pollen selection using PEG as selective agent was effective in improving moisture stress tolerance of the progeny in sorghum genotypes studied. Further, the pollen selection also had influence on plant height, panicle length, panicle width, panicle weight and grain mass. Thus, the pollen selection had a significant effect on grain yield through its components and developmentally related traits. Pollen selection for osmotic stress tolerance in sorghum influences the growth and vigour of the plants resulting in superior progeny in moisture stress environment. The analysis of individual crosses indicated that pollen genotype selection was able to favour performance of the progeny. However, the pollen selection had positive effect in majority of the hybrids and the study demonstrates the transmission of the selected trait from pollen generation to progeny.",Moisture stress; Osmotic agent; Pollen selection; Selective fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142123061

Based on a survey of 17 interspecific hybrid combinations, consisting of 119 genotypes, it was found that the F1 hybrids of Chilean-Brazilian species mostly produced first division restitution (FDR) 2n gametes. These F1 hybrids were self-pollinated in order to obtain F2 seeds, which was an indication that the F1 plants also produced 2n eggs simultaneously. All the F2 progeny plants were typical allotetraploids, most of which formed 16 bivalents and a small proportion formed multivalents during metaphase I stages of meiosis. Through genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) it was proved that multivalent formation in F2 plants, derived from A. inodora x A. pelegrina hybrid, was due to homoeologous recombination but not from reciprocal translocations. In order to test the segregation pattern of the recombinant chromosomes, an F3 population from one genotype, P6C49-6, was investigated.

It was concluded that in allopolyploids of Alstroemeria, bilateral sexual polyploidisation could accomplish genetic recombination by both homoeologous crossing-over as well as through the assortment of chromosomes.",Alstroemeria; Genomic in situ hybridisation; Homoeologous recombination; Interspecific hybridisation; Unreduced gametes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141615490

(Moraceae), a critically endangered species distributed in the Bonin Islands of Japan, we need to distinguish between pure M. boninensis and hybrid (M. boninensis x M. acidosa Griff.) seedlings within populations derived from M. boninensis mother trees. Therefore, we developed three co-dominant SCAR (Sequence Characterized Amplified Region) markers to distinguish between M. boninensis, M. acidosa and their hybrids. All three markers could clearly identify the species and the hybrids, although we observed one case of a putative null allele or a backcross at one locus (Mos0251-l). Hence, we suggest that pure and hybrid seedlings could be unambiguously identified by the simultaneous use of the three markers. When we investigated a seedling population produced by a single mother tree growing in the Iguma-bay population of Haha-jima Island, the proportion of embryos formed by pollination from M. acidosa pollen was about 13%. All hybrid seedlings identified according to the molecular markers showed incisions in their leaves, a morphological character that has never been observed in pure M. boninensis individuals. Our results suggest that M. boninensis can potentially be multiply by excluding hybrids from the seedling pools, using incisions on the leaves as morphological markers to identify them.",Bonin Islands; Endangered species; Hybridization; Morus acidosa; Morus boninensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141503906

Significant improvements in seed yield of the selected AberDart over the unselected AberElan were observed both in individual plants grown in the glasshouse and in field plots. Detailed observations of the individual components of seed yield showed that the increased seed yield of AberDart can be attributed to a higher proportion of ovules forming seeds (% seedset), greater seed number per tiller and more reproductive tillers per plant. This improvement in seed yield of AberDart was also observed when it was grown in field plots with AberElan, experimental selection lines and commercial varieties.

In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), two such nucleases (Bnuc1 and BEN1) were individually identified in unrelated tissues. In the present work, we demonstrate that their genes are also expressed in immature anthers at different stages of pollen development. Further experiments carried out on RNA extracted from immature barley anthers led to discover a novel endonuclease gene, namely Bnuc2 (AJ311603 in the EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases), eventually found up-regulated at the tetrad stage. The protein encoded was found to conserve large sequence portions of Bnuc1 and BEN1 endonucleases, including the domain regions involved in secretion and DNA/RNA binding. A survey conducted on barley EST libraries showed that Bnuc2 and BEN1 mRNAs are jointly present also in the transcriptome of 20 DAP spike and that other endonuclease ESTs are co-expressed with Bnuc1 or BEN1 in tissues where PCD has been recorded. Therefore, it can be concluded that during the PCD process, a set of S1-type endonucleases is synthesised regardless of the tissue considered. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

As a result of this scarcity, fruit and seed set under natural conditions were significantly lower compared to hand-pollination treatments. The main flower visitors were mostly flies and blowflies, with Eristalis tenax (Syrphidae) and Calliphora vicina (Calliphoridae) being the most efficient pollinators.

Pollination of crops depends on local agricultural management and the quality of adjacent habitats. Lowland coffee Coffea canephora, is an important tropical cash crop. Fruit set depends on cross-pollination by bees, so inadequate pollination leads to reduced yield. In this study we analyse the relationship between bee pollinators, fruit set in coffee, and the local and regional agroforestry systems to identify the optimal conditions for pollinators. 2. We analysed the abundance and species composition of coffee flower-visiting bees in 15 agroforestry systems differing in distance to forest (important for wood-nesting species), light intensity (important for ground-nesting species), blossom cover of coffee and noncoffee-flowering plants, and species richness of flowering plants (as pollen and nectar resources) in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). We examined which factors were most important for optimal pollination success. We carried out bagged and open pollination experiments in each agroforestry system, to measure the pollination efficiency of 15 bee species. 3. The number of social bee species decreased with distance to forest, whereas the number of solitary bee species increased with light intensity (less shade) and greater quantities of blossoms. 4. Fruit set of open pollinated flowers (as opposed to manually cross-pollinated flowers) increased with the diversity and abundance of flower-visiting bees. In the agroforestry systems studied, a bee community of 20 species or more led to a higher fruit set (95%) than a species-poor bee community of six species (70% fruit set). 5. Pollination activity by members of the species-rich solitary bee assemblage led to higher levels of fruit set than that arising from pollination activity by members of the more abundant social bee assemblage. 6. Synthesis and applications. A species-rich and abundant bee assemblage will facilitate high pollination success in lowland coffee. This will increase fruit set and coffee yield. Farmers can encourage different species of bees through simple management measures such as growing coffee in shade beneath a variety of trees; by pruning trees to increase levels of sunlight and numbers of flowering herbs; and by increasing the availability of nesting sites for solitary bees. Weed control and the use of herbicides should be kept to a minimum so that a diverse nectar and pollen resource is available to bees throughout the year. Natural forests and forest fragments should be preserved in the vicinity of coffee agroforestry systems (< 500 m) so that forest-nesting social bees can travel easily to the coffee fields to pollinate the flowers.",Agroforestry systems; Bees; Indonesia; Isolation; Lowland coffee; Pollinator limitation; Shade effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141501987

Using microsatellite markers, we conducted a genetic analysis of space use and resource sharing at several spatial scales among workers of two ecologically dissimilar bumble bee species (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) foraging in an urban landscape (London, UK). At fine scales, the relatedness of workers visiting small patches of flowers did not differ significantly from zero. Therefore, colonies shared flower patches randomly with other colonies, suggesting that worker scent-marks deterring visits to unrewarding flowers have not evolved as signals benefiting nestmates. To investigate space use at intermediate scales, we developed a program based on Thomas & Hill's maximum likelihood sibship reconstruction method to estimate the number of colonies utilizing single sites. The average number of colonies (95% confidence limits) sending workers to forage at sites of ? 1 ha in area was 96 colonies (84-118) in B. terrestris and 66 colonies (61-76) in B. pascuorum. These values are surprisingly high and suggested that workers travelled far from their colonies to visit the sites. At the landscape scale, there was little or no genetic differentiation between sites. We conclude that urban habitats support large bumble bee populations and are potentially valuable in terms of bumble bee conservation. In addition, bumble bee-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-bumble bee conservation requires landscape-scale action.",Bombus; Foraging ecology; Microsatellite; Plant-pollinator relationship; Relatedness; Social insect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141613133

We tested the hypothesis that two rare South African orchid taxa Brownleea galpinii ssp. major (nectar-producing) and Disa cephalotes ssp. cephalotes (non-rewarding) are mimics of the nectar-producing flowers of a relatively common species, Scabiosa columbaria (Dipsacaceae), with which they always occur sympatrically. Flowers of the orchids were apparently unscented and had similar dimensions and almost identical spectral reflectance to the flowers of Scabiosa. The orchids were pollinated exclusively by long-proboscid flies (Tabanidae and Nemestrinidae) that feed mainly on nectar in Scabiosa flowers. Choice experiments showed that these flies did not discriminate between the orchids and Scabiosa when alighting on their flat-topped inflorescences. However, flies were not attracted to related orchids dissimilar to Scabiosa, or to inflorescences of B. galpinii that had been artificially reconstructed in the shape of a spike, rather than a flat-topped capitulum. A phylogenetic analysis showed traits that give the orchids a resemblance to Scabiosa, such as a flattopped inflorescence and cream floral colouration with dark spots and short spurs, to be mostly apomorphic features, and therefore likely to be relatively recent adaptations for mimicry. We caution that the term mimic should not be applied to species whose resemblance to another species is due entirely to plesiomorphic traits that, in all likelihood, evolved prior to the ecological association. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Advergent evolution; Batesian; Choice experiment; Deceptive pollination; Long-proboscid fly; Mimicry; Orchidaceae; Phylogeny; Pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142126796

Much effort has been dedicated to marking the sexual types of papaya at the seedling stage to distinguish hermaphroditic from female papayas. A hermaphroditic papaya mutant (SR*) has been obtained, derived from the 'Sunrise' papaya cultivar mutant. Self-pollination of the mutant resulted in all progenies being hermaphroditic. The genotype of the female was lethal, as a result of a lethal gene being linked to the mm female gene complex in this case. However, a 3:1 segregation ratio was obtained from the progeny of the hermaphroditic cultivar 'Thailand' crossed with SR*, indicating that all genotypes survived. Homozygous genotypes (M2M2) would be lethal according to Storey's model. Randomly selected F1 plants of the 'Thailand' SR* combination were self-pollinated to obtain an F 2 generation. The F2 segregation ratio suggested that the SR* mutant had a different form of the M2 allele, now designated as M@, which allowed the dominant M@M 2 to survive in cross combinations.

This zone is detected in maturing and mature pollen grains and has not been found in any other tissue. ADH-P is detected by electrophoresis in a neutral medium (at pH 7.0-7.2). In an alkaline medium (pH &gt; 8), protein ADH-P is completely inactivated, whereas protein ADH1 retains its activity. ADH-P is a modified variant of the major protein ADH1. Both alleles of the main structural gene (Adh1-F and Adh1-S) undergo modification. The pollen of an FS heterozygote has two variants of the modified enzyme: ADH-P S and ADH-P F. Analysis of segregation in F 2 offsprings and test crosses has confirmed that this character is controlled by the only gene Adh-P with allelic variants Adh-P+ (the presence of the modified ADH protein in the pollen) and Adh-P- (the normal protein). Allele Adh-P+ is transmitted through female gametes at a normal frequency (about 1) and through male gametes at a decreased frequency (0.2-0.6), the mean frequency being about 0.4. The frequency of the transmission of allele Adh-P+ through male gametes depends on the genotype of the female parent and the conditions of pollination. Cytoembryological study of microsporogenesis in the Adh-P+/Adh-P- heterozygotes demonstrated an absence of any disturbances in the formation of microspores and pollen grains. Some differences in the formation of pollen tubes on an artificial medium have been observed. It is assumed that the differences between the Adh-P+ and Adh-P- microgametophytes manifest themselves at the progamic phase of fertilization.

(Verbenaceae) from other plant scents. The relative importance of floral scent vs. color was also studied. Butterfly foraging behavior was measured as probing with proboscis. This probing, on floral models varying in scent and color, was timed. When given a choice of floral and vegetative scents of L. camara, newly emerged butterflies preferred floral scent, indicating an innate response to floral scents. When butterflies were conditioned to L. camara floral scent by offering the scent with yellow color and sugar water, yellow color elicited stronger feeding responses than did the floral scent. However, the floral scent of L. camara was preferred to that of the novel species Philadelphus coronarius L. (Hydrangiaceae). The floral scent of L. camara was dominated by tepenoid compounds, while that of P coronarius by fatty acid derivatives, thus demonstrating totally different compositions.

Our results indicate that populations of A. blepharocalyx have two floral morphs, which differ in flowering behaviour: the cataflexistylous morph in which the stigma is held erect above the dehiscent anther when anthesis begins in the morning and becomes curved under the anther at afternoon, and the anaflexistylous morph in which the receptive stigma is curved under the indehiscent anther first and moves into a reflexed superior position above the anther as it begins to shed pollen in the afternoon; the flowering period of both floral morphs is 12 hours; the stylar movements in the two floral morphs are synchronous, and they have similar traits to those found in other Alpinia species previously reported. Also, on average, cataflexistylous flowers are larger than anaflexistylous flowers, especially the labellum and corolla tube length; moreover, the P/O ratio of the two floral morphs is significantly different: the cataflexistylous morph has more pollen grains and fewer ovules than the anaflexistylous morph; the evolutionary significance of this comparison is discussed. Cataflexistylous flowers were observed to produce a lower concentration of nectar than that of anaflexistylous flowers before 11:00 a.m., but they then have higher nectar concentration; cataflexistylous flowers always have more nectar than anaflexistylous flowers. Flowers of A. blepharocalyx were visited by fewer insects at a lower frequency, including honey bees (Apis cerana cerana) and two species of carpenter bees (Xylocopa spp.). No significant differences were found in the fruit set among the hand-pollination treatments regardless of selfing (geitonogamy and autogamy) or crossing (intermorph and intramorph); but all hand-pollination treatments exhibited much higher fruit set than the controls; meanwhile, no fruit set occurred in the unpollinated bagged plants. Pollen tube growth was examined using fluorescence microscopy following self, intramorph, and intermorph hand pollinations at different times of the day; the pollen tubes of both floral morphs have the same growth rate and the capability to reach the ovary. Both the results of pollen tube growth and fruit sets under different pollination conditions show that A. blepharocalyx is self-compatible and dependent upon insects for pollination. The distinctive flexistyly mechanism of A. blepharocalyx is likely a floral mechanism that promotes effective intermorph pollen transfer.",Alpinia blepharocalyx; Flexistyly; Floral biology; Nectar secretion; Pollen tube growth; Pollination; Zingiberaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242592157

Using a Y-tube olfactometer, we tested ant response to odours emitted by different types of figs (receptive female, ripe female or male figs) and by fig wasps (pollinators or non-pollinators). We demonstrate that ants were significantly attracted only to odours emitted by pollinators, either alone or associated with odours of male figs (releasing wasps).

Action spectrum of light for this tropism was found similar to those for the phototropism shown in coleoptiles of monocotyledonous plants. Image analysis of pistil and stamen indicates that elongation and bending does not proceed uniformly over those organs.

Although pollen tube growth is clearly affected by temperature, little information is available on its effect on the female side and on flower receptivity. In this work, the effect of temperature has been evaluated on stigmatic receptivity of sweet cherry in vivo, in the laboratory, and in planta, in the field. Results herein show that temperature has a clear effect on the duration of stigmatic receptivity. Thus, whereas high temperature reduced stigmatic receptivity, low temperature enlarged it. The stigma lost the capacity to offer support first for pollen penetration, second for pollen germination and, finally, for pollen adhesion. The effect of temperature was more pronounced on pollen germination and penetration than on pollen adhesion. High temperature reduced the germination capacity of the pollen as early as the first day after anthesis, a time when no apparent signs of stigma degeneration are apparent. This clear effect of temperature on stigmatic receptivity and pollen performance may have clear implication in crop performance and in establishing screening criteria of best-adapted genotypes.",Female receptivity; Gametophyte; Pollen performance; Reproductive phase; Sporophyte; Temperature stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142039879

The effects of the size of the treatment area (analogous to initial weed population), germination fraction and degree of self-pollination in the weed were investigated. The results indicate that the probability of developing resistance to one or both herbicides decreases as the size of the area/initial population decreases. For treatment areas of 100 ha or less with an initial weed seedbank of 100 seeds m -2 and initial frequencies of the resistance genes of 10 -6, development of resistance to both herbicides (double-resistance) is uncommon within 50 years for all types of weeds if both herbicides are used in all years (used in combination). If herbicides are used in alternate years (rotated) double-resistance almost always occurs in 100 ha areas but is uncommon in areas of 1 ha or less.

To identify which compounds in a floral scent are more attractive and, thus, of biological importance to foraging butterflies, we applied electrophysiological methods. Antennal responses of male and female adults of the tropical butterfly Heliconius melpomene L. (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae) to individual compounds of natural floral scents and synthetic floral scent mixtures were investigated using gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD). The natural floral scents included those of two tropical plant species, Lantana camara L. (Verbenaceae) and Warszewiczia coccinea (Vahl) KI. (Rubiaceae), and two temperate species, Buddleja davidii Franchet (Loganiaceae) and Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Asteraceae). The two synthetic floral scent mixtures contained many of the compounds found in the natural scents, but all in equal quantities. Compounds both present in relatively high abundance in the floral scents and detected exclusively in the floral parts of the plant, such as linalool, linalool oxide (furanoid) I and II, oxoisophoroneoxide, and phenylacetaldehyde, elicited the strongest antennal responses, suggesting that they may reflect adaptations by the plant to attract butterfly pollinators. However, other compounds also present in high abundance in the floral scent, but detected in the vegetative as well as floral plant parts, either elicited strong antennal responses, such as trans-?-ocimene and benzaldehyde, or failed to elicit antennal responses, such as the sesquiterpenes ?-caryophyllene and ?-humulene from L. camara. The most volatile monoterpene alkenes in the synthetic scent mixtures elicited only low or no responses. Furthermore, the overall antennal responses were stronger in females than in males. The findings suggest that several floral scent volatiles, especially those of exclusively floral origin, are of high biological significance to H. melpomene butterflies.

Although the effects of intrinsic selection on hybrid fitness are well known, less is understood about extrinsic fitness variation. At Tiryal Dag, northeast Turkey, Rhododendron x sochadzeae (R. ponticum x caucasicum) forms large populations in which neither segregation nor backcrossing occur, in habitats intermediate between those of its parents. Using single-copy species-specific random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter simple sequence repeat markers, it was determined that most or all R. x sochadzeae plants are F1s, and that there are many separate genets present. Hand pollination and germination experiments showed that R. x sochadzeae plants can produce viable seed of F2s or backcrosses in either direction. Furthermore, adult backcrosses have been observed in habitats atypical for R. x sochadzeae. From this, all non-F1 hybrid derivatives appear to be eliminated in the hybrid zone at Tiryal Dag as a result of postgermination selection. This absence of post-F1 hybrid derivatives apparently prevents introgression. This type of hybrid population is here termed an F 1-dominated hybrid zone (F1DZ), and also occurs in Encelia. The observed dominance of F1s within a narrow habitat range is best explained by habitat-mediated superiority of F1s over all other genotype classes. Therefore, habitat-mediated selection against the second hybrid generation might be preventing interspecific gene flow in R. x sochadzeae. F1DZ formation is postu-lated to require the formation of F1s in quantity, habitat-mediated superiority in F1s, and highly specific habitat conditions.",Extrinsic fitness; F1 advantage; Hybrid breakdown; Hybrid zones; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141613130

Numerous studies have reported detrimental effects of agrochemical sprays on pollination, fruit set, and yield in tree fruit crops. However, effects of fungicides on pollen germination and growth in almond are little known, particularly those from recently developed active ingredients. In this study we evaluated the effects of commercial formulations of 10 fungicides on pollen germination and tube growth in almond using in vitro assays. Assays conducted at 1/100 recommended field rates (RFR) were effective in delineating differences in almond pollen sensitivity to different fungicides. Captan and azoxystrobin were the most inhibitory, with germination percentages of less than 1% of the no-fungicide control. Germination was not significantly affected by propiconazole and benomyl. Intermediate inhibitory effects on pollen germination were observed with ziram, cyprodinil, maneb, thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, and myclobutanil. In contrast to germination, tube growth was less affected by the presence of fungicide. In pollen that germinated, tube elongation was the same as in controls in five of 10 of the fungicides evaluated. Nonetheless, azoxystrobin and captan reduced tube elongation by ?90%. Some fungicide treatments also influenced tube morphology. In the absence of field evaluation studies, in vitro germination data may provide insight on how specific chemicals may impact pollination processes and further guide in vivo studies, particularly in the case of new chemical formulations.",Pollen tube morphology; Prunus dulcis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345447620

Endosperm of eight hybrids generated by reciprocal crosses and their seven inbred parents were sampled at three developmental stages: 10, 14, and 21 days after pollination (DAP). These samples were subjected to GeneCalling, an open-ended mRNA-profiling technology, which simultaneously analyzes thousands of genes. Results indicated that the overall level of gene expression in the maize endosperm was dosage-dependent, that is, the gene expression was proportional to the parental genome contribution of 2n maternal : 1n paternal. However, approximately 8% of the genes deviated from such allelic additive expression and exhibited differential expression in hybrids of reciprocal crosses, resembling either maternally or paternally expressed genes. There were more genes with maternal-like expression (MLE) than those with paternal-like expression (PLE). Allele-specific expression analysis of four selected genes using the WAVE denaturing HPLC (dHPLC) system revealed several mechanisms responsible for the deviation from the allelic additive expression in the hybrid endosperm: heterochronic allelic variation, allelic variation in the level of expression, and genomic imprinting. We discovered a novel imprinted gene no-apical-meristem (NAM) related protein1 (nrp1) that was expressed only in the endosperm and regulated by gene-specific imprinting.

One hundred twenty proteins differing in kinetics of appearance were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. These analyses provided peptide mass fingerprint data that identified 84 of them. Some of these proteins had previously been shown to accumulate during seed development in legumes (e.g. legumins, vicilins, convicilins, and lipoxygenases), confirming the validity of M. truncatula as a model for analysis of legume seed filling. The study also revealed proteins presumably involved in cell division during embryogenesis (?-tubulin and annexin). Their abundance decreased before the accumulation of the major storage protein families, which itself occurs in a specific temporal order: vicilins (14 d after pollination [DAP]), legumins (16 DAP), and convicilins (18 DAP). Furthermore, the study showed an accumulation of enzymes of carbon metabolism (e.g. sucrose synthase, starch synthase) and of proteins involved in embryonic photosynthesis (e.g. chlorophyll a/b binding), which may play a role in providing cofactors for protein/lipid synthesis or for CO2 refixation during seed filling.

Because the purpose of the flower is to facilitate pollination, it often is abscised after fertilization. We have identified an Arabidopsis ethylene-sensitive mutant, inflorescence deficient in abscission (ida), in which floral organs remain attached to the plant body after the shedding of mature seeds, even though a floral abscission zone develops. The IDA gene, positioned in the genomic DNA flanking the single T-DNA present in the ida line, was identified by complementation. The gene encodes a small protein with an N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that the IDA protein is the ligand of an unknown receptor involved in the developmental control of floral abscission. We have identified Arabidopsis genes, and cDNAs from a variety of plant species, that encode similar proteins, which are distinct from known ligands.

The resultant component cells are rich in protein. Since flowers of pseudopollen-forming species generally lack nectar, it is probable that pseudopollen gradually replaced nectar as the pollinator reward. However, direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. The present paper examines the labellar micromorphology of five Brazilian species of Maxillaria assigned to the M. discolor alliance. The flowers of two of these species, namely M. violaceopunctata and M. villosa, produce both food hairs and a lipoidal, labellar secretion which is rich in aromatic amino acids. Moreover, in the case of M. violaceopunctata, the secretion was found to contain reducing sugars. This may represent an intermediate stage in the transition from nectar-producing to pseudopollen-forming flowers.

At the time of fruit production, female inflorescences were 2.6 times heavier than at flowering with developing fruit six times heavier than flowers. In addition to the increase in biomass allocated to structures associated with the provisioning and dissemination of seed, support structures (main and side stalks) were also heavier. As a result of this additional investment of resources at the time of fruit production, the reproductive effort (RE) of female plants was much higher than that of males: 37% of above ground biomass compared with 21% for males. Differences in RE did not change with plant size; however, allocation to reproduction appeared to be a constant proportion of biomass over nearly all plant sizes sampled.

While variation in tracheid length in white spruce is well known, estimates of genetic control over that trait as well as its relationships with growth traits and other wood characteristics have not yet been reported. Thus, the objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the extent of the differences in tracheid length among 30-year-old white spruce open-pollinated families; (2) to estimate the narrow sense heritability at both the individual and family levels for tracheid length; and (3) to estimate the phenotypic, genetic, and family mean correlations between height, diameter, volume, and wood specific gravity. We have shown that more than 90% of the variation in tracheid length is due to differences among trees within family plots. Heritabilities at both the family and the individual levels are low, so significant genetic gain could only be obtained from selection and vegetative propagation of the trees with the longest tracheids. Tracheid length in white spruce is negatively correlated to growth traits but appears to be independent of wood specific gravity.

Decisions to deregulate Bt crops in the USA have relied strongly on arguments that these crops will not interbreed with wild relatives in the permitted growing regions. Limited attention therefore has been directed to analyses of the consequences of gene flow. To provide a transparent evaluation process for risks associated with insecticidal transgene escape, we crafted a series of questions designed to guide this aspect of the risk assessment. We then explored the current knowledge base available for answering such risk-related questions for three Bt crops (cotton, rapeseed, and rice). First, we generated a list of wild relatives of these crops. A definitive list of potential transgene recipients is not yet possible for some crops. Sufficient data are not available for some crops to eliminate certain related plant species from consideration of fertile hybrid formation, thus making lists for these crops subject to speculation. Second, we queried the HOSTS database (UK) to obtain a worldwide listing of lepidopteran species that feed on these crops and their wild relatives, and to determine the host range of the larvae. To our knowledge, this list of 502 lepidopteran species is the first such list published for these crops and wild crop relatives. Third, we used a data set maintained by the Canadian Forest Service to assess Bt toxin susceptibility for these lepidopterans. Only 3% of those species have been tested for susceptibility; and the literature suggests that generalizations about susceptibility among taxa are difficult due to the variability within families. Fourth, we consulted the literature to interpret what is known about the ability of lepidopterans to regulate plant fitness or invasiveness. We could not eliminate the possibility of ecological release due to plant resistance against lepidopterans. In fact, there is strong experimental evidence that lepidopteran herbivores do limit the distribution and/or abundances of at least some wild plant species. Neither could we eliminate the possibility that non-target lepidopterans might have important functions in the ecosystem as pollinators or alternate hosts to natural enemies of pest species. This study suggests that crucial data are lacking for the development of a credible scientific basis to confirm or deny environmental risks associated with the escape of Bt transgene constructs to wild relatives. Given the absence of information on the identity, level of susceptibility, and ecological roles of lepidopterans exploiting specific wild relatives of Bt crops, we suggest that new efforts be directed to assessing possible consequences of lepidopteran mortality on resistant wild relatives.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-11244267003

Significant variation among the tristaminate forms, both in stamen morphology and stamen position with respect to the perianth parts, indicates that stamen reduction from six to three has occurred more than once, and possibly several times within Dypsis. A few species include teratological forms with zygomorphic flowers; for example, Dypsis lantzeana normally possesses three antesepalous stamens, but in some specimens only the median outer (abaxial) stamen is expressed, perhaps indicating incipient zygomorphy correlated with complex synorganization. Inclusion of earlier historic genera such as Neophloga and Chrysalidocarpus within a broadly circumscribed Dypsis appears to be justified, although the informal taxonomic groupings within Dypsis require review, in particular the taxonomic significance of the different types of anther morphology. The discovery here that adnation of staminodes to the pistillode (complex syn-organization) occurs in species other than D. mirabilis opens further questions about the taxonomic utility of this character in Dypsis, in which stamen/staminode development and adnation are apparently unusually labile. Such androecial-gynoecial adnation is otherwise rare in palms, as also in other monocots, in which probably the best-known example occurs in orchids. Septal nectaries are present in some, but not all, staminate flowers in species of Dypsis. Dypsis bejofo is exceptional in that in staminate flowers the pistillode is distally bulbous and bears three prominent modified supralocular septal nectaries. Female (pistillate) flowers in Dypsis are syncarpous, normally pseudomonomerous (as in many other Arecoideae), and possess septal nectaries that effectively delimit the carpel margins and indicate insect pollination.

We evaluated the hypothesis that differential selective pressures act together with restricted among-population gene flow result in genetically divergent populations of A. aurea. Study sites were located within Nahuel Huapi National Park (41°8'S, 71°19'W) at two mountain ranges and two different elevations. These were Chall Huaco Valley, a pristine site, with populations at 1,250 and 1,100 m, respectively, and Cerro Otto, a disturbed site, with populations at 1,250 and 950 m, respectively. Seeds at each of the four populations were harvested from 20, 1 x 1 m plots. These seeds were counted, weighed, and germinated after a cold and humid stratification for 4 months. Within- and between-mountain ranges differences in seed traits were evaluated by ANOVA. We genetically characterized 30 plants of each population by allozyme electrophoresis and estimated levels of genetic variation and divergence. Seed traits showed different responses to elevation and site conditions. Total number of seeds was greater at low-elevation populations even though they had a higher number of undeveloped seeds. Reduced seed yield at high-elevation populations may result from a short growing season at higher altitudes. Additionally, seed weight, germination rates, and early vegetative spread were significantly greater at Otto, which may suggest a selective strategy to colonize disturbed sites under favorable physical conditions. These between-site differences were supported by allozyme data. High genetic divergence, and thus low gene flow, was estimated among Otto and Chall Huaco whereas within each mountain range among-population divergence depended upon site characteristics.

A total of 43,776 F1 plants were generated by using Robertson's Mutator (Mu) pollen parents and self-pollinated to establish a library of transposon-mutagenized seed. The frequency of new seed mutants was between 10-4 and 10-5 per F1 plant. As a service to the maize community, maize-targeted mutagenesis selects insertions in genes of interest from this library by using the PCR. Pedigree, knockout, sequence, phenotype, and other information is stored in a powerful interactive database (maize-targeted mutagenesis database) that enables analysis of the entire population and the handling of knockout requests. By inhibiting Mu activity in most F1 plants, we sought to reduce somatic insertions that may cause false positives selected from pooled tissue. By monitoring the remaining Mu activity in the F2, however, we demonstrate that seed phenotypes depend on it, and false positives occur in lines that appear to lack it. We conclude that more than half of all mutations arising in this population are suppressed on losing Mu activity. These results have implications for epigenetic models of inbreeding and for functional genomics.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141593573

Such exotic hybrid seedlings have now been found in the wild adjacent to plantations at three locations. The proportion of exotic hybrids in open-pollinated seed collected from nearby mature E. ovata was 5.5%. This level compares with only 0.4% for natural hybrids between native species at these sites (E. ovata, E. viminalis and E. rodwayi). Detection of hybrids was initially based on their deviant morphology, which was generally intermediate between parental species. This subjective classification was then successfully verified by morphometric and allozyme analyses. Pure E. nitens seedlings (wildlings) were restricted to within 30 m of these plantations, whereas established hybrids were found up to 310 m from the plantations. This pattern of establishment reflects dispersal of exotic seed and pollen respectively. It is likely that the recent expansion of the eucalypt plantation estate in Australia will cause an increase in the frequency of exotic hybrids.

Airborne pollen was monitored with Rotorod traps located inside and outside the seed orchard. There was no time gap in the onset of flowering between the earliest female and male strobili in 1992. Female flowering began 3 days earlier than male flowering in 1993, and the earliest strobili were probably pollinated by pollen transported long distance from more southerly areas. The almost simultaneous peak in pollen occurrence inside the seed orchard and in surrounding pine stands indicates that the seed orchard clones are not temporally isolated from sources of contamination. However, pollen concentrations inside the seed orchard were higher than those in the surrounding stands.

This progeny trial was replicated on three sites in central Alberta, Canada. At six years from seeds, there was statistically significant variation for height, branch length to height ratio and needle length. On individual test sites, values of individual-tree heritability for height ranged from 0.20 to 0.35, whereas values of heritability for family means ranged from 0.41 to 0.59. These low to moderate heritabilities suggest that a combination of family and within-family selection would be effective in improving height growth for this population on individual sites. Across sites, values of individual-tree heritability for height ranged from 0.03 to 0.06, whereas values for heritability of family means ranged from 0.17 to 0.29. These low heritabilities across sites were due to high genotype by environment (GE) interaction. Analysis showed that 87% to 99% of the GE interaction was due to lack of genetic correlation among sites. Heterogeneity of the genetic variance among test sites contributed 1% to 13% of the GE interaction. This shows that families in this population of Scots pine are not broadly adapted and are therefore suitable only for a site-specific breeding programme.

Here we show that the Arabidopsis WD-40 domain protein MSI1 is present together with MEA and FIE in a 600 kDa complex and interacts directly with FIE. Mutant plants heterozygous for msi1 show a seed abortion ratio of 50% with seeds aborting when the mutant allele is maternally inherited, irrespective of a paternal wild-type or mutant MSI1 allele. Furthermore, msi1 mutant gametophytes initiate endosperm development in the absence of fertilization at a high penetrance. After pollination, only the egg cell becomes fertilized, the central cell starts dividing prior to fertilization, resulting in the formation of seeds containing embryos surrounded by diploid endosperm.

Sixteen open-pollinated families from each of three pine taxa - genetically improved loblolly pine (PTI; Pinus taeda), improved slash pine (PEI; Pinus elliottii var. elliottii), and unimproved slash pine (PEU) - were planted in two locations under a common split-split plot experimental design in north Florida. At each site, two levels of silvicultural treatments (low intensity - no fertilization; high intensity - fertilization and weed control) were implemented. Vector analysis suggested that N, P, and K were nutrients mostly commonly limiting growth, while Mg and Ca were generally not deficient for the three taxa over four different sampling periods during the growing season. The period of highest nutrient demand occurred during the growing season from June to September, with deficiencies easing throughout the remainder of the year. Differential family responses in foliar nutrient levels (especially N and P) were closely associated with current-year foliage biomass production and annual height growth for the three taxa. PTI and PEI families with constant, but minor, foliar N and P deficiencies during the growing season had higher foliage biomass production and height increments than those exhibiting excess, dilution, or severe deficiency. PEU families generally had lower nutrient requirements than PTI and PEI families. Differences in nutrient demand for growth existed between PEU and PEI. Differences between PEI and PEU in foliar nutrient response to intensive management from this study, along with findings in growth performance and crown structure, suggested that PEI had growth strategies more closely aligned with PTA than with PEU. Significant intra-specific differences in growth and nutritional characteristics also indicated that family forestry could be a viable option suited for intensive plantation management because family-specific fertilizer prescriptions may be needed to further improve stand growth. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

G. quinquenervis is epiphytic, and its flowers have osmophores, glands that produce aromatic volatiles, that are collected by males of Euglossini (Hymenoptera, Apidae). Every flower of an inflorescence opened simultaneously, however, overlaps in floral phases between individuals were low. Pollinaria deposition on the stigma caused immediate wilting of the perianth, while pollinaria removal had no influence on flower longevity. The reproductive system experiments showed that the species is self-compatible. The characteristics of floral morphology and its highly specialized pollination mechanism are efficient in limiting autogamy and geitonogamy and favouring cross-pollination. Three species of Euglosso were found (E. cordata, E. perpulchra and an undescribed species) visiting the flowers of C. quinquenervis. All these efficiently removed the pollinaria of the flowers, which adhered to the posterior margin of the scutellum. Even though there was a high pollinaria removal rate by pollinators, the reproductive success in the field was extraordinarily low. We suggest that low fruit set, despite high pollinator frequency, is a result of a combination of the particular phonological characteristics of C. quinquenervis, such as short flower longevity and low overlap of flowering phases between individuals, leading to the reduced population of this orchid in the degraded Atlantic Forest. Conservation measures are necessary to guarantee the survival of C. quinquenervis in the northern part of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.",Euglossini; Floral longevity; Gongora quinquenervis; Pollination; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345149799

The study aimed at estimating the level of outcrossing provided by the insects, using flower colour as the marker. The yellow-flowered genotype produced less seeds per pod, and tended to set less pods per raceme, than the purple-flowered genotype, although flower tripping by the bees was higher in the former genotype within four days from insect introduction. By examining the frequencies of flower colour classes in the insect-pollinated progenies of the two genotypes (in comparison with selfed, S1 progenies of the same genotypes, previously obtained), we estimated the proportion of actual cross-pollination to be about 70%, thus incomplete and in line with previous investigations.

Unexploded flowers (intact flowers) produced no fruit, implying that autonomous selfing and apomixis do not occur and that the explosion of flowers by insects is necessary for the fertilization of flowers. The fruit set in the natural condition was intermediate between that in artificial selfing or exploding and that in artificial outcrossing. Seed set and the ratio of seeds to ovules did not differ significantly between the natural condition and artificial outcrossing. The fruit set by a single flower visit from Apis mellifera was similar to natural conditions. Apis mellifera was the most frequent visitor and the number of flowers tripped open per hour was the highest among all the flower visitors. Approximately 75% of pollen on a flower disappeared in a single flower visit by A. mellifera. The small amount of pollen remaining on already-exploded flowers appears to be the reason why A. mellifera do not frequently visit already-exploded flowers. The higher seed set by outcrossing was believed to contribute to the seed set in both natural conditions and single flower visits by A. mellifera, and did not differ between them. Therefore, at least in Japan, A. mellifera appears to be the most important pollinator for C. scoparius, resulting in a high outcrossing rate with each single flower visit.",Apis mellifera; Cytisus scoparius; Fruit set; Seed set; Single flower visit,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142010153

Pollinators include large matinal bees (predominantly Ptilothrix tricolor and Megachile sp.) and hummingbirds (Chlorostilbon aureoventris and Heliomaster furcifer). Hummingbirds rarely visit other local Opuntias. Hummingbirds, which are more common in the afternoon, prefer female flowers whereas bees prefer hermaphroditic flowers. Female flowers have more dilute nectar than hermaphroditic flowers. Under experimental conditions female fertility is as high as that of hermaphrodites, however, seeds from females always result from cross-pollination and from more severe ovule selection (ovule number is higher in female flowers). Under natural conditions female plants are reproductively more successful than hermaphrodites.

In contrast to previous studies we found no difference in global species richness between wind- and biotically pollinated sister clades. Regarding phenology, we found wider phenological spread in biotically pollinated clades, earlier flowering onset in wind-pollinated trees, but no difference in duration of flowering between pollination modes.

The number of insects per 1000 available flowers was counted for the four main pollinators: honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees, and Diptera. Additionally, on 'Falcon'/'Falcon pat' the foraging behaviour of the main pollinating insects, i.e., honeybees and bumblebees, was observed (number of flowers visited per min, foraging postures, intervariety flights). A pleiotropic effect could affect nectar and pollen production, therefore we measured nectar volume, nectar sugar concentration, and composition for the four plant genotypes, and on 'Falcon' and 'Falcon pat' pollen production was also estimated. The diversity and density of the foraging insect population observed on the transgenic genotypes were similar to that on the non-transgenic controls. Moreover, the foraging behaviour strategy was similar on 'Falcon' and 'Falcon pat', and honeybees flew indifferently across these two genotypes. No difference was found in nectar and pollen between the genotypes.

Ficus species have a highly species-specific pollination mutualism with agaonid wasps. Therefore, the identification of cases in which breakdown in this sophisticated system occurs and the circumstances under which it happens is of interest. Various studies have confirmed that Ficus species are able to hybridize and that pollinator-specificity breakdown can occur under certain conditions. This study is the first example in which hybrid identity and the presence of hybrids in the natural distribution of parental species for Ficus have been confirmed with molecular markers. Hybrid individuals were identified on three island locations in the Sunda Strait region of Indonesia. These findings support Janzen's (1979) hypothesis that breakdown in pollinator specificity is more likely to occur on islands. We hypothesized that hybrid events could occur when the population size of pollinator wasps was small or had been small in one of the parental species. Later generation hybrids were identified, indicating that backcrossing and introgression did occur to some extent and that therefore, hybrids could be fertile. The small number of hybrids found indicated that there was little effect of hybridization on parental species integrity over the study area. Although hybrid individuals were not common, their presence at multiple sites indicated that the hybridization events reported here were not isolated incidences. Chloroplast DNA haplotypes of hybrids were not derived solely from one species, suggesting that the seed donor was not of the same parental species in all hybridization events.",Agaonidae; Colonization; Fig; Introgression; Krakatau; Monsoonal forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344099162

In this study, using immunohistochemistry we investigated the expression patterns of maize genes homologous to human p53 and c-myc during caryopsis development stages in maize. In a giving stage after pollination, p53 homologue showed high levels in the antipodal cells, integument, immature endosperm, ovary wall, tracheary elements, and aleurone layer, while c-myc homologue showed low levels in these tissues, only before pollination showed high expression in polar nucleus. The results of TUNEL assay demonstrated that TUNEL positive signals were detected where p53 homologue showed high expression levels. In animal cells, p53 shows reverse function with that of c-myc, so does it in maize basically.

Although seedlings obtained from controlled mating indicated segregation of isozyme, polymorphism of the isozyme genotype was detected mainly among populations, but rarely within each pond population. This suggested clonal dominance and rarity of seed or seedling survival in natural populations. In the pollination experiment, the mean seed set ratio in cross-pollination between plants of the same isozyme genotype (7.6%) did not differ significantly from self-pollination (7.6%), but was lower than cross-pollination between plants of different genotypes (45.7%). The low ratio in crossing between the same genotype plants was ascribed to the clonality of the parents. In general, these results corresponded with the low ratios in seed setting observed in natural populations (7.9-13.7%). All the male-sterile populations we surveyed showed the same genotype, thus male sterility in the study area was considered to have the same origin.",Isozyme; Male sterility; Sexual reproduction; Utricularia australis; Vegetative reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142010145

Although the anthers in male, and in the much more abundant hermaphroditic flowers, are the same size and they bear the same quantity of pollen, these organs exhibit some specialization in the two flower types. Experimental results imply that significant roles of the male organs in hermaphroditic flowers are as sources of pollinator reward (pollen) in these nectarless flowers, at least as near-distance attractive elements, and as landing platforms. Evidence for the latter comes from experiments that showed bees visited flowers (alighted) that lack stamens with a much lower frequency. In contrast, the stamens of the male flowers function primarily as possible near-distance attractors and as a source of pollen for reproduction. Male flowers are seldom open concurrently with the hermaphroditic flowers on the same plant and thus the staminate flowers function primarily as pollen donors because they cannot often serve as attractants to hermaphroditic flowers.",Andromonoecy; Female fitness; Male fitness; Pollen; Pollinator rewards; Solanum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242407156

The study was carried out using 3H-labelled sucrose and microautoradiography. In this orchid species, nectar was secreted and accumulated in the spur. Inside the spur, the epidermis developed numerous unicellular secretory hairs engaged in nectar secretion and resorption. Nectar resorption occurred near the end of anthesis. Following pollination, sucrose from the resorbed nectar was incorporated into starch accumulated in parenchyma cells of developing capsules. Additionally, radioactivity in the cell walls of parenchyma and ovules was also observed. The label was not detected either in the gynoecium of unpollinated flowers or in tuberous roots of all plants investigated.

The relationships between these species and the diploids T. bessarabicum and T. elongatum were also investigated. The number of phenotypes and the composition of bands yielded by the electrophoretic separation of endosperm proteins were used to estimate intra- and interpopulational variability. DNA polymorphism generated by 24 arbitrary 10-mer primers and 14 specific 20-mer primers was used to determine interpopulational variability and interspecific relationships. Jaccard's coefficient of similarity was used to analyze presence and absence data in the DNA polymorphism and endosperm protein determinations of individual plants. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient was used to analyse interpopulational variation using endosperm protein band frecuency data. Dendrograms were constructed using an unweighted pair group method with arithmetical average (UPGMA). The high level of intrapopulational variability found in T. junceum and T. junceiforme was inconsistent with the traditional classification of these species as self-pollinating. The level of interpopulational variation varied according to the degree of polymorphism of the corresponding markers. The endosperm proteins and random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) proved to be the most polymorphic markers to those used although only the former were able to distinguish between the different populations.

Aborted ovules or seeds collected at 30 days after pollination (DAP) were smaller than normally developing seeds, although they were larger than unfertilized ovules at anthesis. Success or failure in fertilization could be determined by the presence of pollen tubes in the sections of ovules or developing seeds sampled at 3 DAP, but even unfertilized ovules without pollen tubes enlarged in developing capsules. In aborted ovules or seeds sampled at 4 DAP or later, the structures in embryo sacs degenerated. Observation of sections of aborted ovules or seeds revealed that 64% and 71% of ovules in 'Sunsmile Blue' and 'Akatsukinokurenai', respectively, were not fertilized, and that 5% and 2% of the fertilized ovules in the respective cultivars aborted. In each cultivar, about 4% ovules with a nucellus lacked the embryo sac.

Ca. 60% of the species were self-compatible (SC). Natural fruit set of SC species triplicate those of self-incompatible (SI) species. Almost all SC species have autonomous selfing capacity. Nevertheless, on average, SC species produce more than twice as many fruits through natural pollination in comparison to autonomous selfing, and fruit set obtained after autonomous selfing was significantly lower than hand-selfed fruit set. Most SC species received insufficient pollen from themselves via autonomous selfing, and natural fruit set was mostly pollinator-mediated. Thus, the reproductive assurance provided by autonomous selfing is relatively low in comparison with that provided by pollinators. We supplemented our data with published results from different sites in South America, to assess how general are the associations between life form and compatibility system and between natural fruit production and the self compatibility index. There is a differential distribution of SC and SI species according to life form, with a skew towards incompatibility among woody plants and towards compatibility in herbs. On the other hand, regression analysis showed there is a general positive trend between natural fruit set and the self compatibility index of the species.",Autonomous selfing; Chaco Serrano forest; Genetic load hypothesis; Pollen limitation; Reproductive assurance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344287503

Understanding the effects of inbreeding depression on plant fitness is especially important in the context of habitat fragmentation, where plant populations become smaller and more isolated, exhibiting increasing levels of inbreeding depression. We examined the joint influence of inbreeding depression and maternal effects on life cycle traits and dispersal ability in the herb Trogopogon pratensis that grows in fragmented populations in Europe. We conducted experimental crosses to obtain selfed and outcrossed progeny in two contrasted environments. In particular, we produced a first generation of seeds and plants that were self-pollinated again to produce a second generation of seeds. Individual seeds were weighed and their pappuses measured to estimate the dispersal potential. Pollination treatment only had a significant effect on seed mass and dispersal ability. Coefficients of inbreeding depression did not differ between selfed and outcrossed plants. Seed mass had a significant effect on germination date. Environment had a significant effect on mass of the second generation of seeds and the interaction between pollination treatment and family was significant for six traits, indicating the existence of strong maternal effects in T. pratensis. Results suggest population differentiation.

The pollen is consistently inaperturate, isopolar and radially symmetrical. Four basic patterns of exine sculpturing are identified: rugulate, verrucate, scabrate and psilate. The exine stratification of one representative species, P. macrocarpa, is shown to be entirely ectexinal. The ectexine consists of a discontinuous outer tectal layer, a columellar infratectal layer, and an inner lamellar foliated foot layer; the intine is very thin and fibrillar. The pollen is invariably released as acalymmate tetrads, in which the tectum is absent from the proximal walls. The individual pollen grains within the tetrads are connected by crosswall cohesion, involving both exine and intine; this form of cohesion has not hitherto been reported in the Annonaceae. In addition, pollen grains of neighbouring tetrads are connected in two different ways, viz. short exine connections and non-sporopollenin pollen-connecting threads. Neither of these cohesion mechanisms has previously been reported for the genus. The function of the various forms of cohesion between pollen grains and tetrads in Pseuduvaria is discussed as a mechanism to enhance the efficiency of pollination by enabling the fertilization of multiple ovules following a single pollinator visit. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Acalymmate tetrads; Crosswall cohesion; Non-sporopollenin threads; Palynology; Pollen masses; Systematics; Taxonomy; Viscin threads,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141453400

Contributions of seed and pollen dispersal to total gene flow were investigated by analysing the pattern of decrease in kinship coefficients among pairs of individuals with geographical distance and comparing it with simulation results. Plots of kinship against the logarithm of distance were decomposed into a slope and a shape component. Simulations showed that the slope is informative about the global level of gene flow, in agreement with theoretical expectations, whereas the shape component was correlated with the relative importance of seed vs. pollen dispersal. Hence, our results indicate that insights into the relative contributions of seed and pollen dispersal to overall gene flow can be gained from details of the pattern of spatial genetic structure at biparentally inherited loci.

The precision of parameter estimates is affected by two factors: the number of offspring under consideration, and the precision with which the offspring can be assigned to parents. When assignment of parents is based on genetic information, the confidence in assignments is affected by the number and polymorphism of the loci considered, and by the number of potential parents in the population. Studying larger populations may yield higher numbers of offspring, but since larger populations contain more potential parents, more (or more highly polymorphic) loci are necessary to attain a given level of confidence in the parent assignments. This article addresses how to relate the size of the population and the number of loci when designing a study. It is shown that the number of loci needed to assign all offspring unambiguously is proportional to the logarithm of the population size. In some cases, the constant of proportionality can be determined, eliminating the need for simulation-based projections. Population-wide measures of uncertainty in parent assignments are also introduced, and it is shown that holding uncertainty ""steady"" as the population size increases also requires increasing the number of loci proportional to the logarithm of the population size. Data from a study of self-pollination are used to illustrate the techniques suggested.",Dispersal; Fertility; Mating; Study design,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042334680

Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain why associations occur between dioecy and several of these attributes, yet most assume that dioecy originates more often in clades with these traits than in clades with alternative character states. To investigate correlations between dioecy and these attributes, and to provide insights into the potential evolutionary pathways that have led to these associations, we assigned states of these traits to genera on a large-scale molecular phylogeny of the angiosperms; we then used maximum-likelihood analysis to analyse the presence of correlations and the sequence of acquisition of traits. Phylogenetic analysis revealed correlations between dioecy and six of the seven attributes; only many-flowered inflorescences exhibiting no association with the dioecious condition. The particular correlations that were revealed and the strength of the association differed among the three main monophyletic groups of angiosperms (Rosids, Asterids, and Eumagnoliids). Our analysis provided no general support for the hypothesis that dioecy is more likely to evolve in lineages already possessing the seven attributes we considered. Further analysis of the intercorrelations of the seven attributes provided evidence for non-independence between some of the traits, implying that functional associations among these traits have influenced the ecology and evolution of dioecious species.",Correction for phylogeny; Dioecy; Discrete; Ecological correlates; Life-history correlates; Maximum-likelihood; Plant sexual systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042878222

Spur length and geographic distribution are commonly used to distinguish the varieties, but these characters overlap and are not useful for distinguishing the taxa in all instances. In this study, taxonomic boundaries within P. dilatata are reevaluated using variation in 16 morphological traits, six ISSR primers, four RAPD primers, and RFLPs of two chloroplast regions. Morphological, ISSR, and RAPD markers revealed groupings that loosely corresponded to the three recognized varieties, but there was a substantial amount of overlap among the taxa, and no markers alone reliably distinguished the varieties. Some variation was detected in the two chloroplast regions, but it did not correspond well with taxonomy or geography. These data also revealed a surprisingly strong degree of divergence between eastern and western populations of var. dilatata at ISSR and RAPD loci, but not in morphological or chloroplast markers. Collectively, these results suggest a relatively recent divergence among the three varieties and among populations of var. dilatata. Furthermore, these taxa are likely still in a very active state of evolution due to a combination of geographic isolation and selection by pollinators. Because each of the varieties is generally distinguishable by a set of floral traits and molecular markers, their recognition at the subspecific level is supported.

An exception to this rule may be nectar-feeding birds, which excrete significant amounts of ammonia under certain conditions. Although ammonia is toxic, because it is highly water soluble its excretion may be facilitated in animals that ingest and excrete large amounts of water. Bird-pollinated plants secrete carbohydrate- and water-rich floral nectars that contain exceedingly little protein. Thus, nectarfeeding birds are faced with the dual challenge of meeting nitrogen requirements while disposing of large amounts of water. The peculiar diet of nectar-feeding birds suggests two hypotheses: (1) these birds must have low protein requirements, and (2) when they ingest large quantities of water their primary nitrogen excretion product may be ammonia. To test these hypotheses, we measured maintenance nitrogen requirements (MNR) and total endogenous nitrogen losses (TENL) in three hummingbird species (Archilochus alexandri, Eugenes fulgens, and Lampornis clemenciae) fed on diets with varying sugar, protein, and water content. We also quantified the form in which the by-products of nitrogen metabolism were excreted. The MNR and TENL of the hummingbirds examined were exceptionally low. However, no birds excreted more than 50% of nitrogen as ammonia or more nitrogen as ammonia than urates. Furthermore, ammonia excretion was not influenced by either water or protein intake. The smallest species (A. alexandri) excreted a significantly greater proportion (>25%) of their nitrogenous wastes as ammonia than the larger hummingbirds (?4%). Our results support the hypothesis that nectar-feeding birds have low protein requirements but cast doubt on the notion that they are facultatively ammonotelic. Our data also hint at a possible size-dependent dichotomy in hummingbirds, with higher ammonia excretion in smaller species. Differences in proportionate water loads and/or postrenal modification of urine may explain this dichotomy.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242724940

To be successful for commercial use, SE technology must work with a variety of genetically diverse trees. Initiation in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), our main focus species, is often recalcitrant for desirable genotypes. Initiation percentages of loblolly pine, Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco], and Norway spruce (Picea abies L., Karst.) were improved through the use of brassinolide. Brassinosteroids, which include brassinolide, are a relatively new group of natural plant growth regulators that are found in many plant species. They have been shown to have diverse, tissue-specific, and species-specific effects, including the stimulation of cell elongation and ethylene production and increasing resistance to abiotic stress. In our media, brassinolide was effective at concentrations ranging from 0.005-0.25 ?M. Using control medium (no brassinolide) and brassinolide-supplemented (0.1 ?M) medium, we achieved improved initiation percentages in loblolly pine, Douglas-fir, Norway spruce, and rice - 15.0% to 30.1%, 16.1% to 36.3%, 34.6% to 47.4%, and 10%, respectively. Brassinolide increased the weight of loblolly pine embryogenic tissue by 66% and stimulated initiation in the more recalcitrant families of loblolly pine and Douglas-fir, thus compensating somewhat for genotypic differences in initiation. Initiation percentages in loblolly pine were improved through the combination of modified 1/2-P6 salts, 50 mg/l activated carbon (AC), adjusted levels of Cu and Zn (to compensate for adsorption by AC), 1.5% maltose, 2% myo-inositol (to raise the osmotic level, partially simulating the megagametophyte environment), 500 mg/l casamino acids, 450 mg/l glutamine, 2 mg/l ?-naphthaleneacetic acid, 0.63 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine, 0.61 mg/l kinetin, 3.4 mg/l silver nitrate, 10 ?M cGMP, 0.1 ?M brassinolide, and 2 g/l Gelrite.

Manual crosses showed that the species is self- and cross-compatible, but is essentially an autogamous selfer. Seed set in the species is generally low, with higher output in ssp. teeta and lower in ssp. lohitensis. The low fecundity is ascribed to a number of pre- and postfertilization events, including unsuitability of floral features for attracting pollinators, high pollen sterility and high rates of fruit and seed abortion. Sexual reproduction does not contribute significantly towards population increase in this species. This could be an important factor contributing to its rarity. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Breeding systems; Endangered species; Fecundity; Himalaya,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141453431

All showed signs of growth inhibition encompassing both shoot and root systems, and accumulated higher than normal levels of OPDA. Mutants belonging to classes I and IV failed to set seeds due to defects in flower development which prevented self-pollination. One mutant, designated cas1, was characterized in more detail and showed, in addition to elevated levels of AOS mRNA, AOS polypeptide, OPDA, and JA, constitutive expression of JA-responsive genes (VSP2, PDF1.2).

TBG6 mRNA is highly abundant during the early stages of fruit development, but the levels decline sharply after the breaker stage with the start of the respiratory climacteric and a concomitant increase in ethylene production. Two antisense lines were obtained with significantly reduced levels of TBG6 mRNA at all stages of fruit development. At 30 d after pollination (dap), TBG6 mRNA levels were reduced by up to 98% and 88% in lines 6-2 and 6-10, respectively. Morphological phenotypes observed in the antisense lines included increased fruit cracking, reduced locular space, and a doubling in the thickness of the fruit cuticle. Two biochemical changes in antisense lines, compared with wild-type lines, were a reduction of exo-galactanase activity at the breaker +3 d stage and a reduction in the cell wall galactosyl content at the 20 dap stage. In addition, transgenic lines exhibited a 35-39% reduction in fruit firmness at the 20 dap stage, but their texture was equivalent to the wild type at 30 dap and beyond.

The SURE element was reported first for potato, in which it confers sugar responsiveness to the patatin promoter. A SURE binding transcription factor has not been isolated. We have isolated a transcription factor cDNA from barley and purified the corresponding protein. The transcription factor, SUSIBA2 (sugar signaling in barley), belongs to the WRKY proteins and was shown to bind to SURE and W-box elements but not to the SP8a element in the iso1 promoter. Nuclear localization of SUSIBA2 was demonstrated in a transient assay system with a SUSIBA2:green fluorescent protein fusion protein. Exploiting the novel transcription factor oligodeoxynucleotide decoy strategy with transformed barley endosperm provided experimental evidence for the importance of the SURE elements in iso1 transcription. Antibodies against SUSIBA2 were produced, and the expression pattern for susiba2 was determined at the RNA and protein levels. It was found that susiba2 is expressed in endosperm but not in leaves. Transcription of susiba2 is sugar inducible, and ectopic susiba2 expression was obtained in sugar-treated leaves. Likewise, binding to SURE elements was observed for nuclear extracts from sugar-treated but not from control barley leaves. The temporal expression of susiba2 in barley endosperm followed that of iso1 and endogenous sucrose levels, with a peak at ?12 days after pollination. Our data indicate that SUSIBA2 binds to the SURE elements in the barley iso1 promoter as an activator. Furthermore, they show that SUSIBA2 is a regulatory transcription factor in starch synthesis and demonstrate the involvement of a WRKY protein in carbohydrate anabolism.

We transformed tobacco with the tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) nucleocapsid gene from the Hawaiian L isolate in order to obtain TSWV resistant breeding lines. Doubled-haploid lines were produced from primary transgenic plants that were selected for resistance to the virus. Several of these lines showed very high levels of resistance and were symptomless after inoculation with the Hawaiian L isolate of TSWV The accumulation of only low levels of full-length transgene RNA and protein observed in these lines is consistent with an RNA-mediated mechanism of resistance. The lines that were highly resistant to the Hawaiian L isolate of TSWV were also found to be highly resistant to several other isolates of TSWV, while lines that were only moderately resistant to the Hawaiian L isolate were often susceptible to the other isolates. The highly resistant lines were advanced over several generations by self-pollination. Although these lines were fully homozygous, several lines lost resistance in later generations, indicating that the resistance was unstable.

We then study the dynamics for the evolution of each reproductive system; and compare our results with similar published models. In this process, we introduce a general concept of fitness and list some of its properties, obtaining a relative measure of population growth, computable as an eigenvalue of a mixed mating transformation for a population in equilibrium. Our results concur with previous models of the evolution of androdioecy and gynodioecy regarding the threshold values above which the sexual polymophism is stable, although the previous models assume constant the fraction of ovules from hermaphrodites that are self pollinated, while we assume constant the fraction of the progeny derived from selfing. A stable androdioecy requires more stringent conditions than a stable gynodioecy if the amount of pollen used for selfing is negligible in comparison with the total amount of pollen produced by hermaphrodites. Otherwise, both models are identical. We show explicitly that the genotype fitnesses depend linearly on their frequencies.

In all populations, the stamen bases are attached to three broad flat pedestals regardless of number of stamens present. In certain other Hibbertia species, each pedestal results from initiation via a common stamen primordium that usually produces at least 3-4 stamens per common primordium. In H. fasciculata, each of the three pedestals is associated with three to four stamens in flowers of southeastern populations, but with only one stamen per pedestal in the coastal populations of New South Wales. Because the pedestals (remnants of common primordia) have persisted, the evolutionary trend probably has been one of reduction in stamen number.

The GxE interaction in the entire region was both statistically and practically significant, with an estimated type b genetic correlation coefficient of 0.64. The detected geographic pattern of the GxE interaction indicates that the old delineation is overly conservative, and consolidating the five old zones into the two new zones is a valid decision. A procedure was developed to convert the expected genetic gain, with respect to the old zone, to the new zone when seed from a rogued local seed orchard is used for reforestation in the entire new zone. A similar procedure was also proposed to predict the breeding value of an individual that was only tested in the old zone of its origin with respect to the new zone. Given the detected amounts of the GxE interaction, and considering other factors, using three to five sites in each new zone for the second-generation progeny testing seems to be appropriate.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345358778

The near-isogenic line (NIL) of T65wx (Japonica type) carrying an alien segment of chromosome 6 from a wild strain gave a reduced seed setting only when crossed with T65wx as the male. Cytological observations showed that abortion of hybrid seeds occurred as a consequence of a failure of early endosperm development followed by abnormalities in embryo development. The genetic basis of cross-incompatibility reactions in the female and male was investigated by testcrosses using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that were established through dissecting the introgressed segments of wild and cultivated (Indica type) strains. The results revealed that the cross-incompatibility reaction was controlled by Cif in the female and by cim in the male. When the female plant with Cif was crossed with the male plant with cim, a failure of early endosperm development was observed in the hybrid zygotes. Among cultivars of O. sativa, cim was distributed predominantly in the Japonica type but not in the Indica type. In addition, a dominant suppressor, Su-Cif which changes the reaction in the female from incompatible to compatible was proposed to present near the centromere of chromosome 6 of the Indica type. Further, the death of young F1 zygotes was controlled by the parental genotypes rather than by the genotype of the hybrid zygote itself since all three genes acted sporophytically, which strongly suggests an involvement of parent-of-origin effects. We discuss the results in relation to the origin of a crossing barrier as well as their maintenance within the primary gene pool.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141790005

Large family variance components were estimated for bud flushing and height. The family x site interaction was significant and more pronounced for growth cessation and height than for bud flushing. Depending on the trait, from 13 to 33% of families contributed significantly to the family x site interaction. Strongly significant site x population interaction was estimated only for bud flushing. Families with early bud flushing were taller, although the correlation was weak. Correlations between family means in bud flushing and bud flushing of parent trees varied from 0.53 to 0.60.

One of the industry's top priorities has been to find alternative ways to preserve their newly developed foods while satisfying the increasing consumer demand to produce safe, all-natural products. In orderto achieve this ""clean label"", much research has been devoted to the use of effective plant-based antimicrobials, such as those from herbs and spices, to replace chemicalpreservatives. However, due to the cross-pollination character of herbs and spices, there is alot of genetic heterogeneity among different batches of the same plant species. This poses a problem for the routine use of plants, and their extracts, as a barrier towards microbial growth. In order to combat this, a unique tissue-culture-based selection strategy was used to isolate an elite phenolic phytochemical-producing clonal line of oregano (Origanum vulgare). Ethanol extracts of this elite clonal line of oregano were then used to study its inhibitory action against Listeria monocytogenes in both broth and meat systems. Thymol and carvacrol, two of the main phenolic constituents of oregano extracts, were also tested in both systems to evaluate their activity against that of the whole oregano extract. Results indicate that thymol, carvacrol, and the clonal oregano line were all effective in inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes in both systems. Approximately 150-200 ppm of pure carvacrol or thymol was needed in order to significantly inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes in broth, while at least 1200 ppm (corresponding to 27.8 ?g phenolics/ml) of the elite clonal oregano extract was needed to do the same. Inconclusive results were obtained when the clonal line was compared to store-brand samples of oregano. In meat systems, 800 ppm of the oregano extract was able to significantly inhibit the growth of the pathogen more so than 800ppm of carvacrol. A possible explanation for this is that the oregano extract was able to work more effectively at the interface of the lipid and water-soluble portions of the meat than the carvacrol. These results are promising for the food industry since we have now developed an approach for a highly consistent and reliable natural source of antimicrobial activity for future studies.",Antimicrobials; Carvacrol; Cloral oregano; Listeria monocytogenes; Origanum vulgare; Phenolics; Thymol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041696501

Because control of the viral disease via management of vector insects is not efficient, incorporation of PRSV-W genetic resistance into C. pepo cultivars would be highly desirable. Although resistant accessions have been described in C. ecuadorensis, C. foetidissima, C. maxima and C. moschata, resistant accessions of C. pepo are rare. This paper reports on interspecific hybridization between C. pepo and a PRSV-W-resistant C. moschata squash accession, and on the early steps in introgression of this resistance into the former species. C. pepo cv. Asmara was crossed with two PRSV-W resistant C. moschata accessions. Immature F1 (C.pepo x C.moschata) embryos were excised 20 days after pollination, and cultured asseptically in two different culture media, each under two different light regimes. No adult plants could be recovered from immature embryos of the cross C. pepo cv. Asmara x C. moschata cv. Piramoita. From the cross C. pepo cv. Asmara x C. moschata cv. Duda, 4 seedlings were recovered from 6 embryos incubated in a growth chamber [25° to 28°C, 16 hours of light with 1500-2000 lux/8 h dark period] immediately after excision and inoculation in a culture medium [= Murashige and Skoog (MS) + 0.01 mg/L of IAA (indolacetic acid) + 0.1 mg/L of Kinetin], without an intervening dark period. F1 (C. pepo x C. moschata) plants were fertile, and upon selfing yielded viable F2 seeds. PRSV-W resistance was assessed in the F2 (C. pepo x C. moschata) population, using C. pepo cv. Asmara and C. moschata cv. Duda, respectively, as the susceptible and resistant (tolerant) checks. Plants were mechanically inoculated with a known PRSV-W isolate. The F2 population showed a PRSV-W response intermediate between those of the parental accessions, and estimates of the mean degree of dominance indicates incomplete dominance in the direction of susceptibility. The mean broad-sense heritability estimate of PRSV-W resistance was 0.48, a medium to high value, indicating the likelihood of a significant response to selection for resistance. The introgression of the resistance to PRSV-W of C. moschata into C. pepo seems to be technically viable.",Embryo rescue; PRSV-W; Summer squash; Tissue culture; Virus resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043206007

This will undermine the value of the resources for their intended purposes, especially if natural and/or silvicultural selection needs to be part of the management system. The potential importance of such contamination was studied by stochastic simulation over five generations of which four incurred contamination, using the scenario for Pinus radiata in New Zealand as an illustration. Assumptions included: a single conceptual trait (which may represent a multi-trait function); two semi-empirical initial differences in genetic merit between gene resources and improved (contaminating) stands (?1), which confer a selective advantage on offspring from contaminant pollinations; a semi-empirical heritability (h2) (and two variations thereof); four arbitrary levels of pollen contamination (c) (1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10% fertilisation by outside pollen); c uniform among parents and constant over generations; genetic improvement per unit time in the contaminating population matching that per generation in the uncontaminated gene-resource component (?t + 1t); effective cumulative contamination (C) (% contaminant-origin genes) defined by pedigree; discrete generations; and 40 (or 160) selected seed parents with 275 offspring each. For each of 18 combinations of input parameter values 100 replicate runs were made to obtain distributions of expected outcomes. The value of C was very sensitive to both ?1 and c indicating major impacts of these factors, and built up progressively over successive generations, reflecting the selective advantage of individuals resulting from contaminant pollinations combined with continued flesh contamination. Impacts of likely departures from the assumptions are discussed, but results point to a need to quantify actual contamination rates.

With data from older trees of the OP families growing in the field (ages 12 and 24), genetic control of similar traits was compared at the different ages, and nursery-field correlations (rxy) were estimated. With the exception of forking, estimates of family heritability (h2 f) were moderate to strong for stem form and branching traits in seedlings (0.32 ? h2 f ? 0.94; mean = 0.73), and similar to growth traits (0.45 ? h2 f ? 0.90; mean = 0.75). Family performance and estimates of genetic parameters were relatively stable across nursery regimes and family type. Genetic relationships among traits in seedlings were similar to those observed in older field-grown trees, indicating that these traits are controlled by similar sets of genes in the two age classes. Nursery-field correlations between comparable traits were consistent across nursery regimes, but rxy was strong enough to be useful for early testing purposes (i.e., | rxy | ? 0.30), only for number of whorls with steep-angled branches (WSAB), branch length, and branch angle in older trees. Predicted gains from early selection for these or correlated traits were at least 40-50% of those expected from selection at older ages. Because of unfavorable genetic correlations, selection for stem growth potential alone at the seedling stage is expected to produce unfavorable impacts on WSAB and stem sinuosity in older trees.

Management intensity reflected a combination of cultural practices and levels of usage. Low intensity management (LM) included only soil fertilization and weed control. High intensity management (HM) additionally involved plastic mulch, drip irrigation, insect pest control, and plant disease control. Use of partial budget analysis simplified evaluation of the effect of management intensity on profitability, which was defined as a difference in net return between HM and LM. The difference in net return between HM and LM (??) was based on market price (P), changes in yield (?Y), and changes in production cost (?I) due to increased intensity of management: ?? = P × ?Y - ?I. We used means of daily wholesale market price for midseason (July to August) at Dallas, TX, for seeded and seedless red melons each year, means of yield difference between HM and LM for each cultivar each year, and concurrent estimates of production cost difference between HM and LM in our empirical analyses. HM was more profitable than LM in two of the three years with increased net return up to almost 8,000 $·ha?1, but the level of profitability varied among cultivars and years. Triploid (seedless) cultivar had higher yield difference between HM and LM and received higher prices, resulting in larger profits than did diploid open-pollinated or diploid hybrid (both seeded) cultivars in all three years. The difference in net return between HM and LM corresponded positively with yield differences between HM and LM, but not in proportion because of differences in production cost between HM and LM and in market price among years. In our sensitivity analyses, we introduced the concept of rate of change in net return as ??%. Based on mean values of the market price and differences in yield and in production cost between HM and LM over this 3-year study as modes of variation, we demonstrate that the rate of change in net return between HM and LM was more sensitive to the yield difference and market price than to the cost difference between HM and LM. This is the first time information of production cost and profit based on this model of partial budgeting has been developed for watermelon. When yield difference was small or when market price was low, the rate of net return increased more effectively in response to increasing management intensity.

Triploid cultivars, plastic mulch, beehives, raised beds, and 2-row planting was found in < 30% of fields. Transplants, windbreaks, hoeing, and irrigation were used in < 55% of fields. Cultivation, fertilization, and crop rotation occurred in > 85% of fields. Overall, < 5% of growers used low management intensity of open-pollinated cultivars, direct seeding, no cultivation, and no fertilization. Only < 1% growers used high management intensity of diploid or triploid hybrid cultivars, plastic mulch, raised beds, pollination management, transplanting, and irrigation, in addition to cultivation, fertilization, and crop rotation.

There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042424615

Chl. lamellata flowers from November to January, forming a lax spike with ca. 13 flowers. The floral life-span is 14 ± 4 days. The species is self-compatible. There was no statistical difference between the amount of seed produced after hand cross-pollination and hand self-pollination treatments. Neither direct autogamy nor agamospermy are involved in seed setting, thus pollinating agents are essential for the species' reproduction. Also, it has a high number of pollen grains (881733) and ovules (599833) per flower. The P/O ratio calculated is low (1.46). Probable pollinators belong to the orders Hymenoptera (Corynura chloris and Ruizantheda proxima) and Diptera (Sarcophagidae); these insects had a low visitation rate (0.00002 visits/spike/ minute). The rate of pollination observed was low (28.6% flowers with pollinia deposited versus 71.3% flowers with pollinia removed).

Six plots were established in 1997 in the Sierra Nevada, Spain; three were fenced to exclude native ungulates, and the remaining were open to ungulates. I determined pollinator and ungulate preferences for plant traits and their effect on plant fecundity. Then I compared the selection regimes between plants excluded from herbivores and plants open to them. When ungulates were absent, I found significant selection on flower number, reproductive stalk height, basal diameter of the stalks, petal length, and inner diameter of the flowers. When ungulates were present, selection on floral traits completely disappeared, and selection strength on flower number and morphological traits decreased. This effect was due to the ungulate preference for larger plants and the phenotypic correlations between plant size and floral traits. Results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection can be disrupted by conflicting effects of plant enemies acting during or subsequent to pollination.

Through two pollination experiments conducted over multiple years, I also measured pollen limitation and self-incompatibility in this species. The number of flowering plants varied greatly among years, as did reproductive success. Percent seed set was significantly correlated with the number of plants flowering annually, such that plants flowering in high flowering years (1997 and 2001) exhibited significantly higher percent seed set than did plants flowering in low flowering years (1998-2000). In the 3-year pollen limitation study, plants flowering asynchronously were pollen-limited, whereas plants flowering synchronously were not. This species is strongly self-incompatible. Results of this study demonstrate that the Haleakala silversword experiences reduced reproductive success in low flowering years, and suggest that this Allee effect is pollinator-mediated.

In France, it is mainly present in the region of Lyon, where it threatens the health of the population. Objective: To analyze annual, daily, and bihourly pollen concentrations in the air to determine the characteristics of ragweed pollination and in particular its diurnal rhythm. Methods: Ragweed pollens were sampled from 1987 to 2001 by a Hirst volumetric trap calibrated to handle a flow of 10 L/min of air, which roughly corresponds to a human breathing rhythm. Pollen counts were performed on a daily and bihourly basis, which is of particular importance in allergologic practice. Results: Ragweed pollination occurs from the beginning of August to the end of September. Annual and daily levels of pollen have increased significantly since 1987. The pronounced diurnal periodicity shows a peak from 9 to 11 AM. Pollen counts increased from the early morning with temperature increase and relative humidity decrease. Conclusions: Daily pollen counts of this strongly allergic plant are above the allergic thresholds commonly defined, limiting the interest of eradication campaigns. Thus, prevention of ragweed allergy depends on informing and educating the public through reports and updates. Diurnal variations seem to be the most crucial part of such a report, allowing allergy patients to adapt their daily outdoor activities in respect to the pollen peaks and off-peaks.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042238020

L. Rob.) Small; both are endemic to Florida, and federally listed as endangered. Field observations and experiments in central Florida determined their phenology, pollination, breeding system and germination. The species are protogynous, although there is an overlap of female and male stages in both. They are similar in floral morphology but differ in color and scent. They differ from Asimina in their small flowers with subequal petals and low number of stamens (16-34) with elongated connectives. They are both spring-flowering shrubs, but anthesis begins four to five weeks earlier in D. pulchellus. Fire or other disturbances enhances flowering dramatically. Pollinators are few and infrequent and may include flies, tumbling beetles, and thrips. Hand-pollination (self) resulted in 4.4% fruit set vs. 19.5-23.5% in hand-pollination (cross) and 1.6-1.8% in open-pollinated flowers of D. rugelii. Open-pollinated flowers of D. pulchellus yielded 1.2% fruit set and 11.4% when they were hand-pollinated (cross). Over a six-year period, 80.5% of open-pollinated seeds of D. rugelii germinated and survived, vs. 42.6% in hand cross-pollinated and 34.8% in hand self-pollinated.

Based on quantitative sampling of seedlings, saplings, and trees, we assess whether particular sexual systems, pollination syndromes, or seed-dispersal modes are associated with successional stage, prior selective logging, woody growth forms, or patterns of abundance or rarity. We further examine the phylogenetic structure of these traits in the regional woody flora, testing explicit hypotheses regarding phylogenetic clustering of reproductive traits and habitat distributions. Animal dispersal and insect pollination predominate across all forest types and size classes. In second-growth trees, relative abundance of species with explosive dispersal, hermaphroditic flowers, and insect pollination is higher, and relative abundance of species with animal dispersal and mammal pollination is lower, compared to old-growth and logged forests. Overall, dioecy and wind dispersal are more frequent than expected in canopy trees, and hermaphroditic flowers are more frequent than expected in shrubs. Reproductive traits, growth-form traits, and relative abundance patterns show significant clustering within the supertree phylogeny. Patterns of trait distribution across forest types are closely linked with patterns of floristic composition at the genus and family level. Species-level associations among reproductive traits and woody growth form can be explained by phylogenetic correlations. Wind dispersal and hummingbird pollination are significantly concentrated in clades with hermaphroditic flowers, whereas wind pollination is concentrated in clades with unisexual flowers.

Choice of pre-change flowers was greater than random in relation to the proportion of colour phases available within the plant population. 3. Levels of floral manipulation that mimicked the flower handling characteristics of visiting bumble bees confirmed that triggering of the pollen release mechanism is necessary for the instigation of colour change. 4. Moreover, this study suggests that, in L. pilosus, an aspect of pollination (pollen deposition by bees and/or subsequent pollen tube growth within the style) is linked with colour change and may act as the trigger for such change.",Bombus terrestris; Colour change; Foraging behaviour; Lupinus pilosus; Pollen deposition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042574149

In M 2, a decrease in the number of plants with multiple karyotype aberrations and interchromosomal exchanges with high frequency of multivalent formation was observed. The multivalent configurations had different types and chromosome disjunctions. Their pollen fertility was higher than in translocants found in M 1. Desynapsis often occurred in M 2, including plants with chromosome deficiency or rearrangements.

The 30 selected BC1 seedlings were grown to maturity and self pollinated to produce BC1S1 progeny seeds. Twenty of the 30 selected BC1S1 progeny families were evaluated for germination rate under DS and their average performance was compared with that of a ""nonselected"" BC1S1 population of the same cross.

The 30 selected BC1 plants were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and marker allele frequencies for 119 RFLP markers which spanned 1153 cM of the 12 tomato chromosomes were determined. A distributional extreme marker analysis, which measures statistical differences in marker allele frequencies between a selected and a nonselected population, detected four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for rate of germination under DS in this population.

In order to characterise this gene family in sugarcane, seven DNA fragments displaying a high homology with grass PEPC genes were isolated using polymerase chain reaction-based cloning. A phylogenetic study revealed the existence of four main PEPC gene lineages in grasses and particularly in sugarcane. Moreover, this analysis suggests that grass C4 PEPC has likely derived from a root pre-existing isoform in an ancestral species. Using the Northern-dot-blot method, we studied the expression of the four PEPC gene classes in sugarcane cv. R570. We confirmed that transcript accumulation of the C4 PEPC gene (ppc-C4) mainly occurs in the green leaves and is light-induced. We also showed that another member of this gene family (ppc-aR) is more highly transcribed in the roots. The constitutive expression for a previously characterised gene (ppc-aL2) was confirmed. Lastly, the transcript accumulation of the fourth PEPC gene class (ppc-aL1) was not revealed. Length polymorphism in non-coding regions for three PEPC gene lineages enabled us to develop sequence-tagged site PEPC markers in sugarcane. We analysed the segregation of PEPC fragments in self-pollinated progenies of cv. R570 and found co-segregating fragments for two PEPC gene lineages.

We examined salt marsh development over 17 years (1984-2001) in a rapidly accreting, well-drained lagoon of a macrotidal marsh in south-west Spain. Scattered, elevated tussocks of colonizing Spartina maritima expanded radially until they either coalesced or were separated only by narrow drainage channels. We recorded changes in elevation of the tussocks and investigated the cover and biomass of successive species invading them. 2. Sediment accretion produced a mean annual increase in tussock elevation of 3.5 cm. Sarcocornia perennis had begun to invade the raised centres of the tussocks by 1984, subsequently displacing Spartina maritima radially to become dominant by 1990. A hybrid form of Sarcocornia, which appeared on some of the tussocks occupied by S. perennis in 1997, also expanded radially and had achieved dominance on many of the invaded tussocks by 2001, by virtue of its more erect growth form and rapid accumulation of high above- and below-ground biomass. 3. Tussocks not yet invaded by the hybrid remain dominated by S. perennis and have maintained sediment accretion rates and redox potentials similar to those that have been invaded. 4. Genetic analysis, using random amplified DNA (RAPD) markers, indicated that the hybrid was a cross between the diploid Sarcocornia perennis (2n = 18) and the octaploid S. fruticosa (2n = 72), a high-marsh species, and suggested that each hybrid individual may have resulted from a separate pollination of an indigenous S. perennis plant. 5. Invasion by the new hybrid thus probably occurred as a result of pollen flow from high-marsh S. fruticosa, some 1 km distant, to the stigmas of the established dominant S. perennis. Succession might therefore be facilitated genetically rather than simply by the enhanced sediment accretion, which ameliorated the effects of submersion and low sediment redox potentials that presumably exclude S. fruticosa from lower parts of the marsh.",Genetic facilitation; Marsh elevation; Positive interaction; RAPD marker; Redox potential; Sediment accretion; Tidal wetland,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041709466

Half of the plants showed a unique multilocus phenotype and 75% of all phenotypes occurred only in Scandinavia. Diploid populations showed similar levels of genetic diversity as other widespread outbreeding species with animal-mediated pollination and F-statistics indicated excessive heterozygosity and low rates of gene flow among them. In spite of dramatic population histories caused by the ice ages, diploid populations have maintained the same genetic diversity in Scandinavia as in central and southern Europe. Northern populations have apparently been established through the gradual advance of genetically variable populations and patterns of variation at individual loci indicate different migration routes, from the south-south-west and the east-north-east, respectively. The data strongly support a repeated autoploid origin of the tetraploid cytotype which has been much more successful than the diploid progenitors in colonizing new land since the last ice age. High genetic diversity in Scandinavia has apparently been obtained by a combination of immigration of plants from different source areas and recurrent formation of autotetraploids from diploid progenitors. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Autoploidy; Enzyme markers; Heterozygosity; Ice age; Phylogeography; Plant migration; Polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042566237

Variation of the mitochondrial genome was measured using RFLPs. Although population differentiation at both nuclear and chloroplast markers was much weaker than at mitochondrial DNA, it nonetheless corroborated the grouping observed with mitochondrial DNA. The AFLPs led to the same population grouping as mtDNA. Notably, the presence of two ancient western and eastern groups within L. sibirica was confirmed and possible postglacial routes inferred. The genetic composition of the northernmost L. sibirica population in our sample established that it is located at the confluence of the eastern and western recolonization routes. The joint use of the three markers also indicated that populations around Lake Baikal are hybrids between L. gmelinii and L. sibirica, with L. gmelinii primarily acting as the pollinator.

Transgenic plants with delayed senescence are useful for studying interactions between these signaling mechanisms. Expression of ipt, a cytokinin biosynthetic gene from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, under the control of the promoter from a senescence-associated gene (SAG12) has been one approach used to delay senescence. We transformed petunia (Petunia x hybrida cv V26) with P SAG12-IPT. Two independently transformed lines with extended flower longevity (I-1-7-22 and I-3-18-34) were used to study the effects of elevated cytokinin content on ethylene synthesis and sensitivity and ABA accumulation in petunia corollas. Floral senescence in these lines was delayed 6 to 10 d relative to wild-type (WT) flowers. Ipt transcripts increased in abundance after pollination and were accompanied by increased cytokinin accumulation. Endogenous ethylene production was induced by pollination in both WT and IPT corollas, but this increase was delayed in IPT flowers. Flowers from IPT plants were less sensitive to exogenous ethylene and required longer treatment times to induce endogenous ethylene production, corolla senescence, and up-regulation of the senescence-related Cys protease phcp1. Accumulation of ABA, another hormone regulating flower senescence, was significantly greater in WT corollas, confirming that floral senescence was delayed in IPT plants. These results extend our understanding of the hormone interactions that regulate flower senescence and provide a means of increasing flower longevity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041508750

To assess the role of environmental conditions in the occurrence of sexual reproduction in this dioecious species, spatio-temporal variation in flowering was investigated in the reef flats off Cape Bolinao, north-western Philippines. Flowering occurred year-round, but the intensity varied temporally and correlated with mean water temperature. Spatially, differences in flowering intensity correlated with available light as affected by turbidity and water depth. Exposure duration of female flowers to air seems to be crucial for pollination and subsequent seed setting, resulting in higher numbers of fruits in shallower sites. Contrary to previous hypotheses, no effect of tidal levels on the release of male flowers was observed. It is suggested that production of gas bubbles in photosynthesis plays a key role. The great discrepancy between observed flowering and the presence of peduncle scars on the rhizomes at the deeper sites suggests that early abortion is common here. The use of these scars to quantify flowering will lead to an overestimation of reproductive effort in deep sites. The rare occurrence of flowering in deep sites supports the contention that light availability is a key factor in successful flowering in E. acoroides. Allocation of biomass and nutrients (N, P) over various plant components suggests that sexual reproduction involves high cost in E. acoroides. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The corresponding polypeptides possess transmembrane domains and GPAT activity when expressed heterologously in a yeast lipid mutant. The functional significance of one isoform, AtGPAT1, is the focus of the present study. Disruption of the AtGPATI gene causes a massive pollen development arrest, and subsequent introduction of the gene into the mutant plant rescues the phenotype, illustrating a pivotal role for AtGPATI in pollen development. Microscopic examinations revealed that the gene lesion results in a perturbed degeneration of the tapetum, which is associated with altered endoplasmic reticulum profiles and reduced secretion. In addition to the sporophytic effect, AtGPAT1 also exerts a gametophytic effect on pollen performance, as the competitive ability of a pollen grain to pollinate is dependent on the presence of an AtGPATI gene. Deficiency in AtGPAT1 correlates with several fatty acid composition changes in flower tissues and seeds.

Phenological differences, and the timing of flowering with respect to pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators, may provide one mechanism underlying variable responses of plants to herbivore damage. The subalpine wildflower, Ipomopsis aggregata, grows across a wide range of elevations and, because phenology varies with elevation, phenological delays associated with elevation may affect the ability of I. aggregata to compensate for or tolerate browsing. Thus, we examined the response of I. aggregata to herbivory across an elevation gradient and addressed the interactions among phenological delays imposed by damage, elevation, pre-dispersal seed predation and pollination, on I. aggregata's compensatory response. Among high and low elevation populations in areas near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Gothic, Colorado, we compared the responses of naturally browsed, artificially browsed (clipped), and unbrowsed (control) plants of I. aggregata. We compared responses in the date of initiation of flowering, timing of peak bloom, floral display, nectar production and sugar concentration, oviposition and fruit destruction by the predispersal seed predator Hylemya sp. (Anthomyiidae), fruit production, and aboveground biomass production. Clipping had the greatest effect on reproductive success and clipped plants at high elevation exhibited the lowest tolerance for herbivory. The effects of browsing appear to be mediated by flowering phenology, and both browsing and elevation delayed flowering phenology. Time needed for regrowth delays flowering, and thus affects the overlap with seed predators and pollinators. As a result of delayed flowering, naturally browsed and clipped plants incurred lower rates of seed predation. In the absence of seed predation, plants would exhibit a lower tolerance to herbivory since naturally and artificially browsed plants had fewer fruits destroyed by Hylemya larvae. We provide additional evidence that, for populations near the RMBL, clipping and natural browsing do not have the same effect on I. aggregata plants. This may be due to the selection of larger plants by herbivores. Although under some conditions plants may tolerate browsing, in areas where the growing season is short a phenological delay imposed by damage is likely to significantly reduce plant fitness. Identifying the mechanisms that allow plants to tolerate herbivore damage will help to develop a general framework for understanding the role of tolerance in plant population and community dynamics, as well as plant-herbivore interactions.",Compensation; Elevation; Herbivory; Phenology; Tolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041695494

This paper investigates the possible dynamical outcomes of a mechanistically formulated model system, involving two obligate mutualists and one exploiter. The model is based conceptually on a mutualism between a plant species and its pollinating seed parasite, in the presence of an obligate, nonpollinating seed parasite. Of particular interest are the conditions under which the exploiter species can invade and coexist with a mutualism that, by itself, possesses an equilibrium stabilized by other density-dependent regulating factors. Two types of models are used in the analyses: a deterministic, nonspatial model described by a set of discrete time equations, and an individual-based simulation incorporating stochastic interactions and spatial structure. Comparing the results of these two models uncovers the temporal dynamics of both well-mixed local systems and spatially distributed populations. Using these two situations, we examine how the predictions of the nonspatial model are affected by habitat structure. In the nonspatial case, and without the exploiters, there are typically two stable equilibria: one having zero densities for both mutualist species, and the other having nonzero densities. This bi-stability is a characteristic feature of obligate mutualisms. When the exploiter species is included, the system always retains the stability of the zero-density equilibrium, but the dynamics of the upper equilibrium can be more complicated, including limit cycle and extinction dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that spatial structure is a highly stabilizing influence on the three-species system as long as the exploiter's dispersal distance is large relative to the seed dispersal distance of the plant species. Given this condition, the model predicts spatial distributions that are marked by a patchy distribution of plants, with mutualists and exploiters situated about these patches.",Cheating; Competitive coexistence; Exploitation; Mutualism; Spatial structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037717293

Koshihikari and Sasanishiki isogenic lines exhibited the same good regeneration ability as that of Konansou, and Koshihikari and Sasanishiki exhibited poor regeneration ability compared with that of Konansou. One full-length cDNA (Os22A) whose expression was elevated in the rice calli that exhibited vigorous plant regeneration was isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that Os22A is identical to the EST clones expressed in Oryza sativa in the endosperm 10 days after pollination (accession number BI797481) and in the panicle at the ripening stage (accession number AU172698). Os22A is highly homologous to a barley gene coding for glucose dehydrogenase (accession number S72926) that is specifically expressed in developing embryos. Os22A encodes a transcript of 1391 nucleotides and is specifically expressed in calli with good regeneration ability in rice. Expression of Os22A mRNA decreased or disappeared with decrease in regeneration ability. In order to characterize the function of Os22A, we integrated Os22A into rice calli (O. sativa cv.

The regeneration ability of transformed calli clearly improved by integration of Os22A.

Genetic variation in natural regeneration was greater than in parental populations, especially for low-frequency alleles. Silvicultural treatments caused no significant differences in amabilis fir genetic-diversity parameters, while the shelterwood system resulted in lower observed and expected heterozygosity in western hemlock. Nei's genetic distance revealed that all parental populations were extremely similar. The two species had contrasting mating system dynamics with amabilis fir producing higher levels of correlated paternity and inbreeding with wider variation among individual tree outcrossing-rate estimates. Western hemlock had significant levels of correlated paternity only for the green tree and shelter-wood treatments demonstrating family structuring inversely related to stand density. Inbreeding in western. hemlock was significant but lower than that observed for amabilis fir with a J-shaped distribution for individual tree multilocus outcrossing-rate estimates.

Seeds were not produced asexually. Flowers were fully self-compatible and autonomously self-pollinating. Autonomous self-pollination was due to a delayed selfing mechanism that gave precedence to cross pollen but ensured that stigmas contacted the anthers at the end of floral life. Using selfed and crossed progeny from 10 maternal plants, we examined the magnitude and timing of inbreeding depression over a range of life-cycle stages, including seed production by maternal plants, and seed germination, seedling growth, survival, flowering and seed production by F1 plants. Average cumulative inbreeding depression was 0.15, although there was considerable variation among maternal families (? = -0.07-0.43). Inbreeding depression was not uniform across all life stages and was most prevalent late in the life cycle, affecting days to flowering and fruiting and flower production.

Results: Experimental exclusions of pollinators from plants with emasculated flowers in natural populations in southern Utah during an outbreak of the hawkmoth Hyles lineata revealed that 24% of the seed set could be attributed to insect pollination, and eliminated wind pollination and apomixis as contributing to seed set. Hence these moths can mediate gene flow when self-pollen is unavailable. To quantify gene flow when self-pollen is available, plants were transformed with two marker genes: hygromycin-B resistance and â-glucuronidase. The utility of these genetic markers to measure gene flow between plants was examined by mixing pollen from plants homozygous for both genes with self-pollen in different ratios and hand-pollinating emasculated flowers of plants growing in a natural population. The proportion of transformed seeds was positively correlated with the amount of transformed pollen applied to stigmas. In glasshouse experiments with the hawkmoth Manduca sexta and experimental arrays of transformed and wild-type plants, pollination mediated by moths accounted for 2.5% of the seed set.

Consequently, IITA hegan screening maize genotypes under controlled conditions for tolerance to drought stress in 1998. Some drought tolerant genotypes have been identified and are undergoing further improvement. Field studies were carried out in 2001 and 2002 to determine the response of drought adaptive traits (flowering, stay-green and leaf area index) in six of the maize genotypes already evaluated under drought. These traits are useful in the improvement of maize genotypes for tolerance to clrought since they have heen found to improve the efficiency of selection for drought tolerance. The trials were planted in two separate but adjacent blocks representing two irrigation treatments (water-deficit and well-watered conditions).

Under induced moisture stress, the trend was the same but the OPV performed better than the hybrids.

The field tests included control pollinated progenies from 434 phenotypically selected parent trees constituting the clones of 11 commercial seed orchards, and 16 natural stand control lots. The field test covered a wide geographical and climatic gradient (latitude 62.3-67.8° N, temperature sum 496-1056 day-degrees), covering the area used for commercial forestry in northern Sweden. Progenies of selected trees had 10% superior height growth, whereas differences in survival were small and non-significant. Thus, selection of individual trees within a stand did not result in the strong negative relationship between growth and survival normally observed among provenances of different latitudinal origin. The height superiority did not show any significant dependency on the growth conditions of the site (temperature climate), the transfer distance of the seedlings or the age of trees.

After open pollination, compatibility of crosses (i.e., whether at least one fruit developed per marked flower), fruit set of compatible crosses, and cumulative fitness (number of plants per maternal ovule) after 14 months in a common garden were lower for plants from smaller populations. Throughout the study, cumulative fitness was lower after hand pollination with pollen of one donor than after open pollination (finally 73.4% lower), suggesting that several pollen donors or single pollen donors of higher quality are involved in open pollination. Moreover, cumulative fitness was lower after hand selfing than after hand outcrossing (finally 69.4% lower), indicating both inbreeding depression and reduced compatibility after selfing. High self-compatibility (40.6%), dry stigmas, and differences in the compatibility of 11 of 33 experimental reciprocal crosses between plant pairs confirmed that C. bavarica has a sporophytic self-incompatibility system, as is common in the Brassicaceae.

Flowers pass through three phases: a) male phase, when outer anthers release their pollen, but stigmas are not receptive; b) female phase, when stigmas are receptive, but still separated from flowers' own pollen, and c) an autogamous phase, when the round anthers grow towards the stigma, leading to delayed autonomous self-pollination.

In the case of yuccas, moths serve as the plant's only pollinator, but eggs laid by the moths before pollination hatch into larvae that consume seeds. Previous studies have shown that flowers with high egg loads are more likely to abscise. This suggests that yucca flowers can select against moths that lay many eggs per flower through selective abscission of flowers; however, it is not known how yucca moths trigger floral abscission. We tested how the moth Tegeticula yuccasella triggers floral abscission during oviposition in Yucca filamentosa by examining the effects of ovipositor insertion and egg laying on ovule viability and floral abscission. Eggs are not laid at the site of ovipositor insertion: we used this separation to test whether wounded ovules were more closely associated with the ovipositor site or an egg's location. Using a tetrazolium stain to detect injured ovules, we determined whether the number of ovipositions affected the number of wounded ovules in naturally pollinated flowers. Two wounding experiments were used to test the effect of mechanical damage on the probability of floral abscission. The types of wounds in these experiments mimicked two types of oviposition - superficial oviposition in the ovary wall and oviposition into the locular cavity - that have been observed in species of Tegeticula. The effect of moth eggs on ovule viability was experimentally tested by culturing ovules in vitro, placing moth eggs on the ovules, and measuring changes in ovule viability with a tetrazolium stain. We found that ovules were physically wounded during natural oviposition. Ovules showed a visible wounding response in mothpollinated flowers collected 7-12 h after oviposition. Exact location of wounded ovules relative to eggs and oviposition scars, as well as results from the artificial wounding experiments, showed that the moth ovipositor inflicts mechanical damage on the ovules. Significantly higher abscission rates were observed in artificially wounded flowers in which only 4-8% of the ovules were injured. Eggs did not affect ovule viability as measured by the tetrazolium stain. These results suggest that physical damage to ovules caused by ovipositing is sufficient to explain selective fruit abscission. Whether injury as a mechanism of selective abscission in yuccas is novel or a preadaptation will require further study.",Floral abscission; Mutualism; Oviposition and selective floral abscission; Ovule damage; Plant-pollinator interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042209859

A strong relationship has been observed between the effective pollination period (EPP) and the general cropping of the orchard. The EPP concept has also been proven to be a useful parameter to establish a relationship between the variation in the reproductive process and cropping behaviors. For apples and pears, a slow pollen tube growth has been shown to be the main limiting factor of the EPP in the traditional cooler temperate cultivation regions. However, while higher temperatures speed up the pollen tube growth, the expansion of these crops into warmer areas often results in failures of fruit set. Thus, with the aim to ascertain the main limiting factor responsible for fruit set failures in Mediterranean conditions we have evaluated the EPP for two consecutive years in 'Agua de Aranjuez' pear, the main Spanish cultivar, by studying the stigmatic receptivity, pollen tube kinetics, and ovule development. Complete flower fertility was maintained for just 2 days after anthesis in both years. Pollen tube kinetics and ovule degeneration do not appear to limit flower receptivity. However, the stigmatic receptivity expressed as flowers with at least one receptive stigma, closely matches the duration of the EPP evaluated from fruit set experiments. This was consistent over the 2 years of experiments, in spite of the differences recorded in the EPP, suggesting that stigmatic receptivity is clearly the limiting factor of flower receptivity. This is the first report for stigmatic receptivity limiting the EPP in pears and suggests that stigmatic receptivity could be an important factor limiting pear flower receptivity and hence cropping performance under warmer conditions.",Effective pollination period; Pear; Pyrus communis; Stigmatic receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037870418

Gull Lake Drive, Hickory Corners, MI 49060-9516, United States","Evolutionists have long recognized the role of reproductive isolation in speciation, but the relative contributions of different reproductive barriers are poorly understood. We examined the nature of isolation between Mimulus lewisii and M. cardinalis, sister species of monkeyflowers. Studied reproductive barriers include: ecogeographic isolation; pollinator isolation (pollinator fidelity in a natural mixed population); pollen competition (seed set and hybrid production from experimental interspecific, intraspecific, and mixed pollinations in the greenhouse); and relative hybrid fitness (germination, survivorship, percent flowering, biomass, pollen viability, and seed mass in the greenhouse). Additionally, the rate of hybridization in nature was estimated from seed collections in a sympatric population. We found substantial reproductive barriers at multiple stages in the life history of M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. Using range maps constructed from herbarium collections, we estimated that the different ecogeographic distributions of the species result in 58.7% reproductive isolation. Mimulus lewisii and M. cardinalis are visited by different pollinators, and in a region of sympatry 97.6% of pollinator foraging bouts were specific to one species or the other. In the greenhouse, interspecific pollinations generated nearly 50% fewer seeds than intraspecific controls. Mixed pollinations of M. cardinalis flowers yielded &gt;75% parentals even when only one-quarter of the pollen treatment consisted of M. cardinalis pollen. In contrast, both species had similar siring success on M. lewisii flowers. The observed 99.915% occurrence of parental M. lewisii and M. cardinalis in seeds collected from a sympatric population is nearly identical to that expected, based upon our field observations of pollinator behavior and our laboratory experiments of pollen competition. F1 hybrids exhibited reduced germination rates, high survivorship and reproduction, and low pollen and ovule fertility. In aggregate, the studied reproductive barriers prevent, on average, 99.87% of gene flow, with most reproductive isolation occurring prior to hybrid formation. Our results suggest that ecological factors resulting from adaptive divergence are the primary isolating barriers in this system. Additional studies of taxa at varying degrees of evolutionary divergence are needed to identify the relative importance of pre- and postzygotic isolating mechanisms in speciation.",Ecological isolation; Hybridization; Mimulus; Pollen competition; Pollinator isolation; Reproductive isolation; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041695752

Previous studies have shown that recruitment in periods other than autumn of the flowering season has few demographic implications; that is contributes little to the population growth rate. Since environmental conditions in periods other than autumn would allow recruitment, we examined to what extent the seed ecology of L. maritima accounts for recruitment shortage for the greater part of the year. To this end, we studied the effects of selfing and outcrossing on seed production and germination, within- and between-year variation in seed mass and germination, seed characteristics in the soil seed bank throughout the year, and the effect of temperature as a factor controlling seed germination. Results indicate that selfing does not decrease recruitment, and thus the observed changes in visitation rate and pollinator composition throughout the year cannot account for differences in recruitment. Germinability decreases throughout the year, suggesting a possible cost in reproduction associated with extended flowering. L. maritima has a transient seed bank whose seeds also experience a decrease in their germination throughout the year. Finally, temperature affects seed germination patterns, indicating the existence of quiescence mechanisms that prevent germination in the months prior to the summer drought. Overall, the results obtained support and, at least partly, explain the recruitment patterns of L. maritima observed in the field. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Germination; Lobularia maritima; Pollinators; Quiescence; Seed bank; Seed mass; Temperature requirements,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038487058

The objectives were to (1) determine intraspecific variation in phenology between sites in different geographic locations with different precipitation regimes, (2) compare interspecific phenological patterns within sites during one year, and (3) document seasonal pollinator use of floral resources at one site in relation to the flowering phenology of these species. To determine the sequence of phenological events in trees of the family Bombacaceae across three study sites, phenology of marked individuals was recorded every 2 wk from September 2000 through August 2001 for six species. To estimate the importance of bombacaceous species in the diet of nectarivorous bats, pollen samples were collected from the bodies or feces of bats once every 2 wk during flowering. Our study suggests that phenological patterns of the Bombacaceae family in Neotropical dry forests are mainly constrained by phylogenetic membership and adaptive selective pressures associated with competition for pollinators. Abiotic factors related to precipitation and soil water content appear to be regulating leaf flushing and abscission, but the principal causes of flowering are related to ultimate factors associated with competition for pollinators.

The seeds of most species were considered to be bird dispersed. However, wind is also important for pollination and seed dispersal. The phenological trend was for an increase in the number of species flowering and fruiting around the end of the warm dry season/start of the hot wet season, followed by a decline at the end of the wet season, and lower proportions during the cooler season. Seed size was significantly correlated with fruit size. Other correlations, between flower size and fruit size, and between seed size and seed number, were significant using species as independent observations, but did not hold following phylogenetic correction.

On the pollinators, the secretion mixed with pollen was found adhered to the integument on the parts making contact with the anthers and stigma, mostly on the scape of the antennae. These trichomes are anatomically identical to the glandular scales common in the entire family and are formed by a multicellular cuticle-bounded structure, with a foot and head. The secretion is accumulated as a milky emulsion under the cuticle, outside the primary cell wall, and is liberated by rupture of the cuticle. The composition possibly differs from what generally distinguishes these glandular trichomes, i.e. volatile oils that give these plants their particular smell.

We studied the pollination system of the near carnivorous plant genus Roridula and showed that reproductive assurance is important in this system. Hemipterans have a digestive mutualism with Roridula and have been implicated in pollination but flowers show adaptations to hymenopteran pollination. We deduce that hemipterans are the primary pollinators of Roridula because seed set is significantly reduced when hemipterans are excluded from the flowers. Using allozyme electrophoresis, we show that hemipterans are responsible for mostly selfed progeny. Although bees still pollinate Roridula on very rare occasions, their exclusion does not affect seed set. The complicated floral structures that occur in Roridula most likely evolved as adaptations for bee pollination. Resident hemipterans facilitate selfing by Roridula, and this acts as a reproductive assurance mechanism because it increases seed production and ensures that plants still reproduce in the absence of more motile, outcrossing pollinators.",Autogamy; Facilitated selfing; Mutualism; Pollination; Reproductive assurance; Roridula; Seed set; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043269405

The most resistant families were also the most stable for performance across test sites, with stability defined as the slope of the regression of family means for rust infection versus site means for rust infection. A family's R-50 value (its predicted rust infection level when the site mean infection is 50%) was correlated to its stability parameter or slope (r = 0.78). On average, any one family's level of infection (% galled) was reasonably predictable for any given infection level at a given site; the average coefficient of determination (r2) was 0.78 for the regression of family means for rust infection versus site means for rust infection. However, the six most stable families for resistance had the lowest r2 values (average r2 = 0.58). We speculated that the lower predictability for the most resistant families was due to interactions of specific resistance genes in these families and corresponding avirulence and (or) virulence levels in the pathogen populations that may differ among sites. Although the predictability of the individual resistant families was relatively low, if these families were bulked into a resistant seed lot, they performed in a more predictable manner with r 2 = 0.74 for the regression of the bulk mean versus site means.

Phylogenetic hypotheses support the non-monophyly of most of the supraspecific classification units currently recognized in Achimenes, multiple origins of each of the pollination syndromes and the major morphological characteristics used to define these syndromes, multiple origins of floral spurs, multiple tetraploid events, and sympatric distributions of many closely related species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042009477

In subfamily Mapanioideae there is particular specialization of the inflorescence into units termed spicoids. The structural homology of the spicoid is difficult to interpret, making determination of intrafamilial relationships problematic. To address this, pollen from eight species in Mapanioideae was investigated using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Pollen development was also examined to identify the type of pollen present in these species. We also analyzed DNA sequence data using the trnL-F and rps16 regions from 25 genera and 35 species of Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and Thurniaceae. Two types of pollen, Mapania-type and pseudomonad, were identifed. Analysis of combined DNA and pollen data resolved a clade sister to the rest of Cyperaceae, corresponding to Mapanioideae. Within this, two further clades were resolved. One comprised taxa assigned to tribe Hypolytreae, which had Mapania-type pollen. The other comprised taxa mainly assigned to tribe Chrysitricheae, but included two taxa from Hypolytreae, Capitularina and Exocaiya. All taxa in this clade had pseudomonad pollen. Thus new groupings within the subfamily have been discovered based on the specialization of some taxa in terms of their pollination biology.",Chrysitricheae; Cyperaceae; Hypolytreae; Mapanioideae; Phylogenetics; Pollen; Pseudomonad; rps16; trnL-F,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042266910

The trials were established from Mpumalanga to the North-eastern Cape in a balanced 7x7 lattice design with 48 common treatments that comprised 45 unrelated, open-pollinated families and 3 genetic checks. The environments sampled represented a range of climatic and site quality gradients. All trees were assessed for height and diameter at 6 years of age. Survival was 87% and ranged from 83 to 92% across the 5 sites. Growth on the 5 sites varied from 0,034m3 to 0,065m3 / tree and single site heritability estimates ranged from 0,17 to 0,43. The interactions between site and treatment were highly significant. The overall GxE variance represented approximately 21%of the variance due to treatment. EstimatedType B genetic correlations averaged 0,76 for all pairs of sites with a range ofO,4 to 1,0 and were correlated with median rainfall during the spring period from September to November. Thejoint regression method was utilised to determine the stability of genotypes across sites. Some rank changes were detected across the 5 locations but these were limited to 15%ofthe families tested.

Seeds formed after pollination with irradiated pollen were cultured in liquid medium for 10 days before excision of the embryos for further culture. This made it easier to identify the seeds containing parthenogenetic embryos, thereby reducing the effort required and increasing the percentage of plants recovered. The plants obtained (?175) were transferred to a greenhouse for evaluation. Three fertile lines were identified, and selfed seeds were obtained for evaluating virus resistance. Flow cytometry of leaf tissues showed that two of these lines were spontaneous DH and the third was a mixoploid containing haploid and diploid cells. The other plants remained sterile through the flowering stage. Flow cytometry of 20 sterile plants showed that all were haploid. Attempts to induce chromosome doubling by applying colchicine to greenhouse-grown plants were unsuccessful. Shoot tips from the haploid plants were used to establish new in vitro cultures. In vitro treatment of 167 micropropagated haploid shoots with colchicine produced 10 diploid plants as well as 100 mixoploid plants. Pollen from male flowers that formed in vitro on the colchicine-treated plants was examined. High percentages of viable pollen that stained with acetocarmine were found not only in the diploids but also in <60% of the plants scored as mixoploid or haploid by flow cytometry.

A technique using sorghum with A3 cytoplasmic male sterility to control transgene flow through pollen while using nontransgenic pollinators is described and an experiment was designed to evaluate the risk of viable pollen flow using A3 hybrids under field conditions. Seed set under pollinating bags (an indicator of fertile pollen) was evaluated at the University of Nebraska Field Laboratory at Ithaca, NE, in 2001 and 2002 on selfed F2 progeny grown from open pollinated seed of 12 F1 hybrids produced in A1 and A3 cytoplasm.

In each evaluation year, the experimental design was a split-split plot with seed production year the main plot factor, hybrid as the subplot factor, and cytoplasm as the sub-subplot factor. Cytoplasm effects were highly significant, with percent seed set on A1 F2 individuals averaging 74%, and on A3 F2 individuals averaging 0.04%. Upper confidence limits (P = 0.05) for percent seed set were 1.32% or less for the progeny from all A3 hybrids.

Both P. pusillus and P. berchtoldii displayed low levels of variation within populations associated with high levels of interpopulation differentiation. This pattern of partitioning of genetic variation within and between populations is attributed to the founder effect, frequent vegetative propagation by turions, dominant self-fertilization and limited seedling recruitment. The mechanism of pollen transfer was investigated in cultivation. Effective pollination takes place in air above the water surface (autogamy, geitonogamy, anemogamy), on the water surface (epihydrogamy) or below water surface (hydroautogamy). The species are self-compatible. The low level of infra-population variation together with rare occurrence of heterozygotes suggest that selfing is the most frequent mode of pollination, although the protogynous flowers may occasionally permit some cross-pollination. Unique enzyme markers were found for P. pusillus and P. berchtoldii, and also for the single population of P. trichoides. All multienzyme phenotypes were species-specific.

Results revealed greater overall variation between populations from different catchments than those in the same catchment, and suggested the generation of population structure in the relatively short time since the initial introduction. Between-catchment variation may reflect population structure generated by local founders as the species spread and may indicate a large initial founder population at the time of the introduction into Britain, or multiple introductions. Within-catchment variation was consistent with expectations based on the water-borne dispersal of seeds in this species, and the relatively small dispersal range of likely pollinators.

The abundance and specific localization of PELPIII in the intercellular matrix (IM) of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) stylar transmitting tissue, and translocation of PELPIII from the IM into the pollen tube wall after pollination, presume the biological function of these glycoproteins to be related to plant reproduction. Here we show that in in vitro assays the translocation of PELPIII is specifically directed to the callose inner wall of the pollen tubes, indicating that protein transfer is not dependent on the physiological conditions of the transmitting tract. We designed a set of experiments to elucidate the biological function of PELPIII in the stylar IM. To study the function of the specific interaction between PELPIII proteins and the pollen tube wall, one of the PELPIII proteins (MG15) was ectopically expressed in pollen tubes and targeted to the tube wall. We also generated transgenic tobacco plants in which PELPIII proteins were silenced. In vitro bioassays were performed to test the influence of purified PELPIII on pollen tube growth, as compared to tobacco transmitting tissue-specific proteins (TTS) that were previously shown to stimulate pollen tube growth. The various tests described for activity of PELPIII proteins all gave consistent and mutually affirmative results: the biological function of PELPIII proteins is not directly related to pollen tube growth. These data show that similar stylar glycoproteins may act very differently on pollen tubes.",Extracellular matrix; HRGP; Nicotiana tabacum; Pollen tube; Pollen-pistil interaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042069851

Onion (Allium cepa L.) is a biennial plant and amenable to the production of gynogenic haploids. Although a strong population effect has been observed for gynogenic haploid production, there is no report describing the genetic basis of greater haploid production in onion. We evaluated over years the frequency of haploid production among onion inbreds and identified lines showing significantly (P &lt; 0.01) greater production of haploids. The onion inbreds, B0223B and B2923B, produced the highest mean frequencies of haploids so far reported. Hybrid families from crosses of B2923B with inbreds having relatively low haploid production showed significantly higher haploid production than the low-producing parent and significantly lower haploid production than B2923B. Plants from B0223B and B2923B with established rates of haploid production were testcrossed and/or self-pollinated. The F1 family from B1717A-1 × B2923B-3 showed rates of haploid production slightly greater than the low parent (B1717A-1) and significantly less than the high parent (B2923B-3). Self-pollination of plants from B2923B showing relatively high rates of haploid production generated S1 progenies also producing relatively high frequencies of haploids. Selfed progenies from plant B2923B-6 showed a high mean rate of haploid production (56.8% ± 14.5%) and, more importantly, the highest level of haploid production (82.2%) reported for any single onion plant. These results indicate that relatively high haploid production, at least for B2923B, was quantitatively inherited with dominance towards low production. We suggest S1 family selection as an effective method to increase gynogenic haploid production of onion populations.",Allium cepa; Haploidy; Inbreeding; Inheritance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037870279

We examined their geochemistry and structure as well as the reproductive ecology of their signature species Mirabilis rotundifolius to assess factors influencing endemism. While no single component consistently identified the barrens soils, the natural locations that support Mirabilis can be identified using elemental profiles from a cluster analysis of soil extracts. Because seeds germinate and plants proliferate in transplant gardens with non-calcic soils, bedrock and soil chemistry do not appear to be determinant components of endemism. Mirabilis rotundifolius utilizes diverse pollinators but is capable of autogamy when insects are excluded; seed predation by harvester ants may be a limiting factor for population spread outside the barrens habitat. Mirabilis rotundifolius is a disturbance-tolerant species, part of a barrens cohort that shares traits of suffrutescence, woody caudices, or multibranched rhizomes penetrating the chalk strata. Its presence may be enhanced when disturbance inhibits the presence of other species that compete for limited water resources. We conclude that endemism is dictated not by unusual soil chemistry requirements but rather by structural components of the barrens. In a water-limited environment, shallow soils and thin chalk strata coupled with a functionally adaptive growth habit allow M. rotundifolius to survive when other species are excluded by disturbance or the physiochemical aspects of the barrens.",Chalk barrens; Edaphic endemism; Geobotany; Mirabilis rotundifolius; Niobrara Formation; Oxybaphus rotundifolius; Rarity; Soil extraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042978597

The use of palynological evidence in forensic investigation requires careful collection and interpretation. There are many features that render pollen useful as forensic evidence, including the unique surface patterning for each species, the seasonal production and the circadian release. Thus, unique pollen assemblages can be constructed for specific locations, aiding in the collection of associative forensic evidence, and these assemblages change hourly and seasonally, giving a temporal as well as a spatial marker. The main limit of forensic palynology is set by the common neglect to use it.

The modified plants showed a reduced fertility, mainly caused by chromosomal rearrangements and genomic mutations during meiosis. The genomic mutations involved primary and tertiary monosomics, monotelodisomics, and a haploid plant. The decrease in meiotic index and pollen fertility in the cotton aneuploids was related not only to aberrations in chromosome pairing but also to genetic features of the original plants. It was found that heterozygosity for interchromosomal exchanges found in M 1 plants resulted in the formation of multivalent associations of chromosomes of various forms and types of segregation from translocation complexes. Another result was high variability in pollen fertility. An increase in irradiation dose rate caused an increase in the number of translocants with a high frequency of quadrivalents. The results suggest that the great diversity of forms observed in M 1 after pollination with irradiated pollen is determined, first, by elimination of some chromosomes or their arms or the whole paternal genotype and second, by interchromosomal rearrangements. The high variability in pollen fertility of translocants hampers using this trait as a marker of heterozygosity for exchanges in cotton.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-9344229791

Methods: This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy with standardized ragweed pollen extract tablets, in patients with an allergic rhinitis. A total of 110 out-patients were randomized (immunotherapy [I]: 55; placebo [P]: 55), of whom 99 were analyzable for efficacy (I: 48; P: 51) and 106 analyzable for safety (I: 53; P: 53). After a 28-day progression phase, the patients received a maintenance treatment during 6.5 months. Efficacy variables included a global assessment of efficacy (patient/investigator), symptoms and medication scores as well as the frequency of asthma attacks. Results: In the active treatment group, 43 patients completed the study, versus 49 on placebo. During the whole period of pollination, the difference favoring immunotherapy was highly significant for the global assessment by the patient (p = 0.004) and by the investigator (p = 0.005). Adverse reactions were reported more often in the active treatment but mild or moderate, and they abated after dose adjustment. A subgroup analysis of those patients receiving the highest dose of immunotherapy (3 tablets 3 times a week) showed a highly significant response for rhinitis and conjunctivitis total scores by comparison to lower dosages. Conclusion: This study confirms the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy and strongly suggests a dose-response relationship. Copyright © 2003 S.

Respiratory complaints were objectified via measurement of exhaled NO and inflammatory mediators in nasal lavage (NAL). During the study children, skin prick negative (n = 31) or positive to grass pollen (n = 22), HDM (n = 34) or grass pollen + HDM (n = 32), kept a daily diary on respiratory symptoms, and NAL and exhaled air was sampled twice a week. The level of air pollutants and pollen was monitored continuously. Like children sensitised to HDM, those sensitised to pollen reported respiratory complaints (shortness of breath, itchy eyes or blocked nose) more frequently than non-sensitised children during (but not before) the pollen season; the respiratory complaints of sensitised children were independent of the pollen level. In addition, exposure to increased levels of PM10 induces 'shortness of breath' in pollen- and HDM-sensitised children, whereas ozone induces a blocked nose in HDM-sensitised children. Combined exposure to PM10 + pollen and O3 + pollen induces a blocked nose in both HDM-sensitised children and children sensitised to pollen + HDM. Significant positive associations were found between eNO and the levels of NO2, CO, PM2.5 and pollen in both sensitised and non-sensitised children. At the start of the pollen season, the NAL concentration of eosinophils and ECP in pollen-sensitised children was increased compared to winter, but their levels were not further affected by increased exposure to pollen or air pollution. In conclusion, during the pollen season, sensitised children continuously report a high prevalence of respiratory complaints which coincides with increased levels of upper and lower airway inflammatory markers. No additional pro-inflammatory effect of air pollution was observed, which indicates that air pollution does not facilitate allergen-induced inflammatory responses. Copyright © 2003 S.

FISH experiments revealed three distribution patterns of rDNA sequences, distinguished by one, two and three loci of 5S genes; 18S-5.8S-25S genes were always localized at a single locus. The results add information to the genome structure of M. truncatula, revealing a pattern of distribution of rDNA genes unobserved previously, which consists of 5S genes clustered at a single locus.

University, Bawal 123 501, Haryana, India","The requirement for simultaneous increases in stover as well as grain yields in pearl millet in arid zone environments means that conventional selection for grain yield improvement through increased harvest index (HI) is not applicable to such environments. In addition, there is a need to retain the adaptive traits present in local landrace germplasm, so that new cultivars for the arid zone do not trade increased productivity for reduced yield stability and increased risk of crop failure. This research was designed to test the hypothesis that it will be possible to meet these requirements by exploiting heterosis for overall biomass production in topcross hybrids (TCH) made with adapted, landrace-derived pollinators and dual purpose male-sterile seed parents, which partition the extra biomass of their hybrids equally to grain and stover. General combining ability (GCA) estimates for seven landrace-derived populations/varieties, derived from multi-environment tests in arid zone environments, indicated that selection history played a large role in determining GCA for both biomass and HI, with prior selection (for grain yield) favoring GCA for HI at the expense of GCA for biomass. A similar analysis of a set of male-sterile seed parents indicated a wide range of GCA for both grain and stover yields, with a similar tradeoff of GCA for one trait against GCA for the other. It was, however, possible to identify several parental lines with a positive GCA for biomass, achieved by a positive GCA for growth rate, and neutral GCA for HI, resulting in positive/ neutral GCA for both stover and grain yields. A limited test of the ability of parental GCA to predict heterosis in TCH indicated that heterosis for stover yield was closely related to pollinator GCA for stover yield, and heterosis for grain yield was related to both pollinator and A-line GCA for HI. The same test confirmed the original hypothesis that crosses of parents with positive GCA for biomass/growth rate and neutral GCA for HI could produce TCH with positive heterosis for grain yield without an off-setting negative heterosis for stover yield. The frequency of such parental lines was limited, however. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this work, floral biology in relation to phenological stages of six olive cultivars was studied to obtain a comprehensive description of suitable pollenizers for 'Meski'. The level of flowering, pistillate inflorescences, viability and germination rates of pollen grains were determined for each cultivar. The flowering period of the six tested cultivars was recorded in order to determine if their flowering duration coincides fully with the bloom period of 'Meski'. Viability, germination and pollen tube elongation abilities of all the cultivars were tested. Comparison of pollen viability of all the cultivars was done using acetocarmin staining technique and the fluorescein diacetate test. The pollen showed little loss in viability and germinability over the tested storage period at -18°C.

The objectives of this study were to determine through two experiments the genetic basis of resistance to S. zeamais in African maize germplasm of open-pollinated cultivars, lines and hybrids. The first experiment tested for resistance of 20 maize cultivars (10 white and 10 yellow-grained) developed for lowland Africa grown in three relatively weevil-free savanna locations. The second experiment tested two sets of diallel crosses without reciprocals of 66 F1 progeny from 12 inbred lines and 78 F1 crosses from 13 inbred lines of subtropical and temperate origins. Variables studied for the first experiment included husk cover, grain texture, number of egg plugs, number of weevils produced, and number of grains damaged by the weevil. Results showed highly significant differences among the 20 maize cultivars tested. Significant cultivar x location interactions for egg plug and weevil production indicate the importance of environmental effects and complexity in weevil resistance. Of the 20 cultivars tested, Ikenne 83-TZSR-W-1 (open pollinated) and 8329-15 (hybrid) were the most promising for restricted weevil production and minimal grain damage. The results of genetic studies in the second experiment with 144 crosses indicated the presence of genetic differences in maize lines to weevil attack. General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability mean squares were highly significant, suggesting that the maize weevil resistance was controlled by both additive and non-additive gene actions and the inheritance was quantitative and polygenic. Among the lines used in the crosses, the two most weevil resistant lines with high GCA effects were TZi 30 (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture) and FLA2BT 106 (Florida). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We found that e.g. when both sized plants have large pollen dispersal areas relative to their seed dispersal areas, which plants are male-biased is largely determined by relative fecundity (t) and relative size of seed dispersal area (k) of the large plants to the small plants: If t>k, large plants tend to be more male-biased even if relative size of pollen dispersal area of large to small plants (l) is smaller than k. If t<k, large plants tend to be more female-biased even if with very large l, e.g. infinity l.

We predicted that early successional species would flower any time of the year, but species pollinated by different vectors as well as dioecious species would flower nonrandomly across seasons. However, there was little evidence that flowering time varied with successional status, pollen vectors, and sexual systems. As we predicted, supra-annual flowering was proportionately less common in early successional species as compared to late ones, in understory species as compared to canopy species, and in dioecious species as compared to those with hermaphroditic flowers. When considering phylogeny, however, supra-annual flowering in the understory was not as rare as predicted.

However, management methods for honey bee greenhouse tomato pollination scarcely have been explored. We 1) tested the effect of initial amounts of brood on colony population size and flight activity in screened greenhouses during the winter, and 2) compared foraging from colonies with brood used within screened and unscreened greenhouses during the summer. Brood rearing was maintained at low levels in both brood and no-brood colonies after 21 d during the winter, and emerging honey bees from both treatments had significantly lower weights than bees from outdoor colonies. Honey bee flight activity throughout the day and over the 21 d in the greenhouse was not influenced by initial brood level. In our summer experiment, brood production in screened greenhouses neared zero after 21 d but higher levels of brood were reared in unscreened greenhouses with access to outside forage. Flower visitation measured throughout the day and over the 21 d the colonies were in the greenhouse was not influenced by screening treatment. An economic analysis indicated that managing honey bees for greenhouse tomato pollination would be financially viable for both beekeepers and growers.

We elucidated the critical life stages and processes in the recruitment of Rhamnus ludovici-salvatoris, a dioecious shrub endemic to the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean), populations of which have been shrinking in recent decades. We evaluated transition probabilities between all stages involved in regeneration from pollination to seedling recruitment, in order to determine the overall probability of an ovule in a flower becoming an established individual in a population. 2. We compared populations in an oak (Quercus ilex) forest and in a more disturbed habitat (an abandoned field). We studied seed rain and probabilities of predation, germination and survival in the main microhabitats within each community. 3. High levels of seed predation after dispersal and unfavourable conditions (water deficit) during germination and recruitment periods were the most critical factors limiting population growth in both habitats. 4. The greater fecundity of shrubs in the abandoned field did not compensate for the lower probability of ovules recruiting new individuals in that habitat compared to the forest. 5. Spatial patterns of recruitment in this species cannot be predicted from seed dispersal patterns produced by frugivorous birds. In both habitats, but especially in the forest, there was strong spatial discordance between seed rain (most seeds were deposited under conspecifics) and seedling establishment. In the forest, most established Rhamnus are found under oaks, whereas in the abandoned field, saplings and juveniles are more equally distributed across different microhabitats. 6. This empirical study supports the idea that habitat disturbance, in general, may considerably alter the patterns of plant recruitment. For endemic species with restricted and rather small populations, the loss of natural habitat is likely to be detrimental for species' persistence, as recruitment in disturbed sites is greatly reduced.",Balearic Islands; Disturbance; Mediterranean habitats; Population recruitment; Seed and seedling survival; Seed dispersal by birds; Spatial variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038050747

To determine the effect of honey bees on the pollination of calamondin, three flowering trees were caged to exclude bees and three were left open to allow pollination by them. Fruit set in uncaged plants was better, thus these plants yielded more fruits than the uncaged ones, an effect attributed to the presence of pollinators such as honey bees and stingless bees. Moreover, the occurrence of minimal fruit set in caged plants indicates that calamondin, being a hermaphrodite, is capable of self-pollination.

Effects of anther arrangement on pollen deposition and removal in hermaphrodite flowers were experimentally quantified to assess the ecological significance of stamen structure. The anther arrangement of Brassica rapa was modified into six types with respect to anther number and the spatial arrangement of long and short stamens. Each anther treatment was combined with a nectar-intact and nectar-depleted treatment. After single visits by bumblebees in a glasshouse, the visit duration to each flower and the number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas and pollen grains remaining in long and short anthers were measured. 2. Visits were significantly shorter in nectar-depleted flowers. Short anthers also extended visit duration, but modification of the long anther arrangement had no effect. Pollen deposition on stigmas depended on the number of long anthers and on visit duration. Although an increase in long anther number accelerated self-pollination, removal of short anthers did not influence pollen deposition. 3. Pollen removal from long anthers depended on anther treatment and visit duration, but not on nectar availability. Any modification of anther arrangement tended to increase pollen removal during single visits. Long anthers contributed to the decrease in pollen removal per visit, while pollen removal from short anthers depended only on visit duration. Short anthers appeared to have a different function from the restriction of pollen removal during single visits by bumblebees. 4. Thus, long and short anthers made different contributions to pollination efficiency of nectar-feeding bumblebees. The maintenance of different types of stamens in Brassicaceae plants (tetradynamous stamens) may reflect functional advantages for a diverse pollination syndrome if the pollination efficiency of long and short anthers varies depending on the type of pollinator.",Brassica rapa; Bumblebee; Nectar; Pollination efficiency; Visit duration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038757665

Recently, attention has focused on the potential reproductive assurance (RA) benefit of selfing: the ability to produce seeds via autonomous selfing when the potential for outcrossing is reduced or absent. To date, there is little experimental support for this benefit under natural pollination conditions. In addition, the RA hypothesis has not been tested experimentally in a species displaying morphological variation for traits expected to influence the mating system, such as flower size, which affects both attractiveness to pollinators and ability to self autonomously. Here, we document significant among-population variation in flower size in Collinsia parviflora and show that pollinators preferred large flowers over small flowers in experimental arrays. The pollinator community varied among three study sites, and two small-flowered populations had lower pollinator visitation rates than one large-flowered population. We compared seed production between intact flowers (can self) and experimentally emasculated flowers (require a pollinator) on large-and small-flowered plants. As predicted by the RA hypothesis, small-flowered plants show a greater RA benefit of selfing than large-flowered plants; emasculated, small flowers produced very few seeds, relative to intact, small flowers or either emasculated or intact, large flowers. We also show that the RA benefit is pollination-context dependent, differing between small- and large-flowered test sites, likely due to a combination of pollinator discrimination against small flowers and differences between test sites in the pollinator community. This paper is the first experimental evidence showing a trait-dependent RA benefit of selfing under natural pollination conditions.",Autogamy; Collinsia parviflora; Floral morphology; Plant mating systems; Pollinator limitation; Reproductive assurance; Scrophulariaceae; Vancouver Island,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038010270

Genetic analyses have indicated that two dominant genes, one major (Rft1) and another minor (Rft2), were required to achieve complete fertility restoration. Though the major gene (Rft1) can cause complete fertility restoration on its own, its expression was significantly enhanced in the presence of the minor gene (Rft2). In the absence of Rft1, Rft2 caused only partial fertility restoration. We used a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs), differing for the presence/absence of Rf genes, to identify AFLP markers linked to fertility restorer genes. A total of 64 EcoRI/MseI primer combinations were surveyed which produced 3,225 bands, of which 19 (0.006%) were polymorphic between parental NILs. Primer combinations which led to the identification of polymorphic bands present in fertile parental NILs were used for assaying a mapping population of 70 F2 plants for determining the segregation pattern of markers. Initial screening resulted in the identification of five AFLP markers. The recombination analyses of these AFLP markers revealed that at least two (EACC/MCTT105, EAAG/MCTC80) were present in the same linkage group along with the Rf loci. Marker EACC/MCTT105 was separated from the major gene (Rft1) by a distance of 18.1 cM, while it was 33.2 cM away from the minor fertility restorer gene (Rft2). Another marker EAAG/MCTC80 was also located adjacent to Rft1 at a distance of 18.1 cM, but on other side. Identification of flanking markers (EACC/MCTT105, EAAG/MCTC80) for the major fertility restorer gene (Rft1) provides a crucial component for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning of the restorer genes, and can hence be used to construct elite restorer genotypes.",AFLP markers; Brassica napus; Cytoplasmic male sterility; Fertility restorer gene; Tournefortii CMS,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037812918

To gain a better understanding of how intensity of crop management affects yield, we conducted a comparative study contrasting high and low intensity management in 1997, 1999, and 2000. High-intensity management (HM) included the use of trickle irrigation, black plastic mulch, insecticides, and fungicides, not used under low-intensity management (LM). We examined the effects of management intensity on watermelon productivity, the variation in such effects among watermelon cultivars, and the mediating effect of survival of watermelon plants, abundance of insect pests, and incidence of anthracnose (% leaves with anthracnose lesions). The results indicated that HM produced 100% greater marketable fruit yield per area and marketable fraction of total fruit than LM in 2 out of 3 years. The effect of management intensity on plant survival was related to this effect on yield in 1 out of 2 years, and contributed to the latter by increasing weight and number of marketable fruit per plant under HM. We detected no significant effect of abundance of insect pests and incidence of anthracnose on yield. There was variation in the effect of management intensity on yield among watermelon cultivars in 1 out of 3 years. The triploid 'Gem Dandy' showed great differences in yield between HM and LM in 2 years, producing on average 28.9 Mg·ha-1 of marketable fruit yield under HM compared to 14.0 Mg·ha-1 under LM. 'Gem Dandy' also produced 100% higher yield of marketable fruit per area, per plant, and marketable fraction of total fruit than the open-pollinated diploid 'Allsweet' or the diploid hybrid 'Sangria.' Each year during the 3-year study, all three cultivars had a similar density of insect pests, incidence of anthracnose, and plant survival after transplant and at harvest.

Both partners of this interaction show extensive variation in their respective biology. Here we investigate Ficus life-history trait evolution and fig/fig wasp coadaptation in the context of a well-resolved molecular phylogeny. Mapping out variations in Ficus life-history traits on an independently derived phylogeny constructed from ribosomal DNA sequences (external and internal transcribed spacer) reveals several parallel transitions in Ficus growth habit and breeding system. Convergent trait evolution might explain the discrepancies between morphological analyses and our molecular reconstruction of the genus. Morphological characters probably correlate with growth habit and breeding system and could therefore be subject to convergent evolution. Furthermore, we reconstruct the evolution of Ficus inflorescence characters that are considered adaptations to the pollinators. Our phylogeny reveals convergences in ostiole shape, stigma morphology, and stamen:ovule ratio. Statistical tests taking into account the phylogenetic relationship of the species show that transitions in ostiole shape are correlated with variation in wasp pollinator head shape, and evolutionary changes in stigma morphology and stamen:ovule ratio correlate with changes in the pollination behavior of the associated wasp. These correlations provide evidence for reciprocal adaptations of morphological characters between these mutualistic partners that have interacted over a long evolutionary time. In light of previous ecological studies on mutualism, we discuss the adaptive significance of these correlations and what they can tell us about the coevolutionary process occurring between figs and their pollinators.",Active pollination; Coadaptation; Comparative analysis; Figs; Parametric bootstrap; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037626869

Exploiters have been widely assumed to destabilize mutualisms, yet they are common. We develop models to explore conditions for local coexistence of obligate plant/pollinating seed parasite mutualisms and nonpollinating exploiters. As the larvae of both pollinators and (at a later time) exploiters consume seeds, we examine the importance of intraspecific and (asymmetric) interspecific competition among and between pollinators and exploiters for achieving three-way coexistence. With weak intra- and interspecific competition, exploiters can invade the stable mutualism and coexist with the mutualists (either stably or with oscillations), provided the exploiters' intrinsic birthrate (bE) slightly exceeds that of the pollinators. At higher bE, all three species go locally extinct. When facing strong interspecific competition, exploiters cannot invade and coexist with the mutualists if intraspecific competition in pollinators and exploiters is weak. However, strong intraspecific competition in pollinators and exploiters facilitates exploiter invasion and coexistence and greatly expands the range of bE over which stable coexistence occurs. Our results suggest that mutualist/exploiter coexistence may be more easily achieved than previously thought, thus highlighting the need for a better understanding of competition among and between mutualists and exploiters.",Coexistence; Competition; Exploiter; Obligate mutualism; Pollinating seed parasite; Yucca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037626644

The annual values of pollen concentration varied, and a significant decrease was observed during 2000. The greatest airborne pollen record was in October with an average of 82.3% in relation to its total concentration during 1998-2000. Based on the intradiurnal behaviour analysis, it was observed that the maximum pollination peak occurs at 2H when the temperature reaches its maximum values.

A second minor emission peak for MeSA occurs in the morning/day. To understand these emission patterns, we have studied in detail the temporal regulation of the last step of the biosynthetic pathway of MeSA, the convertion of salicylic acid (SA) to MeSA catalysed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine : salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT). We observed that in young flowers a maximum in SAMT activity occurs in the night, and that in flowers which were open longer than 4 days, two SAMT activity maxima occurred per day. These maxima correlated well with dawn and dusk and the previously detected MeSA emission peaks. The SAMT mRNA levels, however, have a broad maximum during the dark phase, while the SAMT protein levels continuously increase during floral development without showing dairy rhythms. Furthermore, under continuous illumination (LL) the SAMT mRNA levels and activity patterns oscilrate, suggesting the involvement of a circadian clock in the regulation network. Taken together, this analysis clearly demonstrates that regulation of MeSA emission occurs both at the transcriptional and post-translational levers, indicating that control at more than one level is necessary to guarantee the precise timing of volatile emission in flowers of S. floribunda.",Circadian clock; S-adenosyl-L-methionine : salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (SAMT); Stephanotis floribunda; Transcriptional and post-translational regulation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038011605

We first used distance analyses to determine which coding method(s) best distinguishes species while grouping conspecifics. Results suggest that interspecific differences in fragrance composition were maximized by coding as presence/absence of fragrance compounds and biosynthetic pathways rather than when quantitative information was also included. Useful systematic information came from both compounds and pathways and from fragrance emitted by both floral and vegetative tissues. The coding methods that emerged from the distance analyses as best distinguishing species were then adapted for use in phylogenetic analysis. Although hierarchical signal among fragrance data sets was congruent, this signal was highly incongruent with the phylogenetic signal in the DNA sequence data. Notably, topologies inferred from fragrance data sets were congruent with the DNA topology only in the most distal portions (e.g., sister group pairs or closely related species that had similar fragrance profiles were often recovered by analyses of fragrance). Examination of consistency and retention indices for individual fragrance compounds and pathways as optimized onto one of the most-parsimonious trees inferred from DNA data revealed that although most compounds were homoplastic, some compounds were perfectly congruent with the DNA phylogeny. In particular, compounds and pathways found in a few taxa were less homoplastic than those found in many taxa. Pathways that synthesize few volatiles also seem to have lower homoplasy than those that produce many. Although fragrance data as a whole may not be useful in phylogeny reconstruction, these data can provide additional support for clades reconstructed with other types of characters. Factors other than phylogeny, including pollinator interactions, also likely influence fragrance composition.",Acleisanthes; Character coding; Four o'clocks; Fragrance; Mirabilis; Phylogenetics; Scent; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038825264

Since 'Femminello' lemon normally reproduces apomictically by nucellar embryony, an embryo-rescue technique was applied 105 days after pollination to recover zygotic embryos. Sixty-six plantlets were regenerated as follows: 20 from the 4nX2n cross and 46 from the 2nX2n cross. In order to distinguish zygotic embryos from nucellars, flow cytometry was applied on all the 66 plantlets; and a modified amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) technique and microsatellite analysis were carried out on a sample of 20 seedlings (six triploids and 14 diploids). Here, we report the usefulness and reliability of the tested techniques and discuss the results obtained. Flow cytometry (FCM) was useful only in interploid crosses, identifying six triploids, four of which were also detected by simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis and only two by modified AFLP.

A Scheffe's test was carried out before the correlation analysis to establish years corresponding to the same statistical population. The results obtained from both tests were used for a regression analysis to establish the prediction patterns for this taxon. Even when a negative correlation coefficient was presented, the influence of this parameter did not decline. Previous temperatures in the main pollination period, however, were a determinant factor predicting the onset and intensity of Alnus flowering. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023973972

Because Cr2 is dominant and results in a conspicuous hypersensitive reaction (HR) in pine needles, the phenotype can readily be detected in offspring of susceptible seed parents fertilized by unknown Cr2 donors in the ambient pollen cloud. Gametic frequencies of Cr2 were thus determined as the proportion of total challenged seedlings that were pollen receptors exhibiting the Cr2 phenotype. Zygotic frequencies, the proportion of seed parents with progeny that segregated in Mendelian ratios for the Cr2 phenotype to the total number of parents, were a complementary, though less precise, measure. Cr2 frequency was rare overall, ranging from 0.004 to 0.008 in the Sierra Nevada to about 0.001 in the central Cascade Range; it was undetectable further north in the Cascades, as well as in the Rocky Mountains and Coast Mountains of the United States and Canada. The diminishing frequency of Cr2 from the southern and central Sierra Nevada northward mirrors that of Cr1 in sugar pine (P. lambertiana) and points to this region as the origin of both genes. We rationalize that this coincidence may have resulted from protection that these genes may have conferred on both species to an endemic pine stem rust congeneric with C. ribicola (C. occidentale) in recent geologic epochs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037609586

We selected 23 bats of 8 species for radiotelemetry and the areas used by them varied from 65 to 530 ha. Some species restricted their activity to the vicinity of their roosts, rarely moving more than 500 m away, but others traveled greater distances between roosts and foraging areas. All tracked bats flew over savannas, crossing distances from 0.5 to 2.5 km. Roost location and type varied among species, from individuals roosting alone in the foliage to colonies in buildings.

At this altitude the climate is harsh and the growing season short. Hence, plant and animal communities, constituting the sub-alpine plant-flower-visitor network, are clearly delimited, both spatially and temporally. We investigated species composition and interaction structure of this system. A total of 11 plant species (91% endemics) and 37 flower-visiting animal species (62% endemics) formed 108 interactions. Numbers of interactions among species varied ten-fold within both plant and animal communities. Generalization level of a species was positively correlated with its local abundance. Two separate network analyses revealed a significantly nested structure. In relation to a plant-flower-visitor system, nestedness implies that specialized species (animals or plants) interact with a subset of the species pool visiting (animals) or being visited (plants) by more generalized species. Therefore, specialized, locally rare plants tend to be visited by generalized, locally abundant animals, and specialized, locally rare animals tend to utilize generalized, locally abundant food plants. Such patterns could have implications for conservation of the sub-alpine network, and stress the importance of preserving not only rare species, but also the more abundant ones, which may be key food resources or pollinators in the plant-flower-visitor network.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038725602

Most estimators of the number of alleles present in natural populations are designed for gametophytic self-incompability systems (GSI) in which the recognition phenotype of the pollen is determined by its own haploid genotype. In sporophytic systems (SSI), the recognition phenotype of the pollen is determined by the diploid genotype of its parent, and dominance differs among alleles. We describe research aimed at estimates of S-allele numbers in a natural population of Arabidopsis lyrata (Brassicaceae), whose SSI system has recently been described. Using a combination of pollination studies and PCR-based identification of alleles at a locus equivalent to the Brassica SRK gene, we identified and sequenced 11 putative alleles in a sample of 20 individuals from different maternal seed sets. The pollination results indicate that we have not amplified all alleles that must be present. Extensive partial incompatibility, nonreciprocal compatibility differences, and evidence of weakened expression of SI in some genotypes, prevent us from determining the exact number of missing alleles based only on cross-pollination data. Although we show that none of the theoretical models currently proposed is completely appropriate for estimating the number of alleles in this system, we estimate that there are between 13 and 16 different S-alleles in our sample, probably between 16 and 25 alleles in the population, and discuss the relative frequency of alleles in relation to dominance.",Arabidopsis lyrata; Brassicaceae; Partial incompatibility; S-alleles; Sporophytic self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037791752

Our results reveal that genetic variation in photochemical quenching and yield of photosystem II exists within this species. The pattern of variation found in these traits is consistent with the variance profile expected to occur as a result of segregation among nuclear genes. Variation among families accounted for 17% of the total variation observed in photochemical quenching, whereas the component for trees within families made up slightly more than 25% of the total. Less variation, both among families as well as among trees within families, was found for yield of photosystem II. A strikingly different pattern was observed for nonphotochemical quenching. Other than the error term, only pretreatment effects contributed significantly to the variation observed. This suggests that nonphotochemical quenching is largely influenced by environmental factors.

Ants exert selection on flower scent, size and shape in skypilots by damaging the pistils. Here, I report on the frequency and nature of contact between ants and pollen-bearing anthers and determine the consequences of such contact for pollen performance and pollen donor paternity. In laboratory trials, ants entered flowers with full intact anthers and emasculated (female) flowers equivalently. Similarly, flower visitation rates of ants foraging naturally were not affected by the frequency of male phase flowers per plant. Ants actively interacted with the pollen-bearing anthers during 21% of flower visits, on average. The rate at which such interactions occurred was predicted by the proportion of flowers in the male phase, under a random foraging model. The effect of ants on pollen fertility was tested experimentally by enclosing ants in male-phase flowers on intact inflorescences. Adjacent control flowers were left un-occupied. Pollen from flowers with a history of ant occupancy had significantly lower germination on virgin recipient stigmas than pollen from unoccupied control flowers. With hand-pollination, sufficient pollen was transferred from ant-occupied flowers to saturate seed set. However, a model based on the relationship between seed set and compatible pollen delivery by natural pollinators indicated that ant damage to pollen should reduce paternity accruing per flower visit by 20-26% on average, in nature.

In this study, pollen-mediated dispersal of transgenes via cross-fertilization was examined. Plants of Lotus corniculatus L. transformed with either the Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase gene asnA or the ?-glucuronidase gene uidA, were used as the pollen donor. Nontransgenic plants belonging to the species L. corniculatus L., L. tenuis Waldst. and Kit. ex Willd, and L. pedunculatus Cav., were utilized as recipients. Two experimental fields were established in two areas of central Italy. Plants carrying the uidA gene were partially sterile, therefore only the asnA gene was used as a tracer marker. No transgene flow between L. corniculatus transformants and the nontransgenic L. tenuis and L. pedunculatus plants was detected. As regards non-transgenic L. corniculatus plants, in one location flow of asnA transgene was detected up to 18 m from the 1.8 m2 donor plot.

Variation in elemental composition among five full-term seed sources was minimal providing elemental composition targets for somatic embryos. Seed tissues from two open-pollinated families, grown in different locations, were analyzed across the sequence of development. Significant changes in elemental composition occurred over time. Phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium and zinc contents in the FG were highest during early seed development while sulfur and iron were relatively constant. The lowest copper levels were detected during early FG development. Zygotic embryos attained maximum potassium, calcium, manganese and zinc content during early embryo development. Embryo phosphorus, magnesium, and iron generally increased across embryo development. Both seed collections showed minimal values of embryo iron content at stages 4-7 followed by gradual increases until embryos stopped growth. Sulfur and copper were fairly constant; lowest copper occurred during early embryo stages. Patterns for sodium and boron were not consistent in the two open-pollinated families analyzed for either FG or embryo tissues. One family showed peaks in sodium and boron during early embryo development. The second family showed similar levels for sodium and boron through embryo development.

Embryo dry weight during in planta development increased between 80 and 140 d after pollination (DAP) and was then stable until maturity. Embryos underwent dehydration until 120 DAP, but their moisture content remained high at maturity (c. 2g H2Og-1 DW). Desiccation tolerance was acquired between 83 and 104 DAP, and was positively correlated with embryo age and dry weight, and negatively correlated with initial water content during this period. Sucrose, the main soluble sugar present throughout embryo development, accounted for an average of 24% of the dry weight. Glucose and fructose contents decreased to less than 1 mg g-1 DW in embryos at maturity. At 117 DAP, as embryos became tolerant to desiccation, the monosaccharides/sucrose ratio fell to 0.015 and raffinose was detected. Stachyose appeared later in 147-day-old embryos and accumulated until shedding. In vitro culture of immature embryos in the presence of high sucrose concentrations (350 and 700 mM) resulted in an increase in their dry weight and a decrease in their water content, and induced the acquisition of desiccation tolerance. Under these conditions, sucrose accumulated in embryos to 30-40% on a dry weight basis, but neither raffinose nor stachyose was detected. Acquisition of desiccation tolerance by oil palm immature embryos was associated both in planta and in vitro with an accumulation of dry matter, a reduction of moisture content, and a fall in the monosaccharides/sucrose ratio. In planta, survival to dehydration was also related with the deposition of oligosaccharides whereas in vitro, it was related with high sucrose accumulation.

The paternity of individual seeds resulting from mixed pollination was determined by isozyme analysis. No evidence for pollen competition was found. Instead, seed paternity reflected the level of self-incompatibility of each tree as determined by separate self- and cross-pollinations. Furthermore, the number of seeds set per capsule following mixed pollination was significantly less than that following cross-pollination in the two least self-compatible trees.

Reproductive development and seed dispersal occupied approximately half of the 4-month growth cycle. Flowers of B. muelleri did not have any obvious self-incompatibility systems and were readily selfed to produce viable seed. It appeared that B. muelleri may be preferentially cross-pollinated under ideal conditions of pollinator visitation, but could revert to self-pollination in the event of outcross failure. Seed dispersal was assisted by the epinastic curvature of peduncles as fruit matured, bringing capitula into contact with the soil a short distance away from the parent plant. Slight wind-stimulated movement of the capitulum was sufficient to dislodge seed directly onto the soil surface. Seed was shed in the immediate vicinity of parent plants and although some short-range movement facilitated by rain splash, water flow and gravity was observed, no long-distance dispersal mechanisms were apparent. Annual seed production of the single extant population of B. muelleri in South Australia was estimated at about 5 million seeds. Immediately after dispersal, the soil seed bank in the vicinity of B. muelleri plants contained, on average, over 1700 germinable seeds m-2. Many of these seeds germinated or died within a year, the remainder persisting into a second or third year. Seed viability under field-burial conditions declined to less than 10% over that time.

On the other hand, early flowering species may benefit by escaping the peak of flower and/or seed predator activity. Previous studies have implicated unpredictable weather conditions and the inactivity of pollinator and predator insects early in spring as causes of severe pollen limitation and light predation in early flowering species. However, differences not only in flowering schedule, but also in floral morphological traits and breeding systems, could induce variations in fruit set and intensity of predation among species. Comparing two species while simultaneously observing individual flowers within species could help determine the cause of these interspecific differences. For four years, I followed the fate of individual flowers, from bud to fruit, in two Vaccinium species that bloom successively in spring and share pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators. My predictions were as follows: (1) the early flowering species, V. hirtum, would not easily gain pollinator services because of low ambient temperature, and its fruit set would be low in comparison with the late flowering species, V. smallii; (2) the early flowering species would avoid attacks by flower and pre-dispersal seed predators via phenological escape from the predators' activity peak. Hand-pollination experiments showed both species had incomplete self-compatibility, with bumblebees required for pollination. As predicted, only the early flowering species seemed to suffer from pollen limitation. However, Studies of individual flowers suggested that pollen limitation resulted not only from pollinator limitation early in spring, but also from geitonogamy and reproductive interference between plant species. Moth and fly larvae consumed flowers and fruit, while the pre-dispersal seed predator was a weevil (Mecysmoderes sp.). Far from escaping flower and seed predation, the early flowering species suffered more severe insect attacks than the late flowering species in two years out of four. Studies of individual flowers clearly showed that flower predators' activity was not limited, even in the early weeks of the flowering season.",Bumblebee; Flowering phenology; Mecysmoderes; Pre-dispersal seed predation; Temporal variation; Vaccinium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037656442

Goodwin, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","Studies focusing on pairwise interactions between plants and herbivores may not give an accurate picture of the overall selective effect of herbivory, given that plants are often eaten by a diverse array of herbivore species. The outcome of such interactions may be further complicated by the effects of plant hybridization. Hybridization can lead to changes in morphological, phenological and chemical traits that could in turn alter plant-herbivore interactions. Here we present results from manipulative field experiments investigating the interactive effects of multiple herbivores and plant hybridization on the reproductive success of Ipomopsis aggregata formosissima XI. tenuituba. Results showed that ungulate herbivores alone had a net positive effect on plant relative fitness, increasing seed production approximately 2-fold. Caterpillars had no effect on plant relative fitness when acting alone, with caterpillar-attacked plants producing the same number of flowers, fruits and seeds as the uneaten controls. Caterpillars, however, significantly reduced flower production of ungulate browsed plants. Flower production in these plants, however, was still significantly greater (approximately 1.7-fold greater) than uneaten controls, likely leading to an increase in reproductive success through the paternal component of fitness given that fruit and seed production was not significantly different from that of herbivore-free controls. Although results suggest that herbivore imposed selection is pairwise, ungulates likely have a large influence on the abundance of, and hence the amount of damage caused by, caterpillar herbivores. Thus, because of the ecological interactions between ungulates and caterpillars, selection on Ipomopsis may be diffuse rather than pairwise, assuming such interactions translate into differential effects on plant fitness as herbivore densities vary. Plant hybridization had no significant effect on patterns of ungulate or caterpillar herbivory; i.e., no significant interactions were detected between herbivory and plant hybridization for any of the fitness traits measured in this study nor did plant hybridization have any significant effect on host preference. These results may be due to patterns of introgression or the lack of species-specific differences between I. aggregata formosissima and I. tenuituba. Plant hybridization per se resulted in lowered reproductive success of white colored morphs due in part to the effects of pollination. Although it appears that there would be strong directional selection favoring darker flower colors due to the lower reproductive success of the white colored morphs in the short run, the natural distribution of hybrids suggest that over the long run selection either tends to average out or there are no fitness differences among morphs in most years due to the additive fitness effects of hawkmoth and hummingbird pollinators.",Cervus elaphus; Heliothis phloxiphaga; Herbivory; Hybridization; Ipomopsis aggregata formossissma; Ipomopsis tenuituba; Odocoileus hemionus; Pairwise vs. diffuse coevolutionary interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038332048

Seed coats isolated from the immature nuts between 15 and 40 days after pollination were superior in the induction of somatic embryos. Only 35% of seed coat halves induced somatic embryos. Somatic embryos developed best on MS medium fortified with 13.3 ?M benzyladenine (BA), 271.5 ?M adenine sulphate (Ads) and 2.7 ?M naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). On this medium, an average of 3.3 embryos were developed per half seed coat. Embryos originated from the inner layer of the seed coat. Transfer of the embryos to fresh induction medium facilitated development of secondary somatic embryogenesis (more than 10 embryos per primary embryo).

The variables were tree size (trunk diameter), available phosphorus in the soil, floral phenotypic sex expression (i.e. gynoecium biomass allocation), flower production, fruits initiated, and length of the corolla and diameter of its opening. The path model explained 79.9% of the total variation, and the production of mature fruits was related in large part by the number of fruits initiated and by phenotypic sex expression. In turn, fruits initiated were related to corolla tube diameter and to a lesser extent to corolla tube length. The model could explain a low percentage of the variation (18.5%) of the number of fruits initiated, but once a fruit was initiated it had a high probability of maturing. Phenotypic sex expression related negatively to the number of flowers produced and positively, to almost the same degree, to available phosphorus in the soil. Tree size had a positive effect on flower production but a negligible effect on fruits initiated and matured. Soil phosphorus affected positively, although weakly all variables. The relationships between tree size, number of flowers and phenotypic sex expression suggested that abundant flowering in this species functions more for pollen donation than its reception.",Breeding systems; Convolvulaceae; Path analysis; Pollination; Reproductive success; Sexual selection; Tropical dry forest; Tropical tree,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038670656

The objective of this study was to determine if the number of viable hybrid seed produced directly from this wide cross could be improved by optimizing female/male parent selection when treated with various hormones in the presence or absence of a surfactant (Triton X-100). Individual or combination treatments of BA (6-benzylaminopurine), GA3 (gibberellic acid), and/or NAA (?-naphthaleneacetic acid) were applied (both with and without surfactant) to the ovaries of two L. esculentum female parents (Fla 7613 and 89S) one day following pollination by nine L. chilense accessions. Hormone applications over 1-, 3-, and 5-day periods were made and all treatments were compared to a distilled water control. Across all experiments 21 viable hybrids from 1920 fruits (1.1%) were obtained from 2128 pollinations. There were five consistent trends observed across three experiments. First, treatments utilizing NAA produced more hybrids than any other treatment hormone. Second, eight of the total 21 hybrids resulted from five consecutive days of hormone treatments (P-value ?0.01), and six of those eight were realized when NAA was involved. Third, the use of Triton X-100 in combination with the hormone treatments significantly reduced the number of fruits/pollination (P-value ?0.01), but did not significantly reduce the number of overall viable hybrids (P-value &gt;0.4). Fourth, the L. chilense male parent LA2759 significantly produced the most interspecific hybrids (P-value ?0.04), seven hybrids from 295 fruits, compared to the male parent LA130 which did not produce any hybrids (from 293 fruits) - other accessions were intermediate. Fifth, nearly ten times more hybrids were produced from crosses with Fla 7613 than with 89S.

Here we report genetic data demonstrating the coexistence of previously undetected cryptic fig wasp species in at least half of the host fig species surveyed. The substantial mitochondrial sequence differences (4.2-6.1%) imply old divergences (?1.5-5.1 million years ago) among these species. Furthermore, some cryptic species pairs seem to be sister taxa, whereas others clearly are not, indicating both long-term coexistence on shared hosts and the colonization of novel fig species. These findings undermine the prevalent notion of strict one-to-one specificity between cospeciating figs and their pollinators, thereby challenging existing theory concerning the evolution and stability of mutualisms. Moreover, the incorporation of the genetic information significantly improves the fit of the observed sex ratios to predictions of local matecompetition theory, further strengthening support for sex allocation theory and the precision of adaptation.",Coevolution; Ficus; Fig wasp; Local mate competition; Symbiosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038624013

Here, we show that fruit set of the self-fertilizing highland coffee (Coffea arabica) is highly variable and related to bee pollination. In a comparison of 24 agroforestry systems in Indonesia, the fruit set of coffee could be predicted by the number of flower-visiting bee species, and it ranged from ca. 60% (three species) to 90% (20 species). Diversity, not abundance, explained variation in fruit set, so the collective role of a species-rich bee community was important for pollination success. Additional experiments showed that single flower visits from rare solitary species led to higher fruit set than with abundant social species. Pollinator diversity was affected by two habitat parameters indicating guild-specific nesting requirements: the diversity of social bees decreased with forest distance, whereas the diversity of solitary bees increased with light intensity of the agroforestry systems. These results give empirical evidence for a positive relationship between ecosystem functions such as pollination and biodiversity.

However, empirical demonstrations of frequency-dependent reproductive success are rare, particularly in plants. We investigate this problem by manipulating the frequencies of style morphs in a natural population of Narcissus assoanus, a self-incompatible herb with style-length dimorphism and intra-morph compatibility. We predicted that the reproductive success of morphs would vary negatively with their frequency because of the effects of morph-specific differences in sex-organ position on patterns of pollen transfer. This prediction was generally supported. The fruit and seed set of the two morphs did not differ significantly in plots with 1:1 morph ratios. However, short-styled plants produced significantly fewer seeds than long-styled plants in monomorphic plots, and significantly more seeds than long-styled plants in plots with 'long-biased' morph ratios. These patterns indicate that in the absence of physiological barriers to intra-morph mating, negative frequency-dependent selection contributes to the maintenance of stylar polymorphism through inter-morph pollen transfer. Our experimental results also provide insights into the mechanisms governing the biased style-morph ratios in populations of Narcissus species.",Amaryllidaceae; Frequency-dependent selection; Pollination; Stigma-height dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037650220

This study investigated the effects of flowers distribution, tree shape, charging levels, and airflow characteristics on the amount of pollen deposited artificially by an electrostatic pollinator on various tree parts. Deposition tests were made on a simulated tree constructed in the laboratory and in a commercial almond orchard where supplementation of charged pollen to conventional honeybee pollination was examined. Fruit-set and pollen germination were evaluated. The laboratory tests showed that charging the pollen can cause an order-of-magnitude increase in deposition on all branches, although more pollen was deposited in regions closer to the applicator or the periphery. The enhancement due to electrostatic pollination was more moderate in the field tests, but was greater in the medial than in the outer parts.

'Preference to an insect group by a plant species' was expressed as a significant deviation of the actual proportion (i.e. the proportion of the number of flower visits by the insect group to the plant species in the total number of visits to the plant species) of the expected proportion (i.e. the proportion of the number of visits by the insect group in the total visits during its flowering period). 'Preference to a plant species by an insect group' was similarly expressed using the number of flowers of the plant species visited by the insect group. Most significant preferences varied temporally or spatially. Variability in the preferences is suggested to have resulted from temporal and spatial variations in the abundance and species composition of both flowers and insects. However, in species showing variable preferences, significant specialization in the pollinator insect group (i.e. relatively constant, mutual preferences) were demonstrated for seven and five plant species at the two study sites, respectively.

This asynchrony is partially responsible of reduced kernel set at the ear tip, and hybrids differ in this trait. The objective of this work was to analyze the pattern of floret and silk differentiation and elongation at different spikelet positions (Sn) along the apical ear of two hybrids of contrasting ear size (DEA ? 500 spikelets ear-1; DK696 ? 800 spikelets ear-1). At silking, both hybrids had reached approximately the same proportion of final ear length (about 44%), but DK696 had differentiated a greater number of spikelets row-1 (46 spikelets) than DEA (33 spikelets). Silk initiation rate was always faster than spikelet initiation rate, and silk extension dynamics was similar for all spikelet positions. Silks from the base of the ear were always longer than those from the tip (S25 in DEA or S35 in DK696). Before pollination, silks experienced an early phase of exponential elongation followed by a phase of linear growth. A drastic reduction in elongation rate followed silk emergence, which did not occur when ears were bagged and pollination was prevented. Convergence in silking among spikelets along the ear could be attained by (i) synchronous silk initiation among spikelet positions, followed by a similar pattern of silk elongation in all florets (hybrid DEA), or (ii) increased silk elongation rate in apical florets (hybrid DK696).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038034090

Leaf concentrations of condensed tannins and seven different phenolic glucosides were determined by using butanol-HCl and HPLC analyses. Insect herbivore leaf damage was measured on the same leaves as used for chemical analyses. We found hybrids to be approximately intermediate between the parental species: S. caprea with high levels of condensed tannins and no phenolic glucosides, and S. repens with low levels of condensed tannins and high levels of phenolic glucosides. We also found a negative correlation between concentrations of condensed tannins and phenolic glucosides, suggesting a trade-off in production of these two substances. F2 hybrids and the hybrid back-crossed to S. caprea were significantly more damaged by insect herbivores than the parental species and the F1 hybrid, indicating reduced resistance and possibly a selective disadvantage for these hybrid categories.",Chrysomelidae; Condensed tannins; Herbivore resistance; Phenolic glucosides; S. repens; Salix caprea; Willows,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038515325

Here we investigate the importance of flower heliotropism as a source of parental environmental effects on pollen quality and performance. Flowers of the snow buttercup, Ranunculus adoneus, closely track the sun's rays. We experimentally restrained flowers to test for effects of heliotropism on pollen quality and performance after pollination. When equivalent amounts of pollen were transferred to recipient pistils, pollen from solar-tracking donor flowers exhibited a 32% advantage in germination compared to pollen from stationary (tethered) donor flowers. By the end of anthesis, pistils of tracking flowers contained 40% more germinating pollen grains and 44% more pollen tubes midway down the style than pistils of stationary ones. Solar tracking had no direct effect on pollen tube growth. The greater amount of germinating pollen in tracking flowers accounted for the treatment effect on pollen tube density. A survey of pollen receipt and pollen germination in naturally tracking flowers indicated that solar tracking primarily affects pollen tube density by promoting pollen germination rather than pollen deposition. We conclude that flower heliotropism, by enhancing the paternal environment for pollen development and the maternal environment for pollen germination, represents a source of positive parental environmental effects on pollen performance in snow buttercups.",Flower heliotropism; Maternal environmental effects; Paternal environmental effects; Ranunculaceae; Ranunculus adoneus; Solar-tracking flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038514183

The droplet that forms on the calyptra of unopened flowers was artificially pollinated, but no pollen tubes appeared to grow through it to the gynoecium of female flowers. Calyptra droplets occur on both female and male (having reduced female structures) flowers of this dioecious plant. It is considered unlikely that a drop pollination mechanism, analogous to that found in some gymnosperms, is at work in T. insipida, and it is proposed that one possible droplet function is as a ""reward"" to potential pollinators in advance of flower opening. Pollen tubes were observed to grow almost exclusively along epidermal cells. Early thoughts on angiosperm transmission tissue are re-examined and built upon. It is proposed that the male gametophyte conduction tissue in angiosperms is homologous with epidermal tissue, and that pollen tube passage occurred originally solely along the surface of specialized epidermal cells, or possibly for short distances along unspecialized regions covered with exudate derived from these cells.

Additionally, we found a clear difference in female phenology of florets in self-pollinated capitula compared with florets in cross-pollinated capitula. Female florets in self-pollinated capitula remained receptive for longer time. These results suggest that Scalesia affinis is partly self-incompatible.

Whereas pollinators' foraging behavior suggested a high potential for geitonogamy (70% of the flights occur within plants), microsatellite analyses of seed progenies demonstrated that plants are primarily outcrossing (outcrossing rate [tm] = 0.65, 0.96, and 1 in three populations). Given the relatively long pollen viability (at least 4-5 d) and the high number of simultaneously opened flowers on each plant, protandry is not sufficient to eliminate selfing. Second, controlled crosses demonstrated not only auto-fertility, but also partial self-incompatibility. Partial self-incompatibility is probably due to the competitive advantage of cross vs. self-pollen, and, together with protandry, could lead the species to selfing as a reproductive assurance. These results are encouraging for the maintenance of large populations. However, higher selfing was observed in a small population that could suffer inbreeding depression, as observed on experimentally selfed seeds. Thus, these populations should be carefully monitored.

Moreover, gene tree does not necessary represent the true species tree because of random sorting of polymorphic alleles in different lineages. A solution to these problems is to use many amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) distributed throughout the whole genome, to infer cladistic and phenetic among-species relationships. Phylogenetic relationships among interfertile species of Trollius L. (Ranunculaceae) were investigated using nuclear DNA (ITS1 + 5.8S rRNA+ITS2) and chloroplast DNA (trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergene spacer) sequences, and AFLP markers. ITS sequences were not informative at the intrageneric level, but confirmed the sister relationship between Trollius and Adonis genera, and provided new information on the phylogenetic relationships among five Ranunculaceae genera. Chloroplast DNA was more informative among Trollius species, but not consistent with the sections previously described. AFLP proved to be a powerful tool to resolve the complex genetic relationships between the morphological entities constituting the genus Trollius. Although as much as 76.1% of the total AFLP variability was found within a priori defined morphological groups, the remaining 23.9% variability differentiating groups was sufficient to generate congruent and robust cladistic and phenetic trees. Several morphological traits, independent from those used to define groups, were mapped onto the molecular phylogeny, and their evolution discussed in relation to the absence/presence of pollinator-seed parasite Chiastocheta flies. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Although total sugar concentrations (glucose, fructose and sucrose) are the same in both types, relative concentrations are different, ""real"" pollen being sucrose-rich (S/[G + F] = 1.2) and feed pollen glucose-fructose-rich (S/[G + F] = 0.3). A lower degree of dehydration, pore intine protrusion and higher monosaccharide content could make feed pollen more digestible for pollinators. On the other hand, the cytological features of ""real"" pollen (high dehydration, higher sucrose content) points to longer viability and reproductive function.",Feed pollen; Lagerstroemia indica; Pollen carbohydrates; Pollenkitt,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042125559

C. abyssinica is an annual cruciferous oil crop with a high content of erucic acid in the seed oil valuable for technical purposes. UV-irradiated mesophyll protoplasts of C. abyssinica cv 'Carmen' and cv 'Galactica' were fused with hypocotyl protoplasts of different genotypes of B. napus cv 'Maplus' and breeding line '11502'. Shoot regeneration frequency varied between 6.1% and 20.8% among the different doses of UV-irradiation, ranging from 0.05 J/cm2 to 0.30 J/cm2. In total, 124 shoots were regenerated, of which 20 asymmetric somatic hybrids were obtained and verified by nuclear DNA content and AFLP analysis. AFLP data showed that some of the characteristic bands from C. abyssinica were present in the hybrids. Cytological analysis of these hybrids showed that 9 out of 20 asymmetric hybrids had 38 chromosomes, the others contained 40-78 chromosomes, having additional chromosomes between 2 and 40 beyond the 38 expected for B. napus. The investigation into the fertility of asymmetric somatic hybrids indicated that the fertility increased with increasing UV-doses ranging from 0.05 J/cm2 to 0.15 J/cm2. All of the hybrids were cultured to full maturity, and could be fertilized and set seeds after self-pollination or backcrosses with B. napus. An analysis of fatty acid composition in the seeds was conducted and found to contain significantly greater amounts of erucic acid than B. napus.

Corn oil is primarily composed of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Delta-12 desaturase in plants converts oleic acid (18:1) to linoleic acid (18:2) by inserting a double bond at the delta-12 position. Fatty acid desaturase-2 (fad2) encodes delta-12 desaturase that functions in the endoplasmic reticulum while fatty acid desaturase-6 (fad6) encodes delta-12 desaturase that functions in plastids. Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones from putative maize homologs for fad2 and fad6 were identified and the entire clones DNA sequenced. The maize fad2 cDNAs showed an amino-acid identity of 67-77% to fad2 of Glycine, Arabidopsis and Brassica species. Our cDNA sequence comparisons suggested that more than one fad2 gene is transcribed in maize embryos. Two different fad2 cDNAs from an embryo cDNA library map to separate chromosomal positions, providing evidence consistent with two different isoforms of fad2 expressed in the embryo. The fad2 cDNAs from multiple tissue sources clustered into three groups on a phenogram, and map to different positions on chromosomes 4, 5 and 10, which suggests at least three different isoforms of fad2 may be expressed in the maize plant. The two maize fad6 cDNAs share 81% amino-acid identity with the Arabidopsis fad6 and map to chromosome 1. Northern analysis revealed that fad2 is transcribed in embryos at 14, 21, 28 and 35 days after pollination, with the highest level observed at day 14. None of the fad2 or fad6 clones mapped to maize chromosome bins associated with QTLs for the ratio of oleic/linoleic acid, notably bin 6.04 which contains the linoleic1 locus and the largest reported QTL for the oleic/linoleic ratio. This suggests, but does not prove, that some of the QTLs for the oleic/linoleic acid ratio do not involve allelic variants of fad2 or fad6 but rather involve other genes that may influence flux through the enzymes encoded by fad2 or fad6.",cDNA Mapping and Sequencing; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Maize; Quantitative trait loci (QTLs); Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038115427

Model predictions of kernel number generally are based on empirical relationships between final kernel number and carbohydrate supply or plant growth at silking, without regard to flowering dynamics. The objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting kernel set from seasonal dynamics of pollen shed and silk exsertion. Hybrids were planted in isolated plots at four ratios of male fertile (MF) and male sterile (MS) plants. Dynamics of pollen shed in each plot was described by a Gauss curve and by a population index (Pind) derived from the percentage of plants at beginning, maximum, and ending pollen shed. Percentage of plants at silking followed a sigmoid curve, whereas the number of silks exposed daily per ear followed a monomolecular model. Pollen shed and silk exsertion curves were translated to potential kernel set using a published relationship. Excellent agreement was observed between predicted and measured number of florets per hectare available for pollination. The model overpredicted kernel number per hectare at high pollen shed densities. Predicted kernels per hectare were within 5% of actual kernel numbers at low pollen shed densities when delayed development of subapical ears and asynchronous pollination within ears were considered. These results indicate kernel set in maize can be predicted from simple measures of the flowering process. They confirm that kernel set is limited primarily by factors other than pollen amount when all plants in the population are MF.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037509970

Here, we demonstrate that moth eggs almost always perish if they are inside these oviposition-induced 'damage zones' of developing fruit. Moreover, because more ovipositions result both in larger damage zones and in higher proportions of eggs within damage zones, this source of mortality is strongly density-dependent. Therefore, mortality of eggs in oviposition-induced damage zones may be an important process for limiting seed consumption and regulating moth densities in many moth-yucca mutualisms.",Costs of mutualism; Density dependence; Oviposition; Yucca moth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037721425

The temporal expression patterns of a recently discovered family of tomato ?-galactosidase (TBG) genes suggest that accumulation of some TBG mRNAs may be regulated by ethylene. Because of the dramatic changes in mRNA abundance patterns that TBG4, TBG5 and TBG6 exhibit ar the onset of fruit ripening (when ethylene production begins), we analyzed the effects of ethylene exposure on expression of these genes ar 35 days after pollination (Mature Green) in wild type and three tomato ripening-impaired mutants: ripening inhibitor (rin), non ripening (nor) and Never ripe (Nr). RNA gel blot analysis showed that 48 h of ethylene treatment increased accumulation of TBG4 mRNA up to 20-fold, except in the nor mutant, suggesting that the NOR gene product is required for ethylene up-regulation of TBG4. Experiments in which fruit were exposed to ethylene for either 2 or 24 h indicated that the observed TBG4 up-regulation is an indirect response to the ethylene treatment, rather than a primary (or direct) response. Ethylene treatment caused the levels of TBG5 mRNA to decrease 63-93% in wild type and mutant fruit at the Mature Green stage, but had no effect after the onset of ripening. Ethylene dramatically decreased the mRNA abundance of TBG6 in wild type and all mutants at the Mature Green stage. It was shown previously that the TBG4-encoded enzyme has ?-galactosidase and exo-galactanase activity. In order to elucidate its potential cell wall modifying activity, the TBG5-encoded enzyme was expressed in yeast. ?-Galactosidase and exo-galactanase activity of the TBG5-encoded enzyme were confirmed through a quantified release of galactosyl residues from p-nitrophenyl-?-D-galactopyranoside and from tomato fruit cell wall fractions containing ?(1 ? 4)-D-galactan, respectively. The TBG6-encoded product was not successfully expressed in yeast.

Plants growing in a seasonally dry location and subjected to the natural rain regime were studied for approximately one year; 30 plants of this population were frequently watered. Nocturnal acid accumulation and leaf rolling, angle and reflectance were higher throughout the year, except during the rainy season, in plants receiving the natural water supply than in watered plants. The former had a higher production of flowers and fruits than experimentally watered plants. No significant differences between the two groups of plants were found in the frequency of pollinator visits.

Previous investigations had demonstrated that resistance was inherited by the offspring, and that differences in resistance between progenies of the individual orchard clones were highly significant. 3. Susceptibility to aphid attack was recorded as the percentage loss of previous year's needles. Differences in susceptibility recorded between the juvenile trees were found to persist after the trees had developed into the closed-canopy, sexually reproducing stage. Needle loss of the families was significantly less than that of the reference population of Sitka spruce. 4.

These studies were made possible by the development of a new method of culturing B. jaapii isolates, using cherry fruit agar. This method enabled large amounts of inoculum to be produced within 2 weeks rather than a couple of months as required previously. In 'Montmorency', disease symptoms were first observed 4 days postinoculation (dpi), with the appearance of small white spots on the undersides of inoculated leaves. These spots gradually grew, producing erumpent spore masses in acervuli approximately 7 dpi.

Cultivar effects explained most of the sum of squares for traits analyzed, except for yield. Crosses yielded 30% more than parental cultivars. Yield of crosses ranged from 3.94 to 5.61 Mg ha-1. Midparent heterosis values ranged from 2.5 to 64.7%. The crosses 'Gallego' x 'Basto/Enano Levantino' and Basto/Enano Levantino x 'Longfellow' showed high heterosis and the best averages for grain yield. On the basis of these results, these crosses could be included in a recurrent reciprocal selection breeding program to increase heterosis among the cultivars and improve their hybrids. A cluster analysis made with midparent heterosis for grain yield as a measure of distance revealed that the flint germplasm probably had similar origins and were related to the 'Northern Flint' race. Some differences among these cultivars were detected. 'Norteño Largo' was closely related to Northern Flint, while Basto/Enano Levantino was different from the rest of the cultivars. It was concluded that the development of hybrids combining good yield and the typical agronomic characteristics of flint maize is feasible.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037696202

The resulting parsimony-based phylogeny reveals 12 well-resolved clades within the Orchidinae, based on Anacamptis s.l., Serapias, Ophrys, Steveniella-Himantoglossum s.l. (including 'Comperia' and 'Barlia', most species being 2n = 36), Neotinea s.l., Traunsteinera-Chamorchis, Orchis s.s., Pseudorchis-Amerorchis-Galearis-Neolindleya-Platanthera s.l. (most 2n = 42), Dactylorhiza s.l., Gymnadenia s.l. (most 2n = 40, 80), Ponerorchis s.l.-Hemipilia s.l.-Amitostigma-Neottianthe, and Brachycorythis (most 2n = 42). Relationships are less clearly resolved among these 12 clades, as are those within Habenariinae; the subtribe appears either weakly supported as monophyletic or as paraphyletic under maximum parsimony, and the species-rich genus Habenaria is clearly highly polyphyletic. The triphyly of Orchis as previously delimited is confirmed, and the improved sampling allows further generic transfers to Anacamptis s.l. and Neotinea s.l. In addition, justifications are given for: (1) establishing Steveniella as the basally divergent member of an appreciably expanded Himantoglossum that incorporates the former genera 'Barlia' and 'Comperia', (2) reuniting 'Piperia' with a broadly defined Platanthera as section Piperia, necessitating ten new combinations, (3) broadening Ponerorchis to include Chusua, and Hemipilia to include single 'orphan' species of Ponerorchis and Habenaria, and (4) recognizing 'Gymnadenia' camtschatica as the monotypic Neolindleya camtschatica within the Pseudorchis-Platanthera clade. Few further generic transfers are likely in Orchidinae s.s., but they are anticipated among habenariid genera, on acquisition of additional morphological and molecular evidence; one probable outcome is expansion of Herminium. Species-level relationships are also satisfactorily resolved within most of the major clades of Orchidinae, with the notable exceptions of Serapias, the derived sections of Ophrys, Himantoglossum s.s., some sections within Dactylorhiza, the former genus 'Nigritella' (now tentatively placed within Gymnadenia s.l.), Hemipilia s.l., and possibly Ponerorchis s.s. Relationships among the 12 major clades broadly accord with bona fide records of intergeneric hybridization. Current evidence supports the recently recognized 2n = 36 clade; it also indicates a 2n = 40 clade that is further diagnosed by digitate root-tubers, and is derived relative to the recently recognized clade of exclusively Asian genera (Ponerorchis s.l.-Hemipilia s.l.-Amitostigma-Neottianthe). This in turn appears derived relative to the Afro-Asiatic Brachycorythis group; together, these two clades identify the plesiomorphic chromosome number as 2n = 42. If the African genus Stenogolottis is correctly placed as basally divergent within a monophyletic Habenariinae, the tribe Orchideae and subtribes Orchidinae and Habenariinae could all have originated in Africa, though in contrast the Asiatic focus of the basally divergent members of most major clades of Orchidinae suggests an Asiatic radiation of the subtribe. Morphological characters informally 'mapped' across the molecular phylogeny and showing appreciable levels of homoplasy include floral and vegetative pigmentation, flower shape, leaf posture, gynostemium features, and various pollinator attractants. Qualitative comparison of, and reciprocal illumination between, degrees of sequence and morphological divergence suggests a nested set of radiations of progressively decreasing phenotypic magnitude. Brief scenarios, both adaptive and non-adaptive, are outlined for specific evolutionary transitions. Recommendations are made for further species sampling, concentrating on Asian Orchidinae (together with the Afro-Asiatic Brachycorythis group) and both Asian and Southern Hemisphere Habenariinae, and adding plastid sequence data. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Africa; Asia; Biogeography; Cladistics; Europe; Homoplasy; ITS; North America; Orchids; RDNA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038783122

In this study, the degree of antibiotic resistance was contrasted with DNA sequence variation for 125 P. larvae isolates collected in North America. Resistance was uncorrelated with bacterial haplotype, suggesting either that resistance has evolved multiple times in P. larvae or that resistance involves recent horizontal transfer via a non-genomic (e.g., plasmid or conjugal transposon) route. The recency of OTC resistance in P. larvae across this broad survey area underscores the need to manage foulbrood infections carefully and to monitor populations for resistance. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science (USA).",Apis mellifera; Pathogen; Plasmid; Pollination; tetA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038069167

Molecular characterisation of this line revealed that the transposon is integrated as a single copy 1727 bases downstream of the ATG signal, within the third intron of the ARR21 gene. The transposon insertion segregated in a Mendelian fashion from heterozygous plants that were allowed to self-pollinate. RT-PCR-based expression analysis showed that ARR21 transcript predominantly accumulates in siliques. In contrast, the full-length ARR21 transcript was not detectable in the ARR21 transposon insertion line, indicating that it harbours an insertion of dSpm transposon in the ARR21 gene. The ARR21 insertion mutant (arr21-1) was subjected to several physiological tests for a possible insertion-linked phenotype. However, our results revealed that the insertion in the ARR21 gene did not cause any alterations in viability and fertility, flowering time, sensitivity to ethylene, cytokinin or red light.

The RAPD screening reflects these differences in breeding systems, with very low genetic variation in the apomictic species, while the sexual species presented much higher variability with no similar genotypes among the sampled trees. The results suggest that adventitious embryony in E. pubescens effectively results in clonal populations or population mosaics of clonal individuals. Since recent studies have indicated poly-embryony and possibly apomixis in a number of Cerrado woody species otherwise considered obligatorily allogamous, the RAPD results presented here indicate the technique will be a useful tool to detect clonal populations of apomictic origin among Cerrado woody species with mixed mating systems and will help to assess the importance of apomixis as a breeding system for the Cerrado flora.",Apomictic; Cerrado; Clonal reproduction; Eriotheca; RAPD,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043127409

Although the number of deposited or adhered pollen grains did not differ between both phenological phases, only an average of 1.6 pollen grains would germinate on BFS stigmas as compared to 6.4 on FE. More over, highly significant differences were observed between phenological phases for stigma height, pollen tube number per stigma, maximum pollen tube length and maximum pollen tube length to stigma height ratio, FE being the phase showing the highest values for these variables. No pollen germination was observed on the flower bud (BF) stigmas, and pollen tubes, although present on BFS, never attained the base of its style reaching the ovule. However pollen tubes reached the base of the style in 25 % of FE. Therefor, FE seems to be the phase, when, most likely, stigma is to be receptive to pollen. To avoid any possible contamination during artificial pollination, however, emasculation should be carried out at early BF phase as a precaution, because pollen may germinate on BFS stigma as well. Tree and phenological phase x tree interaction were significant for all variables. Therefore, the variability of pollen adhering and germination among individual trees may indicate a limitation of allele exchange among genotypes because of differential stigma receptivity and male gametophytes viability adding to the previously encountered time diversity of FE number and pollen fertility.",Argania spinosa; Flower; Phenological phases; Pollen tube; Pollination; Variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041347557

An additional, highly diversified, species-specific pollination mutualism between a monoecious tree genus, Glochidion (Euphorbiaceae), and a moth genus, Epicephala (Gracillariidae), is presented here. At night, the small female moth actively deposits pollen on the cryptic stigma of the female flower by using its proboscis, then oviposits into the style. The moth larva infests only a portion of the developing seeds within fruit. We confirmed that at least three Glochidion species are pollinated only by their respective seed-parasitic moth species, which could be distinguished by genitalic morphology and mitochondrial DNA sequences. These results and widespread evidence of limited seed infestation by the moths associated with Glochidion species suggest that speciation based on the highly specialized Glochidion stylar structure and moth oviposition behavior have promoted species diversification in Glochidion and its pollinators.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038642004

The present paper describes two experiments used to measure the potential of seven plant species to be utilised as winter refuges to support and conserve the predatory bug Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker). In the first experiment, replicated plots of canola (Brassica napus), red salvia (Salvia coccinea), niger (Guizotia abyssinica), linseed (Linum usitatissimum), lupins (Lupinus angustifolius), and lucerne (Medicago falcata) were planted in a randomized experiment during Autumn 1998. Upon crop establishment, adults and nymphs of P. plagipennis were released into treatment plots and their numbers were assessed, along with those of their potential prey, throughout the ensuing winter months. Post-release sampling suggested that canola and niger retained a proportion of adult P. plagipennis, while niger, lucerne and canola retained some nymphs. The other plant species failed to support P. plagipennis nymphs and adults postrelease. In the second experiment, niger was compared with two lines of sunflower (Helianthus annus). Both sunflower lines harboured significantly higher (P < 0.05) densities of P. plagipennis nymphs than did niger. The more successful refuge treatments (sunflower, niger and canola) had an abundance of yellow flowers that were attractive to pollinating insects, which served as supplementary prey on which P. plagipennis were observed to feed. Sunflower and niger also supported high densities of the prey insect Creontiades dilutus (Stål) and provided protective leafy canopies which supplied shelter during the winter months. The potential and limitations for using each plant species as a winter refuge to retain P. plagipennis during winter are discussed.",Bio-control; Creontiades; Niger; Nysius; Predator; Sunflower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038664321

Flower signals such as colours and scents assist this recognition process. For plant species to attract and keep butterflies as pollinators, species-specific floral signals are crucial. The aim of this study is to investigate foraging responses to floral scents in three temperate butterfly species, Inachis io L. (Nymphalidae), Aglais urticae L. (Nymphalidae), and Gonepteryx rhamni L. (Pieridae), in behavioural choice bioassays. The butterflies were allowed to choose between flower models varying in scent and colour (mauve or green). Flowers or vegetative parts from the plants Centaurea scabiosa L. (Asteraceae), Cirsium arvense (L.) (Asteraceae), Knautia arvensis (L.) (Dipsacaceae), Buddleja davidii Franchet (Loganicaeae), Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), Achillea millefolium L. (Asteraceae), and Philadelphus coronarius L. (Hydrangiaceae) were used as scent sources. All visits to the models - those that included probing and those that did not - were counted, as was the duration of these behaviours. Both flower-naive and flower-experienced (conditioned to sugar-water rewards, the colour mauve, and specific floral scents) butterflies were tested for their preference for floral versus vegetative scents, and to floral scent versus colour. The butterflies were also tested for their ability to switch floral scent preferences in response to rewards. Flower-naive butterflies demonstrated a preference for the floral scent of the butterfly-favourable plants C. arvense and K. arvensis over the floral scent of the non-favourable plants Achillea millefolium (Asteraceae), and Philadelphus coronarius cv. (Hydrangiaceae). Most of the butterflies that were conditioned to floral scents of either C. arvense, K. arvensis, or B. davidii readily switched their floral scent preferences to the one most recently associated with reward, thus demonstrating that floral scent constancy is a result from learning. These findings suggest that these butterflies use floral scent as an important cue signal to initially identify and subsequently recognize and distinguish among rewarding plants.",Aglais urticae; Butterfly; Choice bioassay; Floral scent; GC-MS; Gonepteryx rhamni; Inachis io; Lepidoptera; Nectar foraging,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037241948

The antennal responses of three butterfly species, Aglais urticae L. (Nymphalidae), Inachis io L. (Nymphalidae), and Gonepteryx rhamni L. (Pieridae) to floral scent compounds from both natural and synthetic mixtures were examined. Floral scents were collected from the butterfly nectar plants Cirsium arvense (L.)

These eluates, composed of natural floral scent blends, represent an array of compounds in their natural state. In the GC-EAD analyses eleven compounds were identified from C. arvense with the benzenoid compound phenylacetaldehyde in highest abundance. Seventeen compounds were identified from B. davidii with the irregular terpene oxoisophorone in highest abundance. Thirty-nine synthetic floral scent compounds were mixed in pentane, in equal amounts; about 35 ng were allowed to reach the antennae. The butterflies showed antennal responses to most of the floral scent compounds from both natural and synthetic blends except to the highly volatile monoterpene alkenes. Certain benzenoid compounds such as phenylacetaldehyde, monoterpenes such as linalool, and irregular terpenes such as oxoisophorone, were emitted in relatively large amounts from C. arvense and B. davidii, and elicited the strongest antennal responses. These compounds also elicited strong antennal responses when present in the synthetic scent blends. Thus, the butterflies seem to have many and/or sensitive antennal receptors for these compounds, which points to their biological importance. Moreover, these compounds are exclusively of floral scent origin. For B. davidii, which depends highly on butterflies for pollination, the exclusive floral scent compounds emitted in high abundance could be the result of an adaptive pressure to attract butterflies.",Aglais urticae; Butterfly; Floral scent; GC-EAD; GC-MS; Gonepteryx rhamni; Inachis io; Lepidoptera,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037239309

We determined relative self-compatibility and temporal overlap of male and female functions for hermaphrodites in subdioecious Wurmbea dioica to assess the role of selfing in the maintenance of gender dimorphism. Plants were self-compatible but did not self-pollinate autonomously. Self- and open-pollinated hermaphrodites had high seed abortion and low seed set, whereas crossed hermaphrodites and crossed and open females had low seed abortion and high seed set. For selfed hermaphrodites, abortion occurred over a range of developmental stages and was negatively related to seed set. Inbreeding depression for seed set varied extensively among plants, averaging 0.56. Despite high inbreeding depression, substantial selfing occurred in open-pollinated hermaphrodites (S = 0.76), as estimated by a non-genetic method. Flowers were protogynous, although temporal separation of male and females functions was limited because anthers began to dehisce shortly after flowers opened. Anther dehiscence was staggered over 4 days and floral longevity, pollen longevity and stigma receptivity were prolonged, thus providing considerable opportunities for pollinator-mediated self-pollination.

Approximately 75% of these species were specialized to a single pollinator group such as bee, beetle, or moth. Pollinators from diverse groups pollinate the remaining 25% of the tree species. Global comparison with other wet forest sites showed that diversity and specialized pollination modes observed in Kakachi bore closer resemblance to other lowland than montane forest sites described so far. However, the number of pollinators involved in pollination was comparable with montane sites. We examine the consequences that might have led to selection of the observed pollination modes in Kakachi.

We report a species of this genus bearing flowers that last 1 to 4 days, and are mainly pollinated by hoverflies. Floral biology, daily blooming pattern, floral longevity, and frequency and behavior of pollinators of Sisyrinchium vaginatum were studied in a high-altitude grassland in the Serra da Bocaina, southeastern Brazil. Anthesis starts between 10:00 and 16:30 h, but most fowers open in the middle of the day. Flowers open and close every day, or may remain closed on their second day of anthesis, to then re-open the subsequent day. The regulation of flower longevity and blooming pattern seems to be endogenous, but climatic conditions and pollinator activity may also be involved. As a floral reward, the yellow, dish-shaped flowers only offer pollen. Although small bees were reported as the main or exclusive pollinators for other areas, syrphids were the main pollinators of S. vaginatum in the Serra da Bocaina. For this population, the flowering peak occurred during the winter, while for populations of other areas it took place during the summer. Since, in winter, the diversity and number of small bees is extremely reduced in those high-altitude grasslands, the syrphid-pollination in the Bocaina's population is probably linked to its flowering peak in that season.",Bees; Blooming pattern; Floral longevity; Hoverflies; Pollen flowers; Sisyrinchium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038609088

Therefore, selection marker genes are used to identify the rare plants that have taken up foreign DNA. Genes encoding antibiotic and herbicide resistance are widely used for this purpose in plant transformation1,2. Over the past several years, consumer and environmental groups have expressed concern about the use of antibiotic- and herbicide-resistance genes from an ecological and food safety perspective. Although no scientific basis has been determined for these concerns, generating marker-free plants would certainly contribute to the public acceptance of transgenic crops. Several methods have been reported to create marker gene-free transformed plants, for example co-transformation, transposable elements, site-specific recombination, or intrachromosomal recombination3-9. Not only are most of these systems time-consuming and inefficient, but they are also employed on the assumption that isolation of transformants without a selective marker gene is not feasible10. Here we present a method that permits the identification of transgenic plants without the use of selectable markers. This strategy relies on the transformation of tissue explants or cells with a virulent A. tumefaciens strain and selection of transformed cells or shoots after PCR analysis. Incubation of potato explants with A. tumefaciens strain AGL0 resulted in transformed shoots at an efficiency of 1-5% of the harvested shoots, depending on the potato genotype used. Because this system does not require genetic segregation or site-specific DNA-deletion systems to remove marker genes, it may provide a reliable and efficient tool for generating transgenic plants for commercial use, especially in vegetatively propagated species like potato and cassava.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-12244267044

An experiment aimed at investigating whether bumblebee workers forage close to their nests, and distances between three commercially produced bumblebee nests and an introduced forage patch were manipulated.

SP11 binding to SRK induces the autophosphorylation of SRK, which triggers the signaling cascade that results in the rejection of self-pollen. The localization of SP11 protein during pollen development and pollination, however, have never been demonstrated. In this study, we examined the localization of S8-SP11 protein in the anther or pollinated stigma by immuno-electron microscopy. The immunostaining suggested that S8-SP11 was secreted from the tapetal cell into the anther locule as a cluster and translocated to the pollen surface at the early developmental stage of the anther. During the pollination process, SP11 was translocated from the pollen surface to the papilla cell, and then penetrated the cuticle layer of the papilla cell to diffuse across the pectin cellulose layer. Furthermore, SP11 protein could only penetrate the cuticle layer of the papilla cell in the presence of pollen grains, and could not penetrate on its own. This suggests that another factor from the pollen grain is needed for SP11 protein to penetrate the papilla cell wall.",Anther; Brassica; Immunohistochemistry; Pollen S determinant; Pollination; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038672039

Pollination, for most angiosperms, is animal mediated, insects being the most important pollinators. Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) are the most highly adapted of all anthophiles (flower visitors), possessing many anatomical and behavioral adaptations suiting a lifestyle completely dependant on floral resources. This dependence makes bees the most important of all pollinators, and as such, they are keystone components of almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Although there is historic knowledge of the importance of bees in agricultural plant communities, only recently has there been an appreciation of the fragility of many plant-pollinator relationships. Therefore, understanding the complex interactions of plants, pollinators and the ecosystems surrounding these relationships is crucial, especially when considering conservation of the species or their respective habitats. A key step in understanding these relationships is knowing which organisms are involved. This paper provides an annotated checklist of bee species in Nova Scotia, Canada, and includes summaries of their bionomics and floral relations. To date, 157 indigenous bees and two recently introduced species, representing 26 genera from six families, have been reported for Nova Scotia.

Here, we studied the self-incompatibility (SI) behavior of 50 plants derived from such a mixed population, designated U83, and examined the cause of the breakdown of SI. Thirteen plants were found to be self-incompatible, and the other 37 were found to be self-compatible.

All the 37 self-compatible plants carried either an SC1- or an SC2-haplotype. SC1SC1 and SC2SC2 homozygotes were generated by self-pollination of two of the self-compatible plants, and they were reciprocally crossed with 40 self-incompatible S-homozygotes (S1S1 through S40S40) generated from plants identified from three mixed populations, including U83. The SC1SC1 homozygote was reciprocally compatible with all the genotypes examined. The SC2SC2 homozygote accepted pollen from all but the S17S17 homozygote (identified from the U1 population), but the S17S17 homozygote accepted pollen from the SC2SC2 homozygote. cDNAs encoding SC2- and S17-RNases were cloned and sequenced, and their nucleotide sequences were completely identical. Analysis of bud-selfed progeny of heterozygotes carrying SC1 or SC2 showed that the SI behavior of SC1 and SC2 was identical to that of SC2 and SC2 homozygotes, respectively. All these results taken together suggested that the SC2-haplotype was a mutant form of the S17-haplotype, with the defect lying in the pollen function.

ARC1 can shuffle between the nucleus, cytosol, and proteasome/COP9 signalosome (CSN) when expressed in tobacco BY-2 suspension-cultured cells. However, ARC1 localization to the proteasome/CSN occurs only in the presence of an active SRK. In the pistil, ubiquitinated protein levels increase specifically with incompatible pollinations, but they do not change in ARC1 antisense-suppressed pistils. In addition, inhibition of the proteasomal proteolytic activity disrupts the self-incompatibility response. We propose that ARC1 promotes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of compatibility factors in the pistil, which in turn leads to pollen rejection.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242416566

To predict the evolutionary dynamics of empty morphs within a plant population, we modeled different foraging strategies that pollinators could use to avoid them. We predicted that the optimal strategy was to visit empty inflorescences randomly when these were infrequent but to use strategies such as visiting fewer flowers per inflorescence to avoid wasting time on them. As the frequencies of empty inflorescences increased, discriminating directly against empty morphs was more likely to be an optimal strategy than was avoiding the species altogether and switching to an alternative one. An experimental test of this model using artificial inflorescences showed that bumblebees used a variety of strategies to minimize time wasted on empty inflorescences. They showed weak discrimination against empty inflorescences but switched to an alternative type of inflorescence as the frequency of empty inflorescences increased. We predicted that empty morphs would be at a visitation rate disadvantage even when at low frequencies in a plant population.

Don in 11 natural populations from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, were investigated by starch gel electrophoresis. Variation at 15 loci from 10 enzyme systems was analyzed. Allozyme analysis revealed a high level of genetic variation in this species, with percentage of polymorphic loci (Pp), the average number of alleles per locus (Ap), and the expected heterozygosity (Hep) being 55.2%, 2.0, and 0.204, respectively, which exceeds the average level among out-crossing wind-pollinated woody species at the population level. At the species level, Ps, As, and Hes were 60.0%, 2.67, and 0,206, respectively. The observed heterozygosity (Hop) was higher than Hep, indicating the existence of natural selection against homozygotes. The negative fixation index (F = -0.216) implied a significant excess of heterozygosity at the population level. Among-population differentiation (FST) accounted for 4.0% of the total variation. No significant correlation was detected between the genetic distance and geographic distance among populations. Extensive gene flow was inferred, based on the allozyme data (Nm = 6.000 from FST, Nm = 5.605 from the ""private allele "" method). The results demonstrated that the fragmentation status of B. alnoides had no remarkable effects on the population genetic structure of this species.

If true, then the proportions of each morph in one generation should reflect their mating success in previous generations. Here, we test the genetic polymorphism assumption in the male dimorphic species Otitesella pseudoserrata, and demonstrate that it is impossible for such a mechanism to generate alternative morphs in the highly variable proportions observed. These results suggest that male dimorphism is not a classic case of alternative strategies attributable to alternative alleles at a single locus.

As crop fields are often separated by a barren gap, such as an intervening roadway or unplanted area, I measured cross contamination between two herbicide-resistant transgenic fields (canola, Brassica napus) across a gap of up to 12 m. I focused on pollen exchange from the field border up to 7 m inside each field over two seasons. In the absence of a gap, I found that gene dispersal diminished rapidly with distance, with more than 40% of transgenic progeny found within the first meter from the edge of the adjacent crop. Cross contamination between fields declined more rapidly when there were intervening plants, however. Plants separated from the transgenic source by a gap of 3-4 m, yielded the same level of transgenic progeny as those separated by 1 m of crop. Both insects and wind pollinate canola, and so the explanation for my observations could involve the influence of gaps on wind patterns or on the behaviour of pollinators. The gap effect does not seem to depend only upon the variation in the density of neighbours that surrounds those plants at the crop edge versus those in the crop matrix. On the basis of this study, it is recommended that economic profit would be maximised by removing field borders after flowering rather than by leaving a surrounding gap, which would need to occupy up to threefold as much field surface to achieve the same level of containment.",Contamination; Discontinuity; Gene escape; Pollen dispersal; Transgenic oilseed rape,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037855768

For all except A. mellifera the thoracic displacement during sonication is less than during flight but the frequency is greater. Thus, thoracic acceleration during sonication is greater than during flight for this bee species. However, the sonication frequency of A. mellifera, the honey bee, did not differ significantly from flight frequencies. Its accelerations were lower than required to eject pollen from sonication-pollinated flower anthers having poricidal dehiscence (e.g., Solanum spp.). The vibration mode shape of X. californica arizonensis Cresson, a large carpenter bee, was determined, demonstrating that sonication was produced by the same mechanism as flight. However, for Xylocopa, the sonication frequency stimulated resonant frequencies of both head and abdomen, enhancing acceleration forces transmitted during sonication of flowers. Sonication vibration of the thorax occured at the second harmonic frequency of the fundamental flight frequency, but the natural frequency of the thorax with the wings decoupled could not explain the higher sonication frequency. It is proposed that the higher frequency is produced by the second harmonic of the indirect flight muscle stretch activation response. The power requirements for sonication by bees is presumably less than during flight such that muscular displacements at the second harmonic frequency of the stretch activation response is adequate to drive this highly evolved morphological, physiological and behavioral system of pollen harvesting. Our results explain the observation that Apis mellifera, the common honey bee, does not use floral sonication in its pollen foraging behavioral repertoire.",Bees; Buzzing; Mode shape; Pollen collection; Sonication; Vibration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038026053

One method of increasing the concentration of oil in corn grain is the TopCross method. With TopCross, ears of a cytoplasmic male-sterile, normal-oil hybrid are pollinated by a male-fertile, high-oil synthetic hybrid. The concentration of oil in the resulting grain is increased because of xenia effects. Kernels of high-oil corn typically have a larger germ and a smaller endosperm than kernels of comparable normal hybrids. The growth of Aspergillus flavus Link:Fr within germ tissue has been reported to be more extensive than that on the whole corn kernel; therefore, the severity of Aspergillus ear rot could be more extensive and aflatoxin concentrations could be higher in high-oil grain produced by TopCross than in grain with a lower concentration of oil. The objective of this study was to compare Aspergillus ear rot severity levels and aflatoxin concentrations in the grains of hybrids crossed with high-oil or normal-oil pollinators. Fifteen hybrids were evaluated in 1998 and 1999 in Urbana, Ill. Primary ears were inoculated with A. flavus and evaluated for susceptibility to Aspergillus ear rot and aflatoxin production in grain. Concentrations of aflatoxin and oil in corn kernels were significantly higher for high-oil hybrids than for normal-oil hybrids; however, ear rot severity was unaffected by the type of pollinator.

Self-fertilization can enhance polyploid establishment, and theory predicts reduced inbreeding depression in polyploids relative to diploids. Therefore, we may expect mating systems that promote self-fertilization or mixed-mating in polyploid species. However, few studies have measured polyploid mating systems and inbreeding depression. We report the outcrossing rate and inbreeding depression for Campanula americana, a self-compatible protandrous herb. Allozyme genotypes suggest that C. americana is an autotetraploid with tetrasomic inheritance. We found that the multilocus outcrossing rate, tm = 0.938, did not differ from unity. This result was unexpected since previous work demonstrated that pollinators frequently move from male- to female-phase flowers on the same plant, that is, geitonogamy. Self and outcross pollinations were conducted for three populations. Offspring were germinated in controlled conditions and grown to maturity in pots in nature. Inbreeding depression was not significant for most seed and germination characters. However, all later life traits except flowering date differed between inbred and outcrossed individuals resulting in a 26% reduction in cumulative fitness for inbred plants. Limited early- and moderate later-life inbreeding depression suggest that it is buffered by the higher levels of heterozygosity found in an autotetraploid. C. americana appears to have a flexible mating system where within flower protandry and/or cryptic self-incompatibility result in a high outcrossing rate when pollinators are abundant, but self-compatibility and limited inbreeding depression maintain reproductive success when mates are limited.",Autopolyploid; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Outcrossing rate; Polyploid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038035464

Native dragonfly nymphs in Oregon, USA caused zero survival of bullfrog tadpoles in a replicated field experiment unless a non-native sunfish was present to reduce dragonfly density. This pattern was also evident in pond surveys where the best predictors of bullfrog abundance were the presence of non-native fish and bathymetry. This is the first experimental evidence of facilitation between two non-native vertebrates and supports the invasional meltdown hypothesis.

The Australian Cartonema was consistently placed as sister to the rest of the family. The Commelineae is monophyletic, while the monophyly of Tradescantieae is in question, due to the position of Palisota as sister to all other Tradescantieae plus Commelineae. The phylogeny supports the most recent classification of the family with monophyletic tribes Tradescantieae (minus Palisota) and Commelineae, but is highly incongruent with a morphology-based phylogeny. This incongruence is attributed to convergent evolution of morphological characters associated with pollination strategies, especially those of the androecium and inflorescence. Analysis of the combined data sets produced a phylogeny similar to the rbcL phylogeny. The combined analysis differed from the molecular one, however, in supporting the monophyly of Dichorisandrinae. The family appears to have arisen in the Old World, with one or possibly two movements to the New World in the Tradescantieae, and two (or possibly one) subsequent movements back to the Old World; the latter are required to account for the Old World distribution of Coleotrypinae and Cyanotinae, which are nested within a New World clade.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037571981

Among the 20 sense plants and 10 antisense plants obtained, two sense plants showed a mutant phenotype when grown in vitro, with stunted growth and an increase in the (leaves+stem)/roots dry weight ratio. The rate of [3H]-glucose uptake in leaf discs from these plants was decreased to 25% of the value measured in control plants. The amount of VvHT1 transgene and of host monosaccharide transporter MST transcripts in the leaves were studied by RNA gel blot analysis. The VvHT1 transcripts were usually present, but the amount of MST transcripts was the lowest in the plants that exhibited the most marked phenotype. Although the phenotype was lost when the plants were transferred from in vitro to greenhouse conditions, it was found again in vitro in the progeny obtained by self-pollination or by backcross. The data show that VvHT1 sense expression resulted in unidirectional post-transcriptional gene inactivation of MST in some of the transformants, with dramatic effects on growth. They provide the first example of plants modified for hexose transport by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Some of the antisense plants also showed reduced expression of MST, and decreased growth.

N level was directly related to growth, net assimilation, water-use efficiency, and leaf carbon isotope ratio, while N source had no effect on these parameters. Seedlings from families 2 and 3 grew larger than seedlings from family 1, which allocated relatively more dry matter to roots. Growth of the three families interacted with soil pH so that family 1 was largest at pH 7, but families 2 and 3 were largest at pH 6. Seedling boron (B) uptake was reduced by increasing pH and by the Ca(NO3)2 fertilizer.

Six-week-old seedlings were transplanted into 1.7 L pots filled with pumice, and one-half of them was inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal symbiont Laccaria bicolor. A 2 x 2 factorial combination of the presence or absence of the fungus and two nitrogen concentrations (200 mg N/L and 25 mg N/L) was used during 2 wk of establishment. During the following 10 wk, no water or nutrients were supplied. At harvest (week 18) height, shoot and root dry weights, as well as the amount of nitrogen in the shoot and nitrogen acquisition capacity, were determined. There was a strong treatment effect, and most of the traits ranked in increasing order: low N, low N + Mycorrhiza, high N, high N + Mycorrhiza. With low N, plants with mycorrhiza had a shoot dry weight twice that of nonmycorrhizal plants. Significant differences among families were found for most traits in treatments without mycorrhiza, while mycorrhiza strongly reduced the number of significant family differences. The amount of nitrogen in the shoot and all biomass traits showed a significant family x mycorrhiza x nitrogen interaction. Of the two traits related to nitrogen uptake, shoot nitrogen amount showed strong genetic correlations with biomass traits in all treatments (rg within the range 0.92 to 0.99) whereas nitrogen acquisition capacity did not (rg within the range -0.53 to +0.23), which implies that the amount of nitrogen in the shoot is a better predictor of growth than nitrogen acquisition capacity.",Additive variance; Genetic correlations; Laccaria bicolor; Norway spruce,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037386407

Lupinus sulphureus ssp. kincaidii (Kincaid's lupine), a threatened species and the primary larval host plant of the endangered Icaricia icarioides fenderi (Fender's blue butterfly), was historically a panmictic metapopulation. Habitat fragmentation may be causing many of the Kincaid's lupine colonies to display typical symptoms of inbreeding depression, such as low seed production. Hand outcrosses on bagged inflorescences significantly increased seed set and seed fitness compared to open pollination and within-colony pollen treatments. Natural seed set was positively correlated with an increase in the number of Kincaid's lupine patches, suggesting that population size limits seed set. An increase in fruit set was positively correlated with Kincaid's lupine raceme number, raceme density, and the number of lupine patches, demonstrating that floral display and population size increase pollinator service.

The three-way interaction location x tester x progeny was significant for all traits, except for oil content. Differences among progenies were detected for all traits. Testcross means varied from 8.40% to 11.82% for protein content and from 3.77% to 5.10% for oil content.

Combining several optimal practices may further increase production, and, given greater crop health and competitiveness, could also improve weed control. A field experiment was conducted at Lacombe and Lethbridge, Alberta, from 1998 to 2000, to determine the optimal combination of glufosinate-tolerant cultivar (hybrid InVigor 2153 or open-pollinated Exceed), crop seeding rate (100, 150, or 200 seeds m-2) and time of weed removal (two-, four-, or six-leaf stage of canola) for canola yield and weed suppression. At equal targeted seeding rates, the hybrid cultivar had greater seedling density (8 plants m-2 higher) and seed yield (22% higher) when compared with the open-pollinated cultivar. Combining the better cultivar with the highest seeding rate, and the earliest time of weed removal led to a 41% yield increase compared with the combination of the weaker cultivar, the lowest seeding rate and the latest time of weed removal. The same optimal factor levels also favoured higher levels of weed control and lower weed biomass variability.

Breeding value is a measure of the genetic quality of an individual as a parent. There are several procedures available for its estimation/prediction. Among those, the best linear prediction (BLP) relaxes most of the assumptions required by the others and minimizes the error variance of prediction. In most situations in British Columbia, it should provide predictions with satisfactory accuracy and precision with greatly reduced computational complexity. In this province, breeding value for growth potential is expressed as percent gain of stem volume over the unimproved population at a designated rotation age. Genetic worth is an important attribute of the genetic quality of a seedlot. It represents the average level of genetic gain expected for the trait of concern at a designated rotation age when a seedlot is used for reforestation. Currently, the genetic worth of a seedlot is estimated by the mean breeding value of all the parents, including those that contribute to pollen contamination and supplemental mass pollination, weighted by their proportional gamete contributions. The yield of a genetically improved plantation is projected by incorporating the genetic worth of the seedlot into the existing growth model developed based on extensive data from managed unimproved stands. The current approach not only takes account of the stand dynamics determined by site conditions and silvicultural regimes but also the declining nature of expected gain over time because of imperfect age-age genetic correlation. Because of errors from genetic and environmental sampling, measurement, and analysis, as well as possible violation of model assumptions, estimates/predictions may still be subject to errors and/or biases. Various conservative measures have been taken to minimize any possible upwards biases. As more matured data and advanced analytical technologies become available, both the accuracy and precision will be improved. The advancement made in the procedures described in this document should contribute to superior decisions in many aspects of forest management.",Breeding value prediction; Growth and yield projection; Seedlot rating,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037389405

Water stress at critical growth stages, excessive soil water evaporation, soil water storage, runoff, and drainage are among the many factors which result in declines in either or both of these ratios. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of soil type, soil water use characteristics, and seasonal climatic differences on the WUE and IWUE of grain sorghum grown in the semi-arid climate of the southern Great Plains of the USA. In 1998 and 1999, grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench 'PIO-8699') was grown in 0.75-m rows with 16 plants/m2 at Bushland, TX in lysimeters containing monolithic soil cores of either the Amarillo, Pullman, or Ulysses soil series. Irrigation treatments in both years were 100, 50, 25, and 0% based on replacement of ET, simulating deficit irrigation that results from limited water availability such as reduced well capacities. The WUE was significantly higher and ET lower in the milder climatic conditions of 1999 compared with 1998, which had a higher evaporative demand. Once normalized for climatic differences, yield response to ET was similar for both years. Crops grown in the Amarillo soil had significantly higher WUE compared with crops in the other soils, primarily due to reduced ET rather than increased yield. Grain sorghum grown in the Ulysses soil was able to produce higher yields at lower plant available water (PAW) compared with the other two soils, but the crops in all soils reduced yield when experiencing water stress at a critical growth stage of pollination. At comparable final soil water contents, grain yields of the crop in the Pullman soil were higher in 1999 (lower evaporative demand) compared with yields produced in 1998 (higher evaporative demand), while the crops in the other two soils produced similar yields in both environments. The relationship between irrigation application and yield was more curvilinear in 1998 possibly due to increased soil water evaporation at the higher irrigation applications, while the relationship was more linear in 1999. In general, IWUE declined with increasing irrigation application within each year, but was variable in some irrigation treatments, due to water stress at critical growth stages. No differences among soil types occurred in IWUE in either year, primarily due to variability among replicates.",Evapotranspiration; Irrigation water use efficiency; Lysimeter; Plant available water; Soil water depletion; Water stress; Water use efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037473215

Discarding position effects in access to resources as a source of variation, since pyrenes are radially oriented inside the fruit, we conducted a pollination experiment, in which different pollen donors were used to make single and mixed pollinations on different female plants. We found strong maternal effects on brood size and seed mass. Although we found no effects of pollen load or pollen source on fruit set, brood size or seed mass, all variables showed enhanced values after multiple pollination treatments. Furthermore, we found an increase of intra-brood variance in seed mass after multiple pollination, suggesting that multiple siring really occurs when multiple donors were involved in pollination, and that sibling rivalry could be a mechanism implicated in seed provisioning, discarding maternal choice as the alternative scenario. Our results on resource provisioning fits with a hierarchical model, since disparities in shares increased down the dominance rank, being the middle sized seed the least sensitive to resource partitioning, and the disparities were reduced when more resources were available in terms of fruit mass. Maternal effects, number of pollen donors, and sibling competition are therefore accounting for seed mass variability in R. alpinus.",Parental effects; Pollination; Seed mass variability; Sibling rivalry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037228793

We analysed, for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge, foraging distances and dance activities of honeybees in relation to landscape structure, season and colony using a replicated experimental approach on a landscape scale. We compared three structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size. Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the beginning of May to the end of July. A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean foraging distance was 1526.1 ± 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range 62.1-10037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies. Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger in simple (1743 ± 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 ± 71 m) and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e. the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex landscapes. The results facilitate an understanding of how human landscape modification may change the evolutionary significance of bee dances and ecological interactions, such as pollination and competition between honeybees and other bee species.",Bee dance; Competition; Foraging strategy; Gene flow; Landscape structure; Social insects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037460886

These practices affect the light environment perceived by plants and the post-flowering source-sink ratio, but there is scarce information on the way they influence plant leaf senescence. The objectives of our research were to: (i) characterize the development of leaf area senescence for contrasting canopy architectures (i.e. plant population x row spacing), and (ii) analyze the response of leaf senescence to changes in the light environment and the post-flowering source-sink ratio. Field experiments were conducted in Argentina between 1997/1998 and 2000/2001. Four hybrids were grown at a wide range of plant populations (3, 9, 10 and 12 plants m-2), row spacings (0.35, 0.7 and 1 m) and pollination treatments (natural and restricted pollination). Senescence development was well described (r2 = 0.61-0.99, P &lt; 0.05) as a bilinear process, starting always at around 500 °C day (base temperature of 8 °C) before silking. Senescence progressed at a lower rate during the first phase of the process than during the second one (?1.4 vs. ?5.5 cm2 per plant per °C per day). The second phase always started between silking and 400 °C day after silking. Increased plant population increased senescence rate during the whole plant cycle, but never affected the ontogenic stage when senescence was initiated or accelerated in all hybrids. Increased plant population promoted: (i) an enhanced light attenuation within the canopy (k coefficient = 0.43, 0.55, 0.53 and 0.65 for 3, 9, 10 and 12 plants m-2, respectively), (ii) an augmented post-flowering source-sink ratio (11.6 cm2 of green plant leaf area per kernel at 9 and 12 plants m-2 compared to 8.3 cm2 per kernel at 3 plants m-2), and (iii) a decreased grain protein concentration. Senescence was reduced by kernel set restrictions that enhanced post-flowering assimilate availability, indicating the process was accelerated by assimilate starvation at high plant populations independently of the green leaf area established per growing kernel. Row spacing altered light quality (red:far-red ratio) perceived at the lowermost leaf stratum at the highest plant populations, but had no effect on senescence development. Senescence during grain filling was related to the local light quantity perceived by leaves and to N availability for actively growing kernels. Although senesced leaf area was influenced by crop growing conditions, senescence initiation and the onset of increased senescence rate were not. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Significant differences were found among provenances and families-within-provenances for all parameters. The provenance from De Grey river (WA) performed best, with 18 of the 25 families having very fast growth rates. Overall survival, at 60 months, was 74% (provenance mean range of 89% (Wiluna) to 28% (Vic.)). Overall mean height at age 60 months was 8.7 m (provenance mean range of 10.2 m (De Grey river) to 4.6 m (Vic.)). Overall mean diameter at breast height (DBH) was 6.7 cm with provenance mean range from 9.2 cm (De Grey river) to 3.4 cm (Vic.). Stem straightness (scored qualitatively on a four point scale of 1-4 with four as the straightest stem) for most of the provenances was good to very good with a trial mean value of 3.2.

Covariate analyses showed that variations in soil salinity across the trial site had little influence on comparison between means of provenances or of families-within-provenances.

Particularly minimum temperatures show a more pronounced increase than maximum temperatures. Not only the phenological seasons, but also the potentially plant damaging late frost events are governed by the atmosphere. In case of a rise of minimum temperatures one would expect phenological phases and spring late frost events to occur earlier. In this work the question is elucidated whether plant phenology shifts at a higher or lower rate towards earlier occurrences than potential plant damaging events, like spring late frost events. Frost events based on the last occurrence of daily minimum temperatures below a certain threshold have been moving faster to earlier occurrence dates than phenological phases during the last decades at 50 climate stations in Central Europe. Trend values of frost time series range around -0.2 days/year and of phenological time series are between -0.2 and 0.0 days/year over the period from 1951-1997. 'Corylus avellana beginning of pollination' is the only one of the 13 phases considered here with a lower trend value of -0.28 days/year. Early phases are more adapted to below zero temperatures and therefore follow more closely the temperature variability. Later phases seem to have more reason to be concerned about possible late frost events and react more cautiously towards higher spring temperatures and earlier last frost dates. The risk of late frost damage for plants should have been lower during the last decade as compared to the previous decades.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346036042

Therefore, chiropterophilous plants, which depend on these bats as pollinators, may be expected to have evolved acoustically conspicuous flowers that facilitate detection. As it is poorly understood how bats manage to find and recognize flowers acoustically, we investigated the echoes of some of the flowers pollinated by bats. Echoes of bell-shaped bat-pollinated flowers have characteristic features with respect to the echoes they reflect to a calling bat and differ from the echoes of leaves or other objects in their surroundings: the echoes are comparatively long and of complex spectral composition. Owing to the specific shape of the flowers, characteristic 'spectral directional patterns' result when the spectra of the echoes are plotted against the angle of sound incidence. We suggest that bats are able to recognize such flowers - and probably other objects as well - not only by a characteristic spectral composition of the echo but also by comparing sequential echoes, at the same time taking into account their exact calling position relative to the object.",Acoustic object recognition; Bat-pollination; Chiropterophilous flower; Echolocation; Glossophagine bat; Plant echo,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037353289

Floral biology and pollination by bees were studied in Viola cerasifolia and V. subdimidiata in high-altitude areas in south-eastern Brazil. Flowers are zygomorphic and spurred. The five stamens are arranged in a cuff around the ovary, and pollen is released by means of apical connective projections, which form a cone surrounding the base of the style. The connective projections of the inferior stamens are elongated and curved to form a hook-shaped structure. Nectar-secreting tissue can occur in the basal connective appendages of the inferior stamens, which project into the spur. Flowers of V. subdimidiata secreted a mean volume of 0.14 ?l nectar over a 24-h period; approx. 40 % of flowers did not secrete any nectar. The main pollinators of these Viola species are female bees belonging to the genus Anthrenoides (Andrenidae), which search mainly for pollen. These bees seem to be oligolectic and obtain large amounts of pollen from Viola by vibrating the flowers or by moving the hook repeatedly back and forth. Males of Anthrenoides patrol Viola clusters and also feed on nectar, acting as secondary pollinators. The basic floral structure in the genus Viola fits that of 'nectar flowers'. The uncommon hook-shaped projections, scanty nectar production, and behaviour of pollinators suggest that V. cerasifolia and V. subdimidiata are shifting their reward for pollinators from nectar to pollen. Based on floral morphology, this shift may be widespread in Viola sect.

PsGA3ox1 mRNA levels were minimally detectable in prepollinated pericarps and ovules (-2 d after anthesis [DAA]), increased dramatically after pollination (0 DAA), then decreased by 1 DAA. Seed PsGA3ox1 mRNA levels increased at 4 DAA and again 8 to 12 DAA, when seed development was rapid. Pericarp PsGA3ox1 mRNA levels peaked coincidentally with rapid pod diameter expansion (6-10 DAA) to accommodate the growing seeds. The effects of seeds and hormones on the expression of pericarp PsGA3ox1 were investigated over a 24-h treatment period. Pericarp PsGA3ox1 mRNA levels gradually increased from 2 to 3 DAA when seeds were present; however, when the seeds were removed, the pericarp transcript levels dramatically declined. When 2-DAA deseeded pericarps were treated with 4-Cl-IAA, PsGA3ox1 mRNA levels peaked 4 h after hormone treatment (270-fold increase), then decreased. PsGA3ox1 mRNA levels in deseeded pericarps treated with indole-3-acetic acid or GA3 were the same or lower than deseeded controls. These data show that PsGA3ox1 is expressed and developmentally regulated in pea pericarps and seeds. These data also show that pericarp PsGA3ox1 expression is hormonally regulated and suggest that the conversion of GA20 to GA1 occurs in the pericarp and is regulated by the presence of seeds and 4-Cl-IAA for fruit growth.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037353423

The onset and peak dates were consistent across each season, whereas the end dates varied. The onset of the Pinus pollen season coincided with the coolest average monthly temperatures (&lt; 22 °C), lowest rainfall (&lt; 7mm), and four weeks after daily minimum temperatures fell to 5-9 °C in late autumn. Correlations obtained between daily airborne Pinus pollen counts and temperature/rainfall parameters show that densities of airborne Pinus pollen are negatively correlated with maximum temperature (p &lt; 0.0001), minimum temperature (p &lt; 0.0001) and rainfall (p &lt; 0.05) during the main pollination period.

Almond is a self-incompatible nut crop that has a fruit set of only approx. 30 % of the total number of flowers. Thus, interference of pollination and fertilization by fungicide sprays is of concern, and identification of chemicals having the least detrimental effects would be desirable. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of fungicide sprays on stigma morphology in almond using a laboratory spray apparatus that simulated field applications. Four fungicides (azoxystrobin, myclobutanil, iprodione and cyprodinil) were applied, and fresh, unfixed stigmatic surfaces were observed using a scanning electron microscope at 4 and 24 h after spraying. Increased exudate accumulation was induced by azoxystrobin at both time periods, and localized damage and collapse of stigmatic cells were observed after 24 h. Damaged stigmatic papillae exhibited wrinkling, surface distortion or collapse. Likewise, myclobutanil caused significant damage to and collapse of papillae; these were more extensive at later observations. Iprodione had no effect on exudate accumulation but caused marked and severe collapse of stigmatic papillae which was pronounced at 24 h. Cyprodinil promoted a copious increase in exudate secretion and caused the most severe collapse of stigmatic cells of all the fungicides evaluated. Damage was somewhat localized at 4 h but more global at 24 h. This study has verified that certain fungicide sprays have direct detrimental effects on stigma morphology and enhance exudate production in almond flowers. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Almond; Collapse; Exudate; Fungicide; Pesticide; Prunus dulcis; Scanning electron microscopy; Stigmatic papillae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242684556

Depending on the cross, self-compatibility in the progenies was determined by observing pollen tube growth (by means of fluorescence microscopy), stylar S-RNases analysis or allele-specific PCR. The results obtained fit with the accepted hypothesis of inheritance of self-compatibility and the three crossing strategies used ensured 100% of self-compatible descendants. These strategies increase the efficiency of the breeding programme and avoid the laborious task of evaluating this characteristic. From the breeding point of view, self-fertilisation and crosses between relatives tend to produce inbreeding. Furthermore, these methods reduce the possibilities of choosing the parental combination. The use of homozygous self-compatible parents does not have any of these disadvantages.

Flowering took place in late (austral) spring to early summer. The creamy white, entomophilous flowers were protandrous and lasted 3.5-4.5 days. A pleasant odor along with nectar and pollen attracted 36 mostly diurnal insect species of which 41.7% were Hymenoptera, 38.9% Lepidoptera and 19.4% Diptera. However, 75% from all recorded species were infrequent, and domestic bees made ca. 94% of all visits. One halictid bee, one sphecid wasp, one myzinid wasp, four small- to medium-sized butterflies and a hawkmoth completed the set of relatively frequent insect visitors. Pollen and stigma were presented in the same place within the flower, but interference was prevented by a movement-assisted, complete dichogamy mechanism in which the bending ability of the gynophore played a fundamental role. This form of dichogamy was previously unknown in the Capparaceae. In comparison with the known species of the closely allied genus Capparis L., A. emarginata has diurnal, smaller, longer-lasting flowers, that offer much smaller nectar amounts, and that attract a rather generalized array of non-hovering visitors, while Capparis behaves as a more crepuscular-biased sphingophile or ornithophile or chiropterophile. Low levels of seed set under bagging indicates dependence on insect visits and are partly congruent with an earlier report of self-incompatibility in A. emarginata. Pollen tubes arrived to ovules in 90.6% of the inspected flowers. Fruit set of open-pollinated flowers was 43.6%-53.7%. Ninety-five percent of all ovules were regularly aborted in each fruiting ovary; thus, each fruit contained 1.2 developed seeds. Full-sized individuals were expected to produce ca. 10,700 potential offspring per year.",Atamisquea emarginata; Capparaceae; Movement-assisted dichogamy; Pollination; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037336590

Seed coat pigment in the brown-seeded line consisted of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins), while anthocyanin was absent. Dihydroquercetin, dihydrokaempferol, quercetin and kaempferol accumulated only in the mature seed coat of the yellow-seeded line, indicating dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) as an element of genetic control in pigment biosynthesis. DFR transcripts from the developing seed coat in the yellow-seeded line were absent or less abundant at 5-30 days after pollination compared to transcript levels in the brown-seeded line. Seedling leaves of the yellow-seeded line exhibited reduced expression of DFR and contained less anthocyanin compared to the respective tissues from plants of the brown-seeded line when grown at 25/20 °C (day/night). Cooler (18/15 °C) growing temperatures affected seedling leaf pigmentation, mature seed coat colouration and DFR expression in the yellow-seeded line. Comparable brown-seeded line tissues were unaffected by these temperature changes. These results are suggestive of a temperature-sensitive regulator of DFR in the yellow-seeded line of Brassica carinata which ultimately affects the formation of pigments in the seedling leaves and in the mature seed coats. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is of conservation interest therefore to understand how rainforest fragmentation may alter the pollination and breeding structure of remnant trees. Previous studies of the Amazonian tree Dinizia excelsa (Fabaceae) found African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) as the predominant pollinators of trees in highly disturbed habitats, transporting pollen up to 3.2 km between pasture trees. Here, using microsatellite genotypes of seed arrays, we compare outcrossing rates and pollen dispersal distances of (i) remnant D. excelsa in three large ranches, and (ii) a population in undisturbed forest in which African honeybees were absent. Self-fertilization was more frequent in the disturbed habitats (14%, n = 277 seeds from 12 mothers) than in undisturbed forest (10%, n = 295 seeds from 13 mothers). Pollen dispersal was extensive in all three ranches compared to undisturbed forest, however. Using a TWOGENER analysis, we estimated a mean pollen dispersal distance of 1509 m in Colosso ranch, assuming an exponential dispersal function, and 212 m in undisturbed forest. The low effective density of D. excelsa in undisturbed forest (?0.1 trees/ha) indicates that large areas of rainforest must be preserved to maintain minimum viable populations. Our results also suggest, however, that in highly disturbed habitats Apis mellifera may expand genetic neighbourhood areas, thereby linking fragmented and continuous forest populations.",Apis mellifera; Microsatellites; Pollen flow; Pollination; Tropical rainforest; TwoGener analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037350987

We estimated selection gradients for two morphological characters (plant height and number of stems), their respective patch means, and plant density with respect to reproductive success in a two-year study. The approach was also extended to partition selection separately within habitats with varying degrees of exposure to river disturbances and herbivory. The selection differentials and gradients for plant height were positive at both individual and patch levels, with selection forces highest in the closed habitat with low exposure to disturbance. This pattern suggests that local groups with taller than average plants are more visible to pollinators than to groups that are shorter than average plants; and, within patches, individuals with short stature are visited less often than taller ones. Selection on the number of stems was in opposition at individual and patch levels. At the individual level the character was selected toward higher values, whereas selection at the patch-level favored smaller mean number of stems. The strength of the latter component was associated with the intensity of herbivory in different habitats, suggesting that the patch-level selection against a large number of stems might be due to high attractiveness of such patches to the main herbivore, reindeer. Consequently, direction and strength of selection in spatially structured populations may depend significantly on fitness effects arising at the group level.",Contextual analysis; Group selection; Herbivory; Pollination; Selection gradient,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242584417

Four experimental designs differing in the spatial arrangement of the Minghui-63 and O. rufipogon plants were used in experiments conducted in an isolated rice field in Hunan Province, southern China, where O. rufipogon occurs naturally. Natural hybridization events between the two species were detected by scoring a simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular marker. A total of 296 hybrids were identified from 23 776 seedlings that were randomly germinated from > 80 000 seeds collected from O. rufipogon. The occurrence of the crop-to-wild gene flow was significantly associated with wind direction and frequencies of the gene flow, which decreased significantly with distance from the pollen sources. The maximum observed distance of gene flow was 43.2 m. The results indicated that gene flow from cultivated rice to O. rufipogon occurred at a considerable rate. Therefore, isolation measures should be considered when deploying transgenic rice in the sympatric regions of the wild rice, and when establishing in situ conservation of O. rufipogon. The experimental system in this study can be used for biosafety assessment of transgene escape of other wind-pollinated crops. © New Phytologist (2003).",Biosafety; Gene flow; In situ conservation; Molecular markers; Oryza rufipogon; Oryza sativa; Risk assessment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037340254

Population differentiation estimated using AFLPs and SSRs was low (38.3 and 24%) and only slightly higher than previous estimates for Central American populations based on RAPD variation (20%). Significant fine-scale spatial structure was found in all of the surveyed mahogany populations and is probably strongly influenced by the limited seed dispersal range of the species. Furthermore, a survey of progeny arrays from selected mother trees in two of the plots indicated that most pollinations involved proximate trees. These data indicate that very little gene flow, via either pollen or seed, is occurring between blocks of mahogany within a continuous or disturbed forest landscape. Thus, once diversity is removed from a forest population of mahogany, these data suggest that recovery would be difficult via seed or pollen dispersal, and provides an explanation for mahogany's apparent susceptibility to the pressures of logging. Evidence is reviewed from other studies of gene flow and seedling regeneration to discuss alternative extraction strategies that may maintain diversity or allow recovery of genetic resources.",AFLP; Gene flow; Genetic structure; Mahogany; Microsatellites; Swietenia macrophylla,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037357664

The number of polymorphic markers assayed ranged from 48 for Pa to 120 for A according to the heterozygosity of each parental. As our focus was on genome comparison, most of the markers were newly generated simple sequence repeats. Inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphisms based on four retrotransposon sequences isolated from Citrus spp were also used to saturate the maps. These polymorphisms were much more frequent in A (53) than in Pa (15) and randomly distributed throughout both genomes. Since comparative genomics and quantitative trait locus analysis applicability depends on the reliability of marker ordering, the causes of variation in marker order were investigated. Around 25% of the markers showed gametal segregation distortions. Segregation distortions were also observed at the zygotic level towards a reduction in the observed frequency of homozygotes from that expected in linkage groups 5 and 7. The presence of balanced lethal factors or gametal incompatibility genes in those genomic regions would explain a zygotic advantage of heterozygotes at these specific regions. Four differences in genomic organization were observed; three are putative translocations and affect homeologous' linkage groups 3, 7 and 11, where highly distorted markers are found. Other causes of variation in marker order are also discussed: the introduction of new markers in the map, lowering the LOD score and the mapping software.

Corridors directed the movement of all 10 species studied, with all corridor effect sizes >68%. However, this corridor effect was significant for five species, not significant for one species, and inconclusive for four species because of small sample sizes.

These results show that neither the fertility of mature pollen nor the pollen germination on stigma is the principal cause of the low seed set. The mean number of pollen tubes passing through the conducting tissue of the ovary 7 hours after pollination largely differed among the cross combinations. However, it did not show a close relationship with the number of seeds per capsule. Among the embryosacs examined 48 hours after pollination, those that had not been penetrated by pollen tubes were mostly abnormal, in which the development of the egg apparatus had been interrupted halfway.

(E)-?-Ocimene is also a component of many floral scents. Airborne (E)-?-ocimene emitted from plants can serve as a chemical cue for the attraction of parasitoids or predators of plant herbivores and also as an attractant for pollinating insects. Furthermore, exposure of plants to (E)-?-ocimene can activate defense gene expression. In this paper, we describe cDNA cloning and functional characterization of a gene encoding a highly specialized (E)-?-ocimene synthase, AtTPS03, from Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. AtTPS03 was identified as a member of the large AtTPS gene family of putative terpene synthases. A cDNA for AtTPS03 was expressed in Escherichia coli and the enzyme function identified in vitro. The A. thaliana (E)-?-ocimene synthase produces almost exclusively (E)-?-ocimene (94%) with minor amounts of the related acyclic monoterpenes (Z)-?-ocimene (4%) and myrcene (2%). Transcripts for AtTPS03 were up-regulated in leaves of Arabidopsis in response to mechanical wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid, concurrent with induced emission of (E)-?-ocimene.

One of the numerous possible examples is the infusion of Conium maculatum, better known as Hemlock, a plant belonging to the family umbelliferae, used by the ancient Egyptians to cure skin diseases. The current official pharmacopoeia includes various chemical substances produced by secondary plant metabolisms. For example, the immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent organ transplant rejection and the majority of antibiotics are metabolites produced by fungal organisms, pilocarpin, digitalis, strophantus, salicylic acid and curare are examples of plant organism metabolites. For this reason, there has been an increase in research into plants, based on information on their medicinal use in the areas where they grow. The study of plants in relation to local culture and traditions is known as ""ethnobotany"" Careful study of the behaviour of sick animals has also led to the discovery of medicinal plants. The study of this subject is known as ""zoopharmacognosy"". The aim of this article is to discuss the fact that ""ad hoc"" production of such chemical substances, defined as ""secondary metabolites"", is one of the modes in which plant organisms respond to unfavourable environmental stimuli, such as an attack by predatory phytophagous animals or an excessive number of plant individuals, even of the same species, in a terrain. In the latter case, the plant organisms produce toxic substances, called ""allelopathic"" which limit the growth of other individuals. ""Secondary metabolites"" are produced by metabolic systems that are shunts of the primary systems which, when required, may be activated from the beginning, or increased to the detriment of others. The study of the manner in which such substances are produced is the subject of a new branch of learning called ""ecological biochemistry"".",Allelopathy; Chemical defence by plants; Ecological biochemistry; Ethnobotany; Zoopharmacognosy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037356890

In our study we increased the number of entries, 95 entries from the major, equina and minor groups were studied. The selfing process has been quantified by means of univariate as well as multivariate techniques. Effects of selfing on floral, yield and yield distribution traits were investigated by comparing two levels of selfing in open pollination conditions and in cages to exclude insects. Univariate analysis shows that selfing process results in plants with lower seeds per plant, seeds and ovules per pod and pod length. As selfing progressed there was change in yield distribution traits, the number of the lowest pod beating node, the number of nodes between the first flower and the first pod increase and the number of nodes with pods decreases. Multivariate analysis indicates that: a) self-pollination profoundly influences plants performance and the three levels of selfing studied are clearly different; b) There is continuum pattern of change from one level of selfing to the another; c) The main characteristics that contributed to the separation among the levels of selfing varies with the botanical group. d) There was no significant contribution to the discrimination among levels of selfing of number of seeds per plant in the major group.

Listed as endangered species in Korea, only few populations of Abeliophyllum distichum, Leontice microrhyncha, Bupleurum euphorbioides, and Berchemia berchmiaefolia were found. A reduced level of genetic variation in B. berchemiaefolia is consistent with the occurrence of a genetic bottleneck and inbreeding. Leontice microrhyncha differed dramatically from other taxa in its observed level of genetic variation, probably due to its predominant selfing. The level of allozyme variation maintained by A. distichum was high for endemic species. Compared to species with similar traits, A. distichum maintained a relatively higher genetic diversity, probably due to floral heteromorphism and preferred outcrossing. Bupleurum euphorbioides maintained a higher genetic diversity due to outcrossing, but at the individual locus, deficiency of heterozygosity prevailed. Probably inbreeding between local neighborhoods was frequent because A. distichum and B. euphorbioides were pollinated by small fly species which might be less effective as a pollen dispersal, and their visits were extremely scarce and controlled by the weather conditions. Since much of the species-to-species variation in genetic diversity is due to the specific ecological and evolutionary history of a species, any management plan developed should be based on historical changes in the population size and distribution to better predict the amounts and patterns of genetic diversity.",Abeliophyllum distichum; Berchemia berchemiaefolia; Bupleurum euphorbioides; Conservation genetics; Leontice microrhyncha,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037374137

Species is non-autogamous, and produced one flower per flowering shoot each flowering season. We hypothesized that orchids with more flowering shoots and those on trees with clumps of conspecific should develop more fruits than isolated ones. R. glauca population flowers synchronously, and individual flowers last up to 18 days, with flowers closing rapidly after pollination. Individuals produced few flowers per year, although some plants developed flowers in both seasons and fewer of them developed fruits both years. There was no relationship between flower number per orchid, or per host tree, with the number of fruits developed per plant. Host trees with flowering and fruiting orchids were randomly dispersed and the pattern of distribution of flowering and fruiting plants was not related. Apparently, pollinators visit the flowers randomly, with no evidence of density dependence. The fruit set of R. glauca was as low as fruit set of multi-flowered orchids moth pollinated, suggesting that fruit set on moth pollinated orchids could be independent of the number of flowers displayed.",Abundance; Floral display; Fruit set; Orchid; Reproduction; Ryncholaelia glauca; Spatial distribution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642418383

After embryogenesis induction by stress, microspores with enlarged morphology showed higher viability than non-enlarged ones. Following microspore culture, cell division was only observed among the enlarged microspores. Western blot and immunolocalization of three barley 14-3-3 isoforms, 14-3-3A, 14-3-3B and 14-3-3C were carried out using isoform-specific antibodies. The level of 14-3-3C protein was higher in enlarged microspores than in non-enlarged ones. A processed form of 14-3-3A was associated with the death pathway of the non-enlarged microspores. In the early embryogenesis stage, 14-3-3 subcellular localization differed among dividing and non-dividing microspores and the microspore-derived multicellular structures showed a polarized expression pattern of 14-3-3C and a higher 14-3-3A signal in epidermis primordia. In the late embryogenesis stage, 14-3-3C was specifically expressed underneath the L1 layer of the shoot apical meristem and in the scutellum of embryo-like structures (ELSs). 14-3-3C was also expressed in the scutellum and underneath the L1 layer of the shoot apical meristem of 21 d after pollination (DAP) zygotic embryos. These results reveal that 14-3-3A processing and 14-3-3C isoform tissue-specific expression are closely related to cell fate and initiation of specific cell type differentiation, providing a new insight into the study of 14-3-3 proteins in plant embryogenesis.",14-3-3; Androgenesis; Barley; Embryogenesis; Pattern formation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242501000

Significant genetic differentiation was found between the subpopulations on both sides of the Great Wall. A wind-pollinated woody species, Ulmus pumila, showed less genetic differentiation than four insect-pollinated species: Prunus armeniaca, Ziziphus jujuba, Vitex negundo, and Heteropappus hispidus. Cleistogenes caespitosa, a wind-pollinated perennial herb, displayed more genetic differentiation between subpopulations than the insect-pollinated species because of its propagation strategy. Although AMOVA analysis showed that subpopulations divided by a mountain path had diverged genetically, the variance component between the subpopulations on both sides of the Great Wall was significantly larger than that between the subpopulations at the control site.

Treating seeds with GA3 or GA4/7 (both at 10-4 M) failed to significantly improve germination.

This plant attracts olfactory dung-breeding flies through deceit. These insects are principally represented by Diptera, all belonging to saprophyte families. The volatilization of the odouriferous compounds, responsible for their attraction, is achieved through the production of heat by the appendix. The insects are trapped for 24 h in order to participate in both sexual phases of the protogynous inflorescence. The male flowers produce three heat events during flowering. These peaks of heat seem to be involved in the spathe movements, since they occur during the opening of the inflorescence and the liberation of the insects. The last male heat event may be linked with the liberation of pollen and its dispersion by stimulating trapped flies. According to their frequency and pollen-load, two Psychoda species appear to be the most efficient pollinators (P. crassipenis and P. pusilla). Nevertheless, each of the other attracted species could play a significant role under different spatio-temporal conditions. Experiments on self-pollination have shown that obligate cross-pollination is necessary for A. italicum to set seeds. Moreover, hand- and natural-pollinated plants showed similarly high abortion frequencies suggesting that seed set may be more constrained by resources rather than by pollination limitation. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.",Fructification; Inflorescence; Pollinator; Psychoda; Seed set; Thermogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037300778

Field obser- vations were carried out in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, where this orchid is pollinated by males of Eulaema nigrita (Euglossini). Plants cultivated in Campinas (São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil) were eventually pollinated by males of Eulaema nigrita and Euglossa melanothricha (Euglossini). In both cases, Euglossini males collect aromatic compounds produced on the surface of the lip, fix the pollinaria on the dorsal surface of the labrum and perform pollination. This species is protandrous. Recently opened flowers present their stigmatic surfaces blocked and thus flowers act only as pollen donors. After 2-3 days the viscidium dries out and pollinaria cannot be removed anymore. Then, a narrow slit opens in the stigmatic cavity, allowing pollen deposition. Experiments performed with cultivated plants suggest that this orchid species is strongly, though not completely self-incompatible. Pollination experiments showed that bees tend to stay several minutes in each inflorescence. This behavior may promote some degree of geitonogamous pollination because flowers in male and female phases coexist in the same inflorescence. The combination of self-incompatibility with this specific pollinator behavior may explain the rarity of fruits in several neotropical reward-offering Orchidaceae.",Euglossini; Notylia; Oncidiinae; Orchidaceae; Pollination; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037314259

We quantified reproductive parameters of trees (no. inflorescences per branch, total and open flowers per inflorescence) in forest fragments varying from 1 ha (small), to 20 ha (medium) and to >150 ha (large), and in remnant trees in pastures. Visits to flowers by nectar-feeding birds were recorded during 30-min observation periods, spread throughout the day during two flowering seasons, November 1992 and 1993 (n = 242 periods overall). Aggressive encounters among flower visitors were recorded in 1992. We expected less visits to trees in pastures and small forest patches because abundances of Embothrium's main pollinators, the flycatcher Elaenia albiceps and the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes, decreased in smaller patches. We found, however, that pollinator visiting rates were negatively correlated with forest patch area and were highest for pasture trees. This trend was largely due a decline in the number of visits by E. albiceps, the main flower visitor, in larger patches. Hummingbird visits did not change with forest patch size. Lower visitation rates to flowering trees in larger forest fragments seemed to be a consequence of territorial defence by E. albiceps and were unrelated to differences in floral display.",Elaenia albiceps; Embothrium coccineum; Forest edges; Hummingbirds; Passerine pollination; Sephanoides sephaniodes; Territorial defence; Tree reproductive ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037331410

To distinguish between adaptive and nonadaptive explanations for between-species differences in curvature, we determined the relationship between spur curvature and pollen removal, which is one estimate of male reproductive success. Spur curvature exhibited considerable variation both within and among three populations, with spur angles ranging from 0° to 297°. A greenhouse experiment determined that spur curvature of I. capensis flowers has a broad-sense heritability of 0.636. Laboratory experiments indicated that flowers having recurved spurs deposit significantly more pollen grains on hummingbird visitors than flowers having perpendicular spurs, apparently as a result of greater contact between the androecium of curve-spurred flowers and the upper bill of hummingbirds. We also found a significant relationship between spur curvature and flower length, suggesting a developmental link between the two traits.

The 15 crosses plus reciprocals, parents, and checks were evaluated in cold chambers. Growing conditions were 14 hours with light at 14°C, and 10 hours without light at 10°C. Days to emergence, percent emergence, shoot dry weight, and root dry weight were recorded. The experiment was repeated in the greenhouse under warm conditions. Variation for cold tolerance was present among the crosses and cultivars. The variation was primarily due to general combining ability (GCA) effects, with specific combining ability (SCA) effects and reciprocal effects being significant for seedling dry mater. 'Howling Mob' had significant favorable GCAs for all cold tolerance traits and resulted in the most cold-tolerant hybrids. 'Country Gentleman' and 'Stowell's Evergreen' were the slowest emerging parents. Days to emergence under cold conditions was not correlated to days to emergence under warm conditions. The correlations between root weight (cold) and root weight (warm) and shoot weight (cold) and shoot weight (warm) were significant, positive, and relatively large.

To investigate the selective context under which IEMT evolved, maximum likelihood methods that estimate variable dN/dS ratios among lineages, among sites, and among a combination of both lineages and sites were utilized. Statistically significant support was obtained for a hypothesis of positive selection driving the evolution of IEMT since its origin. Subsequent Bayesian analyses identified several sites in IEMT that have experienced positive selection.

Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators; however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers, may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering plant - pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host, Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80% of available flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were 50% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with low robbing relative to a plant with high robbing, suggesting that pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed any advantages associated with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased geitonogamy. Given the widespread nature of plant attack by nectar robbers, these indirect effects are likely common phenomena structuring natural plant populations.",Bombus occidentalis; Geitonogamy; Indirect effects; Ipomopsis aggregata; Nectar robbing; Plant reproductive success; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041813227

In addition to increasing fruit shape index, the 'Perennial' allele at fs3.1 increased fruit elongation and decreased fruit width and pericarp thickness. We verified the effect of fs3.1 in backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from crossing 'Perennial' with 'Maor' and with a second blocky-type inbred line of C. annuum. To determine the effect of the fs3.1 region in additional Capsicum species, we constructed an advanced backcross population from the cross of 'Maor' and the oval-fruited Capsicum frutescens BG 2816 and an F2 of the introgression line IL 152 that contains an introgression of the fs3.1 region from Capsicum chinense PI 152225.

The effect of fs3.1 on the growth of fruit dimensions varied with the genetic background. By measuring the length and width of ovaries and fruits of near-isogenic C. annuum lines that differ in fs3.1 during fruit development, we determined that fs3.1 controls shape predominantly by increasing the growth rate of the longitudinal axis in the first 2 weeks after pollination.

Using these variance components, we demonstrate significant male gametic variability among years for individual trees. However, results indicate that yearly variation in the 'global pollen pool', averaged over all 15 seed trees for these 4 years, is effectively zero.

Single season analyses yield Nep?2.05, which is 40% less than the value of Nep estimated from 4 years of data. We discuss optimal sampling for future studies designed to estimate Nep.

Box 3000, FIN-90014 Oulu, Finland","In gynodioecious plants, seed offspring from hermaphrodites often perform less well than those from females. This lower performance sometimes can be attributed to inbreeding by hermaphrodites or to relatively greater provisioning of individual seeds by females. However, these hypotheses are not explanatory when only outcrossing occurs and when individual seeds of the two morphs are equally well provisioned. Three hypotheses may explain the lower fitness of seed offspring from hermaphrodites in such cases. The morphology hypothesis states that the opportunity for gametophytic selection is lower within flowers of hermaphrodites compared to flowers on females, because the perfect flowers of hermaphrodites are relatively short-styled. The cytotype hypothesis states that the performance difference is directly caused by an individual's cytotype, whose frequency in the population may differ for the two sex morphs. The pleiotropy hypothesis states that negative pleiotropic effects of nuclear restorer alleles or alleles hitchhiking with them are expressed more often by offspring from hermaphrodites. We performed two experiments using the gynodioecious plant Silene acaulis to contrast these hypotheses. In our first experiment we contrasted the morphology and pleiotropy hypotheses by performing controlled pollinations and subsequently planting seeds in both the greenhouse and field. Hermaphrodites of S. acaulis can produce both pistillate and perfect flowers, which allowed us to determine whether flower morphology affects offspring survivorship independent of the sex of the maternal parent. We found that neither seed mass nor germination differed between seeds from females and hermaphrodites. Offspring from pistillate flowers on hermaphrodites did not differ significantly in their survival compared to offspring from perfect flowers on hermaphrodites, but had lower survivorship compared to offspring from pistillate flowers on females, refuting the morphology hypothesis. In a second experiment, we compared offspring survival of full-sibling pairs of females and hermaphrodites (who shared the same cytoplasm) to contrast the cytotype and pleiotropy hypotheses. We found that seed offspring from females and hermaphrodites that shared the same cytoplasm differed in their survival, which is counter to the prediction of the cytotype hypothesis. In both experiments, the sex of the maternal parent significantly affected offspring survival, with seed offspring from hermaphrodites surviving less well than those from females. These results support the pleiotropy hypothesis. We conclude by discussing alternative ways of thinking about negative pleiotropic effects of nuclear restorers or ""the cost of restoration"".",Fitness; Gametophytic selection; Gynodioecy; Negative pleiotropy; Nuclear restorers; Seed size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037297393

Because pollen discounting is strongest when selfing occurs between flowers on the same plant, the advantage of protandry may be greatest in plants with large floral displays. We tested this hypothesis with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry (producing uniformly adichogamous or mixed protandrous and adichogamous populations) and inflorescence size (two-, six-, or 10-flowered inflorescences) and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female outcrossing rate, and outcross siring success. Bees spent more time foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inftorescences than small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size treatments. However, seed set per fruit decreased with increasing inflorescence size, likely as a result of increased abortion of selfed embryos, perhaps obscuring the magnitude of geitonogamous selfing. Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than adichogamous plants, but similar seed set. More importantly, protandrous plants had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to adichogamous plants. However, this siring advantage did not increase linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower interference.",Dichogamy; Geitonogamy; Inflorescence size; Interference avoidance; Male reproductive success; Pollen discounting; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037297394

The flowering synchrony of trees has also been proposed as an additional factor in controlling fruit set and regulating levels of outcrossing, particularly in disturbed habitats. We examined the effects of forest fragmentation and flowering phenology on the reproductive success and genetic structure of the progeny produced by the tropical tree Pachira quinata. We conducted our study in the dry forest of Costa Rica and compared trees in two density and environmental conditions: (1) isolated trees separated by 500 m from other adult conspecifics and located in disturbed sites and (2) trees from continuous populations of groups of 20 or more reproductive individuals per hectare surrounded by undisturbed mature forest. Our study was conducted in the Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica, and surrounding areas. To evaluate flowering phenology, trees were classified as having synchronous or asynchronous flowering. The phenological stage of individuals was classified according to the proximity of the peak flowering date of each tree with respect to the mean peak flowering of the rest of the population. Six percent of the flowers produced a fruit in trees from continuous populations, whereas in isolated trees only 3% of the flowers did so. Fruit set was not affected by the flowering phenology of trees but was influenced mainly by factors associated with forest fragmentation. Seed production per fruit was not affected by forest fragmentation or flowering phenology. Overall, total fruit production per tree was not affected by forest fragmentation, because isolated trees tended to produce more flowers than trees from continuous populations. Genetic analysis revealed that the progeny of trees from continuous populations experienced lower levels of relatedness, a tendency for higher levels of outcrossing, and/ or more sires than isolated trees. Our results suggest that forest fragmentation can have an effect on the mating patterns of P. quinata, reducing the number of outcross sires represented in the progeny of isolated trees.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037324486

Self-incompatibility (SI) alleles have been transferred from Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa into B. napus var. oleifera. An understanding of expression of these alleles in B. napus is essential for their commercial use. Four SI B. napus doubled haploids containing the B. oleracea S-alleles S2, S5, S13 and S24 were crossed to three B. napus cultivars to measure the B. napus genetic background effect on S-allele expression. A line × tester analysis indicated that the largest source of variation in the expression rate of SI was the S-allele itself. The B. napus genotypes tested contained modifier gene(s), some that enhanced SI expression and others that inhibited SI expression. The B. napus Canadian cultivar 'Westar' generally had a negative effect on SI expression while the European cultivar 'Topas' had a positive effect on the B. oleracea S-allele expression. The B. oleracea S-allele S24 was very similar in expression to the B. rapa allele WI. The application of these results for the use of B. oleracea S-alleles for hybrid production in B. napus is discussed.",Brassica oleracea; Brassica rapa; Oilseed rape; S-alleles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037331997

Studies were undertaken to determine the potential for producing broccoli seed using self-compatible selections from open-pollinated (OP) populations or doubled-haploid (DH) programs. In all outdoor and greenhouse trials, three OP selections and seven DH lines produced selfed seed, but seed weight per plant and number per plant varied significantly among the entries. In all environments there were individuals with relatively high (i.e.,<3 g/plant) production that were significantly different from low (i.e., <2 g/plant) producers. The relative productivity of some lines varied greatly between experiments, which indicates that seed production of particular genotypes is affected differently by environmental conditions. This indicates the importance of identifying lines that are high producers of selfed seed across different environments. Two OP cultivar-derived lines (USVL102 and USVL104) and two DH lines (USVL062 and USVL093) were identified that consistently produced relatively high yields in greenhouse and screen cage trials.

All three varieties increased in fresh weight until 28 d after pollination (DAP), but o2 lost large amounts of water during the later stages, thus rendering its dry weight content much higher. Protein content (mg seed-1) was increased similarly in all three varieties, but protein concentration (mg g-tissue-1) was highest in o2 and lowest in WT. WT and SW accumulated about three times as much zein, and three times the amount of protein bodies (PB) as did o2, but only about half the amount of the cytoskeleton proteins, actin, ?;-tubulin, and EF1?. Protein synthesizing potential (measured as polysomes and polysomal mRNA) was high in WT, somewhat lower in SW, and much lower in o2.

This apparent discrepancy (less polysomes, but equal protein accumulation in o2) can be explained by the fact that protein synthesis is dependent not only on the amount of polyribosomes, but also on the cytoskeleton, either in the construction of the cytoskeleton as a scaffold for polysomes·mRNA, or as a provider of factors (EF1?) essential for translation. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

Whereas the flower was closed, no notable changes were found. However, pollination strongly stimulated the synthesis of the F (free) and ASC (acid soluble conjugated) forms, the pistil and not the petals being the main responsible. During embryogenesis, major alterations appeared in the synthesis of free and conjugated PA and ABA. Seeds, and not the silique wall, contributed most to the total content of the different F-PA (free polyamines) in the silique, this contribution involving all the PA studied. During seed desiccation, F-Put remained almost undetectable whereas F-Spd and F-Spm were very high. This is also applicable to ASC-Spd and ASC-Spm, this not being noted in the silique wall. During the first 5 stages of silique embryogenesis, the wall had higher levels of AIC-PA (acid insoluble conjugated polyamines) than in the seeds, primarily due to AIC-Spd and AIC-Spm. By contrast, during the middle and final phases AIC-PA was found more in the seeds than in the silique wall. The free and conjugated ABA showed the presence of 3 and 2 peaks in the seeds and the silique wall, respectively. The first corresponded to the onset of development, the second appeared when the highest moisture content was reached, and the third coincided with the triggering of carotenoid synthesis when the seed and the silique wall had lost more than 70-75% of their moisture. Finally, it is shown that the dry seeds of turnip tops were highly heterogeneous, not only in their germinative capacity, but also in the levels of free and conjugated ABA, which increased inversely to the germinative capacity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037948806

L67-3483, which originated from the cultivar Clark after X-ray irradiation, is male and female fertile. All F1 plants in reciprocal pollinations of L67-3483 with 'Clark', 'Minsoy', or 'BSR 101' were female partial sterile. Partial sterility is expressed in the heterozygous condition at a single locus and upon self-pollination this locus exhibits a 1:1 segregation pattern. This locus is located on the terminus of the soybean molecular linkage group D1b+W, between simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Satt157 and Satt266, and is linked to each by 5.3 and 1.2 cM, respectively. This gene is transmitted through both female and male gametes and there was no segregation distortion of SSR markers linked to this gene. We concluded that this female partial-sterile gene is a new mutation class, and differs from the previously reported mutation classes in soybean, i.e., sporophytic mutation, gametophytic female-specific mutation, and general gametophytic mutation. Restriction of recombination around the mutant gene suggested that this gene is located near or within (a) small inversion(s) or adjacent to (a) chromosomal deletion(s).",Glycine max; Recombination restriction; Simple sequence repeat marker,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037310582

In placenta/pedicel, 79 genes were significantly affected by stress and of these 89% were up-regulated, whereas in endosperm, 56 genes were significantly affected and 82% of these were down-regulated. Only nine of the stress-regulated genes were in common between these tissues. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that different sets of genes were regulated in the two tissues. After rewatering at 9 DAP, profiles at 12 DAP suggested that two regulons exist, one for genes responding specifically to concurrent imposition of stress, and another for genes remaining affected after transient stress. In placenta, genes encoding recognized stress tolerance proteins, including heat shock proteins, chaperonins, and major intrinsic proteins, were the largest class of genes regulated, all of which were up-regulated. In contrast, in endosperm, genes in the cell division and growth category represented a large class of down-regulated genes. Several cell wall-degrading enzymes were expressed at lower levels than in controls, suggesting that stress delayed normal advance to programmed cell death in the central endosperm.

Of the 32 terpene synthase genes in the Arabidopsis genome, 20 were found to be expressed in flowers, 6 of these exclusively or almost exclusively so. Two terpene synthase genes expressed exclusively in the flowers and one terpene synthase gene expressed almost exclusively in the flowers were characterized and found to encode proteins that catalyze the formation of major floral volatiles. A ?-glucuronidase fusion construct with a promoter of one of these genes demonstrated that gene expression was restricted to the sepals, stigmas, anther filaments, and receptacles, reaching a peak when the stigma was receptive to cross pollen.

Nucellar seedlings of 'Muvandan' 'Bappakai' and 'Olour' were vigorous rootstocks in decreasing order of vigour, while those of 'Vellaikulamban' imparted dwarfing, in comparison with the scion grafted on its own open-pollinated zygotic seedlings. The cumulative fruit yield per tree was higher on the vigorous rootstocks, particularly 'Muvandan' and 'Olour'; the latter rootstock also resulting in early higher yields of the scion. However, the fruit yields per unit canopy volume and per unit land area were higher with the dwarfing 'Vellaikulamban' rootstock. Based on the analysis of variance and game theory analysis of growth and yield data of several years, nucellar seedlings of 'Vellaikulamban' and 'Olour' were suggested as potential rootstocks for intensive cultivation of 'Alphonso' scion. Correlation studies indicated trunk cross sectional area to be a good indicator of vigour in mango and cumulative fruit yield during the initial 16 years was highly correlated with that during the subsequent years. The bienniality parameters worked out with the yield data over a number of years suggested 'Alphonso' to be of irregular bearing nature which was controlled more by exogenous factors than endogenous ones and slightly influenced by the rootstocks. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A total of 275 nests of 12 species of bees were located. All nests were closely associated with living (91.5%) or dead (8.5%) trees, either within pre-formed cavities in the trunk (cavity nests) or situated in or under the tree base (base nests). Species of bees differed in nesting habit. The majority of species (seven) were cavity nesters, but the majority of nests (81%) were base nests. Nests were often aggregated (mean of 1.94 nests/nest tree), with up to eight colonies and three species in a single tree. Nest trees were mostly large to very large (86.1% above 60 cm dbh) commercial timber trees; 47.3% of nest trees were dipterocarps. According to visual inspection nest trees were of significantly lower expected timber quality then randomly chosen control trees. Taking into account information on tree species, size and expected timber quality, we estimated that 34.0 or 42.6% of nest trees were potential harvest trees, depending on harvesting regulations (reduced impact logging (RIL) versus conventional). Lower percentages under RIL guidelines were mostly due to size restrictions that protect very large trees (>120 cm dbh). Harvesting is likely to kill bee colonies associated with the respective tree. Therefore, and because meliponine colonies are long-lived and have low fecundity, direct impact from logging may have lasting effects on bee populations. Harvesting guidelines that retain high proportions of large and hollow trees should be promoted in order to preserve meliponine pollination in sustainable forest management. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper presents an analysis of yield components for pearl millet, to explain the specific adaptation of local landraces to stress environments in Rajasthan, India. Six genotypes, ranging from high-tillering traditional landraces to low-tillering open-pollinated modern cultivars, were grown in 20 experiments, covering a range of non-stress and drought stress patterns. In each experiment, yield components (panicle number, grain number, 100 grain mass) were measured separately for main shoots, basal tillers, and nodal tillers. Under optimum conditions, landraces had a significantly lower grain yield than the cultivars, but no significant differences were observed at yield levels around 1 ton ha-1. This genotype x environment interaction for grain yield was due to a difference in yield strategy, where landraces aimed at minimising the risk of a crop failure under stress conditions, and modern cultivars aimed at maximising yield potential under optimum conditions. A key aspect of the adaptation of landraces was the small size of the main shoot panicle, as it minimised (1) the loss of productive tillers during stem elongation; (2) the delay in anthesis if mid-season drought occurs; and (3) the reduction in panicle productivity of the basal tillers under stress. In addition, a low investment in structural panicle weight, relative to vegetative crop growth rate, promoted the production of nodal tillers, providing a mechanism to compensate for reduced basal tiller productivity if stress occurred around anthesis. A low maximum 100 grain mass also ensured individual grain mass was little affected by environmental conditions. The strategy of the high-tillering landraces carries a yield penalty under optimum conditions, but is expected to minimise the risk of a crop failure, particularly if mid-season drought stress occurs. The yield architecture of low-tillering varieties, by contrast, will be suited to end-of-season drought stress, provided anthesis is early. Application of the above adaptation mechanisms into a breeding program could enable the identification of plant types that match the prevalent stress patterns in the target environments. © 2003 E.J. van Oosterom.

Koch (Araceae). Alocasia odora is pollinated by its specific pollinators, Colocasiomyia alocasiae (Okada) and C. xenalocasiae (Okada) (Diptera: Drosophilidae). These flies use the spadix of A. odora as breeding sites. The appendix, which is at an upper part of the spadix and is the most attractive region, attracted these pollinators by emitting volatiles, although the male zone of the inflorescence was also attractive. The number of flies attracted was positively correlated with appendix size. During the pistillate phase of the protogynous spadix, attracted flies aggregated in the lower part (female zone) to mate, lay eggs, and perhaps obtain nutrients. The flies moved to the upper part (male zone) of the spadix by the tightening of the constriction separating the upper and lower parts, and then the staminate phase started. This movement of the flies on the spadix promotes outcrossing of A. odora. Removal of the appendix or the whole upper part of the spadix resulted in much reduced fruit set, suggesting that the absence of the scent-producing region leads to insufficient pollination because of reduced pollinator attraction.",Alocasia; Araceae; Colocasiomyia; Drosophilidae; Floral odor; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0842310468

We describe the preference of four insects (three bees and one butterfly) and one hummingbird species for floral characters, and estimated the strength, direction, and form of pollinator-mediated selection through female fitness. We applied geometric morphometrics to describe the preference of pollinator species for different guide shapes. Our results revealed striking differences in the floral phenotypes preferred by insects and hummingbirds. Insects visited flowers with corollas 1.25-fold larger and guides 1.72-fold larger than the hummingbird species did. While insects preferred flowers with nectar guides pointing toward the corolla tube, the hummingbird preferred flowers with heart-shaped nectar guides. Most of the floral preferences shown by pollinators translated into significant linear and nonlinear selection coefficients. When selection was analyzed on a per-flower basis and for female fitness, corolla size was under positive directional selection, and nectar guide size and shape were under disruptive selection. Because the insect and hummingbird pollinators showed a strong segregation in their daily activity time, we suggest that current disruptive selection on the nectar guide phenotype can result from the differential availability of the rewarding floral variants over a day. Our findings suggest that pollinator-mediated selection favoring extreme phenotypes in M. luteus may not only contribute to high nectar guide variation found in this species, but also can promote divergence of corolla and nectar guide traits.",Disruptive selection; Divergence; Geometric morphometrics; Natural selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344153470

I asked which floral characteristics are important in specializing on either bat or hummingbird pollination, and whether overlap between these floral syndromes can exist. I examined nocturnal and diurnal pollen deposition, pollinator visitation rates, and single visit effectiveness and related them to intra-and interspecific variation in Burmeistera floral characteristics at Monteverde, Costa Rica. Bats and hummingbirds visited both Burmeistera species, and bats pollinated both species. Owing to differences in floral morphology, however, hummingbirds effectively pollinated only B. tenuiflora. The generalized pollination system of B. tenuiflora demonstrates that there can be overlap in the boundary between ornithophily and chiropterophily, and that nectar production and timing of anthesis do not serve as barriers between these syndromes. The high intraspecific variation in floral color from green to red or purple did not correlate with either nocturnal or diurnal pollen deposition. Degree of flower accessibility did affect pollination; nocturnal pollen deposition significantly decreased as flowers become more obstructed.

A range of discrete pollen doses applied to cranberry stigmas resulted in decelerating curvilinear responses for fruiting, berry size, and seed set. Minimum thresholds and maximum asymptotes bounded reproductive responses to incremental stigmatic pollen loads. Four bee species were compared for their pollination efficacies on commercial cranberries, using counts of pollen received by stigmas during single bee visits to previously virgin flowers. Differences between these bee species were found to be exaggerated when raw pollen counts were used for comparison because foragers of some species often delivered pollen in excess of that needed to maximize fruit and seed production. Sixfold differences between species in mean pollen deposition translated into 1.5-2-fold differences in predicted cranberry fruit set and size.

Their extreme degree of local mating leads to highly female biased sex ratios that should eliminate the benefits of fighting and dispersal by males. Furthermore, males sharing a fig are often brothers, and fighting may be barred by kin selection. Therefore, theory supported the presumed absence of fighting and dispersal in pollinating fig wasp males. However, we report here that in pollinating fig wasps, fighting between brothers evolved at least four and possibly six times, and dispersal by males at least twice. This finding supports the idea that competition between relatives can cancel the ameliorating effects of relatedness.

The net outcome of a single visit for the plant depends on the number of ovules fertilised by the visitor, the number of eggs laid, and the number of seeds eaten by each larva. Unlike other known plant-seed eater pollinating mutualisms, the globeflower-globeflower fly mutualism (Trollius europaeus-Chiastocheta spp.) is unique in that not only females but also males visit flowers, and both sexes are potential pollinators. I analysed the relative efficiency of Chiastocheta males versus females in transporting pollen and fertilising globeflower ovules. I show that there is no sex-specific morphological adaptation or behaviour to enhance pollen collection and transportation in Chiastocheta flies, and that males contribute to pollination. However, because of their smaller body size, males transport significantly less pollen than females. Less seeds are produced after a visit from a male than after a visit from a female. A single female visit contributes to about 12% of total seed production, and a single male visit to only 5.4%. Females tend to spend more time inside the flower than males, and the number of ovules fertilised is significantly correlated with the time insects spent inside the closed corolla. The lower efficiency of ovule fertilisation by a male's single visit is compensated for by the higher rate of flower visitation by males: a flower receives about twice as many visits from males as from females during a time unit. The contribution of males to pollination is of major importance with respect to understanding the evolutionary stability of the globeflower-globeflower fly mutualism, as males satiate pollen requirement of flowers, masking the antagonistic effect of ovipositing females.",Pollen load; Pollination; Sex-specific behaviour; Specialisation; Symbiosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037360063

Host species could affect parasite interactions with both herbivores and pollinators due to the uptake of defensive compounds and nutrients. However, the effects of different host species on parasitic plants have not been experimentally tested in the field. I determined the effect of two native host species, an alkaloid-producing, nitrogen-fixing lupine and non-alkaloid, non-nitrogen-fixing grass, on herbivory, pollination, and reproduction of the hemiparasitic plant Indian paintbrush (Castilleja indivisa). Within this experiment, I manipulated herbivory and pollination to determine their effects on Indian paintbrush reproduction. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced three times as many seeds and were more attractive to pollinators than Indian paintbrush parasitizing grass. However, there was no effect of host species on early season or floral herbivory. In addition, MANOVA revealed that host species influenced the response of Indian paintbrush female reproduction to experimentally manipulated herbivory and pollination treatments. Thus, the effect of hosts on parasites is mediated by interactions with herbivores and pollinators, and both direct and indirect effects may shape the selective pressures mediating interactions between hosts and parasites.",Andropogon gerardii; Castilleja indivisa; Diffuse coevolution; Indian paintbrush; Indirect effects; Lupinus texensis; Nitrogen fixation; Parasitism; Tritrophic interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345447458

Insects of the order Hymenoptera predominate in A. incarnata pollination, but there appears to be no specialization for pollination within this order. Pollinators varied significantly in nearly every component of effectiveness that we measured, including pollen load, removal and deposition of pollen, pollination efficiency (deposition/removal), flower-handling time, and potential for geitonogamy (fractional pollen deposition). The visitation rate of pollinators also varied significantly between years and through time within years. Pollination success and percentage fruit-set of unmanipulated plants in the population also varied significantly between years, and pollination success varied among sample times within years. Most components of effectiveness were weakly correlated, suggesting that the contributions of visitor species toward pollination varied among effectiveness components. Mean flower-handling time, however, was strongly correlated with several components, including pollen removal and deposition, pollination efficiency, and fractional pollen deposition.

Such behaviour can only evolve if it benefits the pollinator in some way. The wasps that pollinate Ficus inflorescences can be active or passive pollinators. They lay their eggs in fig flowers, so that a proportion of flowers will host a wasp larva instead of a seed. We show in an actively pollinated monoecious fig that lack of pollination does not induce fig abortion or affect wasp offspring size but results in smaller numbers of offspring. Hence, conversely to other active pollination systems, seed formation is not obligatory to sustain developing pollinator larvae; however there is a direct fitness cost to active pollinators not to pollinate. We then compared the locations of eggs and fertilised flowers of three actively pollinated Ficus species and one passively pollinated species. We found that more flowers containing wasp eggs were fertilised in the actively pollinated species relative to those of the passively pollinated one. These results along with comparison with similar studies on dioecious figs, support the hypothesis that active pollination has evolved in fig wasps to ensure that more flowers containing wasp eggs are fertilised as this may increase the chances of successful gall development.

Our goal was to quantify the reproductive assurance benefit of autonomous selfing and the stochastic nature of pollinator-mediated pollen receipt using three wild populations of the annual species Collinsia verna (Scrophulariaceae) over three years. The timing of autonomous self-pollination in C. verna ranges from competing to delayed, with more than half of the autonomous pollen arriving late in floral life. Floral density, identity of insect floral visitors, and visitation rate varied within and among years, with significant variation in pollinator community between years within populations. Pollinator failure reduced fruit set within and among populations across years. However, reproductive assurance selfing increased fruit set on average by 8% overall and up to 30% in one population. Despite this fitness benefit, fruit set (=?fruits/?flowers) estimated in pollinator-exclusion cages was significantly less than the fruit set in paired open-pollinated plots. In a series of experiments, we found no difference in fruit set from self- vs. outcross pollen, ruling out early inbreeding depression. However, flowers, hand-outcrossed at the same time that autonomous selfing naturally occurs, produced significantly more fruits relative to flowers that received pollen only through autonomous selfing. These results suggest that pollen type (self/outcross) is less important to fruiting success than is the timing or efficiency of autonomous pollination relative to vector-mediated pollination. Our results support the reproductive assurance hypothesis and suggest that autonomous selfing in C. verna is adaptive under variable pollinator conditions. Fruit set results from both pollinator-delivered and autonomous self-pollen, suggesting a ""best of both worlds"" scenario, with mixed mating a likely outcome.",Autonomous selfing; Collinsia verna; Competing selfing; Delayed selfing; Mating-system evolution; Mixed mating; Pollen limitation; Pollinator failure; Reproductive assurance; Resource limitation; Selection on floral traits; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1342330829

Fragrance chemistry was species-specific during nocturnal emissions, whereas odors emitted diurnally were less distinct. All species emitted greater amounts of fragrance at night, regardless of pollinator affinity. However, these species differed markedly in odor complexity and emission rates, even among close relatives. Species-specific differences in emission rates per flower and per unit fresh or dry flower mass were significantly correlated; fragrance differences between species were not greatly affected by different forms of standardization.

On the basis of evidence of pollinator limitation in females and low flower visitation rates, a hypothesis has been proposed to explain geographic variation in the breeding system of P. pringlei. The pollinator abundance hypothesis predicts high frequencies of males and females in areas where L. curasoae is abundant and high frequency of hermaphrodites in areas where this bat is uncommon. We test this hypothesis by describing the following: first, the relationship between sex frequencies and bat abundance as revealed by nocturnal pollen deposition on stigmas of female plants and, second, the extent of pollinator limitation for fruit set in females and hermaphrodites in four populations of P. pringlei from coastal Sonora, Mexico. We also describe geographic variation in the relative fitness of females compared with hermaphrodites and out-crossing rates and inbreeding depression of self-compatible hermaphrodites in these populations. Some of these parameters should vary with bat abundance according to this hypothesis. Sex-frequency distributions showed a clear latitudinal pattern, with gynodioecious populations in the southern range and trioecious populations in the northern range. Large differences in nocturnal pollen deposition in females and abundance of L. curasoae were detected among populations but not as predicted by the pollinator abundance hypothesis. Fruit set was greater in females than in hermaphrodites in different pollination treatments, and no evidence of pollinator limitation was detected in either sex class. In general, the relative fitness of females was greater than hermaphrodites in most populations. Outcrossing rates in hermaphrodites were close to 1.0 in each population. Field and experimental data indicated no evidence of inbreeding depression.

In a field experiment, we examined the effects of resemblance between male and female flowers on pollinator behavior and the amount of geitonogamous pollination. When the same numbers of female and male flowers were presented in an artificial floral array, solitary bees tended to visit female flowers first and then visit male flowers in a foraging sequence. However, when sepals of male flowers were glued to female flowers from which the original sepals had been removed to produce floral monomorphism, solitary bees frequently moved from male to female flowers. Consequently, the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas per array visit was increased. The results show that floral monomorphism increases geitonogamous pollination, and female > male flower-size dimorphism in A. quinata can avoid geitonogamous pollination.

We experimentally evaluated these effects using the nonrewarding bumblebee-pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated nectar-producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of nectar-producing plants (Geum rivale and Allium schoenoprasum) than for individuals placed outside (?20 m away) such patches. These results provide support for the existence of a facilitative magnet species effect in the interaction between certain nectar plants and A. morio. To determine the spatial scale of these interactions, we correlated the visitation rate to flowers of A. morio with the density of sympatric nectar plants in 1-m 2 and 100-m2 plots centered around groups of translocated plants, and at the level of whole meadows (?0.5-2 ha). Visitation rate to flowers of A. morio was not correlated with the 1-m2 patch density of G. rivale and A. schoenoprasum, but showed a significant positive relationship with density of these nectar plants in 100-m2 plots. In addition, visitation to flowers of A. morio was strongly and positively related to the density of A. schoenoprasum at the level of the meadow. Choice experiments showed that bees foraging on the purple flowers of A. schoenoprasum (a particularly effective magnet species) visit the purple flowers of A. morio more readily (47.6% of choices) than bees foraging on the yellow flowers of Lotus corniculatus (17% of choices). Overall similarity in flower color and shape may increase the probability that a pollinator will temporarily shift from a nectar-producing ""magnet"" plant to a nonrewarding plant.

Natural seed set varied slightly across populations, with an average of 71% of ovules fertilized per fruit. At the population level, seed set was not limited by receipt of pollen. At the plant level, seed set per flower first increased, then decreased in response to an increasing density of flowering plants within 2 m. This suggests that neighboring flowers facilitate pollinator visitation at low densities then compete for visits at higher densities. Observed pollinator visitation rates support this interpretation.

We used three potential N-sources in forest soil solution, NO3-, NH4+ and amino acids, to establish N uptake rates by the plants, whether or not associated with a fungus isolated from the field and identified as Paxillus involutus. NO 3- fluxes were determined locally at the root surface using NO3--selective microelectrodes whereas NH 4+ and amino acid (L-glutamate and L-aspartate) uptake rates were calculated from their depletion of the incubation solution by the whole root system. Root systems were digitised in order to determine the number and the length of different root types. In non-mycorrhizal plants, the results showed that the most distinguishing parameters between OPF were NO 3- uptake rates measured in the white tip of the secondary roots and the root architecture, with higher values determined in high-growth than in low-growth field performance OPF. The presence of the mycorrhizal fungus decreased NO3- uptake rates in both OPF and had an opposite effect on root architecture by increasing it in low-growth and decreasing it in high-growth field performance OPF, respectively.

Mycorrhizal symbiosis did not change NH4+ uptake rates whereas it increased that of amino acids, specifically that of L-aspartate in the low-growth field performance OPF.

In temperate latitudes, interactions with climate, especially temperature, may affect both plants and their animal mutualists. Winter-flowering plants allow assessment of biotic influences on the evolution of flowering time because temperature is unlikely to select directly for this uncommon reproductive behavior. In northwestern Patagonia, the hemiparasitic mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus flowers from early fall, through the cool winter, to late spring. This species is pollinated by the hummingbird Sephanoides galeritus, and its seeds are dispersed by the marsupial Dromiciops australis. In two populations during two years, I analyzed seasonal variation in pollination, fruit production, and fruit removal. Hummingbird visitation was lowest in winter and late spring, and flowers opening during those periods showed reduced pollination and fruit set, partly due to pollinator limitation, compared to flowers that opened during fall or early spring. Fruits that ripened during summer (January-March) had a higher chance of being removed than fruits ripening during either spring or fall, due to their overlap with the period of maximum disperser activity. Timing of flower opening was strongly associated with fruit maturation time and with fruit removal rates. Thus, even though flowers that opened during winter exhibited only moderate fruit production, their fruits benefited from high fruit removal and seed dispersal in mid to late summer. These results suggest that the activity period of this plant's disperser, in combination with a lack of strong pollination constraints, probably governed the evolution of flowering phenology in this mistletoe. However, the proximate influence of temperature on flower and fruit development may prevent a fine-tuned match between flowering phenology and the period of maximum mutualist activity.",Flowering phenology; Fruit removal; Fruit set; Hummingbird pollination; Marsupial dispersal; Mistletoe; Pollen limitation; Seed dispersal; Tristerix corymbosus; Winter flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1342289320

At the time of the pollination, most of the observed preparations of ovules were characterized by the occurrence of a deeply staining substance on the papillate stigmatic apparatus with the attached pollen. After the definitive closing of micropyle, the pollen grains were engulfed into the distal part of micropylar canal, approximately 300 ?m from the nucellus of the inverted ovule. Exine of the pollen grains was broken and shed, whereas the tube cell and intine became moderately swollen. Approximately 4 weeks after the loss of exine, the pollen grains were brought upwards into the tip of the nucellus. Before the start of the germination in a very flat pollen chamber, the pollen grains became increased in length and their body cell was characterized by the markedly optically dense cytoplasm. Despite this usual way of the pollen behaviour between pollination and fertilization, relatively high percentage of the ovules (19.8% on average) remained unfertilized, although their previous pollination had been successful. Besides some other factors, this phenomenon is explained, above all, by the disturbances in pollination mechanism (in particular, absence of the liquid in micropylar canal and restraint of the pollen displacement to the nucellus).",Larix decidua; Ovule; Pollen; Pollination mechanism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242710174

It is a generally accepted idea that higher temperatures in the period preceding ripening of the flowers determine earlier pollination. To verify if a correlation between the air temperature and the date of onset of the pollination period of Quercus spp. exists, a comparative study was carried out over 7 years (1995-2001) in two South-European towns: Vigo (Spain) and Perugia (Italy). Quercus pollen is released in the atmosphere of Perugia on average in the last two weeks of April while in the Spanish region the pollination occurs on average one month before. In order to overcome the dormancy period Perugia requires 1110 Chilling Hours (CH)-884 Growth Degree-Days (GDD°C) and Vigo 709 CH-861 GDD°C. With the Ashcroft method Perugia needs 1075 CH-1000 GDD°C and Vigo 625 CH-1512 GDD°C. Heat accumulation from the end of winter dormancy to the onset of pollination, showed the highest significance when mean temperature in Perugia and maximum temperature in Vigo were used. Every year we have found that the colder station needed a lower heat accumulation: Perugia required a higher quantity of chilling and heat than Vigo. However, the correlation detected between temperature and flowering was, on average, less significant that those found in the same regions for other arboreal taxa that present winter pollination (e.g. Corylus, Alnus). This preliminary study suggests that there is an effect of air temperature on Quercus pollination, but other environmental factors, such as photoperiod, hours of light, rainfall, relative humidity, may be of great influence in determining the onset of pollination in plants with a spring flowering.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141703200

Understanding the fundamental components defining these communities is essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We examined the structure of plant-pollinator communities in a dynamic Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity. Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental factors govern the community. Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities at various levels: (1) The overall structure of the bee community (116 species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age. (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on age-characteristic post-fire floral community structure explained 39-50% of overall variation observed in bee community structure. Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of similarity in their species composition (27-59%); however, the geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but significant component to bee community structure. We conclude that floral resources act in specific and previously unexplored ways to modulate the diversity of the local geographic species pool, with specific disturbance factors, superimposed upon these patterns, mainly affecting the dominant species.",Bee diversity; Community structure; Energy partitioning; Fire; Grazing; Mediterranean; Nectar; Nest substrate availability; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242722358

The number of compounds (fatty acid derivatives, benzenoids, phenyl propanoids, isoprenoids, and nitrogen containing compounds) identified in the floral odors ranged from 18 to 51 but all were dominated by only 1-3 compounds. Most of the compounds identified in this study have been previously reported in floral scents from species of the closely related genus Silene L. However, the phenyl propanoids eugenol, methyleugenol, methylisoeugenol, cis-asarone, and trans-asarone have formerly not been found in Silene. Based on the measurement of Sørensen's index of similarity (Is) nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to detect meaningful underlying dimensions and to visualize similarities between the investigated species. The MDS analysis showed three groups of species, (1) the diurnal D. armeria, D. barbatus, and D. deltoides are characterized by the predominance of fatty acid derivatives, (2) the closely related nocturnal D. monspessulanus, and D. superbus by high relative amounts of isoprenoids such as cis-?-ocimene and ?-caryophyllene, and (3) the species D. arenarius, D. sylvestris and S. officinalis by a predominance of benzenoids, especially methylbenzoate.

Pre-dispersal seed predation, resulting in the destruction of developing seeds, may allow resource reallocation to the production of subsequent flowers. Silene latifolia, the white campion, is subject to pre-dispersal seed predation by noctuid moths. In order to determine the potential for resource reallocation in S. latifolia we conducted a greenhouse experiment in which female plants were subjected to three levels of pollination (0%, 50%, or 100%) and simulated pre-dispersal seed predation (0%, 50%, or 100% of total fruit production). We assigned 10 plants to each of the seven treatments (0% pollinated had no fruit); in total, 1490 flowers were measured for flower size and scored for date of flowering and longevity. Flower size decreased over the course of the experiment. Average daily production was 12.2 flowers per plant on non-pollinated plants, but only 4.3 flowers on 100% pollinated plants. Chi-square results showed that simulated seed predation resulted in additional flowering bouts later in the course of the experiment. Time series analysis showed that the time between flowering bouts was also influenced by predation. Plants with 0% predation had an average lag time of 29.5 days, whereas plants with 100% simulated seed predation had a lag period of 20.1 days. Flower longevity of non-pollinated flowers increased in plants that had flowers pollinated but experienced no seed predation. Simulated predation resulted in a decrease in floral longevity. These results suggest that plants reallocate resources to the production of new flowers after the destruction of fruits; thus, flowering phenology is influenced by pollination and seed predation. The relationship between pollinators and flowering phenology is well accepted; these results indicate that seed predators play an equally important role in determining flowering phenology.",Caryophyllaceae; Flowering phenology; Pollination; Seed predation; Silene latifolia; Time series analysis; White campion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345447459

Red-phase flowers seemed to indicate the low reward level of old flowers and functioned as a cue to discourage pollinators from staying longer on the same plant.

We contrasted patterns of specialization observed in five plant-pollinator interaction webs with predictions based on null models. In the five data sets, the observed number of extreme specialists and extreme generalists was significantly higher than the null expectation. This pattern was mostly due to a positive correlation between species frequency of interaction (f) and their estimated degree of generalization (s). After accounting for this association, the expected frequency distribution of degree of specialization generated by the null model closely matched the observed frequency distribution in the five data sets. A second null model, which explicitly incorporated the correlation between f and s, also generated expected frequency distributions of specialization that closely resemble those observed in the data sets. To make progress in understanding the distribution of degree of specialization in pollination systems it will be necessary not only to improve the quality of the data and to refine methods used to quantify specialization, but also to answer the question of why more frequently interacting species appear to be more generalized.",Frequency of interaction; Generalization; Mutualism; Null models; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollination; Sampling bias; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344585300

Edges could affect plant resources (through higher light) and/or pollinator behaviour. This study measures the degree to which pollination and resource limitation affect female reproductive success along a gradient of increasing exposure to the forest edge. Forty-two plants in pairs at varying distances from the forest edge were selected from within two Nothofagus forest fragments in the 1999/2000 season; and on one plant in each pair, all ripe undamaged flowers were hand-pollinated. Light levels and the degree of edge exposure were measured for each plant, and path analysis was used to determine the relationship of these variables to proportion fruit set. In agreement with previous studies, unmanipulated plants were found to be strongly pollen limited, especially in shady locations. However, on plants receiving hand-pollination, fruit set was uniformly high and was unaffected by edge exposure or light levels. Direct observation of flower visitation rates by birds in the 2000/01 season showed that edge flowers were visited twice as often as interior flowers. These results show that the higher fruit set on edges is due to visitation patterns of pollinators, and not due to greater resource availability on edges. This improved pollination on edges may help to buffer this declining plant against local extinction. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bird pollination; Edge effects; Fragmentation; Loranthaceae; Mistletoe; Peraxilla; Pollinator limitation; Resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0142063417

Relative humidity (RH) inside the microfibre bags was up to 20% below ambient during daytime hours, while the polythene and sponge treatments maintained increased levels of relative humidity, 40-50% higher than ambient. All bag types displayed increased temperatures over ambient, with the sponge treatment reaching temperatures as much as 10°C higher than ambient. The use of high viability pollen increased cone survival at harvest by 23% and mean number of developed seeds by 21 seeds per cone. The type of isolation material used during controlled pollination has a major impact on cone survival and seed set, while the role of pollen viability and self-pollination in successful controlled pollination was demonstrated.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842765428

A comparative analysis of the results reveals that this endemic flora does not comply with the general patterns previously observed in local floras, Mediterranean regional floras and floras of temperate latitudes. Predominant life forms are chamaephytes (45%) and hemicryptophytes (33%). By contrast, therophytes (11%) and phanerophytes (1%) are relatively infrequent. This spectrum of life forms mirrors the altitudinal distribution of the endemic species, their seed-dispersal strategy and the type of phytocoenoses in which they occur. As far seed-dispersal is concerned, 44% of the endemic species lack any noteworthy adaptive feature. However, the results clearly suggest that this limitation in their disseminative potential has only encouraged endemicity among the therophytes inhabiting lowlands. Among chamaephytes and hemicryptophytes of medium and high altitude, there is a relatively high frequency of exozoochory and anemochory, an adaptation that has contributed to the survival of small plant populations. 91% of the endemic species are pollinated by animals (insects), and only 3 species are dioecious. The dichotomies that the above mentioned characteristics produce (herbaceous vs woody life form, animal-assisted vs abiotic seed-dispersal, animal-assisted vs abiotic pollination and dioecious vs hermaphrodite reproductive mode), have been used to plot statistically significant associations. These are three: Pollination mode is linked with the seed-dispersal strategy, life form with pollination mode, and pollination mode with the reproductive mode. These associations contrast distinctly with results of previous surveys on whole floras, a contrast which makes the singularity of the endemic flora of the Southern Iberian peninsula even more remarkable.",Biological spectrum; Endemic species; Iberian Peninsula; Life forms; Mediterranean flora; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141855291

In this study we documented inter-annual shifts in the suite of floral visitors to Clematis socialis, a federally endangered species. These pollinator shifts were correlated with shifts in climatic variables that we used as a proxy for the potential effects of climatic change. In addition, we characterized floral visitor behavior and conducted single-visit seed set experiments to assess the pollination effectiveness of floral visitors. Five insect species visited flowers of C. socialis: two lepidopteran species (Erynnis juvenalis and Hemaris diffinis) and three bee species (Anthophora ursina, Bombus pennsylvanicus and Xylocopa virginica). Due to their relatively greater frequency of flower visitation and high single-visit seed set (ca. 2.6-3 seeds/visit), two bee species (Anthophora ursina and Bombus pennsylvanicus) are considered to be the major pollinators of C. socialis. However, the relative importance of each pollinator species varied between years. Anthophora ursina was the most important pollinator in 1997, a year when C. socialis bloomed later in the spring. Queens of Bombus pennsylvanicus were the primary pollinator during 1996, a year when C. socialis bloomed relatively early in the spring. We conclude that management plans that focus on the ""best pollinator"" of a suite of pollinators may not preserve the long-term reproductive integrity of endangered plants with generalized pollination systems. We further conclude that asynchrony between flowering season and pollinator activity patterns may be a risk factor associated with human-caused global climate change.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344445952

Here I examine the theoretical effectiveness of early generation selection. When dominance is absent, the genetic correlation (rG) between the performance of an Ft-derived Fg line (i.e., Ft:g) and a descendant homozygous line is equal to the square root of [1 + F(t)]/2, where F(t) is the inbreeding coefficient at generation t. Dominance, when present, has little effect on rG. The minimum value of rG is high; that is, 0.707 for an F2-derived line.

The identification of dry particulates for use as pollen diluents would facilitate the use of limited amounts of pollen and aid in accurate pollen application and dispersion. Four powders - Rilsan ES, polyester, wheat flour, and Lycopodium spores - were evaluated as pollen diluents using petunia as a model system. Diluents were combined with petunia pollen at a 5:1 (v/v) ratio. Two types of studies were conducted: (1) storage studies evaluated the viability of pollen combined and held with diluent for different durations; and (2) in vivo studies evaluated pollen tube growth in the styles of flowers pollinated with pollen-diluent mixtures. Pollen germination was not affected when stored as pollen-diluent mixtures for 4 days. Slight detrimental effects on pollen germination were observed after 6 days storage with Rilsan ES powders. Pollination with all the pollen-diluent mixtures resulted in fewer pollen tubes growing in the style compared to controls diluted with heat-killed pollen instead of diluent powders. Lycopodium-pollen mixtures were the most inhibitory, providing only 8% of the tube numbers observed in controls. Pollen mixed with polyester powders, Rilsan ES powders or wheat flour had tube numbers ranging from 47 to 61% of the control, but still had 175 or more pollen tubes per style, which would be sufficient for high rates of seed set in petunia. Wheat flour-pollen mixtures tended to clump and degrade pollen flow.

In the course of selection procedures, five poppy cultivars of high chemical diversity, 'Kheops', 'A1', 'Tebona', 'Kék Gemona' and 'Przemko', were selfed and crossed in two successive years (2000-01). After full ripening, both the biomass production and the alkaloid content of capsules of selfed and crossed plants were determined. When the castrated alkaloid-free cultivar 'Przemko' (accumulating only 0.01 mg/100 g morphine in capsules) was pollinated with cultivars rich in alkaloids, the morphine content of its capsules increased to 0.9-7.5 mg/100 g-values. Based on the well-known biosynthetic background of poppy alkaloids, this can be explained by promotion of (S)-norcoclaurine synthesis, which seems to be suppressed in alkaloid-free plants; but tissues of the developing hybrid seeds, which contain a combined gene pool of both alkaloid-free cultivar and that of the pollen donor plants, release this suppression. The chemical metaxenia also manifested itself in other combinations. In particular, the appearance of narcotine (0.1-1.1 mg/100 g) in the narcotine-free cultivars 'Kheops', 'A1' and 'Przemko' can be explained biochemically. If the narcotine-type plants 'Kék Gemona' (accumulating 11.3 mg/g narcotine) were used for pollination, the developing seed tissue, which contains the gene pool of narcotine biosynthesis, might contribute to the suppression of the activity of 1, 2-dehydroreticuline reductase, which leads to the accumulation of narcotine at the cost of morphinanes.",Alkaloid biosynthesis; Codeine; Metaxenia; Morphine; Narcotine; Papaver somniferum; Poppy; Thebaine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038819412

In species where foundresses cannot re-emerge from figs (meaning that all reproduction takes place in a single fig), they might therefore be expected to defend sites from competitors. For the first time, we explicitly documented defence by foundresses. Larger Platyscapa awekei foundresses (pollinators of Ficus salicifolia) in two-foundress figs prevented smaller foundresses from ovipositing by holding them in their mandibles while ovipositing themselves, and deposited the same number of eggs as when ovipositing in isolation. Smaller foundresses deposited around 30% fewer eggs. The onset of defence in two-foundress figs depended on larger foundress body size, implying that they made decisions based on their own size relative to the population mean (i.e. the average probability of being successful). Defence was less common in three- than in two-foundress figs, probably because the presence of a third competitor reduced the benefits accrued. We discuss why foundresses use such tactics, and identify other species in which defence may occur.

The inherent conflict of interest between mutualists suggests that partners should reduce the cost of the interaction whenever possible. As a result, defense mechanisms may evolve to prevent overexploitation by both partners. Selection for the evolution of defenses intrinsic to the interaction may be unnecessary, however, under particular ecological conditions. I examined the interaction between the pollinating yucca moth Tegeticula cassandra and its host plant Yucca filamentosa to determine whether extrinsic factors are important in promoting stability in this mutualism. Yuccas can selectively abscise fruit with high egg loads for moth species that damage ovules during oviposition into the locule. Female T. cassandra, however, lay eggs less than a millimeter beneath the tissue surface and fail to damage ovules, circumventing this mechanism of selective abscission. Consequently, yuccas are unable to regulate egg loads by T. cassandra, and moths are free to lay many eggs. Despite this, only 5-11% of T. cassandra eggs survive to exit the fruit as mature larvae. I tested the hypothesis that T. cassandra survivorship is regulated by the extrinsic factors dehydration and predation. While exclusion of potential predators seemed to have no effect on survivorship, moth eggs in flowers with experimentally increased vapor pressure had significantly greater survivorship compared to controls. Survivorship of a closely related locule-ovipositing species was unaffected by either predator exclusion or changes in vapor pressure. The results suggest that the stability of mutualisms can depend at least in part on extrinsic factors.",Exploitation; Obligate mutualism; Plant-insect interactions; Pollination; Prodoxidae; Regulatory mechanisms; Sanctions; Selective abscission; Stability; Survivorship; Tegeticula; Yucca-yucca moth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1342288325

Genetic differentiation among geographically distant populations of the same species was lower than differentiation among sympatric populations of different species. However, the strength of genetic differentiation among species was among the lowest reported for orchids.

In individual tests, we offered to the hummingbird a pollen donor flower and two emasculated recipient flowers in a controlled sequence. After each foraging bout, we counted the number of pollen grains transported from the donor flower to the stigmas of both recipient flowers. In agreement with Darwin's hypothesis, we found that hummingbirds transport pollen of ""pin"" flowers in significantly higher numbers to legitimate ""thrum"" stigmas, even if previously visiting a ""pin"" flower. However, ""thrum"" pollen was deposited in greater numbers on illegitimate ""thrum"" stigmas. We interpret this asymmetry largely as the consequence of floral morphology; pollen flow was greater between anthers and stigmas that exhibit greater spatial matching. In P. fendleri, the position of floral organs along the corolla tube does not always precisely correspond. In our experimental system, the probability that the pollinator extracts a pollen grain from the anther and the probability of self-pollination were both dependent on the type of floral morph. We discuss the relevance of the latter findings in relation to other studies of pollen flow in heterostylous species.",Floral morphology; Heterostyly; Hummingbirds; Reciprocal herkogamy; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038243093

Eriocaulon elichrysoides and S. caulescens have three nectariferous pistillodes located in the central portion of the receptacle. The pistillate flowers of E. elichrysoides present three simple styles while those of S. caulescens present three simple styles interspersed with three nectariferous appendices. Both the styles of E. elichrysoides and the nectariferous appendices of S. caulescens are vascularized by the dorsal vascular bundles of the carpels. The styles of S. caulescens lack vascularization. At the base of the gynoecium of E. elichrysoides there are six staminodes and there are three in the S. caulescens. Entomophily is suggested as the pollination syndrome in E. elichrysoides and S. caulescens as they present staminate and pistillate flowers with nectariferous structures. The ancestral character in Eriocaulon is probably given by the presence of the two staminal whorls. The staminate flowers of S. caulescens are probably derived from the reduction of a diplostemonous ancestral androecium. It remains open whether the pistillate flowers with nectariferous appendices present an ancestral character or a derived one.",Eriocaulaceae; Eriocaulon elichrysoides; Floral anatomy; Monocots; Pollination biology; Syngonanthus caulescens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038378779

This ecotone, found along headwater streams in boreal mixed-wood forests, supports four distinct vegetation zones: streambank, riparian, transition, and upland forest understory. The objective of this study was to identify specific trait patterns that may indicate functional responses to the changes in environmental factors such as nutrient availability and wind exposure that occur across the ecotone. The suites of plant species traits found in each zone were distinct, with a strong change in the prevalence of several traits. Wind and insect pollination, wind and vertebrate diaspore dispersal, and deciduous and evergreen leaves showed the greatest change in prevalence between the vegetation types. Some traits, including insect pollination and vertebrate diaspore dispersal, were strongly correlated within species. The consistent cooccurrence of pairs of traits in the same species suggests common responses by very different traits to the same environmental factor. This study demonstrates that an ecotone can be characterized not only as a discontinuity in species distributions or environmental factors, but also as a discontinuity in the trait spectrum. Examining ecotones from a trait perspective has strong potential for identifying the environmental factors and associated species functional responses that encourage the development of distinct vegetation boundaries.",Clonal growth form; Dispersal vector; Leaf longevity; Nitrogen fixation; Ontario; Pollination vector; Seed bank; Trait matrix,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1142281901

The levels in the fruit were considered safe for human consumption. Our work involved evaluation of the distribution of these elements in the leaves during the developmental stages of the fruiting season. Thirty-six leaf specimens of the Fard cultivar were collected 9, 15 and 20 weeks, respectively, after pollination and subjected to a standard digestion procedure. Sample masses of typically 1 g (dry weight) were prepared in 25 ml dilute acid solution and investigated for trace levels of Cr and As by ICP-AES. Eleven soil samples collected at random during the growth stages were subjected to a similar digestion procedure and analysis. According to the literature, the permissible mean levels of Cr and As in plants are 200 and 80 ng/g (dry weight), respectively. We used these values as our guideline to assess the ""risk"" levels in our samples of interest. In the case of Cr, about 45% of the specimens possessed levels between 250 and 700 ng/g, while a significant number produced levels between 1000 and 5000 ng/g. With regard to As, about 70% of the samples were above the documented permissible mean value. As a result of the unusually high Cr concentrations in some cases, the feasibility of Cr ""accumulation"" in the leaves was examined. Insects and other organisms subsist on the leaves and an added concern was the accumulation of these elements in the food chain.

The multilocus outcrossing rates (t m) estimated in 1995 and 1997 by using four polymorphic loci were 0.39 and 0.42, respectively, indicating that more than half of the seeds are produced by geitonogamous selfing. Manual pollination demonstrated that the follicle set per fruit (frequency of ripe carpels) and seed set per fruit from self-pollination were 2.6 and 3.8 times less than those from cross-pollination, respectively, and the frequency of aborted seeds from self-pollination was significantly higher than that from cross-pollination. There was no significant difference between self- and cross-pollination in the fruit set and the frequency of remnant ovules (ovules unfertilized or aborted before endosperm development). These results indicate that inbreeding depression is a primary factor reducing the seed set of self-pollinated fruits. The fruit set, follicle set per tree, and seed set per tree from natural pollination were significantly lower than those from the manual pollinations. From these results, we estimated that 91% of ovules in M. obovata were not fertilized owing to pollen shortage, and 65% of embryos failed to develop because of geitonogamous selfing. The high embryo mortality rate from geitonogamy in M. obovata can be regarded as a cost of this tree's pollination system, which is based on automimicry via asynchronous flowering.",Geitonogamy; Inbreeding depression; Magnolia; Outcrossing rate; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242659174

Schery (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae, Swartzieae) were studied to test if the species is wind pollinated (as is reported for its close relative Ateleia herbert-smithii Pittier), beetle pollinated, or possesses a mixed pollination syndrome. Studies of flower visitors suggest that at night, the species might be pollinated by beetles. Only one species of beetle (Phyllophaga sp., Scarabaeidae, Melolonthinae) was caught on all individuals observed. Floral scent, collected in situ with headspace methods from flowers of three individuals of C. mathewsii, mainly contained unsaturated fatty acid derivatives, including heptadecene, and oxygenated monoterpenes, such as linalool and its oxides, as well as minor amounts of benzenoid compounds and sesquiterpenes. The composition of the scent does not preclude beetles as one of the pollinators of C. mathewsii, but it does not point towards beetles as the sole pollinators.

Flowers of Kalmia latifolia (Ericaceae), mountain laurel, have a long duration and can remain viable up to 21 d if unpollinated. I experimentally tested whether this long duration increases pollination success by clipping stigmas to reduce functional floral longevity to 3-4 d. Clipping stigmas decreased fruit set from 65% to only 10%. Flowers with natural life spans were not pollination-limited, demonstrating that long floral duration ensured female reproductive success. The long floral duration of K. latifolia was unique in this site (the Great Swamp, Rhode Island, USA). Coflowering shrubs in summer had a mean floral life span of 3.4 d. Spring-flowering species had significantly longer mean floral durations (7.2 d). These duration differences may reflect seasonal variation in pollinator availability. However, K. latifolia flowers in summer, when its bumble bee pollinators are abundant but it is a poor competitor for bees because its flowers produce little nectar. The long floral duration allows K. latifolia to outlast coflowering competitors and attract sufficient pollinators. I hypothesize that the long floral duration of K. latifolia functions as a mechanism for competitive avoidance and reproductive assurance.","Competition for pollinators; Competitive avoidance; Ericaceae; Floral longevity; Flowering phenology; Fruit set; Great Swamp, Rhode Island; Induced floral senescence; Kalmia latifolia; Pollination limitation; Reproductive assurance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346936287

A comprehensive program for the selection of female cultivars was conducted in Israel for many years. However, selection for male cultivars as pollen sources has largely been neglected. The current use of male seedlings with their large variation in bloom period, amount of pollen produced, and pollen viability, could result in insufficient pollination and reduced yields. The study was conducted at Hazerim plantation, Israel (northern Negev desert), on 8-9-year-old male jojoba plants. Pollen production was investigated 24 and 48 h after removal from the plants. Pollen viability was tested both in vitro and in vivo. Pollen production, in percent pollen from inflorescence fresh weight, was the highest during peak male bloom. The greatest amount of pollen having the best germinability was collected 24 h after the inflorescences were removed from the plants. In vitro germinability of jojoba pollen was affected by pollen source, and by sucrose concentration of the germination solution. Jojoba pollen from all pollen sources germinated intensively on the stigmas of the female flowers, but the percentage fruit set was different for various pollen donors.

Here we present a study on the influence of the surrounding matrix on pollinating flower visitors of the knapweed Centaurea jacea in a small-scale agricultural landscape (Central Hesse, Germany). The study was carried out in late summer 1998 by monitoring visits of 24 insect taxa at 15 C. jacea patches. The following matrix types were studied: (i) arable land only, (ii) arable land close to grassland (<50 m), (iii) a mosaic of arable land, grassland and forests, and (iv) grassland only. More than half of the flower visitors were bees, with honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees being the dominant taxa. The matrix type did not affect either the mean frequency of total flower visits or the mean richness of all taxa. The same applied to different size classes. Significant matrix effects were confined to five large taxa of the Apoidea: Bombus lapidarius, B. pascuorum, the B. terrestris group, large wild bees (other than bumblebees) and A. mellifera. A. mellifera significantly preferred patches surrounded by grassland, while large wild bees preferred patches surrounded by a mosaic of arable land, grassland and forests. The flower visiting frequency of all three bumblebee species was high in patches surrounded by grassland, but only the B. terrestris group showed a clear-cut preference for this matrix type. It is concluded that matrix effects on flower visitors of C. jacea are taxon- and body size-specific. Strong matrix effects on large pollinators suggest that these taxa are able to discriminate between patches. Considering the ecological services provided by pollinators, the preservation of large areas covered by interconnected grassland sites as well as by a mosaic of different land use forms should have high priority in future management strategies. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Pollen competition can in turn, affect seed production, fruit set, and progeny vigor, with important ecological and evolutionary consequences. In this investigation, we determined the potential for pollen competition in four adjacent natural populations of Clarkia unguiculata during three growing seasons. We collected stigmas and styles after 6, 24, and 48 h of exposure to pollinators and determined pollen load sizes, the number of pollen tubes reaching the upper and lower portions of the style, and pollen tube attrition rates. We also collected mature seeds to determine the effect of pollen load size on seed set, seed germination, and seedling vigor. Pollen load sizes increased with increasing length of exposure to pollinators and varied from year to year and from population to population. In most plants, pollen loads were large enough to result in pollen competition on the stigma. The number of pollen tubes reaching the upper and lower portions of the style was affected by pollen load sizes. Pollen tube attrition rates in the style were moderate and were not affected by pollen load sizes. However, as pollen tubes completed growth in the style, the opportunity for pollen competition decreased as the number of pollen tubes became smaller than the number of ovules in the ovary. Seed production in this experiment was dependent on pollen load sizes, even though the number of seeds produced was well below the number typically recorded for this species.

We investigated the relationships between pollinator availability and mating systems of these species along three snowmelt gradients. Relative abundance of flowers and nectar standing crop of P. caerulea decreased from early to late snowmelt plots. Bumble bees preferred P. caerulea to P. aleutica in early and middle snowmelt plots, while their preference shifted to P. aleutica in late snowmelt plots. Pollen limitation was severe in P. aleutica in early to middle snowmelt plots but it was severe in P. caerulea in late snowmelt plots. Seed-set success under natural conditions of P. aleutica was higher than that of P. caerulea in all plots.

The plant's dilemma hypothesis proposes that evolution of larger inflorescences is driven by selection for greater pollinator attraction, but constrained by higher rates of geitonogamy experienced by larger inflorescences. Here we investigate the role of geitonogamy on fruit set in natural populations of Asclepias speciosa. We compared fruit set from three pollination treatments: (1) inflorescences bagged before and after receiving 6 hand outcross pollinia (Bag), (2) inflorescences unbagged and receiving 6 hand outcross pollinia (Open), and (3) naturally pollinated inflorescences (Control). The Bag and Open treatments initiated significantly more fruits than the Control. Bag aborted significantly fewer fruits than Open or Control. Fruit set was significantly higher in Bag than Open, and Open had significantly higher fruit set than Control. From these results, we conclude that (1) high rates of geitonogamy significantly increase fruit abortion and reduce fruit set in natural populations of A. speciosa and (2) natural populations are compatible pollen limited.

Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (YTT) provides an opportunity to examine the expression of genes along the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in response to known environmental triggers during ontogeny. We have cloned and sequenced gene fragments from three anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, chalcone synthase (CHS), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS). Using quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we have determined that CHS and DFR are highly expressed in Stage I white YTT flowers and undergo only moderate increases in expression (25 and 56%, respectively) during the transition to Stage II lavender and Stage III purple flowers. In contrast, ANS is expressed at low levels in Stage I flowers and undergoes a dramatic increase (302%) in expression over ontogeny. Interestingly, expression of all three genes is significantly lower in the absence of two environmental triggers, pollination and light, both of which are necessary for floral color change in V. cornuta. Our results demonstrate the presence of at least two regulated steps in V. cornuta anthocyanin biosynthesis: an early step influenced by pollination and light induces expression of earlier genes (CHS and DFR) in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, and is necessary but insufficient for floral color change, followed by a second step that affects floral color change by inducing expression of later genes (ANS). We have thus identified important environmental cues and developed molecular tools that establish V. cornuta as a new model system for the study of the regulation of natural floral color change. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Anthocyanin biosynthesis; Floral color change; Light; Pollination; Viola,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344065695

Fig wasps constituted the majority of captures above the canopy (pollinators 47%, non-pollinators 5%). However, genera were not evenly represented. There were 50% more species of monoecious fig pollinator than there were host species in the fragment, indicating some must have arrived from forests with different assemblages of figs at least 30 km away. Dioecious fig pollinators were poorly represented suggesting more limited dispersal, which could account for higher endemism and vulnerability to catastrophic disturbance in these figs.

Cerastium alpinum has large showy flowers, while C. cerastoides has smaller and paler flowers. The temporal separation of pollen release and stigma receptivity within a flower (dichogamy) was smallest in C. cerastoides, which was also more highly self-compatible. No pollen limitation on seed set occurred in any species, possibly due to their high selfing ability. Despite a substantially higher pollinator visitation to C. alpinum compared to C. cerastoides, the latter had the higher seed set. Pollen limitation, autogamy, and pollinator visitation did not differ between altitudes for either species. Differences in habitat and flower size, color, and development between the species are consistent with their different selfing ability.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141814655

Most studies that make predictions about optimal pollen presentation assume conditions are constant throughout the flowering season. However, data presented here show that pollen presentation schedules vary seasonally: in early season flowers, anthers dehisce over a number of days, while late season flowers present all anthers simultaneously. I show that pollinator visitation rates to individual plants are higher but more variable early in the season than late in the season. Furthermore, per-male availability of female-phase flowers increases over the course of the flowering season in this population.

Flowers are nocturnal, pollinated mainly by sphingids and self-incompatible. Polymorphism for allozymes (11 loci) was relatively high (P=75%) but moderate levels of heterozygosity were detected (Ho = 0.103 and He = 0.261). Sonoran populations exhibited higher levels of genetic variation than peninsular populations. He declined with latitude when just peninsular and two island populations are included. Substantial levels of inbreeding within populations (f=0.60), moderate differentiation among populations (?=0.10), and no evidence of isolation by distance were detected. The neighbor-joining phenogram showed Sonoran and island populations nested within peninsular populations. Mainland populations showed greater genetic similarity to island populations, supporting a dispersal hypothesis for the origin of the disjunction.

Finally, we bagged, emasculated, and supplementary cross-pollinated flowers to determine the pollination strategy and whether reproduction was limited by pollen availability. Flowers in both populations were highly dependent on pollinator visitation for maximum seed set. In one population pollinators primarily cross-pollinated flowers, whereas in the other the pollinators facilitated self-pollination. The staminodes caused increased pollinator visitation rate and duration to flowers in both populations. The staminodes increased female reproductive success, but only when pollen availability constrained female reproduction.

These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.",Biodiversity; Coevolution; Ecological networks; Food web structure; Pollination; Seed-dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037266152

In populations of two rare cactus species (Peniocereus greggii and Peniocereus striatus), individual plants bloom synchronously on less than five nights per year and are self-incompatible. In contrast, the abundant Datura discolor and Datura wrightii bloom nearly continuously from spring to autumn and are self-compatible. Flowers of all species studied are visited by hawk moths at dusk and by honeybees and native bees the following morning. Hawk moths have the appropriate behavior and body dimensions to pollinate Peniocereus effectively, but visits are rare. Nonnative honeybees also visit P. greggii and may contribute incrementally to fruit set. Peniocereus and Datura flowers are highly reflective at all wavelengths above 400 nm but lack UV reflectance or contrast. All species studied secrete 10-80 ?L of sucrose-rich nectar within flared corollas so deep that moths must land within them, ensuring pollen carriage. These flowers provide rich energetic resources for hawk moths because the caloric content of a single flower would support from 3 to 20 min of hovering flight. Floral scents were more species specific than visual cues because D. discolor and D. wrightii emit complex blends of terpenoid, benzenoid, aliphatic, and nitrogenous scent compounds, whereas flowers of P. greggii produce only eight benzenoid compounds (all of which are present in Datura species) and Peniocereus striatus is scentless.

The study of pollination biology of obligate outcrossers with wide altitudinal range may provide clues on how plants can remain reproductively successful in increasingly hostile environments without resorting to selfing. I studied the phenology, pollinator assemblages, breeding system and maternal success of the perennial entomophile outcrosser, Discaria nana, across a 1200-m elevation span in the Andes of Mendoza and Neuquén, Argentina (34°-37°S). D. nana behaved as self-incompatible throughout the studied gradient. At the higher site proportionally fewer flowers were pollinated, stigmatic loads were smaller and number of visitor species was lower than at low altitude; however, natural fruit set was 3.6 times higher and seed set 3.3 times higher. As a non-exclusive explanation, it is proposed that increased maternal success reflected better pollination quality at the higher site, to which several factors seemed to contribute. At higher altitude D. nana a) exhibited mutualisms with a high proportion of the available pollen vectors, b) had a higher rate of specialized pollinators (Lepidoptera, obligate nectar feeders) to unspecialized ones (Diptera, pollen and mixed feeders) in the visitor assemblage which would reduce ineffective (i.e. self) pollination because nectar feeders visited both male and female phase flowers and pollen feeders favoured male phase flowers, c) had an extended floral longevity (especially the female phase), and d) showed an increased floral display (as number of flowers per unit plant area). Differential rewarding through more concentrated nectar may explain the change in assemblage composition. The flowers' reverse herkogamy (i.e. the location of the stigma below the anthers) seemed to enhance the beneficial effects of the abundance of more effective pollinators.",Discaria; High-altitude pollination; Rhamnaceae; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037262288

In the Asteraceae, differences are mainly found between peripheral non-dispersal and central dispersal achenes (single-seeded fruits). Inbreeding depression is considered as an evolutionary force as it may reduce several fitness traits, and in the case of heterocarpic plants, it could influence fitness traits (e.g., seed set, germination rate, growth rate) of each fruit morph, which may have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. In particular, differential effects on fitness traits and dispersal of selfed and outcrossed progeny can strongly determine the viability of extant populations and the potential to colonize new habitats. We conducted a hand-pollination experiment in greenhouse conditions to test whether inbreeding affects the fitness of achene morphs in the heterocarpic herb Leontodon autumnalis (Asteraceae). Results show that achene morphs significantly differ in their ecological behavior, peripheral achenes germinating more and faster than central achenes. The significant interaction between pollination treatment and achene morph for germination probability might indicate a link between dormancy and mating system in L. autumnalis: germination was higher for outcrossed achenes in central achenes whereas the opposite pattern was exhibited by peripheral achenes. Selfing dramatically reduced seed set, probably as a consequence of strong self-incompatibility mechanisms rather than inbreeding effects. Inbreeding depression significantly affected late life-cycle traits, such as growth rate and biomass at flowering.

Box 3000, Lethbridge, T1J 4B1, Canada","Verticillium wilt caused by Verticillium albo-atrum is an important disease of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in Europe, North America, and northern Japan. The pathogen can spread by various means, including on infected alfalfa seeds and debris, through contact between roots, on farm implements, and through air and water. Recent studies in Canada reveal that V. albo-atrum can also be spread by insect pests, predators, and pollinators, as well as alfalfa pollen. Certain insects, such as the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica), migratory grasshopper (Melanoplus sanguinipes), two-striped grasshopper (Melanoplus bivittatus), and alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) can serve as vectors for effective transmission of the pathogen. Therefore, management of insect vectors should be a part of the strategy for control of this disease. Breeding for disease resistance is thus far the most effective means for control of verticillium wilt of alfalfa. Aspects of breeding efforts for development and commercialization of new alfalfa cultivars in regions of high risk in Canada and approaches to control insect vectors are discussed. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Alfalfa; Disease control; Epidemiology; Insect vector; Medicago sativa; Resistance to disease; Verticillium albo-atrum; Verticillium wilt,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1542319990

In 1999 we tested common reed (Phragmites) stalks, plastic drinking straws, plastic thermoshrink electro-insulating tubing, packing paper and grooved wooden laminates (which were assembled to form blocks with cylindrical chambers inside); these nesting tubes were all 6 mm in diameter and 22 cm long. In 2000 we tested reed, wood, cork and wooden tubes lined with plastic sheet used for inkjet printers; all tubes were 7 mm in diameter and 18 cm long. We measured the percentage of each type of material actively provisioned by female O. rufa, the number of the brood cells and cocoons in the tubes, and the number of adults that emerged. All nest tubes made of reed and those made of printer sheeting inserted into openings in wooden blocks were occupied by O. rufa. The greatest mean number of brood cells was found in nests made of wood (8.3 in 1999 and 12.2 in 2000). The number of cocoons also was highest in wooden nests (5.8 in 1999 and 9.4 in 2000). Reed stalks (4.3 cocoons per nest in 1999 and 5.2 in 2000) and cork (4.7) had the second greatest numbers of cocoons per nest. The number of cocoons was low in paper and in all types of plastic tubes. The production of adult bees per occupied nest was greatest in wooden nests (5.3 in 1999 and 8.8 in 2000). Overall the average production of bees per nest tube offered was greatest in either wood or reed stems. Managing O. rufa was easiest in the disassembled nests made of wood. The design of these nests permitted easy removal of the cocoons and nest reuse for several breeding seasons. © 2003 International Bee Research Association.",Artificial nests; Osmia rufa; Pollinator management; Red mason bee; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-10344220604

Ovule culture was applied as a means to save a substantially larger amount of hybrid embryos from abortion. Though flower/seed capsule abortion eliminated many crosses in an early developmental stage, ovules of many crosses could be initiated in vitro on various time intervals after pollination. Germination was achieved on basal Rhododendron medium + 50 mg/l GA3. Green seedlings were obtained after Tsutsusi x Hymenanthes, Hymenanthes x Tsutsusi, Tsutsusi x Rhododendron, Rhododendron x Tsutsusi and Vireya x Tsutsusi pollination. Many seedlings have little growth vigour and next to green seedlings albino seedlings occur frequently, depending on the pollination type. The first true leaves of many assumed hybrids obviously lack chlorophyll.

The aim of this work is to characterize the development of stigma receptivity, from anthesis to stigma degeneration, in the pentacarpellar pear (Pyrus communis) flower. Stigma development and stigmatic receptivity were monitored over two consecutive years, as the capacity of the stigmas to offer support for pollen germination and pollen tube growth. In an experiment where hand pollinations were delayed for specified times after anthesis, three different stigmatic developmental stages could be observed: (1) immature stigmas, which allow pollen adhesion but not hydration; (2) receptive stigmas, which allow proper pollen hydration and germination; and (3) degenerated stigmas, in which pollen hydrates and germinates properly, but pollen tube growth is impaired soon after germination. This developmental characterization showed that stigmas in different developmental stages coexist within a flower and that the acquisition and cessation of stigmatic receptivity by each carpel occur in a sequential manner. In this way, while the duration of stigmatic receptivity for each carpel is rather short, the flower has an expanded receptive period. This asynchronous period of receptivity for the different stigmas of a single flower is discussed as a strategy that could serve to maximize pollination resources under unreliable pollination conditions.",Pollen germination; Pyrus communis; Rosaceae; Stigma; Stigmatic receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037555416

We crossed 11 individuals that differed in their strength of SI to generate families with four levels of inbreeding (f = 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75). Progeny were scored for three traits related to male fitness and for outcrossed and selfed seed production. Analyses of variance revealed significant inbreeding depression for the three male traits and seed set. Families with strong or weak SI differed in their response to inbreeding. Families with weak SI had lower levels of inbreeding depression for most traits than families with strong SI, but strong SI families had a greater increase in selfed seed set, but not self-fertility, with inbreeding. Finally, we found evidence of a significant linear response to inbreeding for all three male reproductive traits and outcrossed seed, indicating that inbreeding depression was primarily caused by partially or fully recessive deleterious alleles.

Variation in egg density and larval performance were measured for three plant genotypes: a preferred, susceptible wheat; a less preferred, susceptible wheat; a less preferred wheat defended against larval feeding. Oviposition peaked 10-11 d after emergence of the inflorescences and then declined sharply on all three wheat genotypes, although the inflorescences of the genotypes developed at different rates. On the preferred, susceptible wheat, larval performance was high for oviposition that occurred until pollination and low later. On a less preferred wheat, larval performance was high when eggs were laid before or after pollination. On a defended wheat, larval performance was always low. Oviposition preference was associated with larval performance that varied with plant developmental stage, but imperfectly, possibly because females do not detect cues for seed development. Females deposited eggs further from larval feeding sites when ovipositing on less preferred wheats, regardless of whether larval performance on the wheat was high or low. A low preference in combination with a shift in oviposition site supports the hypothesis that some wheats have evolved a defense that deters oviposition. This defense against oviposition is independent of a defense that reduces larval performance, which causes an apparent failure in the expected preference-performance relationship.",Antibiosis; Herbivory; Plant defense; Preference; Resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037396912

The strawberry is an aggregate fruit originating from the receptacle of the flower. The true fruits, the achenes form from the carpels present on the surface of the receptacle. Fruit growth and shape are largely determined by the number and position of achenes on the receptacle; an uneven distribution or an insufficient number of fertilized ovaries will result in small, misshapen fruit. A number of factors contribute to the formation of misshapes, but most important seem to be genotype, flower position within the inflorescence and stamen and carpel viability.

This work analyses the intra- and interannual variations within the period 1993-2000, when a volumetric Hirst spore-trap (LANZONI VPPS 2000) was in continuous operation. Statistically significant differences between periods 1996/97 (with a few rainy days), 1998/99, and all the others were observed. The relationships between atmosphere pollen content and the most important meteorological parameters within the same period were studied by means of correlation analysis. Temperature was the most important factor explaining the presence of Alnus pollen in the air. A Scheffe's test was carried out before the correlation analysis to establish years corresponding to the same statistical population. The results obtained from both tests were used for a regression analysis to establish the prediction patterns for this taxon. Even when a negative correlation coefficient was presented, the influence of this parameter did not decline. Previous temperatures in the main pollination period, however, were a determinant factor predicting the onset and intensity of Alnus flowering.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037829290

In this sense, it is important to recognise that patterns and processes may take place at different scales at the same time, and that the scales of a study must be chosen in accordance with the objectives pursued. Apart from conventional approaches to genetic structure, spatial autocorrelation and related techniques, such as Mantel test, correlograms, Mantel correlograms, join-counts, variograms and point pattern analysis, can detect and characterise the existence of spatial genetic structures and lead the way to discussing the environmental and biological factors responsible for them. An alternative way of including spatial variability in modelling approaches that deal with genetic patterns or processes is through the use of constrained ordinations. Although scarcely used at present, these methodologies have great applicability in conservation biology and can lead a way to an effective integration of genetic, demographic and ecological perspectives. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The S-locus, comprising the determinants of pistil and pollen specificity, typically shows extremely high polymorphism, with dozens to hundreds of specificities maintained within species. This article explores a conjecture, motivated by empirical findings, that the expression of recessive deleterious factors at sites closely linked to the S-locus may cause greater declines in the viability of zygotes constituted from more closely related S-alleles. Diffusion approximation models incorporating variation in viability among S-locus genotypes and antagonistic interactions between a new specificity and its immediate parent specificity are constructed and analyzed. Results indicate that variation in viability tends to reduce the number of specificities maintained in a population at stochastic steady state, and that genealogy-based antagonism reduces the rate of bifurcation of S-allele lineages. These effects may account for some of the unusual features observed in empirical studies of S-allele genealogies. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

As is commonly found in gynodioecious species, flowers on female plants are smaller than those on hermaphrodites for a number of floral traits. Floral size dimorphism has often been hypothesized to be the result of either a reduction in female flower size that allows reallocation to greater fruit and seed production, or an increase in hermaphroditic flower size due to the increased importance of pollinator attraction and pollen export for hermaphroditic flowers. We provide a test of these two alternatives by measuring 11 floral characters in eight species of Lycium and using a phylogeny to reconstruct the floral size shifts associated with the evolution of gender dimorphism. Our analyses suggest that female flowers are reduced in size relative to the ancestral condition, whereas flowers on hermaphrodites have changed only slightly in size. Female and hermaphroditic flowers have also diverged both from one another and from ancestral cosexual species in several shape characteristics. We expected sexual dimorphism to be similar among the three dimorphic taxa, as gender dimorphism evolved only a single time in the ancestor of the American dimorphic lineage. While the floral sexual dimorphism is broadly similar among the three dimorphic species, there are some species-specific differences. For example, L. exsertum has the greatest floral size dimorphism, whereas L. fremontii had the greatest size-independent dimorphism in pistil characters. To determine the degree to which phylogenetic uncertainty affected reconstruction of ancestral character states, we performed a sensitivity analysis by reconstructing ancestral character states on alternative topologies. We argue that investigations such as this one, that examine floral evolution from an explicitly phylogenetic perspective, provide new insights into the study of the evolution of floral sexual dimorphism.",Floral evolution; Gynodioecy; Lycium; Male-sterility; Phylogeny; Sensitivity analysis; Sexual dimorphism; Solanaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037286140

Obtaining good sowing material requires extensive knowledge and rich experience on the part of the seed producers. The rules regarding the production of sowing material for industrial hemp are regulated by the relevant act of Polish Parliament. The farmers and the organizations involved in seed processing, storage and state control should obey those rules. First of all attention should be paid to genetic stability, the presence of male plants in seed plantations and the obligation to remove them. Furthermore the appropriate distance between seed plantations should be observed, considering the allogamy (wind pollination) of this species. The state services conduct relevant control during the vegetation period and carry out laboratory assessment of seed. The positive results of tests provide producers with a qualification certificate, which is the base for the further distribution of the sowing material. The disqualified seed, i.e., having low germination power, low weight of 1,000 seeds or high moisture can be used for technical pur-poses in the industry, e.g., for the production of oil for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications.

RNA blot analysis and in situ localization showed that CvADH1 was preferentially expressed in the nucellar tissue. The CvADH1 protein shared about 50% homology with short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase including ABA2 in Arabidopsis thaliana, stem secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase in Forsythia intermedia, and 3?-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase in Digitalis lanata. We investigated gene-expression levels in seeds from both normally pollinated fruits and those made parthenocarpic via N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N?-phenylurea treatment, the latter of which lack zygotic tissues. Whereas the transcripts of CvADH1 rapidly started to accumulate from about the pre-heart stage in normal seeds, they were not detectable in the parthenocarpic seeds. Treating the parthenogenic fruit with GA3 strongly induced gene expression, up to the level accumulated in pollinated seeds. These results suggest that the CvADH1 gene is induced in maternal tissues by signals made in the zygotic tissues, and that gibberellin might be one of those signals. We also observed that CvADH1 expression was induced by sucrose in the parthenocarpic seeds. Therefore, we propose that the CvADH1 gene is inducible by gibberellin, and that sucrose plays an important role in the maternal tissues of watermelon during early seed development.",Developing seed; Gibberellin; Parthenocarpic fruit; Seed preferential; Sucrose-watermelon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037270479

An artificial increase of mixoploidy in cell population of meristems (colchicine treatment) led to the increase of the apozygotic seed setting in the plants characterized by low mixoploidy level (hybrid ms 704-8 x 741-1-21). Second uniparental reproduction increased seed setting (five times higher than in control plants). In this case the seed setting was approximated to the normal level of seed productivity by random (open) pollination. The plants characterized by increased mixoploidy level without any treatment (line SOAN-31) demonstrated a high apozygotic seed setting. An artificial increase of mixoploidy level did not lead to the rise of apozygotic seed setting.

(Theaceae), an insect- and bird-pollinated, broad-leaved evergreen tree, is widely distributed in Japan and the southern Korean peninsula. The species has a relatively even age distribution within populations, which may influence the spatial genetic structure of different age classes relative to species with typical L-shaped age distributions. To determine whether the internal spatial genetic structure found in seedlings and young individuals carries over into adults, we used allozyme loci, F-statistics, spatial autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I), and coancestry measures to examine changes in genetic structure among seven age classes in a population (60-m × 100-m area) in southern Korea. In seedlings, weak but significam positive values of Moran's I-statistics and coancestry measures were found for distances less than 14 m, which is consistent with a mechanism of limited seed dispersal combined with overlapping seed shadows. This spatial structure, however, dissipates in older age classes, and in adults genetic variation has an essentially random spatial distribution. Morisita's index of dispersion of individuals in each age class showed that seedlings and juveniles are more highly clustered than are older individuals. These results suggest that self-thinning changes the spatial relationships of individuals, and thus genotypes. A multilocus estimate of FST (0.008) shows a small but statistically significant difference in allele frequencies among age classes. In summary, intrapopulation genetic structure within and among age classes of C. japonica was significant but weak. Despite presumably limited seed dispersal, weak spatial genetic structure in juveniles suggests overlapping seed shadows followed by self-thinning during recruitment. The present study also demonstrates that studies of spatial genetic structure focusing on limited numbers of generations may not be sufficient to reveal the entire picture of genetic structure in populations with overlapping generations.",Allozymes; Camellia japonica; Spatial and temporal genetic structure; Spatial autocorrelation; Theaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242684498

Females are at an inherent disadvantage because they can transmit their genes only through ovule production. One mechanism by which females can compensate for the loss of male function is by producing more seeds than hermaphrodites. As such, females should: (1) increase resource uptake to support higher seed production; and (2) allocate resources saved by the loss of male function to seed production. To test this hypothesis, we measured physiological and floral traits of gynodioecious Lobelia siphilitica, controlling for both environmental and genetic variation through a comparison of greenhouse-grown siblings. Pre-reproductive females had 14% higher area-based (Z=2.14; P=0.04) and 32% higher mass-based (Z=1.96; P=0.05) photosynthetic rate than hermaphrodites, suggesting that they have increased carbon acquisition by altering photosynthetic physiology. Female L. siphilitica produced flowers with 4-8% smaller corollas than hermaphrodites (all P<0.05), suggesting that females allocate resources away from floral structures used for pollinator attraction. The genetic correlation between genders for four floral and four physiological traits was significantly less than one but greater than zero, indicating that the evolution of gender dimorphism in response to sex-differential selection will be constrained. The allocation of resources saved by the loss of male function has been viewed as the most important mechanism allowing females of gynodioecious species to support higher seed production. Our data suggest that increased resource acquisition by females at pre-reproductive stages can also contribute to the maintenance of gender dimorphism in gynodioecious species.",Flower size; Photosynthesis; Plant gender; Plant mating systems; Resource allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038581844

Adjacent interseminal scales interdigitate and form a continuous tissue. Seeds are erect and more or less round in cross sections at all levels, and a cupule is not produced. The sarcotesta consists of multicellular peglike projections. The nucellus is attached to the integument only at the chalaza and is vascularized by a shallow cup of tracheids. Apically, the nucellus narrows to a solid finger-like projection that fits tightly into the base of the micropylar canal. A pollen chamber is not produced.

Basal area of live trees, shade, and leaf litter coverage and depth were highest in controls and lowest in salvaged gaps. Coarse woody debris (CWD) cover was greater in intact gaps than in salvaged gaps or controls, but decay was more advanced and CWD had less bark in controls than gaps.

We refer to the time point at which pollen tubes enter the accelerated phase of growth as the pollen growth transition (PGT). Here, we present evidence that pre-PGT and post-PGT growth are quantitatively and qualitatively different, and that the PGT is triggered when pollen tubes reach the transition zone (TZ) below the stigma. The capacity of various pistil zones to precipitate the PGT was tested through 'stump' pollinations: varying lengths of the pistil apex were excised, the cut surface of the remaining pistil (the stump) coated with stigmatic exudates then dusted with compatible pollen. Pollen applied to TZ tissues entered the PGT earlier than pollen growing in intact control pistils; the PGT was delayed in stylar stumps, largely because of delayed germination and reduced pre-PGT growth. In immature pistils, the PGT was delayed by several hours relative to its onset in mature pistils. The PGT fails to occur in pollen cultured in vitro. Collectively, the data suggest that pollen tubes become competent to enter the PGT when they reach a critical size, but the physicochemical environment of the transmitting tissue is necessary for triggering the cellular changes that result in accelerated growth. An analysis of the distribution of pollen tube tips before and after the PGT suggests that pollen competition is most intense during the pre-PGT phase.",Pistil; Pollen; Pollen competition; Pollen growth transition; Self incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037266943

This study examines the potential cost of inbreeding and the extent to which inbreeding depression can vary temporally and in populations of different size and genetic structure. Flowers were pollinated by hand in one large population and one small population over three seasons. Seed set, seed mass, and seed viability were compared among self-, outcross-, and open-pollinated fruits. Seed set was greater than 50% in both populations for all years of study. High levels of inbreeding depression were detected in seed viability but not in seed mass in both populations. However, the magnitude of inbreeding depression differed over years and between populations, a pattern that reflects differing environmental conditions and variable evolutionary and demographic histories.

In the early 1980s, we established a western white pine spacing trial in the southern Cascades of Washington, using seedlings from a seedlot comprised primarily of open-pollinated seed from trees screened and certified as resistant to white pine blister rust. Initial square spacings ranged from 2 to 6 m; treatment plots were 0.4 ha in size and were replicated three times (six times for the 3 m spacing). Permanent measurement plots were installed at age 8, and the lower portion of all stems was pruned in the loth growing season to reduce blister rust infections. The plots were remeasured at ages 11 and 16. Sixteen years after planting, survival averaged 80%; most mortality was associated with blister rust, but the rate of new infections and mortality diminished substantially between ages 11 and 16; 71% of the planted trees were free of blister rust at age 16. Trees averaged 8.4 m tall (ranging from 7.6 m in the 2 m spacing to 8.8 m in the 4 and 5 m spacings) and 12.7 cm dbh (10.3 in the 2 m spacing to 14.0 cm in the 5 m spacing). Periodic annual growth from 11 to 16 yr in the three wider spacings averaged 0.7 m in height and 1.0 cm in diameter. Antler rubbing by elk caused substantial damage to stems, but wounds on most trees were overgrown in 2 to 4 yr. Rub damage did not appear directly related to spacing but rather to stem diameter, with damage limited primarily to stems >6 and <15 cm. Early growth rates in this trial were much greater than those attained in older, natural stands (as inferred from site index curves and yield tables) and in progeny tests and other young silvicultural trials planted elsewhere. We believe rust-resistant stock of western white pine merits greater consideration for planting in the Douglas-fir region.",Animal damage; Cronartium ribicola; Pinus monticola; Pruning; Rust resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037239311

Five dihaploids, derived from crosses between S. tuberosum cv. Pentland Crown and two different S. phureja pollinators (IVP48 and EC90) were investigated by use of 17 AFLP primer pairs. Also 30 dihaploids, derived from pollination of five different S. tuberosum seed parents with S. phureja IVP101, were investigated for the presence of S. phureja-specific markers. In total approximately 680 and 850 AFLP products were detected in the diploid S. phureja clones and in the tetraploid S. tuberosum genotypes, respectively. A total of 68 S. phureja IVP48-specific markers were detected, while the total number of S. phureja IVP101-specific markers was in the range of 72-96, depending on the S. tuberosum seed parent. Introgression of DNA in the S. tuberosum cv.

The mean of 10 seed samples of F1was 83% oleic acid content. High oleic trait was mainly dominant. Two crosses showed intermediate inheritance with the means of 62% and 68%. The range of single-seed variability of these two crosses was from 53% to 89% oleic acid. The genotypes showing abnormal segregation in F1have been selected to develop a set of normal lines with a suppressor for Ol mutation. The inheritance of mid- (increased) oleic content (about 62%) was studied in the F1, F2and BC generations of the inbred line LG27 crossed with the high oleic line HA89 OL. Mid-oleic acid content was shown to be controlled by a recessive allele of ol gene, designated ol1. An inbred line with 92% oleic content was obtained to investigate a super high oleic genotype. Another high oleic line was selected for low stearic content, about 1%. High palmitic (about 24%) line is being developed.

(Scrophulariaceae). Mantel tests found no significant linear correlations between geographic and genetic data. However, redundancy analysis (RDA) models developed using the spatial data as the constraining matrix were highly significant, and spatial data explained 13.6% and 11.1% of total genetic variation in Bolarque and Entrepeñas, respectively. Moran's I correlograms and Mantel correlograms revealed a positive autocorrelation in the first distance class (15 m), which suggests a patchy distribution of genetic diversity. This distribution is consistent with the genetic vicinities that are expected from the territorial behavior of main pollinator Rhodanthidium sticticum (Megachilidae), the predominant short-distance seed dispersal, and the patchy spatial distribution of available safe sites. The gradient pattern obtained in Entrepeñas was consistent with standard isolation-by-distance models. However, a differential sinusoidal pattern was obtained in Bolarque, which would indicate a more frequent gene flow between patches and might be due to lower plant density there. The spatial genetic structure coexists with a strict self- incompatibility system in the species. Simplified RDA models obtained using a stepwise forward selection comprised the easting component in Entrepenas and the easting and northing components in Bolarque. Similar results were obtained with directional correlograms. These differential patterns can be explained by the distinct spatial arrangement of the populations (linear and bidimensional in Entrepenas and Bolarque, respectively).",Antirrhinum microphyllum; Constrained ordination; Directional correlogram; Genetic vicinities; Mantel correlogram; Mantel test; Moran's I; RAPD; Scrophulariaceae; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345832065

These factors included gynoecial malformations that produced a non-ovulated pistil, early gynoecial necrosis (i.e., necrosis before any opportunities for pollination), and seed abortion. Female sterility gave rise to two classes of individuals: trees that were largely female-sterile but dispersed normal quantities of viable pollen, and trees that dispersed both normal pollen and substantial numbers of seeds.

However, during early fruit development, PsCP transcript were accumulated in both pericarp and seeds, preferentially in the nucellus, with a polar distribution at the chalazal region of the embryo sac, suggesting a role in seed development. PsCP transcript levels increased also when fruit set was induced in unpollinated ovaries by gibberellins, although the distribution was uniform. PsCP expression was also induced by auxins but not cytokinins, indicating a selective hormonal regulation of PsCP transcription. Localization of PsCP transcript after pollination parallel reported changes in gibberellin distribution, suggesting that PsCP transcription in developing fruits and seeds is induced by gibberellins.

Problematic is that field variables unrelated to the effects of pesticides on reproductive activities can mask results. In the current study, we specifically investigated the effects of selected pesticide sprays applied to stigmas, on subsequent pollen germination and tube growth. Using two model systems, apple and almond, sprays were applied to detached emasculated flowers under constant laboratory conditions using an electronically controlled robotic apparatus which simulated a field sprayer. Flowers were pollinated at specific times after spraying, and pollen tube numbers and growth assessed using fluorescence microscopy. The pesticides evaluated were for apple: captan, myclobutanil and streptomycin; and for almond: azoxystrobin, myclobutanil, iprodione and cyprodinil. In apple, captan significantly reduced pollen germination, by 20% compared with water controls when pollination was conducted 18 h after treatment. The number of tubes that reached the basal part of the style within 20 h was not affected. In contrast, myclobutanil and streptomycin had no significant effect on pollen tube growth. With almond, none of the sprays significantly affected pollen germination or tube growth.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347382747

There were no significant differences in expected heterozygosity among age classes. However, significant genetic differentiation among age classes was detected (P<0.0001). Fixation indices within age classes showed significant deficits of observed heterozygosity, which may be caused by partial selfing. The homogeneity of genetic structure among four age-classes may reflect similar spatial patterns of seed immigration from surrounding populations occurring year after year. Finally, the average Moran's I and coancestry estimates indicated essentially random spatial distributions of alleles for each of the four age-classes and between seedlings and 2-4 year juveniles vs adult trees. These findings are very similar to those observed in the same study area for another member of the Lauraceae, Neolitsea sericea, which has a very similar life history and ecological characteristics (ie, bird-dispersed fruits, insect pollination, and a similar age structure). Together, these results suggest that the fleshy drupes of lauraceous species represent an adaptation to aid in the independent dispersal of seed by birds, which in turn may increase the genetic diversity of founders colonizing new habitats.",Allozymes; Cinnamomum insularimontanum; Endozoochory; Lauraceae; Seed dispersal; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345505271

In its simplest form the inflorescence is a reduced short shoot, bearing a lateral ebracteate flower and a potentially viable apical bud. Variations in the basic structure can be in the number of flowers, the mix of the sexes of the flowers and the number and type of short shoots as primary, secondary and tertiary axes. A high incidence of structural plasticity of the inflorescence occurs. This can be either throughout the development of the inflorescence or only at the onset of the vegetative stage. These changes occur in the short shoot(s) constituting the axes of the inflorescence, causing either an increase in the length of the internodes, apical proliferation of the axes or a combination of these two effects. A specific combination of changes is linked to a specific inflorescence type. The vegetative elements of the inflorescence thus modified, are retained as an integral part of the vegetative branching system, with extensive influence on the branching pattern. This can also result in the predominance of one sex over the other over time, so that an individual, initially of the one sex, can become one of the opposite sex by the end of the season. Erroneous interpretation of a single point in the process of sex change as if it is a permanent state of sexuality, led to the prevalent acceptance of dioecy as the norm for the genus. Monoecy with dichogamy (or herkogamy at inflorescence level) was observed in this genus, as in many other wind-pollinated taxa.",Branching; Cliffortia L.; Dichogamy; Dioecy; Herkogamy; Inflorescence; Monoecy; Morphological plasticity; Sex change,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344496730

Our understanding of the selection pressures that may maintain these color polymorphisms has primarily been confined to one set of organisms - pollinators. Yet, selection on flower color may also be driven by other agents, such as herbivores, especially in cases where pollinators and herbivores are using the same or correlated traits to select plants. A wealth of studies have documented pollinator preference for anthocyanin-recessive color morphs (A-; yellow and white flowers) of wild radish, Raphanus sativus, over anthocyanin-dominant morphs (A+; pink and bronze flowers); yet, differences in pollination alone do not explain the maintenance of the flower color polymorphism. Here, we ask whether variation in flower color in R. sativus influences the preference and performance of herbivores for A- flower color morphs vs. A+ flower color morphs in four types of herbivores (generalist and specialist Lepidoptera, slugs, aphids, and thrips). We found that all herbivores except for aphids and thrips preferred flowering A- color morphs compared to A+ morphs of R. sativus. Furthermore, all herbivores except larvae of specialist and generalist Lepidoptera performed better on A- color morphs. Differences in plant secondary chemistry may play a role in differential herbivore preference and performance on the anthocyanin flower color morphs. Chemical analyses of leaf secondary compounds (indole glucosinolates) revealed that A+ color morphs produced higher concentrations of indole glucosinolates than A- morphs in the presence of herbivore damage. Therefore, herbivores may exhibit lower preference for A+ color morphs, and these morphs may support lower herbivore performance because they are heavily defended once damaged. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document differential preference and performance of herbivores for different flower color morphs. Previous studies have shown that increased herbivore damage can have profound negative direct and indirect effects on the reproduction of R. sativus. The data presented here suggest that differential preference and performance of herbivores for R. sativus color morphs may counter selection on flower color exerted by pollinators.","Anthocyanins; California, USA; Flower color polymorphism; Herbivory; Plant-insect interactions; Raphanus; Wild radish",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344585035

In a previous large-scale quantitative analysis of a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) diallel experiment, selfing had large deleterious effects on growth but no impact on stable carbon isotope discrimination (an indirect measure of the ratio of net photosynthesis (A) to stomatal conductance (gwv)). It was hypothesized that selfing has no effect on carbon (C) fixation at the leaf level but impairs subsequent utilization of C. Alternatively, A and gwv may be impacted by selfing to the same extent. However, no gas exchange data were collected to test these hypotheses. We have now obtained photosynthetic gas exchange data from three selfed families and three outcrossed families (all the result of controlled pollination) from the same diallel experiment. Photosynthetic responses to intercellular CO2 concentration (A-Ci curves) were generated on four replicates per family, one block per day, over a 4-day period in July. There were no differences between selfed and outcrossed families in maximum carboxylation rate, maximum electron transport, A or g wv (both estimated at 370 ppm CO2), or the ratio A/g wv. Because selfed trees had higher mortality than outcrossed trees during the experiment, we cannot exclude the possibility that previously living selfed progeny had low A. Nevertheless, the data indicate that inbreeding can result in trees that have low productivity despite high A, supporting our hypothesis that gas exchange is similar between selfed and outcrossed progeny trees.

Similarly, for fruit weight, no correlation was found between the ripening interval of cultivars used as pollen sources and fruit weight on females pollinated by those sources.

We identify three main functional categories: resource, genetic, and process linkers and suggest that the diversity within functional groups of mobile links is a central component of ecosystem resilience.

We argue that global environmental change can lead to (a) the decline of essential links in functional groups providing pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control; (b) the linking of previously disconnected areas, for example, the spread of vector-borne diseases and invasive species; and (c) the potential for existing links to become carriers of toxic substances, such as persistent organic compounds. We conclude that knowledge of interspatial exchange via mobile links needs to be incorporated into management and policy-making decisions in order to maintain ecosystem resilience and hence secure the capacity of ecosystems to supply the goods and services essential to society.",Biodiversity; Ecological memory; Ecosystem functioning; Ecosystem services; Functional groups; Global environmental change; Invasive species; Management; Mobile links; Resilience,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037218594

Three genotypes inbred to I2 differing concerning their in vitro response were self- and cross-pollinated to produce I3, F1 and F2 progenies. These progenies were tested in vitro by culturing unpollinated ovules on callus induction medium containing 9.05 ?M 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and 3.94 ?M 2iP (6-(?,?-dimethylallylamino)purine) for two passages of 8 weeks each, followed by a period of 8 weeks on hormone-free medium for differentiation of somatic embryos. Regarding the regeneration ability, uniformity was confirmed in the I3 and F1 generation indicating the homozygosity of the parental I2 plants. No differences between reciprocal cross combinations were found, so that maternal effects have been excluded. In the F2 progenies, derived from crosses between the regenerating genotypes 3051 and 3738, respectively, and the non-regenerating genotype RS8, the segregation of plants with and without regeneration of somatic embryos fit to a 15:1 ratio. Therefore, a genetic control of the regeneration ability by two dominant major genes with epistatic interaction was postulated. Regarding the regeneration rates, defined as the percentage of calluses with somatic embryos, and the regeneration intensity, as indicated by the number of somatic embryos per callus, a continuous variation between the plants with regeneration ability was noticed. These observations point to the fact that - apart from physiological and environmental influences - additional modifying genes might be involved.",Breeding; Cyclamen persicum; Genetic analysis; In vitro propagation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037279309

Water deficit significantly reduced growth, grain yield and yield components of the maize genotypes. Significant differences were observed among genotypes for all the traits measured. One hybrid, 9011-30, and two improved OPVs, STR-EV-IWD and IYFD-C0, that showed tolerance to water stress recorded higher grain yield, and accumulated and partitioned more assimilates to the grain than the drought-susceptible genotypes.

Partial congruence was found with previous analyses using morphology, including strong support for monophyly of the genus and for a sister group relationship between the clade D. anceps + D. pachyloma and the rest of the genus. A previously unplaced bird-pollinated species, D. epiphyllum, was well supported as sister to the only other bird-pollinated species in the genus, D. speciosa, indicating a single origin of bird pollination in their common ancestor. Other morphological groups within Daviesia were not supported and require reassessment. A strong and previously unreported sister clade of Daviesia consists of the two monotypic genera Erichsenia and Viminaria. These share phyllode-like leaves and indehiscent fruits. The evolutionary history of cord roots, which have anomalous secondary thickening, was explored using parsimony. Cord roots are limited to three separate clades but have a complex history involving a small number of gains (most likely 0-3) and losses (0-5). The anomalous structure of cord roots (adventitious vascular strands embedded in a parenchymatous matrix) may facilitate nutrient storage, and the roots may be contractile. Both functions may be related to a postfire resprouting adaptation. Alternatively, cord roots may be an adaptation to the low-nutrient lateritic soils of Western Australia. However, tests for association between root type, soil type, and growth habit were equivocal, depending on whether the variables were treated as phylogenetically dependent (insignificant) or independent (significant).",Bayesian inference; ITS sequences; Legumes; Maximum likelihood; Parsimony; Phylogenetically independent contrasts; Trait evolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042978423

In one such species, Dianthus sylvestris, we investigated mating system parameters using allozyme data. Outcrossing rates and correlations of outcrossed paternity were calculated for the three types of plants and separately for pistillate and perfect flowers on mixed plants. The mean outcrossing rate for the population was tm ± SD = 0.885 ± 0.032.

Although mapping locations of one major and several minor quantitative trait loci (QTL) were known previously, improving submergence tolerance in agronomically desirable types of rice has not been achieved. KDML105 is jasmine rice widely grown in rain-fed lowland regions of Thailand. This cultivar is very intolerant of submergence stress. To improve submergence tolerance in this cultivar, three submergence-tolerant cultivars, FR13A, IR67819F2-CA-61 and IR49830-7-1-2-2, were cross-pollinated with KDML105. Transferring the major QTL for submergence tolerance was facilitated by four back-crossings to the recipient KDML105. Molecular markers tightly linked to the gene(s) involved were developed to facilitate molecular genotyping. We demonstrated that individuals of a BC4F3 line that retained a critical region on chromosome 9 transferred from tolerant lines were also tolerant of complete submergence while retaining all the agronomically desirable traits of KDML105. In addition, effects of secondary QTLch2 were detected statistically in back-cross progenies. Effects of secondary QTLch7 were not statistically significant. The close association between tightly linked markers of the tolerance locus on chromosome 9 and submergence tolerance in the field demonstrates the considerable promise of using these markers in lowland rice breeding programmes for selecting increased submergence tolerance. © 2003 Annals of Botany Company.",Back-crossing; Graphical genotype; Marker-assisted selection; Plant breeding; QTL analysis; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Submergence tolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037243018

The most important factor which is not explored yet in rice under field conditions is stigma receptivity and grain filling against salinity-sodicity stress. We conducted experiments to study the effect of salinity-sodicity on stigma receptivity and grain filling of rice (of different tolerance limits against salinity alone) under field conditions along with other parameters at reproductive phase. Our results showed that viability of pollens was reduced in all the cultivars under salinity-sodicity stress showing significant effect in the salt sensitive Basmati cultivars. The starch synthase activity (? 1-4 glucan-glucosyle transferases, EC 2.4.1.21) was inhibited more significantly in sensitive than in tolerant cultivars. In tolerant rice cultivars the degree of inhibition on all the parameters studied was less, thus showing better grain yield compared to sensitive cultivars. Results regarding stigma receptivity revealed that salinity-sodicity reduced F1 seed set when pollinator plants were grown under dense saline-sodic soil and pistillate plants under control soil. More deleterious effects were observed when both the pollinator and pistillate plants were grown under dense saline-sodic soil conditions. This reduction was highly significant in fine Basmati cultivars due to significant effect on stigma receptivity and starch synthase activity. The data suggest that stigma receptivity is more detrimental for seed set compared to pollen viability and other physiological parameters under dense saline-sodic conditions. In this study KS-282 proved to be the best cultivar for dense saline-sodic soil showing non-significant effect of salinity-sodicity induced changes in all physiological and biochemical functions, pollen viability, stigma receptivity coupled with higher activity of starch synthase towards grain filling and seed set, resulting in higher grain yield compared to all the test cultivars. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mean gene diversity was 0.53 within accessions and 0.61 within pooled inbreds. Open-pollinated accessions showed a tendency toward inbreeding (FIS = 0.09), and 85% of genetic variation was shared among them. A Fitch-Margoliash tree strongly supported the distinctiveness of flint from dent germplasm but did not otherwise reveal evidence of genetic structure. Mantel tests revealed significant correlations between genetic distance and geographical (r = 0.54, P = 0.04) or maturity zone (r = 0.33, P = 0.03) distance only if flint germplasm was included in the analyses. A significant correlation (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.01) was found between days to pollen shed and maturity zone of accession origin. Pedigree, rather than migration or selection, has most influenced the genetic structure of the extant representatives of the open-pollinated cultivars at these SSR loci.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037237072

Seed size was significantly smaller for the two rare species and germinants were less able to emerge from deeper sowing depths than were the larger seeded common congeners. All species had a strong heat-stimulated germination response. While the rare A. ausfeldii showed strong germination only at the highest temperature treatment (100°C), the common and widespread A. pycnantha showed strong germination across a broad range of temperatures (60-100°C), likely to be experienced by soil-stored seeds during a fire. Seed viability, number of seeds per plant, and number of firm, aborted and eaten seeds per pod varied between species, but the pattern of variation was not related to rarity. Small seed size and a very specific temperature requirement for germination may help to explain rarity in A. ausfeldii, and to a lesser extent in A. williamsonii. Fires are often patchy and heating of the soil is likely to be highly spatially variable, so species with germination responses to a broad range of temperatures have an advantage over those that respond only to a narrow range. A narrower range of soil depths from which seeds can emerge will further reduce the proportion of the seed bank that might recruit following fire. Human impacts on species habitats, such as fragmentation, loss of topsoil through mining, timber harvesting, grazing and urbanization, and consequent reduction in fire intensity, are likely to have further contributed to rarity in these species. The role of pollination and other factors in relation to population size is the subject of further investigation.",Acacia; Fire; Forms of rarity; Heat stimulated germination; Seed set; Seed size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038547065

Within deer exclosures, native bees visited five species and ants dispersed Sanguinaria seeds in experimental depots.

By comparing segregation patterns it was now possible to group the Thinopyrum chromosomes into seven homoeologous pairs.

The results could be confirmed by backcrossing two of the most tolerant F1 plants to diploid rye.

Box 1172 Blindern, NO-0318 Oslo, Norway","The Hawaiian endemic mints, which comprise 58 species of dry-fruited Haplostachys and fleshy-fruited Phyllostegia and Stenogyne, represent a major island radiation that likely originated from polyploid hybrid ancestors in the temperate North American Stachys lineage. In contrast with considerable morphological and ecological diversity among taxa, sequence variation in the nrDNA 5S non-transcribed spacer was found to be remarkably low, which when analyzed using standard parsimony resulted in a lack of phylogenetic resolution among accessions of insect-pollinated Phyllostegia and bird-pollinated Stenogyne. However, many within-individual nucleotide polymorphisms were observed, and under the assumption that they could contain phylogenetic information, these ambiguities were recoded as new character states. Substantially more phylogenetic structure was obtained with these data, including the resolution of most Stenogyne species into a monophyletic group with an apparent recent origin on O'ahu (? 3.0 My) or the Maui Nui island complex (? 2.2 My). Subsequent diversification appears to have involved multiple inter-island dispersal events. Intergeneric placements for a few morphotypes, seemingly misplaced within either Phyllostegia or Stenogyne, may indicate reticulation as one polymorphism-generating force. For a finer scale exploration of hybridization, preliminary AFLP fragment data were examined among putative hybrids of Stenogyne microphylla and S. rugosa from Mauna Kea, Hawai'i, that had been identified based on morphology. Cladistic analysis (corroborated by multivariate correspondence analysis) showed the morphologically intermediate individuals to group in a strongly supported monophyletic clade with S. microphylla. Therefore, reticulation could be both historic and active in Stenogyne, and perhaps a force of general importance in the evolution of the Hawaiian mints. The relatively greater extent of lineage-sorted polymorphisms in Stenogyne may indicate selective differentiation from other fleshy-fruited taxa, perhaps through the agency of highly specialized bird pollinators that restricted gene flow with other Hawaiian mint morphotypes. © 2003 The Willi Hennig Society.

The lowland population of P. uliginosa is not numerous and surrounded by extensive P. sylvestris forests, the mountain one is 3 times more numerous, and the nearest population of P. sylvestris is at a distance of 2km. Observations in the field were carried out twice a week during the period of development of micro- and macro-strobili of both taxa. The results show that the P. sylvestris strobili developed every year earlier than those of P. uliginosa.

In Europe and Canada, a standard distance of 5 km is required for the highest classes of hemp seed. This study examines the relative distribution of pollen from an isolated field over the 3-week maximum flowering period, with particular reference to wind direction. The amount of pollen distributed downwind was about six times the amount distributed upwind. In effect, this means that an isolation distance of 5 km on the downwind side is about equivalent to an isolation distance of 0.9 km on the upwind side. In theory, at the experimental site examined, the required isolation area could be reduced by about 58% while still achieving the equivalent of 5 km isolation in all directions. Given that weedy and illegally cultivated plants are widespread, making it difficult to ensure their absence over a distance of 5 km, it seems advisable, when possible, to take advantage of the considerably reduced isolation distance that is necessary on the upwind side. Pollen distribution appeared to follow the expected leptokurtic curve, reducing rapidly with initial distance from the source, but much more slowly with increasing distance. This makes it impossible to guarantee complete absence of potentially contaminating pollen in the field and, for practical purposes, a very low amount of undesired gene flow needs to be tolerated. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-toyear variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this ""free"" service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.",Agriculture; Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Native bee Apis mellifera,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037168514

Functional, structural, or phylogenetic associations between attractive and defensive traits may be non-adaptive or result from correlational selection on sets of herbivory-and pollination-linked traits. Nonadditivity of fitness effects of mutualists and antagonists, a requisite for correlational selection, was experimentally tested in the field. We created experimental populations of the insect-pollinated perennial herb, Helleborus foetidus, at 16 different locations distributed among three regions in the Iberian Peninsula. Plants experienced one of four possible selective regimes generated by independently weakening the effects of pollinators and herbivores (flower and fruit predators) according to a two-way fully factorial design. Effects were assessed in terms of number of next-generation offspring recruited per mother plant under natural field conditions. Differences among H. foetidus plants in the strength of their interactions with pollinators and herbivores translated into differential fitness, as measured in terms of recruited offspring, and subsequent changes in plant population densities. A strong, geographically consistent nonadditivity in the fitness consequences of pollinators and herbivores was found also. Plants possessing the particular combination of ""traits"" simultaneously enhancing pollination and escape from herbivores enjoyed a disproportionate fitness advantage over plants possessing any of the other three possible ""trait"" combinations. Results suggest a simple, possibly widespread ecological pathway favoring the adaptive correlated evolution of mutualism- and antagonism-related plant traits in pollinator-dependent plants suffering intense flower and fruit herbivory.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037168592

Cryptic reproductive barriers in plants arise after pollination but before fertilization as a result of pollen competition and interactions between male gametophytes and female reproductive tissues. We tested for such gametic isolation between the polyploid Chamerion angustifolium and its diploid progenitor by conducting single (diploid or tetraploid) and mixed ploidy (1:1 diploid and tetraploid) pollinations on both cytotypes and inferring siring success from paternity analysis and pollen-tube counts. In mixed pollinations, polyploids sired most (79%) of their own seeds as well as those of diploids (61%) (correcting for triploid block, siring success was 70% and 83%, respectively). In single donor pollinations, pollen tubes from tetraploids were more numerous than those from diploids at four different positions in each style and for both diploid and tetraploid pollen recipients. The lack of a pollen donor x recipient interaction indicates that the tetraploid siring advantage is a result of pollen competition rather than pollen-pistil interactions. Such unilateral pollen precedence results in an asymmetrical pattern of isolation, with tetraploids experiencing less gene flow than diploids. It also enhances tetraploid establishment in sympatric populations, by maximizing tetraploid success and simultaneously diminishing that of diploids through the production of inviable triploid offspring.",Flow cytometry; Hybridization; Prezygotic barrier; Reproductive isolation; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037160233

Pattern vision has been studied in much detail in bees and flies but rarely in butterflies and moths. In this paper, I present a first proof of pattern-learning abilities in a moth, and discuss reasons for the limitations to their pattern learning. The diurnal hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum spontaneously prefers patterned to uniformly coloured stimuli but can be trained to choose the uniform stimulus. By contrast, experience does not override the innate preferences for radial over tangential patterns, and for tangential over striped patterns. These results do not reflect bad visual discrimination but rather a lack of learning ability, and motivation to abolish innate preferences. I propose that radial and tangential flower patterns are good predictors of nectar reward, a condition under which learning is unlikely to evolve. These patterns serve not only as cues for flower detection but also as guides to the reward. Hovering pollinators strongly depend on these guides and should therefore: (i) have rigid pattern preferences; and (ii) not be motivated to abolish these preferences as easily as their innate preferences for colours.",Insect; Learning; Lepidoptera; Motivation; Pattern discrimination; Vision,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037160232

Both male and female flowers produce nectar from the base of the calyx tube during a flowering period of 3 or 4 days, and are pollinated by two bumblebee species, Bombus diversus and B. honshuensis, with different proboscis lengths. When the flowers open, four sepals constructing a calyx tube separate at the top and their respective tips gradually curl up, so that a tubular part shortens. Observations at two field sites showed that B. diversus (with a longer proboscis) most often visits the flowers with a longer calyx tube, and B. honshuensis (with a shorter proboscis) the flowers with a shorter calyx tube, i.e., later in the flowering period. By changing the calyx tube length, the flowers of C. stans accept the two bumblebee species with different pro boscis length as pollinators and thus increase the chance of pollination for each flower. It was also found that the two bumblebee species prefer the male flowers to the female flowers, although the female flowers secrete more nectar as a reward than male flowers. This is likely because they visit the male flowers to collect pollen grains in addition to nectar. © The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer-Verlag 2002.",Bombus diversus; Bombus honshuensis; Clematis stans; Flower morphology; Pollination biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012851398

This is particularly evident if fruit set is resource limited and cannot be increased above the levels produced by the actions of co-pollinators. The pollinating seed-consuming interaction between senita cacti and senita moths in the Sonoran Desert presents a paradox because it exhibits many traits resembling those of the highly specialized yucca/yucca moth system, but also involves co-pollinators. For 6 years, we studied how contributions of nocturnal senita moths and diurnal co-pollinating bees to fruit set depended on resource and pollen limitation, time of flower closing, and the onset and phenology of flowering. Fruit set was typically resource limited. Fruit set of flowers exposed only to senita moths was not different from resource-limited fruit set of control flowers. When only co-pollinating bees were allowed to visit flowers, however, fruit set became pollen limited. Only in one year when fruit set was pollen limited were bees able to increase fruit set beyond the level resulting from senita moth pollination. High temperatures commonly induced flowers to close before sunrise so that diurnal bees were unable to visit flowers. This was particularly important from 1998 to 2000, when flowering did not begin until late in spring when temperatures were already high enough to induce flowers to close before sunrise. Bees were typically functionally redundant with senita moths; excluding bees from visiting flowers did not alter fruit set. Nevertheless, extreme specialization of floral traits to exclude co-pollinators has not evolved in senita, possibly because there are times when bees do increase fruit set. This can occur when senita moths are rare, fruit set is pollen limited, cool temperatures prevent flowers from closing before sunrise, and flowering begins early in spring.",Co-pollinator; Functional redundancy; Mutualism; Pollination; Senita,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036938043

We manipulated flower density by inflorescence removal and determined the effect upon mammal captures, and excluded mammals to determine their effect upon seed set. Of three mammal species captured frequently, the smallest, Acomys subspinosus (18 ± 4 SD g, Rodentia: Muridae), demonstrated the strongest relationship with P. humiflora. Breeding coincided with flowering, and pollen constituted 33.5±27.5% by volume (max 80%, n=19) of winter scats. Acomys captures on control grids were twice those on inflorescence-removal grids during flowering. Aethomys namaquensis (51±14 g, Rodentia: Muridae) included flower products in its diet (pollen comprising 3.2±4.9% of winter scats, n=73), but captures were not affected by inflorescence removal. Aethomys is a seasonal breeder and juveniles entered the population 2 months after flowering. Elephantulus edwardii, although an insectivore (48±7 g, Macroscelidea: Macroscelididae), carried more pollen grains on its nose than the rodents, acquired while foraging in inflorescences for insects. Pollen comprised 3.1±5.4% (n=23) of winter scats. From the plant perspective, seed set was significantly reduced in caged inflorescences and in those >20 cm above the ground, presumably due to limited accessibility by terrestrial animals.

There is a conflict between two major processes: initial pollination of ovules and subsequent maturation of seeds after fertilization. The conflict arises because ovules must be exposed at first to receive pollen (the gymno-ovulate condition), and subsequently seeds must be protected during maturation (the angiospermous condition). The ""Florin model"", which shows that the coniferous cone was ancestrally a compound structure, provides a constructional ""Bauplan"" whose modifications can be understood by developmental study. In the majority of conifers there is no consistent ovule-bearing structure, even though this is required by the model; much of cone ontogeny is determined by intercalary meristematic activity that results in cone closure after pollination. Two main constructional types can be recognized. In Cephalotaxaceae, Cupressaceae, Sciadopityaceae, Taxaceae, and Taxodiaceae (all without saccate pollen), pollen structure and function is uniform and not associated with special modification of the ovulate cone at the time of pollen capture. In the Pinaceae and Podocarpaceae (mostly with saccate pollen), the ovulate cone is usually highly specialized with regard to pollen capture. In the former group, developmental emphasis is on postpollination events that lead to seed protection or are associated with seed dispersal. In the latter group, there is a duality in ovulate cone morphology, initially associated with pollination, and subsequently with seed protection and dispersal. The general conclusion is that the coniferous cone cannot be treated as a static entity for comparative purposes. The functional attributes of cone structures need to be considered in a very broad context when the evolution of the coniferous cone is discussed.",Conifers; Development; Pollen capture; Seed cone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036963853

M5S 3G5, Canada","I address how floral complexity influences geitonogamous self-pollination through manipulation of pollinator behavior in Salvia nipponica. The pivoting stamens of S. nipponica hinder nectar-collecting bumblebees from crawling into flowers, increasing the probing time per flower. I predicted that longer probing times would reduce the relative cost of moving between plants, causing bees to leave plants earlier. To test this prediction, I simplified S. nipponica flowers by removing the stamens from all open flowers within a 75-m2 quadrat. Bumblebees probed these flowers more quickly than intact flowers, but the stamen removal affected neither the frequency of flower revisitation nor the flight distance between plants. In response to the decrease in the probing time per flower, bees probed more flowers on these plants. Therefore, in S. nipponica, floral complexity reduces the opportunity for geitonogamous self-pollination. Stamen removal also increased bee visitation per flower, suggesting that this sort of complexity deters visitation. To keep complex flowers attractive, therefore, selection might increase floral rewards or longevity. Floral complexity might evolve in an integrative manner with the rest of the floral phenotype.",Bombus diversus; Floral complexity; Flower handling efficiency; Geitonogamy; Optimal foraging; Pollen dispersal; Salvia nipponica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036961535

The longevity of female flowers is greater than that of male flowers and opening of both types of flowers occurs at anytime during the day, but is concentrated in the morning. 2) Although nectar is produced uniformly while flowers are open, the nectar volume and rate of female flowers are significantly higher than that of male flowers. 3) Insects, such as bumblebees (Bombus eximius and B. montivolans), honeybees (Apis cerana and A. florea), and wasps (Vespa mandarinia) are the primary floral visitors and show a preference for female flowers. 4) Both fruit and seed set are pollinator-limited at both study sites.

This study aimed to verify possible effects exerted on the attractiveness towards pollinators by the application on lucerne plants of high concentrations of three volatile compounds, the aldehyde trans-2-hexenal, the alcohol oct-1-en-3-ol, and the terpene ocimene, naturally present in lucerne flower aroma. In each of three test days, three potted plants per odour treatment were sprayed with each compound, whereas three unsprayed plants were used as a natural control treatment. All the plants were located in the proximity of an apiary with five honey bee colonies. The number of visits by both honey bees and other pollinating hymenopterans were recorded on each plant between 14.30 h and 15.30 h every day, and between 17.00 h and 17.30 h on the second and third days. Every day at 18.00 h, the 12 plants were placed back under an isolation cage, where five other plants were kept throughout as a control, not pollinated by insects. After about 40 days, number and weight of seeds were recorded on all 41 plants. Chemical analyses on bulked flowers collected from all plants confirmed previous results (high concentrations of trans2-hexenal, relatively large amounts of oct-1-en-3-ol, and limited amounts of ocimene). The effect of pollinating insects was remarkable on seed set, as indicated by the comparison between the 36 plants used in the outdoor trial and the five plants always kept in the cage. There seemed to be some attractive effect of ocimene on honey bees, whereas wild pollinating hymenopterans preferred the unsprayed control plants. The results also demonstrated the preponderant role of flower visits by wild pollinating hymenopterans on lucerne seed set, whereas honey bees confirmed to be poor pollinators of this crop.",Attractiveness; Lucerne (medicago sativa l.); Pollination; Seed set; Volatile compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942708937

In this paper, I attempt to explain this pattern by extending previous models for the evolution of sexual systems to incorporate two main features: (1) a portion of investment in pollinator attraction contributes to only female or male function, because one sexual function of a flower is saturated with pollinator visitation earlier than the other sexual function; and (2) there are trade-offs between the size and number of flowers. The analysis was conducted to determine the conditions when females and males can increase in frequency in a hermaphroditic population, assuming either concave or convex pollinator gain curves (relation between investment to attractive structures of a flower and frequency of pollinator visits to the flower). The results suggest that both of the main factors play important roles in the evolution of plant sexual systems: uneven contribution of pollinator-attractive structures and nonlinear trade-offs between flower size and number can destabilize hermaphroditism. When a convex pollinator gain curve was assumed, the effect of nonlinear trade-offs can produce accelerating compensation from the elimination of one sexual function, allowing males to increase for large regions of parameter space, where females could not increase. The last prediction obviously conflicts with the observed rarity of androdioecy in nature, indicating the necessity of exploring pollinator gain curves in more detail.",Androdioecy; Dioecy; Gynodioecy; Hermaphroditism; Pollinator attraction; Sexual systems; Size-number trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036961614

Further, the purpose was to estimate juvenile -mature correlations between these traits and breast height diameter in field trials. The seedlings were grown for two growth periods in climate chambers. There were two treatments: free access and restricted access to nutrients. The nutrient treatment in restricted access was chosen to result in a growth of approximately one third of the growth in the free access treatment. Height, shoot, root and needle dry weights, as well as amount of N and P in the needles and N and P utilization were assessed. There was a strong treatment effect of nutrients on all height and above-ground biomass traits. They were statistically different at the 1% level. There was a significant family effect for N and P utilization and for all other traits studied under restricted access to nutrients. On the contrary, no significant family effects were noted for nitrogen and phosphorus utilization under free access to nutrients, this may be attributed to luxury consumption of nutrients. The precision of the family variance estimates and heritabilities were slightly higher in restricted access than in the free access treatment. The family x nutrient interaction was significant for most of the traits studied, which resulted in non-significance for most of the family effects in the joint analyses of data from the two treatments. Selection of families that responded strongly to a high availability of nutrients could be useful at regeneration of sites with high soil fertilities. The family mean correlations between juvenile traits and breast height diameter in field were all weak (R2 ? 0.2).",Genetic correlations; Growth chamber; Nutrient utilization; Picea sitchensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038398804

The results clearly showed that plant survival, tuber yield and berry number can be increased by a strong early selection. Likewise, the results suggested that the most-promising OP offspring for TPS production could be derived from tetraploid clones with a high rate of outcrossing.

(QPM) can help alleviate human malnutrition and reduce costs of animal feed because it contains the opaque-2 mutation, which results in increased lysine and tryptophan concentrations and a higher biological value as a food than normal maize. To be commercially successful, however, QPM cultivars must be agronomically competitive with normal-endosperm alternatives while consistently achieving expected protein quality and endosperm modification (i.e., translucent or near-normal phenotype) standards. To assess stability of grain yield, protein content and quality, and endosperm modification of QPM cultivars, we evaluated 18 single-cross, 18 three-way, and 18 double-cross hybrids, and eight open-pollinated cultivars (OPCs) grown at 13 tropical locations on four continents. Hybrids averaged 13% higher grain yield than OPCs (5.97 and 5.17 Mg ha-1), whereas protein concentration in grain was 2% greater for the OPC relative to hybrid cultivars (94.6 and 92.4 g kg-1). Endosperm modification score and tryptophan concentration in protein were similar for all cultivar types. Genotype × environment interactions and sums of squares for deviations from linear regression (Sd2) for grain yield and protein concentration in grain were largest (indicating least stability) for single-cross hybrids, followed by three-way, double-cross, and open-pollinated cultivars (OPCs), successively. The reverse trend was observed for endosperm modification score, suggesting that more homogeneous cultivars had greater stability for this trait. Additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) analysis indicated that genotype × environment interaction effects for grain yield and endosperm modification score were different for hybrids than OPCs; certain environments favored either hybrids or OPCs. In conclusion (i) protein quality and endosperm modification score were always within expected values for QPM and (ii) tryptophan concentration in protein was the most stable trait, followed by protein concentration in grain, then endosperm modification score and finally grain yield.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036889047

A recent innovation in SIT has been the introduction of a novel adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL®) in an improved allergy vaccine formulation. MPL® has a potential to improve efficacy by promoting a Th1 response which should in turn promote the effectiveness of SIT and thus allow shorter courses. So far, this vaccine has provided encouraging outcomes in controlled clinical trials but more data were required from larger populations of patients in a real life setting. We report here a post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study of short-term SIT monitoring efficacy and tolerability of this vaccine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. SIT was prescribed for patients with allergies to pollen from grasses, rye, trees, mugwort and plantain, using appropriate combinations of these allergens (as allergoids) in the vaccine. Efficacy was estimated by medication use and symptoms in comparison to those recorded for the previous pollination season. Tolerability was assessed by the frequency and intensity of local and systemic adverse reactions. From the total of 1736 patients, reduced medication was required by 62.2% of patients and reduced symptoms were found in 82.4%. There was a highly significant reduction in medication consumption (p=0.001). These outcomes were unaffected by the short time interval between the treatment beginning and the pollination season. Local reactions were experienced from 8.6% of the injections and were mostly mild/moderate, consisting of redness, swelling, itching or pain at the injection site. Systemic reactions resulted from 1.3% of the injections and were mainly mild, consisting of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, dyspnoea, urticaria and fatigue. No patient had unexpected side-effects. Self-assessment of acceptability was rated as good or very good by 89.5% of patients. In conclusion, short-term SIT for allergic rhinitis/asthma using four injections of an MPL®-adjuvanted vaccine provided good efficacy and tolerability for a large number of patients in daily practice.",Asthma; Efficacy; MPL; Rhinoconjunctivitis; Short-term immunotherapy; SIT; Tolerability; Vaccine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036969065

A. mellifera collected pollen of Acacia seyal, date palm, and onions early in the morning (and partly in the late afternoon), while A. florea started pollen collection mostly later in the morning and ended it earlier in the afternoon. But in contrast to A. mellifera, A. florea was collecting pollen all day without interruption, even at very high air temperatures.

Anatomical studies were conducted to characterize the effect of glyphosate treatments on the development of male and female reproductive organs of cotton flowers at anthesis. In comparison with nontreated plants, glyphosate applied at both the four-leaf stage postemergence (POST) and at the eight-leaf stage POST directed inhibited the elongation of the staminal column and filament, which increased the distance from the anthers to the receptive stigma tip by 4.9 to 5.7 mm during the first week of flowering. The increased distance from the anthers to the stigma resulted in 42% less pollen deposited on stigmas of glyphosate-treated plants than in nontreated plants. Moreover, pollen from glyphosate-treated plants showed numerous morphological abnormalities. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of large vacuoles, numerous starch grains, and less organized pockets of the endoplasmic reticulum containing fewer ribosomes in pollen from glyphosate-treated plants than from nontreated plants. Pollen development in glyphosate-treated plants is likely inhibited or aborted at the vacuolate microspore and vacuolate microgamete stages of microgametogenesis, resulting in immature pollen at anthesis. Although stigmas from glyphosate-treated plants were 1.2 to 1.4 mm longer than those from nontreated plants, no other anatomical differences in stigmas were visibly evident.

Hence, E. azurea is described as tristylous. For sexual reproduction the plant requires specialized pollinators able to transfer pollen from flowers with long-, mid-, or short-level anthers to flowers with long-, mid-, or short-styles, respectively. This is because within a floral morph, self-incompatibility is the rule. Populations of E. azurea were studied from six localities in south-eastern Brazil (São Paulo and Minas Gerais). The frequencies of floral morphs, floral morphology and flower-visiting bees were recorded in each population. Ten different bee species were observed visiting plants. Four of them were considered generalist bees and not appropriate for legitimate pollination of the three floral morphs. Another three species were considered opportunists and only three species were considered to be potential pollinators. At the coastal region (Juréia), the plant population lacked the short-styled morph and the mid-styled morph and exhibited a semi-homostylous condition, in which the low-level anthers were adjacent to the stigma. This morph showed high level of self-compatibility. The disappearance of the short-styled morph from this region is likely correlated with the absence of Ancyloscelis gigas Friese, a specialized long-tongued bee that is oligolectic on this plant in other localities. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Apoidea; Heterostyly; Pollen harvest; Pollination; Specialized bees; Waterhyacinth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036913917

Masting in pines was studied over three field seasons by simulating seed crops in synchrony (mast years, autumn 1998 and 1999) or out of synchrony (non-mast year, autumn 2000) with the local population. Rodents removed simulated wind-dispersed Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) seeds significantly more rapidly in mast years than in the non-mast year. Radioisotopes were used to follow the fates of individual pine seeds taken from three source trees. Rodents cached nearly all experimental seeds in mast and non-mast years, making 562 caches in 1998, 510 caches in 1999, and 1034 caches in 2000. Mean dispersal distances of seeds in primary caches were 5.9 and 4.6 m (28.6% and 22.1%) farther in the two mast years than in the non-mast year. Rodents often excavated cached seeds and moved them to new sites (secondary caching). During mast years, some seeds were found in as many as three cache sites, but during the non-mast year, the level of secondary caching approximately tripled, with some seeds being found in five or six separate cache sites. Large seed crops were associated with reduced secondary caching of seeds, reduced seed consumption, and greater seed survival in the following spring. Animal-mediated seed dispersal may be a selective force, along with predator satiation and increased efficiency of wind pollination, driving temporal variation in seed production in some large-seeded pines.",Food hoarding; Masting; Pinus jeffreyi; Pinus lambertiana; Pinus ponderosa; Predator satiation; Rodent foraging behavior; Seed caching; Seed dispersal; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038138040

This dilemma can have important evolutionary consequences for mating-system evolution and polymorphisms for floral traits. We investigate the benefits and risks associated with flower size and sex morph variation in Dianthus sylvestris, a gynodioecious species with pistillate flowers that are much smaller than perfect flowers. We found that this species is mainly pollinated by nocturnal pollinators, probably moths of the genus Hadena, that also oviposit in flowers and whose caterpillars feed on developing fruits and seeds. Hadena preferred larger flowers as oviposition sites, and flowers in which Hadena had deposited eggs bore more pollen on their stigmas, suggesting that Hadena is indeed the principle pollinator, or that pollinators and these seed predators employ the same choice criteria for flowers. Globally, perfect flowers suffered more predation by seed predators than did pistillate flowers, suggesting that seed predators play an important role in reproductive system dynamics in this species. On the other hand, female flowers were more likely to be contaminated with spores of another natural enemy, the pathogenic fungus Microbotryum violaceum, that are transmitted by pollinating insects. This complex interplay between two natural enemies, one of which, Hadena, is also a pollinator and vector of fungal spores, may contribute to the maintenance of the polymorphic reproductive system of the host plant.",Dianthus sylvestris; Hadena; Microbotryum (=Ustilago) violaceum; Phenology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036928726

Our results show a significant (p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.423) correlation between genetic and spatial distances within this population which may be a result of restricted pollen and seed dispersal and of a high selfing rate. In the studied population the ant species Myrmica sabuleti (Meinhart) is probably the main pollinator for A. liliago.

Outcrossing by hand pollination produced a higher percentage of viable seed than did natural pollination, as did outcrossing between populations in comparison to outcrossing or selfing within populations, indicating a facultative outcrossing breeding system. Outcrossing also enhanced percent germination, which was positively correlated with the percentage, but not number, of viable seeds. A 16 wk. stratification period resulted in significantly higher percent germination than 8 wk. stratification or no stratification. Germination was further enhanced by inoculation with a mycorrhizal fungus (Ceratorhiza sp.) isolated from P. leucophaea.

We tested the hypothesis that patch area has had a significant effect on patch occupancy and population size of Primula elatior, a common forest herbaceous plant species in Flanders, Belgium. The hypothesis that plants from small populations have lower fitness as reflected by several characteristics related to reproduction was also tested. Finally, the probability of P. elatior colonizing presently empty patches was investigated. Patch area proved to be the most important factor explaining population size. Patch area, spatial isolation and within-patch habitat characteristics all contributed significantly to the explanation of the distribution pattern of P. elatior. Plants from small populations had a significantly lower individual fitness than plants from large populations. Small populations produced significantly fewer seeds per fruit and per plant than did large populations. Individual seed mass decreased with increasing population size, but total seed mass increased with increasing population size. Plant-to-plant variability in the proportion of flowers setting fruit, number of seeds per fruit and number of seeds per plant decreased with increasing population size. Skewed pin-thrum ratios and lower pollination intensity may explain the reduced fecundity in small populations. Geographical isolation had a significant effect on the probability of P elatior colonizing empty patches. The results show that patch area and isolation may influence regional persistence of plant populations through altered colonization probabilities and reduced reproductive success of small populations.",Demographic stochasticity; Dispersal limitation; Metapopulation; Pollinator limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036940799

It has been postulated that the downy inflorescences of these plants might serve to keep the interior of inflorescences warmer than the outside and, thus, to protect reproductive cells from low temperatures in their Himalayan habitat. In the present study, we examined the downy inflorescences of Saussurea medusa Maxim. in native habitats in the high alpine zone of the Henduan Mountains in Yunnan, China, and we analyzed the temperature within inflorescences after absorbance of light energy. S. medusa is pollinated by bumblebees and we found that its inflorescences accumulated heat not on the inside, but, rather, on the upper surfaces. The thick hollow stems and the overlapping bracts with obvious epinasty might serve not only to retain heat, but also as an insulator to protect the inside against overheating, with apparent local warming of flowers that are located at the tops of plants, which are cone-shaped. We made a model that mimicked the warming of inflorescences, providing support for the hypothesis that the downy bracts of S. medusa have two functions: thermal insulation to protect the inside of flowers and the accumulation of heat on the upper surfaces of the inflorescence. Such a system might be effective in attracting pollinators and also in protecting tissues from extreme variations in temperature. © The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer-Verlag 2002.",Alpine plants; Downy plants; Heat insulation; Pollination; Saussurea; Thermography,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-23044532268

It is pollinated by social wasps, and most populations show the morphological characteristics of outcrossing species. However, local predominantly selfing subspecies and varieties have been documented from drier habitats. To document geographic variation in floral morphology, ability to produce seeds through autogamy, and reproductive success in E. helleborine, we sampled 13 populations from three geographic regions along a latitudinal gradient of c. 1000 km from northern to southern Sweden. In the southernmost region, populations in dry and mesic habitats were compared. Supplemental hand-pollination was conducted to determine whether among-population variation in fruit set could be explained by differences in the natural level of pollination, and whether any relationship between floral morphology and fruit production could be explained by interactions with pollinators. Bagging experiments showed no evidence of autogamy in any of the study populations. Number of flowers, pollinia removal and fruit set varied significantly among populations but did not differ among regions. Pollinia removal was positively correlated with population size and both pollinia removal and fruit set were lower in dry than in mesic habitats. At the level of the individual plant, the number of pollinia removed increased more rapidly with flower number than did number of fruits produced. The hand-pollination experiment indicated that the positive relationship between number of flowers and fruit production was due to a higher degree of pollen limitation in plants with few flowers than in plants with many flowers. The experiment also showed that variation in the level of pollen limitation could only partly explain variation in fruit set among populations.",Epipactis helleborine; Floral display; Flower morphology; Fruit set; Hand-pollination; Pollen limitation; Pollen removal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036926664

Two groups in this genus may be distinguished: a) the hummingbird, and b) the perching bird pollinated species. Erythrina dominguezii is included in the second group and occurs in deciduous/semi-deciduous forests in the southwestern neotropics. I studied the exploitation of Erythrina dominguezii nectar by perching birds in a dry forest in western Brazil. Six perching bird species from two distinct groups (Psittacidae: Brotogeris chiriri, Nandayus nenday, Aratinga acuticaudata; Icterinae: Psarocolius decumanus, Icterus cayanensis, I. icterus) consumed its nectar. The two most important consumers were Brotogeris chiriri (51.5% of the flowers visited by birds) and Psarocolius decumanus (20%). While B. chiriri was a flower predator, P. decumanus removed the nectar without damaging the flowers which it opened by inserting its large bill between the standard and the keel. Nandayus nenday, Aratinga acuticaudata, and I. icterus exploited the nectar like P decumanus, and presumably also contributed to pollen transfer. As the flowering in E. dominguezii was intense and synchronous during the dryest period of the year, and its nectar was highly consumed by birds, the present data suggest that the nectar of this species may be important as an alternative resource to frugivorous/omnivorous birds when other resources are scarce.",Bird pollination; Erythrina; Icterinae; Nectar exploitation; Parakeets,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037983072

Controlled crossings were performed with pollen mixtures includingpairs of pollen lots with fast and slowly elongating pollen-tubes. Paternity analysis using isozyme markers was performed on the progenies in order to study whether the in vitro pollen-germination vigour corresponds to the proportion of seeds sired by the pollen donor. Paternal success was found to be unequal, 15 out of 23 crossings producing progeny that differed significantly from the hypothetical ratio of 1:1. The paternal contribution in the majority of the crossings was as expected: the pollen parent with more-vigorous in vitro germination sired more seeds than the less-vigorous pollen. In the case of two pollen mixtures, however, the seed-siring success summed over the maternal trees was the opposite to the expected value. Despite these aberrations, the results support the hypothesis that pollen-tube competition is one of the factors contributing to male fitness in P. abies. However, when all the other factors affecting pollination and seed set under natural conditions are taken into account, it is clear that the seed-siring success of a particular paternal genotype cannot be predicted reliably by measuring only the in vitro pollen vigour.",Germination of pollen; Norway spruce; Paternal success; Pollen-tube growth; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036950603

Previous work showed that hummingbirds visiting bush monkeyflowers with closed stigmas export more than twice as much pollen to recipient flowers as birds visiting flowers with open stigmas. To investigate how stigma closure increases pollen export, we used videotape to examine the interaction between bird and flower. Hummingbirds altered their method of foraging in response to whether the stigma was open or closed. When stigmas were closed, birds most frequently entered flowers from above, relative to the long axis of the corolla tube, bringing the bill close to the ceiling of the corolla where anthers and stigma are positioned. However, birds were much more likely to enter corollas from below when stigmas were open, keeping the bill farther from the sex organs, and resulting in failure to contact open stigmas 33% of the time. Distance of the bill from the corolla-tube ceiling was associated with frequency of contact with anthers and, when contact was made, explained pollen export in a non-linear fashion. Morphometric analyses showed that smaller corolla openings promoted stigma contact, but corolla openings that were wide relative to their height produced increased contact with anthers. Changes in hummingbird foraging position and reduced pollen export when visiting flowers with open stigmas helps to explain the observation of permanent stigma closure, even when less than full seed set has been achieved.",Herkogamy; Hummingbird; Mimulus; Pollen-pistil interference; Pollinator behavior,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036937802

Our objectives were to study genotypic differences in pollen production and flowering dynamics, and to estimate pollen availability per exposed silk. Four F1 hybrids were grown at different plant densities (between 2.5 and 12.5 plants m-2) in two distinct environments (cool Midwest USA and temperate Argentine Pampa). Pollen availability was also modified by delayed plantings and detasseling treatments. We measured the dates of anthesis and silking of individual plants, the anthesis-silking interval (ASI), the number of exposed silks per apical ear, the number of pollen grains per square meter (PGM), and kernel number per ear. The number of pollen grains produced per tassel (PGT) and per exposed silk were estimated. Increased plant density promoted an increase in ASI, matched by an enhanced interplant variability in this parameter, and a reduction in PGT. The latter was reduced from 10.3 × 106 or 11 × 106 at 2.5 plants m-2 to about 3 × 106 at 12.5 plants m-2 (USA), and from 9.7 × 106 or 11.3 × 106 at 3 plants m-2 to 4 × 106 or 3.6 × 106 at 9 plants m-2 (Argentina). We estimated two thresholds beyond which kernel set could be affected: (i) 227 pollen grains cm-2 d-1 at the end of pollen shedding and (ii) two pollen grains per exposed silk. Some cropping conditions were closer to the second threshold than others.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036889307

SSRs chosen from almost every bin in the maize genetic map were tested for repeatability, ease of automation in allele calling, and discrimination (information content). Eighty-five SSRs were found to be repeatable and easily automated, and were run on all material in the study. Fifty-three of these SSRs were found to be the most discriminatory and will be used in future routine fingerprinting studies. The seven breeding populations clustered as would be predicted on the basis of pedigree and heterotic grouping. Genetic diversity within each population was significantly higher than diversity between populations, indicating that the populations are heterogeneous at the molecular level. The inbreds also showed a high level of genetic diversity, indicating that CIMMYT breeders have successfully incorporated considerable genetic diversity into CIMMYT maize germplasm. Only lines closely related by pedigree clustered together. Population of origin and heterotic grouping were not associated with the clusters formed on the basis of SSR markers, a result consistent with the high level of diversity within source populations of the inbreds.

Theories of planning and law occupy a special position because they are rooted in practice. In practice, the main concerns are how institutions are validated in daily policies and how the meaning of institutional norms may change in the course of action. This article addresses how institutions evolve in the practice of planning and law. General norms are evoked, and may be given new meanings, when problems and social conflicts arise. The author investigates how this process plays out in various systems of planning and law.

The F 1 mapping population was produced by crossing a landrace cultivar TDr 93-1 as female parent to a breeding line TDr 87/00211 as the male parent. The marker segregation data were split into maternal and paternal data sets, and separate genetic linkage maps were constructed since the mapping population was an F 1 cross between two presumed heterozygous parents. The markers segregated like a diploid cross-pollinator population suggesting that the D. rotundata genome is an allo-tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40). The maternal map comprised 155 markers mapped on 12 linkage groups with a total map length of 891 cM. Three linkage groups consisted of maternal parent markers only. The paternal map consisted of 157 markers mapped on 13 linkage groups with a total map length of 852 cM. Three and one quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with effects on resistance to Yam Mosaic Virus (YMV) were identified on the maternal and paternal linkage maps, respectively.

The number of TUNEL-positive cells increased during pollen tube growth. The tips of pollen tube branches protruded into the nucellar cells to form a convex-concave junction. At this junction, the cell membrane of nucellar cells was separated from the cell wall and the protoplast shrank. Small vesicles and amorphous materials were released from the protoplast into the space between the cell membrane and wall. Vacuoles were collapsed, chromatin was condensed, and mitochondria and plastids were deteriorated in the shrunken protoplast.

All tests were established in the Mesopotamia region of Argentina and age of measurement ranged from 3 to 15 years old. Tests of both species contained checklots from the local land race of Argentina, but the large majority of families originated from native provenances in Australia. For E. grandis, pooled-site heritabilities were in the range commonly observed for growth and form traits: h2 = 0.16 and 0.17 for VOL and FORM, respectively. For E. dunnii, heritabilities were slightly smaller (0.10 and 0.14). In both species, there was more family x location interaction for VOL than FORM as indicated by the higher type B genetic correlations for the latter trait: rBg = 0.58 and 0.63 for VOL in E. grandis and E. dunnii, respectively, while rBg = 0.74 and 0.73 for FORM.

We examined the effects of flower size and number on female reproductive success by measuring pollination and fruiting success and predispersal seed predation. We found no evidence that pollinators (bumblebees) responded to either flower size or number, but predispersal seed predators (Lepidopteran larvae) preferred plants with larger, more numerous flowers, although predation frequency was not high. Therefore, we did not detect any effect of larger floral displays on female reproductive success in this species.

This protein reacts with a monoclonal antibody specific to the wheat 1Dx5 subunit and was not detected in nontransgenic controls or in pollen, anthers, leaves or embryos of plants grown from seeds expressing this protein in endosperm. Genomic Southern-blot analysis is consistent with results from SDS-PAGE and indicates that the transgene integration sites are complex and are different in the four events studied. Using the presence of this protein as a phenotypic marker, we studied the inheritance of this gene through three sexual generations. Reciprocal crosses with nontransgenic plants and self-pollinations were performed, and the resulting kernels were analyzed for the presence of the 1Dx5 subunit.

When a plant is male-sterile, an open pollination by a genetically diverse pollinator is possible. This study investigates the combined effects of nonrestored cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and xenia (cross-pollination) on the grain yield of seven European flint × dent single-cross maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids. Open pollinated field experiments were conducted in six environments in Switzerland in 1998 and 1999; the design was a split-plot. The effect of CMS on grain yield was statisticallycant (P < 0.05). Three CMS hybrids in nonrestored T-cytoplasm, pollinated by their male-fertile isogenic counterparts, had a higher grain yield (+ 7.4%) than their male-fertile isogenic counterparts. The higher grain yield was due to a greater number of kernels per square meter (KN). The average increase in grain yield due to xenia was 2.6%. The effects of pollinator hybrids on grain yield, kernel weight (KW), and KN were statistically significant (P < 0.001), whereas the pollinator × environment and pollinator × CMS hybrid interactions were not significant. Thus, the general pollinator ability (GPA) of the pollinator hybrids differed significantly and consistently. Averaged across the six environments, the three CMS hybrids, pollinated by five nonisogenic hybrids, outyielded their male-fertile, isogenically pollinated counterparts by 2.1, 9.3, and 15.8%, respectively. The best combination of a CMS hybrid and a nonisogenic pollinator hybrid increased grain yield by 21.4% compared with the male-fertile isogenic counterpart of the CMS hybrid. Therefore, the plus-hybrid system (CMS hybrids grown in mixtures with male-fertile nonisogenic pollinator hybrids) combines the grain yield advantages brought about by CMS and xenia.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036888712

Pollen germinability and style-stigma receptivity were analysed to determine whether protandry is a barrier to self-fertilization. By 48 h after anthesis, pollen germinability had declined to approx. 10 %. The short straight styles are not receptive when flowers first open. They gradually elongate and curve outwards, develop stigma papillae and become receptive. There is no clear separation between stigma and style: the stigma papillae appear in a line along the length of the style. Fruit set is high regardless of pollen source; however, seed set is significantly reduced after both spontaneous and facilitated autogamy. Seed set following spontaneous autogamy was 30 % (86 % in controls) in 1998 and 33 % (87 % in controls) in 1999. Seed set following facilitated autogamy was 62 % (86 % in controls) in 1998 and 67 % (89 % in controls) in 1999. Thus, separation of the male and female phases does not prevent production of seeds by self-pollination, although it does reduce the likelihood of this. Furthermore, results of the present experiments indicate that this species has no self-incompatibility mechanisms (self-compatibility index = 0.98). The selfing rate in the study population was 0.41, which is supported by the lack of self-incompatibility systems and by the incomplete protandry. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Floral biology; Inbreeding depression; Pollen germinability; Protandry; Self-fertilization; Silene acutifolia; Stigmatic receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036899793

Significant variation was found in the robbing rates experienced by different species. Within species, there was variation in robbing rates on an annual basis, on a seasonal basis, among different sites, and within sites.

Plant Sciences, Catholic University of Nijmegen, Toernooiveld 1, 6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands","In flowers of Nicotiana tabacum L., pollination induces a transient increase in ethylene production by the pistil. The characteristic dynamics of the increase in ethylene correspond to the main steps of the pollen-tube journey into the pistil: penetration into the stigma, growth through the style, entry into the ovary and fertilization. Ethylene is synthesized de novo in the pistil, and its production is reduced in the dark. Ethylene production was monitored in tobacco flowers after pollination with incongruous pollen from three different Nicotiana species, N. rustica, N. repanda and N. trigonophylla, and with pollen from Petunia hybrida. Pollen from all of these different sources can germinate on the stigma surface but each pollen type shows a different behavior and efficiency in penetrating the pistil tissues. Thus, these different crosses provided a model with which to study the response of the pistil to pollination and fertilization. Ethylene evolution upon pollination in tobacco differed in each cross, suggesting that ethylene is correlated with the response to pollen tube growth in the tobacco flower.",Ethylene; Fertilization; Nicotiana; Pollen tube growth; Real-time analysis; Trace gas,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346035894

The branches are negatively geotropic, positively geotropic and diageotropic. The flowers are uni- or bisexual, chasmogamous and cleistogamous. This variability influences the breeding system as well as resource allocation to male and female functions. The plants allocate c. 15% of their total resources to reproduction, the major part of which (68.9%) is devoted to production of aerial branches. The proportion of reproductive effort (RE) allocated to various branch systems is correlated with the availability of resources at the time of their differentiation. The pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio, female:male biomass ratio and reproductive output vary between different flower and branch types; variation is more pronounced in the latter. These variations notwithstanding, the results are in line with Charnov's sex allocation theory. The cleistogamous flowers of aerial branches are, however, an exception, being male- rather than female-biased.

The PS-ID sequences of Japanese rice cultivars showed that there are different maternal origins between lowland and upland cultivars. One subtype, 6C7A, of PS-ID sequences was predominant in all but one Japanese lowland cultivar and carried a combination of the indica-specific subtype 8C8A and japonica-specific nuclear markers for the isozyme genotype. It is probably a nuclear-cytoplasmic recombinant resulting from natural out-crossing and succeeding self-pollination. The origin of the plastid was re-confirmed by the existence of an indica-specific deletion in the plastid genome. In contrast, the Japanese upland cultivars showed two subtypes, 7C6A and 6C7A, of PS-ID sequences. An upland-specific isozyme allele as a nuclear marker was equally predominant in cultivars carrying each subtype. The existence of these particular upland-specific nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes suggests that the origin of Japanese upland cultivars is different from that of Japanese lowland cultivars. Cultivars carrying the upland-specific nuclear genotype are common in Southeast Asia, but the combination of the upland-specific nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes which is the same as the Japanese upland predominant type was found in cultivars only in Taiwan and Indonesia.

In this study RFLP probes were used to quantify the genetic diversity within and between landrace accessions of this minimum core using a subset comprising ten accessions of Indian origin. Twenty five plants per accession were assayed with EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII and DraI restriction enzymes, and 16 highly polymorphic RFLP probes, nine associated with a quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for downy mildew resistance, and five associated with a QTL for drought tolerance. A total of 51 alleles were detected using 16 different probe-enzyme combinations. The partitioning of variance components based on the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for diversity analysis revealed high within-accession variability (30.9%), but the variability between accessions was significantly higher (69.1%) than that within the accessions. A dendrogram based on the dissimilarity matrix obtained using Ward's algorithm further delineated the 250 plants into ten major clusters, each comprised of plants from a single accession (with the exception of two single plants). A similar result was found in an earlier study using morpho-agronomic traits and geographic origin. This study demonstrated the utility of RFLP markers in detecting polymorphism and estimating genetic diversity in a highly cross-pollinated species such as pearl millet.

Both choices are interrelated. Maize is the staple food crop in Malawi and the key to food security; and traditionally, 95 percent of the total land area cultivated in maize has been planted to local open-pollinated varieties instead of the newer semi-flint hybrids. Local maize is very popular with smallholder subsistence farmers as is hybrid maize, that when fertilized, intensifies production improving food security at both household and national levels. In the current economic environment, however, planting hybrid maize has two drawbacks. The first is the high price of seed and the second is its high requirements of fertilizer. With fertilizer unaffordable to many farmers, especially to women farmers of poorer female-headed households, planting hybrid maize is impractical. This paper disaggregates Malawi's farmers into subgroups of men, married women, and female headed households, describes the decision processes they make, and examines whether small bags of fertilizer will make any difference to the dilemma they now face.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042761099

Therefore, experiments were conducted to quantify outcrossing rates and flowering periods of giant foxtail accessions resistant or susceptible to ACCase inhibitors and to determine the inheritance pattern of gene(s) that confer resistance. In greenhouse experiments, outcrossing rates between resistant and susceptible parents ranged from 0.24 to 0.73%, as gauged by the response of F1 plants to fluazifop-P. Resistant plants and susceptible plants flowered at similar times, with peak flowering occurring 63 to 67 d after planting. During this period, flower initiation was nearly twice as great for resistant plants as for susceptible plants. In inheritance experiments F2 plants segregated in a 1:2:1 ratio of resistant-intermediate-susceptible phenotypes after exposure to fluazifop-P, indicating that resistance was associated with a single nuclear, incompletely dominant allele. The very low rates of outcrossing among giant foxtail plants in the greenhouse indicate that gene flow of resistance traits in the field is likely to occur primarily by seed immigration rather than by pollen movement. However, gene flow of herbicide resistance traits via pollen provides a mechanism in which multiple resistance may develop among giant foxtail populations that are resistant to other classes of herbicides.",Flowering; Gene flow; Immigration; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646359209

In S. chacoense, these small proteins named ScHT-A and ScHT-B are expressed in the style and are developmentally regulated during anthesis identically to the S-RNases as well as following compatible and incompatible pollination. To elucidate the precise role of each HT isoform, antisense ScHT-A and RNAi ScHT-B lines were generated. Conversion from SI to self-compatibility (SC) was only observed in RNAi ScHT-B lines with reduced levels of ScHT-B mRNA.

Various arbitrarily chosen criteria have been used as a demarcation of the earlywood-latewood boundary. The present study was conducted to compare genetic parameter estimates of ring density (RD) components using various demarcation criteria. Three criteria were considered: density of 400 kg/m3 as a threshold; the average of the minimum and maximum density within the ring; two-thirds of the difference between the minimum and maximum density within the ring. Relative efficiency of selection using ring density and its components as selection criteria, for improving the average ring density at harvest age, was also evaluated. A pith-to-bark 5-mm increment core was taken from each of 8 or 9 trees from each of 50, 30-year-old, open-pollinated radiata pine families. Averages across each core, weighted according to ring width, were determined for overall RD, earlywood density, latewood density and latewood ratio, defined according to the above criteria. Estimated individual-tree heritability of RD at ages 5 and 10 years were 0.71 and 0.81 respectively. Estimates of heritability and genetic correlations among growth ring density components varied considerably depending upon the demarcation criteria. The combination of low estimated heritability of latewood ratio and its non-significant genetic correlations with other traits argues strongly for discounting this variable for not contributing much information. Relative efficiencies of family selection for age-30 RD, based on RD at core ages 5 and 10 years as selection criteria, were calculated to be 82 and 93 percent, respectively. Index selection, involving ring density and its components, appeared to improve selection efficiency. Using the average of the lowest and highest density within a ring as the demarcation criterion gave the highest apparent relative efficiency of family selection. However, increased efficiencies of combined selection on densitometer-measured traits may not be worth the extra costs above selection for density of whole cores.",Correlated response; Family selection; Genetic correlation; Heritability; Index selection; Pinus radiata; Ring density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038736909

We describe the genetical localisation of molecular markers tightly linked to the Nb locus and the development PCR-based markers suitable for isolation of the Nb resistance gene by positional cloning. A bulked segregant approach was applied to identify polymorphic AFLP markers tightly linked to the Nb locus. These markers were mapped in a population of segregating S1 progeny (1,300 plants) from a self-pollinated potato cultivar, Pentland Ivory. From this analysis, Nb was placed in an interval of 0.76 cM, flanked by the AFLP markers GM339 and GM637. Recombinant PVX strains carrying different combinations of avirulence genes were used in biological assays to show that Nb was also present in potato cv. Cara but was masked by the extreme PVX resistance conferred by the Rx gene.

Before pollination, actin filaments appear as short bundles randomly distributed in the cortex of the central cell. Two days after anthesis, they become organized into a distinct actin network. At this stage the secondary nucleus, which is located in the central region of the central cell, possesses an associated array of short actin filaments. Soon after pollination, the actin filaments become fragmented in the micropylar end and the secondary nucleus is located next to the egg apparatus. After fertilization, the primary endosperm nucleus moves away from the egg cell and actin filaments reorganize into a prominent network in the cytoplasm of the primary endosperm. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin A and cytochalasin B indicates that actin is involved in the migration of the nucleus in the central cell. Our data also suggest that the dynamics of actin cytoskeleton may be responsible for the reorganization of the central cell and primary endosperm cytoplasm during fertilization.",Actin; Central cell; Embryo sac; Torenia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646813298

Segregation of male sterility in F2 and testcrosses with HA89 indicated fertility restoration was controlled by two complementary dominant genes. Identical segregation ratios of male fertile to male sterile in both F2 and testcross F1 were obtained with cms-RIG1 using the fertility restoration genes identified for cms-RIGX. These results suggest a single origin of the two cms sources. In a field test, cms-RIGX plants produced no seeds after self-pollination, and 99% seed set from open-pollination, indicating complete male sterility and female fertility.

Thus, in order to develop a reliable in vivo method to test pollen-pistil incompatibility in pear, pollen tube performance has been studied along the pistil following self and cross-pollinations. Results show that, while pollen tube growth in the style may be an unclear test, ovule observation at the microscope for the presence of pollen tube in the nucellus is a proper method to test incompatibility in this crop. With this analysis we could identify S-alleles of 'Williams' (S1S2) and 'Coscia' (S3S4), and three of the four possible S-genotypes resulting from the 'Williams' x 'Coscia' cross, as represented by 'Butirra Precoz Morettini' (S1S3), 'Santa Maria Morettini' (S2S3) and 'Tosca' (S1S4). This result demonstrates that 'Williams' and 'Coscia' cultivars do not share any allele in common. We also established two new inter-incompatibility groups in pear. Furthermore, the presence of a common allele between 'Williams' and 'Agua de Aranjuez', and 'Coscia' and 'Agua de Aranjuez', three apparently unrelated old cultivars, may indicate a narrower genetic base than expected for European pear. This finding together with the fact that 40% of new released cultivars have direct or indirect parental relationship with the cultivars 'Coscia' and/or 'Williams', anticipates the possibility of new cases of cross-incompatibility for this crop in the future.

A QTL mapping approach has been used in this study to understand the genetic and physiological basis of drought tolerance in pearl millet and to provide a more-targeted approach to improving the drought tolerance and yield of this crop in water-limited environments. The aim was to identify specific genomic regions associated with the enhanced tolerance of pearl millet to drought stress during the flowering and grain-filling stages. Test-crosses of a set of mapping-population progenies, derived from a cross of two inbred pollinators that differed in their response to drought, were evaluated in a range of managed terminal drought-stress environments. A number of genomic regions were associated with drought tolerance in terms of both grain yield and its components. For example, a QTL associated with grain yield per se and for the drought tolerance of grain yield mapped on linkage group 2 and explained up to 23% of the phenotypic variation. Some of these QTLs were common across stress environments whereas others were specific to only a particular stress environment. All the QTLs that contributed to increased drought tolerance did so either through better than average maintenance (compared to non-stress environments) of harvest index, or harvest index and biomass productivity. It is concluded that there is considerable potential for marker-assisted backcross transfer of selected QTLs to the elite parent of the mapping population and for their general use in the improvement of pearl millet productivity in water-limited environments.",Drought tolerance; Genetic mapping; Grain yield; Marker-assisted selection; Pearl millet; Quantitative trait loci,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346826282

Maximizing variability among progeny within full-sib families produced by controlled pollination may increase the probability of producing willow clones exhibiting desirable extreme phenotypes. Yet, predicting combinations of parents yielding highly variable progeny is not currently possible. Controlled pollinations were completed among 15 Salix eriocephala clones and the resulting progeny were vegetatively propagated and planted in a greenhouse progeny test. Heights of rooted cuttings were measured after 4 months of growth. Genetic similarity among parents was estimated based on 77 polymorphic AFLP bands. Strong negative correlation (r = -0.88) was detected between mean female-parent similarity indices and the standard deviation of height among half-sib progeny from those females. Parent combinations that had relatively low similarity indices tended to produce progeny that had greater variability in height. This negative relationship suggests that AFLP fingerprints of S. eriocephala parents may be useful for predicting parent combinations that will yield families with large variability.",Biomass; Breeding; Genetic variation; Salix eriocephala; Similarity index,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036929178

Fruit production in females ranged from 36 to 63%, whereas hermaphrodites functioned essentially as males. Though hermaphrodites were mostly male, investigation of pollen tube growth reveals that hermaphrodites of all dimorphic species were self-compatible. Self-fertilization and consequent inbreeding depression are commonly invoked as important selective forces promoting the invasion of male-sterile mutants into cosexual populations. A corollary prediction of these models is that gender dimorphism evolves from self-compatible ancestors. However, fruit production, seed production, and pollen tube number following outcross pollination were significantly higher than following self-pollination for three diploid, cosexual species that are closely related to the dimorphic species. The data presented here on incompatibility systems are consistent with the hypothesis that polyploidy disrupted the self-incompatibility system in the gynodioecious species leading to the evolution of gender dimorphism.",Breeding systems; Dioecy; Gynodioecy; Lycium; Polyploidy; Self-compatibility; Self-incompatibility; Solanaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036945578

The AFLPs indicated little geographic structure probably due to the wind-pollinated reproductive system of the dioecious R. nivalis. Because cpDNA haplotypes exhibited distinct distributional patterns, correlation between AFLPs and PCR-RFLPs was low. The results of common statistical methods and of nested clade analysis were largely congruent. Both supported in situ survival of one group of common haplotypes in the Central Alps. For another group of common haplotypes, classical phylogeographic analyses gave strong evidence for survival in peripheral refugia at the northern alpine border, whereas this conclusion was not as clearly supported in the nested clade analysis. Nested clade analysis provided several detailed insights on past and ongoing populational demographic processes.

In cassava (Manihot esculenta) it is an alternative to reproduction by cuttings, which normally transmits pathogens and leads to an accumulation of viral and bacterial diseases. Apomixis also assures preservation of heterosis and avoids genetic segregation. It occurs in wild relatives of cassava and has been transferred successfully from Manihot glaziovii and M. neusana. It is facultative, and occurs at a low frequency, ranging from 1-2%, and apparently is genetically different from apomixis in other crops. With selection, the frequency can reach 13%. Apomixis in cassava is frequently associated with aneuploidy but it does occur in some diploid types. It is due to the formation of aposporic sacs, which can easily be detected by clearing tissue preparations. Apomixis appears to have played an important role in speciation during the evolution of Manihot, since it leads to the maintenance and perpetuation of sterile interspecific hybridization. The use of apomixis in cassava breeding could lead to a boom in line improvement and commercial production. In addition to preserving superior genotypes, avoiding contamination of new plants, it would enable international programs to export their germplasm to destination countries. This would allow the use of superior genotypes even if apomixis occurs at a low frequency. A scheme to maximize benefits is to use diploid apomictic clones as maternal parents, which can be crossed with pollinators of polyploid interspecific hybrids, followed by selection among the progeny of new apomictic types that combine the heteroses of both interspecific hybridization and polyploidy. In addition, they acquire favored genes that have been transferred from the wild to the commercial crop.",Apomixis; Apospory; Heterosis; Interspecific hybridization; Triploid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842855968

Wheat-barley chromosome pairing was detected using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in two combinations (Mv9 kr1 × Igri, Asakazekomugi × Manas). In vitro conditions caused an increase in chromosome arm association frequency in both combinations and in fertility in some regenerants. Five wheat-barley translocations were produced in a wheat background and characterized through the combination of cytogenetic and molecular genetic approaches (GISH, FISH and SSR markers). The following translocations were identified: 2DS.2DL-1HS, 3HS.3BL, 6BS.6BL-4HL, 4D-5HS and 7DL.7DS-5HS. Physical mapping of the SSR markers on chromosomes 1H and 5H was carried out using the intragenomic and interspecific translocation breakpoints and the centromere as physical landmarks.

Phyllodoce caerulea showed consistently low selfing ability throughout the gradients even when artificial selfing treatment was performed. Phyllodoce aleutica, whereas, showed high selfing ability at the early and middle snowmelt plots but this abruptly decreased at the late snowmelt plots at every site. These results indicate that P. aleutica is predominantly a selfer at early and middle snowmelt places and shifts to an obligate outcrosser at late snowmelt places. Therefore, variations in the mating system actually occur among neighboring populations along snowmelt gradients probably because of directional selective forces such as interspecific competition for pollinators.",Autodeposition; Mating system; Seed-set; Self-compatibility; Snowbed plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036966649

Knowledge of self-incompatibility mechanisms is required to use germplasm effectively in a breeding program. The objective of this study was to characterize features of the incompatibility systems in switchgrass. Seed set and seed characteristics of reciprocal matings of tetraploid, octaploid, and tetraploid × octaploid plants were used as measures of incompatibility. Both bagged mutual pollination and manual emasculation and pollination methods were used to make crosses. The percentages of self-compatibility in the tetraploid and octaploid parent plants were 0.35 and 1.39%, respectively. Prefertilization incompatibility in switchgrass is apparently under gametophytic control, since there were significant differences in percentage of compatible pollen as measured by percentage of total seed set between reciprocal matings within ploidy levels. Results indicated that the prefertilization incompatibility system in switchgrass is similar to the S-Z incompatibility system found in other members of the Poaceae. A postfertilization incompatibility system also exists that inhibits intermatings among octaploid and tetraploid plants. In these interploidy crosses, two very distinctive types of abnormal seed were found. When the female parent was the tetraploid plant, the resulting seed was small and shriveled, while when the female parent was the octaploid, small seed with floury endosperm was obtained.

We examined the relationship between population-level genetic variation and fitness in small, experimental populations of Brassica rapa (a Eurasian annual) in a stable, mild environment. We used allozyme and morphological markers to create populations with either high or low levels of genetic variation. We then grew three high-variation and three low-variation populations for six generations under benign growing conditions, with consistent levels of light, nutrients, and water. We measured fitness components and genetic variation throughout the experiment. All populations were maintained at equal sizes (n = 100 seeds to start each generation), and plants were mass-pollinated to avoid differential inbreeding. Under mild conditions, high-variation plants did not have consistently higher fitness than low-variation plants. In generation three, plants in low-variation populations outperformed high-variation plants. In generation four, however, which was subjected to unplanned heat stress, high-variation plants had higher values for many of the fitness components measured, suggesting that, under stress, genetic variation may be associated with a fitness advantage. No differences in multiplicative fitness were found in any generation, indicating that high- and low-variation populations did not differ significantly in overall population viability. Our results indicate that when degree of inbreeding and population size are held constant, genetic variation per se does not increase fitness under benign conditions. As theory predicts, the role of population-level genetic variation may instead be in enhancing the ability of small populations to remain viable under fluctuating, stressful, or novel conditions.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036898443

The F1 was obtained by crossing two improved breeding lines, TDa 95/00328 as female parent and TDa 87/01091 as male parent. Since the mapping population was an F1 cross between presumed heterozygous parents, marker segregation data from both parents were initially split into maternal and paternal data sets, and separate genetic linkage maps were constructed. Later, data analysis showed that this was not necessary and thus the combined markers from both parents were used to construct a genetic linkage map. The 469 markers were mapped on 20 linkage groups with a total map length of 1,233 cM and a mean marker spacing of 2.62 cM. The markers segregated like a diploid cross-pollinator population suggesting that the water yam genome is allo-tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40). QTL mapping revealed one AFLP marker E-14/M52-307 located on linkage group 2 that was associated with anthracnose resistance, explaining 10% of the total phenotypic variance. This map covers 65% of the yam genome and is the first linkage map reported for D. alata. The map provides a tool for further genetic analysis of traits of agronomic importance and for using marker-assisted selection in D. alata breeding programmes.

Inheritance of self-compatibility and a common Sf-RNase allele that is observed in self-compatible cultivars was investigated using progenies from controlled crosses. Total DNAs were isolated from the parents and progenies of seven crosses that included at least one self-compatible cultivar as a parent. These DNAs were PCR-amplified with the Pru-C2 and PCE-R primer pair to determine S-haplotypes of the parents and progenies. A novel S-haplotype, S8, was found. In all crosses examined, the Sf-RNase gene was inherited from either the seed or pollen parent as a pistil S-allele in a non-functional S-haplotype. Self-compatibility of about 20 trees each from reciprocal crosses of 'Benisashi (S7Sf)' and 'Shinpeidayu (S3Sf)', and 26 selections from 16 different crosses was tested by pollination and pollen-tube growth studies. Cosegregation of the Sf-RNase allele and self-compatibility was confirmed with all but selection 1K0-26 (S3S7). Selection 1K0-26 (S3S7) that originated from 'Benisashi (S7Sf)' x 'Koshinoume (S3Sf)' appeared to be self-compatible even without the Sf-RNase allele.

Oxalidaceae and Connaraceae share petals that are postgenitally united into a basal tube (although they are imbricate in both) but free at the insertion zone, stamens that are congenitally united at the base, uniseriate glandular hairs on the stamen filaments, and ovules that are hemianatropous to almost orthotropous. The sharing of a special type of sieve-tube plastids and of trimorphic heterostyly, studied by other authors, should also be mentioned. With Brunelliaceae, the two families share an androgynophore and nectaries at the base of the stamens in alternisepalous sectors. Elaeocarpaceae and Tremandraceae share buzz-pollinated flowers and a syndrome of features functionally connected with it. In addition, petals are larger than sepals in advanced bud, they are valvate, involute and enwrap part of the adjacent stamens, they have three vascular traces. Lignified hairs are common on the anthers and are found in the ovary locules and on the ovules (not lignified) of representatives of both families.

As a preliminary step for future gene-flow risk assessments, a study of jointed goatgrass × wheat hybrids collected from infested wheat fields in 1998 and 1999 was undertaken in Oregon. Jointed goatgrass accessions representing the range of variation in its worldwide distribution also were included in this study. The high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins, a group of wheat endosperm storage proteins, were used as genetic markers for characterizing this material. In the Oregon jointed goatgrass accessions, the seed protein analysis identified F1 hybrid seed that was formed at a rate of 0 to 8% on a per field basis. The HMW glutenin patterns in the backcross seed threshed from Oregon hybrids showed a higher proportion of seeds formed from pollination by wheat than by jointed goatgrass. Analysis of the roots for remains of the maternal seed or spikelet indicated that most hybrid plants were of the F1 generation and that either jointed goatgrass or wheat could be the female parent. These analyses suggested a hybridization dynamics in which jointed goatgrass serves as the predominant F1 female parent and wheat as the predominant backcross male parent. Development of introgressed jointed goatgrass forms carrying wheat genes would be dependent on the presence of a continuous hybrid zone located near or within a persistent jointed goatgrass population.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036888812

The effective number of the parent (Np) and the variance effective population number [Ne (v)] were used to assess the impact of total (?T), female (?f) and male (?m) fertility variation. A theoretical framework was developed to account for female and male fertility correlations as well as the impact of possible pollen contamination. Total fertility variation was described by the sibling coefficient (?T: the probability that two genes randomly chosen from the gamete gene pool originate from the same parent), which was further subdivided into ?f and ?m. These parameters were compared under various conditions including the total seed harvest, imposing on equal seed harvest among the orchard's clones and two contamination scenarios (M = 0 and 20%). Fertility variations among females, males and clones were observed within and among years. Sibling coefficients (?T) were lower, but the effective number of parent (Np) and variance effective population number (Ne (v)) were higher in years with moderate female and good male strobilus production. Np for female and male reproductive outputs varied from 49 to 82 and from 57 to 93, respectively. Np was higher for males than females. When the crop of the 6 years was pooled, Np for female, male and the clone were 73, 87 and 85, respectively. The impact of female-male fertility correlation for conditions with no-, positive- and negative-correlations were assessed and their impact on ?T, Np and Ne (v) was also evaluated. It was demonstrated that the practice of equal seed harvesting from every clone, or the mixing of seeds from several years, would substantially improve the genetic diversity and the genetic representation of the seed orchard population when a positive correlation between gender fertilities was observed. The relevance of these results to supplemental-mass-pollination was discussed under two cases where equal- and un-equal amounts of pollen from clones were included in the pollen mixes.",Effective number of parent; Equal seed harvest; Fertility variation; Pollen contamination; Seed orchard management; Sibling coefficients,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036929392

A factorial crossing design was applied using the same maternal and paternal clones in two different environmental conditions, in a B. pendula seed orchard established in a greenhouse and at an outdoor clone collection. Both single donor and two-donor pollinations were employed. Female inflorescences were collected after a fixed time of germination, pollen-tube lengths were measured for each cross, and paternity of the seeds sired by two-donor pollen mixtures was analyzed using isozyme markers. The pollination site had a significant influence on pollen-tube growth rate and seed-siring success. Significant interactions between pollination site and pollen donor indicated genotype-environment interactions in pollen-tube growth rate and seed-siring success. A highly significant positive correlation between pollen-tube growth rate and seed-siring success was found in the greenhouse but not at the outdoor clone collection. These results suggest that the pollen-tube growth rate can be a predictor of seed-siring success in controlled greenhouse conditions, where differences among maternal plants are mainly of genetic origin, but not in more heterogeneous Outdoor conditions.

These patterns in resistance can be critical determinants of the fitness of plant hybrids and may also influence distribution of the herbivore. We examined resistance to a pre-dispersal seed predator by natural and experimental hybrids between Ipomopsis aggregata and I. tenuituba. These species and their hybrid offspring differed primarily in ability to avoid oviposition by Hylemya sp. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) rather than in reducing damage to seeds by a developing larva. Plants of I. tenuituba had the lowest frequency of fly eggs and were thus the most successful at avoiding damage. Hybrids were either intermediate to or less resistant than both parental species. Because these patterns persisted in experimental arrays of interspersed potted plants, they cannot be attributed to ongoing differences in the environment between hybrid and parental sites. In experimental arrays, the frequency of fly eggs correlated positively with corolla width, a dimension of flower size that also influences the rate of pollination, suggesting seed predators can generate selection on reproductive traits of hybrids.

Both presence of solid styles and possession of tenuinucellate ovules represent consistent synapomorphies for Alliaceae and support the separation of Agapanthus and Themidaceae from Alliaceae. Within Alliaceae, absence of septal nectaries (i.e., complete fusion of carpel margins) is a synapomorphy for the sister genera Gilliesia and Gethyum; septal nectaries are present in all other Alliaceae. A gynobasic style and reduced ovule number are probable synapomorphies for the genus Allium. In contrast to most other Alliaceae, in Gethyum and Gilliesia only three (abaxial) stamens (A1, a1, a2) are expressed, as in the apostasioid orchid Neuwiedia, but the perianth of Gethyum is only slightly bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic), whereas Gilliesia graminea shows bilateral symmetry in all three floral whorls: perianth (suppression of the inner adaxial tepal in most flowers), androecium (suppression of three adaxial stamens), and gynoecium (slight bilateral symmetry, evident in transverse section). The precise relationships of Miersia and Solaria, the other two genera of Alliaceae with bilaterally symmetric flowers, are unknown, but their morphology indicates a close relationship with Gilliesia and Gethyum. Appendages of tepaline origin occur in Gethyum, Gilliesia, and Miersia; their papillate epidermis suggests that they function as osmophores. Their presence in Miersia, which has six stamens, indicates that these novel structures, which develop late in floral ontogeny, evolved independently from stamen suppression in this group. Within Gilliesia graminea, the genetic mechanisms controlling tepal number and shape are apparently unstable, resulting in fluctuating asymmetry. In G. graminea the possession of insect mimicry, presence of osmophores and absence of nectar together indicate a deceitful pollination mechanism similar to that of some Orchidaceae; this would make Gilliesia highly unusual among non-orchid monocots, given that pollination by sexual deceit is normally regarded as exclusive to orchids.",Alliaceae; Asparagales; CYCLOIDEA; FIDDLEHEAD; Flowers; Fluctuating asymmetry; Gilliesia; Monocotyledons; Monosymmetry; Pseudocopulation; Septal nectary; Solid style; Transmitting tissue; Zygomorphy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036945501

This plant inhabits the high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which is characterized by a harsh climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2-3 m column-shaped, red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly to investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects, and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate. Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise entomophilous plant lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display. In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly insect-pollinated lineage. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

During the period 1977-1999 flowering was highly variable in both timing (date of first flower ranged from 5 July to 6 August, mean=17 July) and abundance (maximum open flowers per 2x2-m plot ranged from 11.3 to 197.9, mean=82). Time and abundance of flowering are highly correlated with the previous winter's snowpack, as measured by the amount of snow remaining on the ground on 15 May (range 0-185 cm, mean=67.1). We used structural equation modeling to investigate relationships among snowpack, first date of bare ground, first date of flowering, number of inflorescences produced, and peak number of flowers, all of which are significantly correlated with each other. Snowpack depth on 15 May is a significant predictor of the first date of bare ground (R2=0.872), which in turn is a significant predictor of the first date of flowering (R2=0.858); snowpack depth is also significantly correlated with number of inflorescences produced (R2=0.713). Both the number of inflorescences and mean date of first flowering are significant predictors of flowers produced (but with no residual effect of snowpack). Part of the effect of snowpack on flowering may be mediated through an increased probability of frost damage in years with lower snowpack - the frequency of early-season ""frost events"" explained a significant proportion of the variance in the number of flowers per stem. There is significant reduction of flower production in La Niña episodes. The variation in number of flowers we have observed is likely to affect the pollination, mating system, and demography of the species. Through its effect on snowpack, frost events, and their interaction, climate change may influence all of these variables.",Climate change; Delphinium barbeyi; Flowering; Frost; Larkspur,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036934301

The amount of airborne pollen increased during the first four days, and then decreased rapidly. Diurnal variation was high; the lowest amounts of pollen being measured at night and in early morning when, in general, air humidity was high and wind speed low. During the first two days of anthesis, pollen densities inside and outside the orchard were approximately the same, but from the third day onwards the densities in the orchard were higher. On the third day, the highest densities were measured on the southern slope, but one day later in the northern part of the orchard, indicating phenological differences in pollen shedding. In addition to phenology, spatial variation was affected by the wind; the highest pollen densities were measured on the downwind side of the orchard. The spatial variation in the amount of airborne pollen correlated significantly with pollen contamination: contamination was high (0.80) on the eastern, upwind side of the orchard, and much lower (0.51-0.57) in the middle and northwest part. The estimated rate of pollen contamination for the whole seed orchard was 0.71, while the rate of self-fertilisation was 0.06 with no significant spatial variation.

The increase in temperature is believed to be the main cause. The earlier start of flowering will have consequences for the start of the pollen season, and thus for the start of the hay fever season. Millions of people world-wide will therefore experience the impact of climate change in their daily lives during spring and summer. In this paper we analyse the relation between climate parameters, especially temperature, and the start of the pollen season in the western part of the Netherlands based on daily pollen counts of the Leiden University Medical Centre and temperature measurements from 1969 till 2000 by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between temperature and start of the pollen season. An advance of the start of the pollen season of 3 to 22 days has been observed.

There are several small, isolated species clusters at the basal nodes of the tree that are all restricted to the winter-rainfall zone of southern Africa (the Greater Cape floral kingdom) and a few, highly derived, large species groups that have radiated extensively within the winter-rainfall zone. Mapping of floral traits shows that an Iris-type flower is ancestral in Moraea. Floral changes are associated with shifts in pollination systems, either from passive pollen deposition on long-tongued bees foraging for nectar to active pollen collection by female bees foraging for pollen, fly, or hopliine scarab beetle pollination. Dating the nodes of the phylogenetic tree using non-parametric rate smoothing with a calibration point derived from broad dating of the angiosperms indicates that the divergence between Moraea and its sister genus Ferraria occurred about 25 mya in the early Miocene.

Non-restored cms-hybrids often yield more than their male-fertile counterparts, especially when they are pollinated by unrelated plants. The combined effects of cms and genetically dissimilar pollen sources (i.e. xenia) are referred to as the ""Plus-Hybrid"" effect. The Plus-Hybrid system consists of blending a non-restored cms-hybrid with an unrelated male-fertile hybrid as a pollinator. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the effect of male sterility and xenia on the gain yield of cms-hybrids as pure stands in small-plot experiments and (2) to confirm the results, obtained from small-plot experiments, with real Plus-Hybrids as blends in large-strip mixture trials. European and US Corn Belt germplasm was used. Small-plot experiments were conducted from 1998 to 2000: Two dent x flint cms-hybrids were crossed with three fertile hybrids in nine environments in Switzerland; two dent x dent (Corn Belt adapted) cms-hybrids were crossed with four fertile hybrids in 12 environments, and one cms-hybrid was crossed with five fertile hybrids in 8 environments in the USA. Large-strip mixture trials were conducted from 1998 to 2000: One cms-hybrid was crossed with four pollinators in three environments in Switzerland; one cms-hybrid was crossed with two pollinators in 32 environments and three pollinators in 16 environments in the USA. The Plus-Hybrids, on average, outyielded their male-fertile counterparts. In Switzerland, the best Plus-Hybrid yielded 1.7 t ha -1 higher in the small-plot and 1.1 t ha -1 higher in the large-strip mixture trials. In the USA, the Plus-Hybrid effects were somewhat less strong and less consistent.

Although qualitative tests of the effects of mating systems on sex ratios abound, there is a dearth of studies that quantify both the mating system and the sex ratio. I use a colour dimorphism with a simple Mendelian inheritance to quantify the mating system of an unusual fig-pollinating wasp in which males disperse to obtain matings on non-natal mating patches. In qualitative agreement with initial expectations, the sex ratios of single foundresses are found to be higher than those of regular species. However, by quantifying the mating system, it is shown that the initial expectation is incorrect and this species' sex ratio is a poor predictor of its mating system (it underestimates the frequency of sib-mating). The species has a very high variance in sex ratio suggesting that excess males can simply avoid local mate competition (and hence a lowered fitness to their mother) by dispersing to other patches.",Agaonidae; Dispersal; Local mate competition; Partial local mating; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-53149090916

I investigated the reproductive biologies of two species of unbranched short-columnar cacti, Ferocactus cylindraceus and F. wislizeni. I recorded female reproductive output (flowers produced, fruit set, seeds per fruit and seed mass), plant size and growth, and used hand-pollination experiments to determine breeding systems and pollen limitation. In both species, the ability to self varied among individuals, but self-pollination resulted in very few seeds, suggesting strong inbreeding depression. Neither species was pollen-limited. Numbers of flowers produced increases with plant size for both species, and seeds per fruit may also be related to plant size, although the relationship is unclear. Seed mass is not correlated with plant size. Flower production was similar in both species, but F. cylindraceus produced fewer seeds per fruit than F. wislizeni, and its seeds weighed less. Fruit set by F. cylindraceus was heavily impacted by a florivorous lepidopteran. Fruit set was very high (94 to 96%) in F. wislizeni, suggesting that architectural constraints (e.g., meristem limitation) are more limiting than resource levels or the level of pollinator services. In F. cylindraceus, numbers of seeds per fruit was positively correlated with seed mass, whereas in F. wislizeni, the relationship was negative (tradeoff). The growth rates of F. wislizeni are affected by rainfall the previous season, and growth rates increase as the plant ages. Ferocactus cylindraceus and F. wislizeni are thought to be sister species, meaning that observed differences between them are more likely to be the result of recent evolutionary processes in their lineages rather than differing phylogenetic histories.",Breeding system; Cactaceae; Female reproductive output; Ferocactus; Plant size; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036034950

However, nectar production by Banksia is difficult to measure because inflorescences comprise large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of tiny flowers. Our aim was to quantify variation in nectar volume among B. ericifolia L.f. plants, but existing techniques were too time consuming or required destructive sampling of inflorescences. We estimated nectar volume by counting the number and estimating the size of nectar drops on a sample of flowers on each inflorescence. Our technique was fast (10 min per inflorescence) and a highly significant positive relationship was found between visual estimations and direct measures (capillary tubes and micropipettes) of nectar volume (r = 0.92; P ? 0.0001). This technique thus provides an alternative to current techniques for measuring nectar volume in plants that have large numbers of small flowers arranged in dense inflorescences. By using this technique, we found significant variation among days in nectar volume produced by each of five B. ericifolia plants (P ? 0.02). Furthermore, days of high and low nectar production were synchronised among plants. We concluded that the temporal variation found may be the result of fluctuations in environmental variables, rather than the age of an inflorescence. Indeed, nectar volume was found to be significantly correlated with a range of weather variables including daily maximum temperature (°C), precipitation (mm), wind speed (km h-1) and relative humidity (%). However, larger-scale and longer-term studies are needed to adequately examine any relationship between environmental variables and nectar production.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036032575

Although chromosome numbers in all four taxa were confirmed as 2n = 36, the size of the chromosomes was slightly larger in genus Bruguiera. Regular chromosome pairing was observed in the three species; however, in the hybrid meiosis was very irregular. Pollen viability in all three species was very high (>80%); however, in the hybrid pollen viability was <10%. This could be due to non-homology in the chromosomes of the two parental species and irregular meiosis in the hybrid. Due to highly irregular meiosis in the hybrid and uneven distribution of chromosomes to the two poles, most of the pollen was non-viable. All three species were fully self-compatible. Between B. gymnorrhiza and the two Rhizophora species, pollen in crosses and reciprocal crosses failed to germinate, indicating cross-incompatibility between these two genera. Partial cross-compatibility was recorded between R. samoensis and R. stylosa. In many crosses, pollen tubes were observed growing freely up to the base of the style. This also accords with occasional crossing of these species in nature. However, due to only partial homology in the chromosomes of these two species, the hybrids produced are always sterile. Similarly, cross-compatibility between the hybrid and its two parental species was also partial. This could be attributed to allelic differences between the two species and their hybrid and also to physiological and/or chemical hindrance of the pollen-tube growth through the stylar tissue.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036035317

After 3,077 pollinations were made during the spring and summer of 1995, 31 potential hybrids were obtained; however, they were discarded because of their S. phureja second pollinator characteristics.

Embryo rescue was performed between 15 and 20 DAP and resulted in 3,867 embryos of which 530 developed into seedlings. In January of 1997, a single unique hybrid was discovered in this population and was almost discarded because of its S. phureja anthocyanin nodal banding marker.

Here we assess whether the invasion of exotic plants - mostly mediated by habitat disturbance - facilitates the invasion of exotic flower visitors in temperate forests of the southern Andes, Argentina. We recorded visit frequencies and the identity of visitors to the flowers of 15 native and 15 exotic plant species occurring in different highly disturbed and less disturbed habitats. We identified three alien flower visitors, the hymenopterans Apis mellifera, Bombus ruderatus, and Vespula germanica. We found significantly more visitation by exotic insects in disturbed habitats. This pattern was explained, at least in part, by the association between alien flower visitors and flowers of exotic plants, which occurred more frequently in disturbed habitats. However, this general pattern masked different responses between the two main alien flower visitors. Apis mellifera exploited almost exclusively the flowers of a subset of herbaceous exotic plants that thrive under disturbance, whereas B. ruderatus visited equally flowers of both exotic and native plants in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats. We did not find any strong evidence that flowers of exotic plants were more generalist than those of native plants, or that exotic flower visitors were more generalist than their native counterparts.

We used existing detailed knowledge of the population structures of the host wasps, as well as the ecological and evolutionary relationships among them, to explore the relevance of each of these factors to Wolbachia prevalence and mode of transmission. Fifty-nine per cent of these wasp species have Wolbachia infections, the highest proportion reported for any group of insects. Further, neither the presence nor the frequency of Wolbachia within hosts was correlated with the population structure of pollinator hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of wsp sequence data from 70 individuals representing 22 wasp species show that neither the close phylogenetic relationship nor close ecological association among host species is consistently linked to close phylogenetic affinities of the Wolbachia associated with them. Moreover, no genetic variation was detected within any Wolbachia strain from a given host species. Thus, the spread of Wolbachia within host species exceeds the rate of horizontal transmission among species and both exceed the rate of mutation of the wsp gene in Wolbachia. The presence and, in some cases, high frequency of Wolbachia infections within highly inbred species indicate that the Wolbachia either directly increase host fitness or are frequently horizontally transferred within these wasp species.

The coordination of the senescence process within the flower requires interorgan communication. To determine if differential ethylene responsiveness among floral organs is involved in regulating senescence signaling, ethylene biosynthesis and the expression of ethylene biosynthetic genes were investigated in styles, ovaries, and petals from 6 stages of flowers following ethylene treatment. As flowers matured, all floral organs investigated became more responsive to ethylene. Ovaries were the first flower organ that had detectable increases in ethylene production following ethylene treatment. In stage 4 and 5 flowers, the highest levels of ethylene production were detected in petals, while styles had the highest ethylene production at stage 6. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS) and ACC oxidase (ACO) genes were induced by ethylene treatment, and transcript abundance of DCACS1, DCACS2 and DCACO1 increased in all floral organs as flowers matured. DCACS3, a pollination-responsive ACS gene, did not show a significant increase in transcript levels following ethylene treatment except in styles. Patterns of gene expression in ethylene-treated styles and petals corresponded with increases in ethylene biosynthesis, with increases in ACS mRNA abundance detected at stage 1 or 2 in petals and at stages 4, 5, or 6 in styles. The largest increases in ethylene production and gene expression occurred in styles at stages 5 and 6 and corresponded to the stages at which the styles were first receptive to pollination.

Pollinators' size should follow Bergmann's rule in mountains (larger body size at higher altitudes) and selection should, in turn, lead to larger flower size at higher altitudes. The study focuses on the flower and pollinator size variation in 11 Cytisus scoparius populations located between 680 and 1300 m a.s.l., and on the relationship between flower size and pollination success of plants in each population. Significant differences among populations were found in flower size, pollinator size and fruiting success (ANOVA, P < 0.001 in all cases). Regression models show that (i) pollinator size increases significantly with altitude, (ii) a parallel quadratic increase in flower size and (iii) a quadratic decrease in pollination success with altitude. Moreover, there is a tendency of plants with smaller flowers in each population to have a higher percentage of flowers initiating development into fruits (ANCOVA, P < 0.05).

Here, we present the results from field experiments in which flower mites were excluded from flowers of six hummingbird-pollinated plants with contrasting flower longevities. Nectar measurements were taken on flowers from which mites were excluded and those without mite exclusion over their lifespans. The exclusion of mites had a significant positive effect on the amount of nectar available in plants with long-lived flowers. In contrast, nectar availability in short-lived flowers was not significantly reduced after mite exclusion. The significance of the mite-exclusion treatment was independent of floral morph and flower age. Results also suggest that the magnitude of the mite-exclusion treatment depends on the volume of nectar produced by the flower throughout its lifetime. The treatment effect was detected when nectar consumption, presumably by flower mites, exceeded 13% of the nectar produced by the flowers; nectar availability was not significantly reduced when nectar volume was < 7 ?L per flower. It appears that flower mites consume proportionately more nectar in long-lived flowers than in short-lived flowers. Parasitic hummingbird flower mites seem to be preferentially taking advantage of plant-pollinator interactions in which flowers last several days and produce large volumes of nectar. The consequences of this finding concerning plant-hummingbird-mite interactions await further investigation. As a working hypothesis, we propose that nectar production has increased over evolutionary time not only by the selective pressures imposed by the pollinators, but also to compensate for the reduction they suffer after exploitation by nectar robbers and thieves such as flower mites.",Ascidae; Flower longevity; Hummingbird pollination; Multiple-species interactions; Mutualism exploitation; Nectar theft,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036879576

Pseudobombax munguba has nocturnal, white, brushlike flowers that, surprisingly, lack nectar, and they are pollinated by a single, large bat species, Phyllostomus hastatus. Although self pollen tubes penetrated ovules with equal facility to cross tubes, fully selfed flowers failed to form fruits. Flowers with mixed (self + cross) pollinations set fewer fruits than those of full crosses, and the fruiting success decreased with self : cross pollen ratio (i.e., 1 : 1 vs. 3 : 1). Fruits from such mixed pollinations contained varying but generally low (mean 3.3%, range 0%-22%) numbers of selfed seed.

A potential drawback of this and other ant-plant mutualisms is that ant-guards may drive away useful, insects, particularly pollinators. We assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict in a Mexican ant-acacia, Acacia hindsii. This Acacia is guarded by a highly aggressive ant (Pseudomyrmex veneficus), which resides entirely within the host plant canopy and is provided with extrafloral nectar and protein-rich Beltian bodies. Acacia hindsii flowers released their pollen from 0700 to 0830 hours, and were visited by pollinators from 0730 to 1300 hours. Over the same time period ants maintained high activity levels at extrafloral nectaries on young leaves. Although daily activity of ants and pollinators overlapped substantially in time, it was largely separated in space: resources exploited by the ants are predominantly concentrated within new growth, while inflorescences are present only on shoots from the previous year. Ants nevertheless visit extrafloral nectaries on older leaves near inflorescences, and there is thus potential for ant-pollinator conflict. Bioassays of ant behavior showed young A. hindsii inflorescences induce an avoidance response in its ant-guards, which reinforces spatial segregation between ants and pollinators. This effect is absent from buds or postreproductive flowers. Young flowers of two non-myrmecophilous Acacia species also induced significant (though less potent) repellent effects, suggesting a general role for ant-repellents in Acacia, with selective enhancement in myrmecophilous species.",Acacia hindsii; Ant-plant; Ant-pollinator conflict; Ant-repellent; México; Mutualism; Pollination; Pseudomyrmex veneficus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012869303

The sites represented three sizes of grassland and two levels of grassland abundance in the landscape. Five years' demographic data were evaluated in a stochastic matrix population model, and studies of seed set, pollinator abundance, and inbreeding depression were performed in order to examine possible links between population viability and pollination. In all six sites, plants with reduced capacity of self-pollination (due to herkogamy) showed strongly reduced population viability in locally fragmented grassland habit, with pronounced extinction thresholds at certain levels of local fragmentation. Population viability was reduced because of inbreeding depression and reduced seed production in combination, both caused by pollinator deficit in locally fragmented grasslands. Plants with high selfing capacity had low population viability over the entire local fragmentation gradients. Selfing yielded high seed set in the absence of pollinators and was advantageous in fragmented parts of the grasslands. However, selfing had negative effects in nonfragmented parts of the grasslands, because it decreased the chances of cross-pollination and because selfed progeny had reduced fitness compared to outcrossed offspring. A comparison among the six sites indicated that the negative effects of local fragmentation were amplified by reduced size of the grassland sites and by reduced abundance of grassland habitat in the landscape.

There is little resistance to early blight among commercial potato cultivars. However, resistance to early blight in diploid (Solanum phureja-S. stenotomum) potatoes has been identified, and was found to be highly heritable and readily transferred to the tetraploid level via 4x-2x crosses. The purposes of this study were to identify good levels of early blight resistance in open-pollinated 4x-2x (Solanum tuberosum x S. phureja- S. stenotomum) hybrids selected for horticultural characteristics, to estimate broad-sense heritability for early blight resistance in these hybrids, and to investigate the general and specific combining ability for resistance to early blight from some of these early blight resistant tetraploid selections. Four early blight resistant clones were crossed as female parents with four different male parents in a design II mating scheme to generate 16 families. Approximately 20 randomly chosen offspring per family were visually evaluated for early blight resistance in 1995 and 1996 in a randomized complete block design in Pennsylvania.

There were significant differences among female and male parents for area under the disease progress curve, indicating the importance of general combining ability for early blight resistance in this germplasm. The female x male source of variation was not significant, indicating that specific combining ability was not important. The greatest number of resistant progeny were observed in families where both parents were derived from the early blight resistant population; however, at least one highly resistant progeny was produced in all families.

Calendula arvensis starts flowering when pollinators are still scarce. Mean temperature of the inflorescence surface was positively related to solar radiation and was 2°C higher than the surrounding air. Inflorescences proved to be heliotropic, traversing a 19° mean arc from east to west every day, and maintaining excess temperature during the period of maximum sunshine. Calendula arvensis showed high fruit production by self pollination. Neither fruit production nor fruit mass was limited by pollinators, but pollen germination was heavily limited by temperature. The optimum range for germination in the laboratory was 25-40°C. Under natural conditions, the temperature on C. arvensis heads surpassed the minimum threshold for optimum pollen germination only during the period of maximum sunlight (midday). Usia aurata adults only foraged on C. arvensis heads, they only moved to feed, and they flew from head to head when sunshine was intense. In the laboratory, the temperature at which insects were able to fly ranged from 22° to 31°C for females, and between 21° and 31°C for males. No efficient physiological ability for thermoregulation was found either in females or in males, although females were able to warm themselves slightly. Nevertheless, heat captured passively on C. arvensis inflorescences was sufficient to reach the flying temperature range. Fly behavior on inflorescences also depended on their surface temperature: the higher is the temperature on heads, the longer the time spent feeding, and the shorter the period spent basking. The role of solar warming of heads in plant reproductive fitness was related to stimulation of pollen germination rather than to pollinator attraction. The optimal temperature range for pollen germination overlapped with optimal temperature range for insect flying. U. aurata therefore acted as a pollinator of C. arvensis without playing a decisive role in plant reproductive fitness.",Behavioral thermoregulation; Bombyliidae; Calendula arvensis; Central Spain; Compositae; Ectothermy; Floral microclimate; Foraging behavior; Heliotropism; Marigold; Pollen germination; Usia aurata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037800369

The relative amounts of alkanes were mostly the same between the two orchid species, whereas the relative amounts of most alkenes were significantly different. On the grounds of these findings and behavioral experiments conducted in earlier studies, we suggest that the difference in relative amounts of alkenes is responsible for the selective attraction of pollinators in the two orchids.

Since pollen size distributions of each morph overlap we develop a method, based on chi-squared comparisons of observed to expected pollen size distributions, to quantify pollen transfer proficiencies. This method, unlike previous methods, does not assume an equal chance of pollen transfer for pollen grains in the region of overlap. The probability that a single pollen grain from a short-styled plant undergoes legitimate pollen transfer to long-styled flowers (4.19 × 10-2) was more than twice that for illegitimate transfer to other short-styled plants (1.56 × 10-2). In contrast, the probability that a single pollen grain from a long-styled flower undergoes legitimate pollen transfer to short-styled flowers (1.65 × 10-2) was no greater than that of illegitimate pollen transfer to other long-styled plants (2.15 × 10-2). The transfer proficiencies of individual pollen grains are thus highly asymmetric. However, because long-styled flowers produce significantly more pollen, the ratio of legitimate to illegitimate pollen on the stigmas of short-styled flowers (1.85) markedly exceeded that for long-styled flowers (1.11). Short-styled flowers incurred significantly higher levels of self-pollination than long-styled plants, emphasizing the importance for self-pollination to be removed before comparing stigmatic pollen loads. The method we propose could be applied to other distylous species with pollen size overlap between morphs and thus allow for a more widespread study of the pollination ecology of heterostylous species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-18744386095

However, little is known about intraspecific variation in floral scent composition in these as well as in other plants. In this study the level of variation in floral scent composition found within and among five populations of Geonoma macrostachys var. macrostachys in the western Amazon is documented. Floral scent samples were collected using head-space adsorption and were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Most of the 108 compounds recorded were of isoprenoid origin, but only 28 of the compounds were found in all 62 samples analyzed. No differentiation was found between the studied populations, confirming that G. macrostachys var. macrostachys is outbreeding and indicating that the individual populations are part of a metapopulation linked by sufficient gene flow to avoid local differentiation. However, a negative correlation between distance and similarity of floral scent chemistry indicates a case of clinal variation within the distribution area of G. macrostachys. Male euglossine bees are infrequent visitors to G. macrostachys, while other groups of insects are abundant. However, the level of variation and the chemical composition lend support to a suggested importance of male euglossine bees in long-distance pollen flow in G. macrostachys.

In this study, the anthetic structure of the gynoecium and androecium of representatives of all genera of Buxaceae were comparatively studied, and observations on the flowering processes and pollination biology were made. Styloceras and Notobuxus were studied in detail for the first time. Various features of the morphological analysis support our earlier molecular phylogenetic study. Shared reproductive characters among Sarcococca, Pachysandra and Styloceras are the occurrence of two (rarely three) carpels, the lack of interstylar nectaries, a micropyle formed by both integuments, attractive stamens in male flowers, and fleshy fruits. In addition, Styloceras and Pachysandra share a secondary partition in the ovary. Notobuxus does not seem to be clearly distinct from Buxus. Both have a similar inflorescence and perianth structure; female flowers have three carpels, interstylar nectaries, micropyles formed by the inner integument, rudimentary arils, and they develop into capsular fruits; in male flowers stamens are sessile and the central pistillode is lacking in some species.

Nectar traits were compared between male and female flowers to determine any differences in the characteristics of the main reward offered to pollinators. Nectar chemical composition and sugar proportions were similar between flower types. Total nectar sugar production per female flower was threefold higher than per male flower, and nectar removal did not have any effect on total nectar production in both flower morphs. Pollinators reduced nectar standing crops to similar and very scarce amounts in both flower types. Results indicate indirectly that pollinators are consuming more nectar from female flowers, suggesting that the higher nectar production in female flowers may be a reward-based strategy to achieve the high female reproductive output observed in this species.",Cucurbita maxima ssp. andreana; Cucurbitaceae; Nectar production; Nectar sugar composition; Removal effects; Standing crop,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036879956

To study this phenomenon, gender expression of the monoecious herb Sagittaria trifolia was investigated over the entire flowering season in two field and two cultivated populations in Hubei and Hunan Provinces, China. In racemes of S. trifolia, flowers open sequentially from bottom to top, with female flowers opening first followed by male flowers. This creates a temporal separation of sexes in the species. Under field conditions small plants are often male, with production of both male and female flowers increasing with plant size. Femaleness increased among sequential inflorescences since female flower production increased whereas male flower production did not. Seed production was greater in large inflorescences because they contain more female flowers, and the number of ovules increased in female flowers at basal positions within the raceme. A consistent pattern of high seed set was observed in flowers from both field and cultivated populations. About 1% of unfertilized ovules resulted from no pollination and 2% of the seeds produced were only partly developed due to resource limitation. In the first inflorescence of the six experimental populations, 6.7-40.0% of individuals produced only male flowers, and female flowers of 1.9-6.5% individuals were aborted.

Meiotic analyses of 219 male plants belonging to 12 populations showed across a wide geographical range one quadrivalent and seven bivalents in all of them. The quadrivalent involves the four biggest m chromosomes and probably constitutes a sex multivalent carrying in tight linkage the sex genes and provides a mechanism whereby permanent translocation heterozygosity is maintained. In metaphase I alternate orientation of the quadrivalent was predominant (85.71 %). Fourteen megaspore mother cells were analyzed and did not show the quadrivalent.

It is assumed that there are two non-allelic factors M and n; M would be a dominant female suppresor and n a recessive male-suppresor.

Ethylene and its biosynthetic precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) play an important role in regulating these responses. Because exogenous application of ethylene or ACC does not invoke the full postpollination syndrome, the pollination signal probably consists of a more complex set of stimuli. We set out to study how and when the pollination signal moves through the style of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) by analyzing the expression patterns of pistil-expressed ACC-synthase and -oxidase genes. Results from this analysis showed that pollination induces high ACC-oxidase transcript levels in all cells of the transmitting tissue. ACC-synthase mRNA accumulated only in a subset of transmitting tract cells and to lower levels as compared with ACC-oxidase. More significantly, we found that although ACC-oxidase transcripts accumulate to uniform high levels, the ACC-synthase transcripts accumulate in a wave-like pattern in which the peak coincides with the front of the ingrowing pollen tube tips. This wave of ACC-synthase expression can also be induced by incongruous pollination and (partially) by wounding. This indicates that wounding-like features of pollen tube invasion might be part of the stimuli evoking the postpollination response and that these stimuli are interpreted differently by the regulatory mechanisms of the ACC-synthase and -oxidase genes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036853040

Each of the 7 sites contained from 6 to 15 open-pollinated families from each of 4 provenances: Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP), Central Florida (CF), Marion County Florida (MCF), and Gulf Coastal Plain (GCP). The main objectives for establishing these trials were to: (1) characterize the genetic architecture among and within these provenances; and (2) determine the relative genetic worth of these provenances for possible inclusion in advanced-generation breeding programs in the Coastal Plain in the southeastern United States. Provenance and family within provenance effects were strong and highly significant for height and MAIV, but only family effects were significant for rust infection. The Florida provenances were the best growers at all ages and at all sites. The poor growth of the Gulf Coastal Plain provenance compared to the Atlantic Coastal Plain provenance could not be explained by climatic or edaphic differences between the regions of origin. We speculate that gene flow from slower growing sources on the western side of the Mississippi River may be at least partly responsible for the poor growth of the GCP loblolly. Because of the relatively stable performance of the provenances and the families within provenances at each site and across ages, selection of superior families for growth and rust resistance between ages 5 and 10 yr should result in substantial genetic gain in the Coastal Plain.",Genetic gain; Heritability; Pinus taeda; Tree improvement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036846446

With over 124,000 described species, and countless more awaiting discovery, they are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on Earth. This series of ten papers explores the diversity of Diptera. Several authors describe the diversity of dipteran lifestyles and behaviours, both as larvae and adults. They also reveal the various roles that these animals play in the ecological interactions of the planetcountless numbers of flies feed on plants, control pest arthropods (including other flies!), break down rotting vegetation and excrement, pollinate flowers, provide food for other species, and of course, spread diseases. Indeed, because of their role as vectors of disease, flies have almost single-handedly prevented the economic development of countries in tropical Africa and South America. But flies are used in positive ways by humans, too, and several authors describe their use in forensic science, molecular research, and even as main attractions in the tourism industry.

We investigate the genetic basis of floral differences between two closely related plant taxa with highly divergent mating systems, Mimulus guttatus (large-flowered outcrosser) and M. nasutus (small-flowered selfer). We had previously constructed a framework genetic linkage map of the hybrid genome containing 174 markers spanning approximately 1800 cM on 14 linkage groups. In this study, we analyze the genetics of 16 floral, reproductive, and vegetative characters measured in a large segregating M. nasutus x M. guttatus F2 population (N = 526) and in replicates of the parental lines and F1 hybrids. Phenotypic analyses reveal strong genetic correlations among floral traits and epistatic breakdown of male and female fertility traits in the F2 hybrids. We use multitrait composite interval mapping to jointly locate and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying interspecific differences in seven floral traits. We identified 24 floral QTLs, most of which affected multiple traits. The large number of QTLs affecting each trait (mean = 13, range = 11-15) indicates a strikingly polygenic basis for floral divergence in this system. In general, QTL effects are small relative to both interspecific differences and environmental variation within genotypes, ruling out QTLs of major effect as contributors to floral divergence between M. guttatus and M. nasutus. QTLs show no pattern of directional dominance. Floral characters associated with pollinator attraction (corolla width) and self-pollen deposition (stigma-anther distance) share several pleiotropic or linked QTLs, but unshared QTLs may have allowed selfing to evolve independently from flower size. We discuss the polygenic nature of divergence between M. nasutus and M. guttatus in light of theoretical work on the evolution of selfing, genetics of adaptation, and maintenance of variation within populations.",Adaptation; Floral evolution; Genetic architecture; Mimulus; Quantitative trait locus; Selfing; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842833989

The species was investigated for self-compatibility, seed set without pollinators, and inbreeding depression in a greenhouse experiment. Seed set was equivalent in hand-selfed and hand-outcrossed plants (c. 53%), indicating full self-compatibility. Seed set was low (2.8%) in caged, unmanipulated flower heads. There was no significant difference in seed weight, germination, and survival between selfed and outcrossed progeny. Juvenile biomass was significantly lower in selfed than in outcrossed progeny (on average 45% lower). Cumulative fitness calculations for germination, survival, and juvenile biomass showed that the mean inbreeding depression was 58% in offspring produced by selfing. The results suggest that in K. arvensis, which is protected against self-pollination within flower heads through protandry, the likely mechanism for selfing is via geitonogamy among flower heads. Geitonogamy among ramets within the larger clones observed in abandoned grassland could reduce offspring viability in K. arvensis since the fitness of selfed offspring was low. Inbreeding depression could therefore add to the recruitment problems experienced by plants in abandoned grassland, both in K. arvensis and probably in other clonal grassland species, depending on their growth structure and breeding system. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Population structure and the main phases of the reproductive process were examined in order to shed light on recruitment patterns and limitations. Rhododendron ponticum flowers are self-compatible and attract a diverse array of insects, which are responsible for a considerable number of seeds set in the populations. Nevertheless, only adults form populations, whilst seedlings are scarce and saplings virtually absent (only two juveniles out of 2489 adults sampled). Non-specialized vegetative multiplication by layering was observed. Recruitment failure seems to depend on the scarcity of safe microsites, which are free from drought, for seedling establishment. The observations contrast with R. ponticum's reputation as an aggressive invader in temperate Atlantic areas. It is proposed that the species shows a variable balance between sexual reproduction and vegetative multiplication depending on environmental conditions. At present, only the latter seems to be prevailing in relict populations in the Iberian Peninsula. This flexible reproductive strategy is also discussed as a mechanism allowing persistence during geological climatic oscillations. © The Linnean Society of London.",Bombus; Breeding system; Clonal plants; Macroglossum; Plant extinction; Pollination; Recruitment; Refugia; Seedling survival; Threatened plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036853055

Correlated-divergence analysis (using phylogenetically independent contrasts) and cross-species analysis (exploring patterns across present-day species) were employed in a complementary fashion to test the hypothesis that rare and common species differed with respect to life history. Two measures of rarity, threat of extinction and geographical range size, were investigated for relationships with growth form, longevity, pollination mode, mating system, dispersal and seed mass. Species threatened with extinction had, on average, significantly smaller seed mass than non-threatened species. This emerged in both correlated-divergence and cross-species analyses, independently of the effects of the other life-history traits. In cross-species analysis, but not as phylogenetic contrasts, a significant number of species with short life spans were less likely to be threatened with extinction. This arose because most short-lived species not threatened with extinction diverged from long-lived species threatened with extinction at a major node deep in the phylogenetic tree (where monocotyledons diverged from dicotyledons). Mating system was significantly related to geographical range size in correlated-divergence analysis, but not across present-day species. There was evidence that evolutionary divergences for dioecy have been significantly correlated with the occupation of a wide geographical range, although this relationship has not been maintained across present-day species. Growth form, pollination mode and dispersal could not account significantly for variation in either threat of extinction or range size. Because relationships for plants of eastern Australia were found to differ considerably from those emerging for other species assemblages on other continents, support is provided for the notion that associations between species rarity and life history are highly dependent on geographical context and the species assemblage under scrutiny.",Evolutionary divergence correlation; Geographical range size; Phylogenetic regression; Threat of extinction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041401198

Formerly the model was applied only to haploid pollen gametes in the offspring of conifers, but is extended so that it can be used with genotypic data from diploid offspring of both angiosperms and gymnosperms. In addition, it is shown that the mating parameters can be estimated without independent estimates of allele frequencies in the pollen pools outside the neighbourhood; thus the model might be applied effectively to natural populations exposed to unknown external pollen sources. Parameters of the neighbourhood mating model were estimated for a 10-year-old seed orchard population of the insect-pollinated tree, Eucalyptus regnans, in southeast Australia, which contained a mixture of two geographical provenances (Victoria and Tasmania). The mating patterns revealed were complex. Crosses between trees of the same provenance occurred three times more often than crosses between trees of different provenances. Levels of self-fertilization and patterns of mating within neighbourhoods were influenced by provenance origin, crop fecundity and orchard position (central vs. edge) of mother trees. Gene dispersal, however, was extensive, with approximately 50% of effective pollen gametes coming from males more than 40 m away from mother trees (average distance between neighbouring trees was 7.4 m). Thus, insect pollinators are efficient promoters of cross-fertilization in this orchard, with the result that the effective number of males mating with each female is large.",Gene flow; Mating system; Parentage analysis; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036846103

Iris hexagona is a salt-sensitive species that exhibits intraspecific variation in salinity tolerance. To investigate the effect of salinity on flowering, we exposed I. hexagona collected from natural populations to salt treatments in a common garden. Experimental salinity additions strongly delayed flowering phenology, but the effect was not apparent until the second year, when less than 4 g/L NaCl delayed flowering up to 3 d. In the field, soil salinity and flowering phenology varied substantially within I. hexagona populations. Iris flowers are receptive to pollinators for 2 d or less, therefore a 3-d delay could affect outcrossing dynamics, and ultimately, the evolutionary ecology of iris populations. Salinity also had a carryover effect; prior salinity exposure delayed flowering in irises that had been replanted in freshwater conditions for 6 mo. This is an important result because it suggests that episodic stress (such as tropical storms) can influence performance well after the stress has disappeared. Our research further underscores the importance of long-term studies because a 1-yr experiment would have failed to reveal the strong effects of salinity that emerged in the second year.",Flowering phenology; Freshwater wetlands; Glycophyte; Phytohormones; Salinity stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036860533

The nine grading classes represented a factorial of three root collar diameter classes (small [4-6 mm], medium [6-8 mm] and large [8-10 mm]) and three root quality classes (poor, fair, and good). Putative cull classes included runts, poor foliage coverage, jumbos, ""dog-legged"" (one horizontal root at a right angle to the stem), multiple leaders, and excessive sweep. After assessment, the rooted cuttings and seedlings were established in a randomized block design on a coastal site in southern Beaufort County, North Carolina. Five years after establishment in the field, survival, height, diameter, presence or absence of fusiform rust incidence, number of leaders, and sweep were assessed. Analyses of variance were conducted to detect differences among the putative cull classes. Nursery rooting cutting morphological traits were regressed on fifth year field traits. Iterative logistic regression was performed between the nursery traits (continuous variables) and survival (binary variable). Overall, fifth year survival of the rooted cuttings was higher than that of the seedlings (77 versus 42%, respectively), and their stem volume was not significantly different from seedlings (0.259 versus 0.285 m3). For the four open-pollinated families studied, these results indicate that no culling standards are needed for rooted cutting planting stock to perform at least as well as seedling planting stock. However, eliminating cuttings with poor foliage coverage (less than 2.5 cm) and culling or pruning rooted cuttings with multiple leaders is recommended to reduce the number of forked trees in the field.

Batsch) epicarp and ovary, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the two fragments share 54% identity at nucleotide level and show common features of plant LTP genes, such as conserved cysteine residues and lipid-binding motifs. Phylogenetic analysis grouped Pp-LTP1 and Pp-LTP2 in two distinct clusters, the former with most of LTP genes sequenced in the Rosaceae family, the latter only with one almond LTP. Genomic Southern data indicated that a small LTP gene family is present in peach. Pp-LTP1 and Pp-LTP2 have been used as gene-specific probes to describe expression in flowers and fruits throughout development. In petals, sepals and stamen only Pp-LTP1 was expressed whereas transcripts of Pp-LTP2 strongly accumulated in non-pollinated and pollinated ovary with a decreasing trend in the period of four weeks after pollination. In fruits, a dramatic accumulation of Pp-LTP1 mRNA was detected in epicarp at all stages of fruit development and, with the exception of the early growth stage, no Pp-LTP1 transcripts have been detected in mesocarp. When Pp-LTP2 was used as a probe in the same fruit tissues, a faint hybridisation signal was observed only in epicarp of fruitlets collected at an early growth stage. Infection with Monilia induced only a slight increase of Pp-LTP1 transcript in epicarp of pre-climacteric and climacteric fruits. These results support the hypothesis of multiple roles played by LTPs and, considering that LTPs have been recognised as the major allergen of peach, indicate that Pp-LTP1 could be related to the allergenicity of peach. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was found within populations (64%), although variation among regions (17%) and among populations within regions (19%) was highly significant (P &lt; 0.001). Accordingly, the global fixation index FST averaged over loci was high (0.39). The among-population differentiation indicates restricted gene flow, congruent with limited dispersal of specific globeflower's pollinating flies (Chiastocheta spp.). Within-population diversity levels were significantly higher in the Alps (mean Nei's expected heterozygosity HE = 0.229) than in the Pyrenees (HE = 0.197) or in Fennoscandia (HE = 0.158). This finding is congruent with the species-richness of the associated flies, which is maximum in the Alps. We discuss the processes involved in shaping observed patterns of genetic diversity within and among T. europaeus populations. Genetic drift is the major factor acting on the small Pyrenean populations at the southern edge of T. europaeus distribution, while large Fennoscandian populations result probably from a founder effect followed by demographic expansion. The Alpine populations represent moderately fragmented relics of large southern ancestral populations. The patterns of genetic variability observed in the host plant support the hypothesis of sympatric speciation in associated flies, rather than recurrent allopatric speciations.",Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers (AFLP); Genetic variation; Habitat fragmentation; Population differentiation; Postglacial recolonization; Sympatric speciation; Trollius europaeus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036846975

Little attention has been paid to the adaptive significance of this sexual system, which is particularly prevalent in the Asteraceae. We investigated one hypothesized advantage of having two flower types, namely that this arrangement permits flexibility in allocation of resources to male and female reproductive functions. We examined six species of goldenrod (Solidago), a genus of gynomonoecious, perennial herbs. In greenhouse experiments, we varied one or more of three environmental variables - light, nutrients and water - and/or examined heads in different positions on the plants. Most variables had little or no effect on the proportion of ray flowers. Significant effects were found for light in 0 of 5 experiments, for nutrients in 4 of 9 experiments and for water in 0 of 3 experiments. Heads in different positions in the inflorescence differed in the proportion of ray flowers in half of the experiments, though the differences were small. We also monitored temporal patterns in four species and found that the proportion of ray flowers increased significantly over the blooming period and the number of flowers per head declined. Because of the small number of significant effects and their modest magnitude, we conclude that the presence of two flower types in goldenrods is probably not advantageous in allowing flexibility in sex expression. It seems likely that this sexual system has been more important either in increasing pollinator attraction or in reducing pollen-pistil interference. The small observed changes in floral ratios were generally accompanied by changes in disc size in a manner consistent with an explanation based on allometry. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Allometry; Capitulum; Disc flowers; Goldenrods; Pollen-pistil interference; Ray flowers; Sex allocation; Sex expression; Sexual system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036853953

There is a two-nucleotide deletion in the gene from tomato cv Walter, which results in a frame shift and the deletion of four amino acids at the C terminus of the full-length protein. Other cultivars that produce either active or inactive enzyme show the same absence or presence of the two-nucleotide deletion. The endo-?-mannanase enzyme protein was purified and characterized from ripe fruit to ensure that cDNA codes for the enzyme from fruit. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that non-ripening mutants, which also fail to exhibit endo-?-mannanase activity, do so because they fail to express the protein. In a two-way genetic cross between tomato cvs Walter and Trust, all F1 progeny from both crosses produced fruit with active enzyme, suggesting that this form is dominant and homozygous in tomato cv Trust. Self-pollination of a plant from the heterozygous F1 generation yielded F2 plants that bear fruit with and without active enzyme at a ratio appropriate to Mendelian genetic segregation of alleles. Heterologous expression of the two endo-?-mannanase genes in Escherichia coli resulted in active enzyme being produced from cultures containing the tomato cv Trust gene and inactive enzyme being produced from those containing the tomato cv Walter gene.

In this paper, we describe the development of glyphosate as a selective agent for the recovery of transgenic embryogenic corn callus and the production of plants tolerant to Roundup® herbicide. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup® herbicide inhibits the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) and thus prevents the synthesis of chorismate-derived aromatic amino acids and secondary metabolites in plants. A maize EPSPS gene has been cloned, mutated to produce a modified enzyme resistant to inhibition by glyphosate, and engineered into a monocot expression vector. In addition, a bacterial gene which degrades glyphosate (glyphosate oxidoreductase, or GOX) was also cloned into a similar expression vector. Stably transformed callus has been reproducibly recovered following introduction of mutant maize EPSPS and GOX genes into tissue culture cells by particle bombardment and selection on glyphosate-containing medium. Plants have been regenerated both on and off glyphosate selection medium, and are tolerant to normally lethal levels of Roundup®. Excellent seed set has been obtained from both self and outcross pollinations from both sprayed and unsprayed regenerated plants.

The lineages were assumed to have remained separated from each other for several glacial periods. The conifer Abies alba Miller, silver fir, is an excellent model to test whether pollen-mediated gene flow may eliminate the genetic imprints of Pleistocene refugial isolation. Two DNA markers with contrasting modes of inheritance were applied to 100 populations covering the entire range of silver fir in Europe. The markers exhibited each two highly conserved alleles based on an insertion/deletion of 80 bp in the fourth intron of the mitochondrial nad5 gene and on a synonymous substitution in the chloroplast psbC gene. The geographical distribution of the maternally inherited mitochondrial variation supported the existence of at least two refugia with two recolonizing maternal lineages remaining largely separated throughout the range. The cline of the nad5 allele frequencies was much steeper than the one of the two psbC alleles. The psbC cline was as wide as the whole range of the species. Our results provide striking evidence that even a species with very long generation times and heavy pollen grains was able to establish a highly efficient pollen-mediated gene flow between refugia. Therefore we postulate that an exchange of genetic information between refugia by range-wide paternal introgression is possible in wind-pollinated plant species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037195146

By growing local cultivars farmers obtain an average yield of 1.2 t-1 whereas research has released cultivars yielding 5-11 t -1 under on-station conditions. Recognizing this and the important role maize is playing in the livelihood system of farmers in eastern Ethiopia; Participatory Varietal Selection (PVS) was conducted for three consecutive seasons (1996-1998) in three locations. The objectives of the study were to identify farmers' cultivar selection criteria for future breeding, to enable farmers to assess the performance of improved cultivars under their management, to increase farmers' access to the cultivars of their preference by injecting source seed into the local seed system, and to investigate whether breeding for wide adaptation like for the Hararghe highlands has any drawbacks or not. The study indicated farmers' maize varietal selection criteria together with the differences in selection criteria across locations classified under the same adaptation zone. Though farmers selected some of the many improved cultivars tested, no improved cultivar had all the characteristics, which farmers want in a single cultivar. To be able to combine cultivar selection traits farmers considered cultivar combinations in all locations, but not the single 'best' cultivar. Despite the yield advantage of hybrids, farmers selected Open Pollinated Varieties (OPVs) because they had more preferred traits. Farmers also preferred to retain their local cultivars despite their lower yield compared to most of the improved cultivars. Both situations confirmed how resource poor farmers' cultivar requirements are much more diverse than yield per se. Gender and social group-driven difference in cultivar preference was also observed. The study revealed the need for proper zoning of the Hararghe highlands as a prerequisite to developing better adapted maize cultivars to the varied agroecological and socioeconomic niches. As shown in this study, proper zoning, due consideration to farmers' relevant selection traits and wider use of participatory approaches should be adapted to develop cultivars which can gain farmers acceptance.",Eastern Ethiopia; Farmers' cultivar selection criteria; Participatory varietal selection; Ranking; Specific adaptation; Zoning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036392697

We tested for distance-related genetic structure by hand-pollinating plants at increasing distances and measuring fruit set (berries/pollinated flowers) and seed number per fruit in natural populations of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Bagging of the flower buds without natural (pollination by insects) or hand-pollination yielded almost no fruit or seed, suggesting that the species are obligately insect pollinated. Self-pollination led to a significant reduction in seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with cross-pollination. Moreover, seed number increased with increasing distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient. Flight distances of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower and, for lingonberry, between-inflorescence flight distances. About 90% of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. At this distance, we observed less than the maximum seed number per fruit in hand-pollinations in both study species.

Floral scent compounds were analysed from 22 flowering butterfly-pollinated plant species, representing 13 families which originate mainly from temperate North Europe but also from tropical and temperate America. Scents were collected using the dynamic headspace adsorption method and identified with coupled gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total, 217 floral scent compounds were identified, with the number per species ranging from 8 to 65. The major emerging pattern is the occurrence of certain compounds emitted exclusively by the flowers of many of the investigated species in major amounts - the benzenoids phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol, the monoterpenes linalool and linalool oxide (furanoid) I and II and the irregular terpene oxoisophorone. It is likely that these compounds serve as a signal to attract pollinating butterflies, and may have evolved in conjunction with the sensory capabilities of butterflies as a specific group of pollinators. While there is convergence in terms of the compounds sharing this function there has been a geographical divergence in terms of their relative abundance.

Both yield and fruit quality (per cent split fruit) were tested in several experiments. Applying smaller amounts of pollen (1.5 g per tree in early application only in 1996 or 0.5 g in two applications in 1997) resulted in higher yields than with open pollination or supplementary pollination using larger amounts of pollen (1.5 g per tree in four applications in 1996 or 1.0 g in two applications in 1997). Applying 1.0 g pollen in two applications in 1998 resulted in decreased yields compared with open pollination or non-electrostatic pollination. Pollen germinability on the stigma was greatest for open pollination suggesting that overloading the stigmas with pollen in supplementary pollination may not only reduce yield but also increase competition between pollen grains.

Mean grain yields for the two sets of data were 2.32 and 2.72 t ha-1 for early- and late-maturing varieties, respectively, giving a yield advantage of 17.24% of the late-maturing varieties over the early-maturing varieties.

For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.",Castilleja miniata; Hemiparasitic plants; Herbivory; Host-parasite interactions; Indian paintbrush; Indirect effects; Lupine; Lupinus argenteus; Plant chemical defense; Pollination; Quinolizidine alkaloids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038814764

We sampled pollinators in small (0.5-2 ha), medium (3-10 ha), and large (>30 ha) habitat fragments during the peak flowering period in spring and summer. We also compared fruit set and seed set in the seven plant species on different-sized fragments. Hand-pollinated controls were used to determine pollination deficits in three species. Seed-germination studies were done on two species to determine the effect of reduced seed set on reproductive output. Overall, the species richness of bees, flies, and butterflies did not vary significantly among different-sized fragments. However, the abundance of particular species of bees and monkey beetles (Scarabaeidae: Hopliini) was significantly affected by fragment size, together with other factors such as vegetation cover and the ratio of grass to shrubs. Fragment size and distance to large remnants of vegetation had a significant influence on seed or fruit set in four of the seven plant species examined. One species failed to set any seed in small- and medium-sized fragments. Comparisons of fruit and seed set among hand-pollinated and naturally pollinated plants confirmed that seed set was pollinator-limited in the orchid Pterygodium catholicum. Our results suggest that perennial plant species respond in different ways to fragmentation, and that populations on small fragments do not always experience pollination deficits. Existing classifications of pollination systems, in relation to their vulnerability to fragmentation, do not adequately explain our results.

To determine the effect of flower age on infection, stigmata were inoculated with conidia of M. vaccinii-corymbosi between 0 and 5 days after anthesis, fungal growth rates through the stylar canal were measured in detached flowers in the laboratory, and fruit disease incidence was determined in plants grown in the greenhouse. Hyphal growth rates were greatest in flowers inoculated on the day of anthesis, declined linearly with increasing flower age at inoculation (r = 0.921; P < 0.0001; n = 12), and were unaffected by the presence or absence of pollen applied at the time of inoculation. In greenhouse-grown plants, the percentage of infected fruit decreased exponentially with increasing flower age at inoculation (R = 0.878; P = 0.0057; n = 10), with disease incidence ranging from 76.4% for flowers inoculated on the day of anthesis to 15.5% for those inoculated 4 days later. Fruit disease incidence in the greenhouse was linearly correlated with hyphal growth rates in detached flowers (r = 0.985; P < 0.0001; n = 9), justifying the use of detached flowers when investigating gynoecial infection by M. vaccinii-corymbosi. In separate experiments, the effects of timing and sequence of pollination and inoculation on hyphal growth rates through the stylar canal and on disease incidence were investigated. Application of pollen to detached flowers 1 or 2 days before inoculation reduced hyphal growth rates by between 14.0 and 42.9% compared with flowers that received pollen and conidia simultaneously. Similarly, reductions in fruit disease incidence by between 9.5 and 18.3% were observed on greenhouse-grown plants for pollination-to-inoculation intervals ranging from 1 to 4 days. These results document that newly opened flowers are most susceptible to infection by M. vaccinii-corymbosi and that fruit disease incidence is reduced if pollination occurs at least 1 day before inoculation.

For introgressive hybridization to proceed, F1 and advanced hybrids must be released from reproductive barriers and successfully mate with one or both parental species. I investigated the mating system of natural hybrids between A. exaltata and A. syriaca in three populations in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia. Allozyme data and a maximum-likelihood procedure were used to estimate the frequency of six genotypic classes (parentals, F1, F2, and backcrosses) of the hybridizing populations, the pollinia received by hybrid plants, and the paternal parents of seeds produced by hybrids. F1 hybrids, backcross A. syriaca, and parental A. syriaca individuals were common in three hybrid populations. Even though self-pollinations and interhybrid pollinations were common, F2 seed production and the occurrence of F2 individuals were rare in hybrid populations. Hybrid plants received more pollen from A. syriaca than A. exaltata, which resulted in the production of more backcross-A. syriaca seed than backcross-A. exaltata seed. Asclepias exaltata was rare in the hybrid populations, but A. exaltata pollinia were received by hybrids and this species sired between 15% and 36% of the seeds produced on hybrids. The potential for introgression with A. exaltata populations is lower because this species is unsuccessful as the maternal parent in interspecific and backcross hand-pollinations. The asymetry of hybridization with A. syriaca as the maternal parent is further supported by the incorporation of maternally inherited chloroplast DNA markers in hybrids. Hybrid milkweeds frequently backcross with both parental species and may be released from the reproductive barriers that limit the formation of F1 hybrids in natural populations. The direction of interspecific gene flow and introgression in milkweeds is influenced by the reproductive biology of hybrids, the constituency of the surrounding population, and failure of some crosses to produce seeds. Finally, introgressive hybridization remains an important evolutionary force even when the initial formation of F1 hybrids in natural populations is rare.",Asclepias; Hybridization; Introgression; Pollination; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036807286

Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created by the presence of a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plantanimal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant-animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036789948

First, a low fruit:flower ratio may be a passive ""nonadaptive"" consequence of external stressors that destroy flowers or limit their pollination. Alternatively, a low fruit:flower ratio may be a result of adaptations that enhance plant fitness, perhaps by allowing the plants to compensate for the very stressors that limit fruit set. We tested these nonadaptive and adaptive hypotheses using Solanum carolinense (horsenettle), an herbaceous plant that generally exhibits a low fruit:flower ratio. Horsenettle often suffers substantial flower loss to herbivores and fruit set can be pollen limited. We present experimental evidence that neither floral destruction by herbivores nor pollen limitation directly affected fruit:flower ratio.

The Ivr2 soluble invertase mRNA was more abundant than the Incw2 mRNA throughout pre- and early post-pollination development (peaking at +3 d). In contrast, Incw2 mRNAs increased only after pollination. Drought repression of the Ivr2 soluble invertase also preceded changes in Incw2, with soluble activity responding before pollination (-4 d). Distinct profiles of Ivr2 and Incw2 mRNAs correlated with respective enzyme activities and indicated separate roles for these invertases during ovary development and stress. In addition, the drought-induced decrease and developmental changes of ovary hexose to sucrose ratio correlated with activity of soluble but not insoluble invertase. Ovary abscisic acid levels were increased by severe drought only at -6 d and did not appear to directly affect Ivr2 expression. In situ analysis showed localized activity and Ivr2 mRNA for soluble invertase at sites of phloem-unloading and expanding maternal tissues (greatest in terminal vascular zones and nearby cells of pericarp, pedicel, and basal nucellus). This early pattern of maternal invertase localization is clearly distinct from the well-characterized association of insoluble invertase with the basal endosperm later in development. This localization, the shifts in endogenous hexose to sucrose environment, and the distinct timing of soluble and insoluble invertase expression during development and stress collectively indicate a key role and critical sensitivity of the Ivr2 soluble invertase gene during the early, abortion-susceptible phase of development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036801555

We tested three possible explanations for this movement. Our results showed that (1) this movement is unlikely to be a mechanism to attract pollinators or enhance pollen output, because no pollinator preference was observed between erect and pendulous flowers and we found no buzz-pollination in this species; (2) hand self-pollination yielded higher seed set than open pollination in the field, but spontaneous selfing rarely occurred. Among open-pollinated flowers, seed set was depressed by emasculation, indicating that in the presence of insects, self-pollen provided reproductive assurance in this protogynous and self-compatible species. However, the change in flower orientation cannot be explained as reproductive assurance in that even self-pollination largely depended on pollinator visits rather than gravity. (3) A pollen germination experiment indicated that pollen damage by water is serious in this species. We deduced that the bending of the flower stalk during anthesis was to avoid rain damage to pollen grains in this species. During the 3-6 d period of pollen presentation, the petals elongated and were covered with unwettable hairs. Together with flower stalk movement, this was enough to protect the organs inside the flower from rain.

I tested this hypothesis using Anacamptis morio, an orchid that does not reward its pollinators. Supplementation of inflorescences with artificial nectar did not result in an increase in fruit set on supplemented inflorescences compared to control inflorescences and tended to reduce pollinia removal. Supplementation resulted in reduced fruit quality, but there was no evidence that this was as a result of inbreeding depression. Behavioral experiments showed that pollinating bumble bees, as predicted, visited more flowers on supplemented inflorescences. Bumble bees also deposited more self-pollen on supplemented inflorescences, but this was marginally significant. Bumble bee queens removed significantly more pollinia from control inflorescences, while Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum workers did not. I conclude that while pollinators behaved as predicted, there was weak evidence that pollinia removal, pollen deposition, and fruit set followed the predictions of the hypothesis.

The commonest type of trichome is uniseriate, two to four-celled, with a clavate or subclavate terminal cell. This type occurs amongst representatives of most sections examined. Other trichomes are bristle-like with tapering or fusiform terminal cells, whereas representatives of section Polystachya have uniseriate, moniliform trichomes that fragment with the formation of rounded or elliptical component cells. Most contain protein and, while some contain starch, lipid is invariably absent. The presence of particular types of labellar trichomes does not coincide with variations in vegetative morphology. Thus, current taxonomic treatment of the genus indicates that trichome types, with perhaps the sole exception of moniliform, pseudopollen-forming hairs found in section Polystachya only, have limited taxonomic value. However, the remarkable similarity between pseudopollen-forming hairs of Polystachya and those of the Neotropical genus Maxillaria in terms of morphology, cellular dimensions and food content indicates that pseudopollen may have arisen several times and evolved in response to similar pollinator pressures. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Histochemistry; Low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy; Pollination; Taxonomy; Trichomes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036800740

In the middle Albian, structural and landscape modification of the region resulted in its subdividing into several floristic-palaeogeographic subregions. Latest Albian and Late Cretaceous floras of coastal plains of North-eastern Asia and Alaska were dominated by angiosperms, whereas within the Asiatic continental interior depressions and the highlands of the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanogenic belt angiosperm-dominated floras coexisted with floras dominated by ferns and gymnosperms. The observed phenomenon can be explained by the early angiosperm ability to colonise disturbed coastal plain environments due to their abbreviated reproductive cycle and generalised methods of pollination and seed dispersal. In North-eastern Asia and Alaska the first angiosperm remains were found in deposits of an alluvial-deltaic origin. During the early-middle Albian these plants probably occupied disturbed near-channel environments. Within the coastal plains and lowlands of the North Pacific Region, repeating transgressions and regressions and lateral river channel migration constantly disturbed environments and provided fresh sedimentary surfaces that were colonised by angiosperms more readily than by other plants. Climatic fluctuations and proximal volcanic eruptions probably contributed to the formation of habitats favourable for early angiosperms. Angiosperm-rich plant communities gradually invaded the Asiatic continental interiors along river valleys and other disturbed habitats and replaced previous fern-conifer-dominated mature climax vegetation. The data presented here do not support the hypothesis of the initial dispersal of early Cretaceous angiosperms along mountain ranges bur support the hypothesis of angiosperm dispersal around coastal margins and into continental interiors along disturbed river habitats. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

An alternative to solve this problem is to use the opaque-2 gene, which improves the level of these amino acids, but has negative pleiotropic effects on agronomic characters. A phenotypic recurrent selection scheme was carried out in two non-opaque maize populations to verify the possibility of improving their protein quality without using this gene. Four cycles were completed and a 20% selection intensity for tryptophan content in the kernels was used in two populations, IG-1 and IG-2. The original and the four-cycle populations were evaluated in three locations for agronomic traits. For protein and tryptophan content, a separated trial was carried out because plants of the plots were hand-pollinated. No increase in tryptophan content was observed in the IG-2 population, whereas IG-1 presented a small increase (0.70% per cycle). The ratio tryptophan/protein increased 1.26% per cycle in IG-1 and the protein content did not increase in both populations. The ESALQ-VD2-opaque check was superior in relation to both populations for protein quality, as expected, even after completion of four selection cycles. The kernel yield (2.5% per cycle) prolificacy, plant and ear heights, decreased with selection cycles, as a correlated response to selection. Phenotypic recurrent selection in non-opaque maize was not able to increase, at reasonable rates, the protein quality of maize kernels. © 2002, Scientia Agricola.

The only way to evaluate the performance of a plant line is by greenhouse and field trials over several years on different locations. In this paper, an in vitro physiological method is described that allows prediction of the yield vigour (amount of seeds ha-1) of hybrids and open-pollinating varieties of Brassica napus. The assay relates the vigour of a B. napus line or a hybrid to, first, the capacity of cultured hypocotyl explants to reduce 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), and second, to the sensitivity of this TTC-reducing capacity to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), an active analogue of salicylic acid. Vigorous lines have a higher capacity to reduce TTC than less performing lines. TTC is reduced by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases and the efficiency of the formazan formation depends on the activity of cytochrome oxidase. The amount of TTC that is reduced in a certain time reflects the respiration rate. ASA, on the other hand, lowers the TTC-reducing capacity of the most vigorous lines, and enhances the TTC-reducing capacity of the less performing lines. The central role of salicylic acid in plant defence responses and respiration may explain the influence of ASA on the TTC-reducing capacity. From the results, it can also be concluded that the yield potential in B. napus is already present from the seedling stage onwards and persists until seed setting. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

(Passifloraceae) is native to the southern United States and common in old fields and roadsides. This herbaceous, perennial vine has hermaphroditic flowers yet is self-incompatible. Large bees pollinate these flowers that produce fruits that may be eaten by mammals. Although the mode of sexual reproduction suggests the potential for long distance dispersal of genes, this species also displays extensive vegetative reproduction from rhizomes. Vegetative reproduction may reduce the amount of genetic variation within a population and increase differentiation among populations. We report on the macrogeographic allozymic variation within P. incarnata. Plants were collected from three regions in South Carolina (SC) and Georgia (GA). Genetic data were collected from nine polymorphic loci with starch gel electrophoresis of allozymes. In our sample of 168 plants from SC and GA, we observed 82 different multilocus genotypes. Plants with the same multilocus genotype were collected within and among regions. Genetic data indicated that there was little genetic differentiation among regions. These data suggest that there is extensive long distance transport of genes and that the species may rely heavily on sexual reproduction to establish new habitat.",Allozyme variation; Clonal; Gene flow; Passiflora incarnata; Perennial vine; Vegetative reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036824925

Haplostachys and Phyllostegia have flowers associated with insect pollination, whereas Stenogyne has flowers typical of bird pollination. The three genera had been thought to be closely related to East Asian members of Lamioideae tribe Prasieae because of the fleshy nutlets borne by Phyllostegia and Stenogyne. We evaluated the origins of the Hawaiian mints using phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from the plastid rbcL and trnL intron loci and the nuclear ribosomal 5S nontranscribed spacer. The Hawaiian genera were found to be monophyletic but deeply nested inside another lamioid genus, Stachys. In particular, they were found to be most closely related to a group of temperate North American Stachys from the Pacific coast, suggesting that the Hawaiian mints derived from a single colonization event from western North America to the Hawaiian Islands. Furthermore, Stachys, which contains amphiatlantic and transberingian clades, was found to be polyphyletic, with some species more closely related to Gomphostemma, Phlomidoschema, Prasium, and Sideritis than to other species of Stachys. Based on chromosomal evidence and our phylogenetic analyses, we hypothesize that the Hawaiian mints may be polyploid hybrids whose reticulate genomes predate the Hawaiian dispersal event and are derived from Stachys lineages with flowers exhibiting insect- vs. bird-pollination characteristics. Thus, the Hawaiian endemic mints may provide yet another insular system for the combined study of polyploidy, hybrid cladogenesis, and adaptive radiation.",5S-NTS; Biogeography; Haplostachys; Hawaii; Lamiaceae; Phyllostegia; Phylogeny; rbcL; Stachys; Stenogyne; trnL,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036802358

Genes encoding CHS constitute a multigene family in which the copy number varies among plant species and functional divergence appears to have occurred repeatedly. Plants of the Dendranthema genus have white, yellow, and pink flowers, exhibiting considerable variation in flower color. In this article, 18 CHS genes from six Dendranthema species were sequenced. Two of them were found to be pseudogenes. The functional Dendranthema CHS genes formed three well-supported subfamilies: SF1, SF2, and SF3. The inferred phylogeny of the CHS genes of Dendranthema and Gerbera suggests that those genes originated as a result of duplications before divergence of these two genera, and the function of Dendranthema CHS genes have diverged in a similar fashion to the Gerbera CHS genes; i.e., the genes of SF1 and SF3 code for typical CHS enzymes expressed during different stages of development, whereas the genes of SF2 code for another enzyme that is different from CHS in substrate specificity and reaction. Relative rate tests revealed that the Dendranthema CHS genes significantly deviated from clocklike evolution at nonsynonymous sites. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the nonsynonymous-synonymous (? = dN/dS) rate ratio for the lineage ancestral to SF2 was much higher than for other lineages, with some sites having a ratio well above one.

In the control, only 11% of haploids produced selfed kernels owing to spontaneous chromosome doubling. A strong genotypic effect on the occurrence of fertile sectors after the treatment was observed.

Its leafy production and rapid regrowth have made it a major grass species for pasturing beef animals in this region. Because relatively little breeding work has been done on this species, there is little information on its breeding behaviour. The main objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters and assess breeding methodologies for meadow bromegrass. Forty half-sib (polycross and open-pollinated) and full-sib (selfed) progenies were evaluated for dry matter and seed yield, fertility index, harvest index, plant height, plant spread, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre. Genetic variation for seed yield, harvest index, and plant height was significant in the open-pollinated and selfed tests. Genetic variation estimates for dry matter yield were negative (polycross), not significant (open-pollinated), or significant (selfed). Estimates of genetic variation for quality traits were not significant, except for acid detergent fibre (selfed). Correlations among characters indicated that it is possible to simultaneously improve seed and forage yield. Rankings of progenies by the half-sib tests for forage and seed yield were not altered by the use of the synthetic parental value (SVi), which includes information from selfed progeny. The polycross progeny test did not discriminate parents as well as the open-pollinated and selfed tests; this may have been a result of non-random pollination in the polycross. Correlation among the progeny tests, showed that open-pollinated and selfed progeny tests agreed for all characters, except for harvest index, while correlation between polycross and selfed tests were significant for six characters but not dry matter yield, and acid and neutral detergent fibres. The most dissimilar tests were polycross and open-pollinated, with significant correlations found only for fertility index, height, spread and neutral detergent fibre. It was concluded that there was significant variation and moderate heritability for most traits in the meadow, bromegrass populations evaluated, and that the open-pollinated progeny test is the method of choice for selecting parents for synthetics of this species.",Bromus riparius; Genetic variation; Heritability; Progeny testing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036808395

We also examined whether habitat configuration affected the distribution of species with different life history attributes. 4 All ground layer plant species at 81 sites were recorded, and distribution patterns of 57 species were tested against seed mass, seed number, presence of a seed bank, plant height, life span, mode of pollination, dispersal mode and habitat preference. 5 Habitat quality, especially pH, was more important for the incidence of species than habitat configuration with patch area and isolation significantly affecting only 11 and four species, respectively. Species favoured by larger area were also disadvantaged by greater isolation. 6 The importance of habitat configuration to a species varied with life history.

We measured seed production of 12 (1998) and 14 (1999) populations, and we explored the relationships of seed production to the number of flowering plants (population size) and to the surrounding landscape condition (landscape type). We discriminated between two landscape types, isolated and continuous, to describe the quantity and distribution of forests around T. camschatcense populations. Population size may be correlated with attractiveness to pollinators and the availability of compatible mates, whereas landscape condition can affect the abundance of pollinators. The number of seeds per flower was related to population size in 1999, but not in 1998. In both years, small populations of <50 flowering plants produced few seeds. Although the effect of landscape type was not significant, continuous populations with abundant forest series in their neighborhood tended to produce a higher number of seeds than isolated populations located in small, isolated forest. We attribute the decrease in seed production to pollen limitation because the stigmatic pollen load had a positive relationship to seed production and addition of pollen by hand increased seed production. Variation in population structure (four stage classes) among populations was better explained by population size than number of seeds produced, suggesting the relative importance of population size for the demography of T. camschatcense. Larger populations had a higher proportion of seedlings, possibly because large populations had fewer edge effects, which reduce seedling recruitment and survival. Small populations with 220 flowering plants or less showed almost no seedling recruitment. The data on seed production and population structure suggest that continuous populations with at least 1000 flowering plants may be required to avoid the effects of fragmentation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036795402

This paper analyzes spatial and temporal variation in microgametophyte populations (= number of pollen tubes per style) for the winter-flowering, perennial herb Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae), based on data from 29 populations in three regions of the Iberian Peninsula collected over two consecutive years. Mean size of microgametophyte populations varied significantly at a wide range of spatial scales, including among regions, among populations within regions, among individual plants within populations, among flowers of the same plant, and among pistils of the same flower (H. foetidus flowers are apocarpous). Differences between regions were quantitatively negligible. Differences between populations in the same region were moderate to low, and their sign and magnitude were inconsistent between years. Roughly half of total variance in microgametophyte numbers was accounted for by variation within individual plants, and the largest part of this component was due to differences between the pistils of the same flower. These results reveal extreme spatial fine-graininess and marked stochasticity in the spatial variation of H. foetidus microgametophyte populations and suggest that opportunities for consistent selection on male gametophyte competitive ability are probably negligible in this species.",Gametophyte competition; Geographical variation; Helleborus foetidus; Microgametophyte populations; Pollen limitation; Pollen tube numbers; Ranunculaceae; Winter flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036800872

Caixa Postal 6109, CEP 13083-970 Campinas, SP, Brazil","The pollination biology of Sauroglossum elatum Lindl (Orchidaceae: Spiranthinae) was studied in the State of São Paulo, south-eastern Brazil. This orchid is protandrous and almost fully self-compatible, but pollinator-dependent. Thus, pollinators are required for the plants to set fruits and seeds. The flowers are pollinated by moths of the family Noctuidae. Pollinia are dislodged when the moths probe flowers in the male phase. At this stage the stigmatic surface is inaccessible, so that the flowers can act only as pollen-donors. Flowers in the female phase present their stigmatic surfaces well exposed and dry viscidia; at this stage the flowers act as pollen receivers. Pollinarium-bearing moths, when visiting a flower in the female phase, will brush the pollinarium against the stigmatic surface, thus effecting the pollination. Moth-pollination is reported here for the first time for the orchid subtribe Spiranthinae. Protandry also occurs in a few additional Brazilian Spiranthinae. Based on the evidence presented in this work, protandry in Spiranthinae is not necessarily linked to bumblebee pollination, as currently accepted. It is suggested that the occurrence of protandry in Spiranthinae and in the closely related subtribes Prescottinae and Goodyerinae may also be a feature encompassing ecological and phylogenetic implications. Anecdotal ex-situ observations are briefly discussed. Cultivated specimens were actively visited by Tetragonisca angustula (Meliponini) bees. which broke the pollinaria, collected the pollen and eventually performed pollination by leaving small fragments of the pollinia on the stigmatic surface. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Breeding system; Moths; Orchids; Pollination mechanism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036036071

Field observations of three species: Z. natalensis, Z. elongata and Z. pulvinata, revealed that their flowers are pollinated shortly after dusk by hawkmoths. Further observations showed that Z. microsiphon, the sole species to have flowers that open only during the day, is pollinated exclusively by long-proboscid flies belonging to the family Nemestrinidae. A phylogenetic analysis of Z. sect. Nycterinia based on morphological characters indicates that Z. microsiphon evolved within a clade of night-flowering species. The shift from hawkmoth to long-proboscid fly pollination in Zaluzianskya was probably facilitated because long corolla tubes, white petals and dilute nectar in hawkmoth-pollinated flowers are pre-adaptations for pollination by long-proboscid flies. However, the autapomorphic features of Z. microsiphon, such as zygomorphy, diurnal flower anthesis and lack of scent, can be regarded as adaptations for long-proboscid fly pollination.

All were protogynous. Stigmas were receptive and had pollen deposited on them 2 days before anther dehiscence. The period of anthesis in the three bamboos was 3 days. Individual pollen grains of the three species were similar in size (30-40 ?m in diameter) and had features typical of wind-pollinated plants. The ratios of pollen to ovules (p/o ratio) in P. nidularia, P. heteroclada and P. nuda were 6500, 12 700 and 33 000, respectively. Mean pollen loads on each flower (one ovule) of these three species were 7.3, 8.8 and 9.4 grains, respectively. Pollen transfer in P. heteroclada and P. nuda depended on wind, and no flower visitors were seen in the field. However, in P. nidularia, Apis cerana Fab. was a frequent pollen collector observed from 1200 to 1330 h. The visits undertaken by thousands of honeybees resulted in a large number of pollen grains being released from the anthers in a short time (10-15 min) in one day, which accelerated and synchronized the release of pollen from the anthers that seemed to enhance the chance of pollination. Given that honeybees played an indirect role in pollen transfer this could partly explain the low p/o ratio in P. nidularia.

The serine esterase-specific inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate was used as a probe in a tritiated form, [3H]-DIPF, to determine the number and diversity of serine esterases in crude protein extracts from pollen and stigma. Seven serine esterases were identified in pollen and at least seven serine esterases were identified in stigma. The most abundant enzymes had molecular weights of 30-50 kDa. In the pollen extract a serine esterase was detected with the same molecular weight, 22 kDa, as an esterase previously shown to be a cutinase. Only one serine esterase (40 kDa) appeared to be shared between pollen and stigma extracts. Butyrate esterase activity in pollen and stigma extracts was assayed using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNB), an ester substrate frequently used in 'cutinase' assays. Total PNBase activity in pollen and stigma extracts was shown to be significantly reduced by the serine esterase inhibitors DIPF and ebelactone B. When DIPF and ebelactone B were applied to stigmas prior to pollination, pollen germination was not significantly affected but, at the highest inhibitor concentrations, up to 70% of germinating pollen tubes failed to penetrate the stigma surface. These data demonstrate that serine esterases, most probably cutinase(s), are required for pollen tube penetration of the dry cuticularised Brassica stigma.",Brassica; Cutinase; Pollen; Pollen tube penetration; Serine esterase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036371635

Certain metabolite classes also function in beneficial interactions with other organisms. For example, anthocyanin pigments and terpenoid essential oils have key roles in attraction of flower pollinators. Secondary metabolites also have direct uses for man. Flavonoids and terpenoids for example have health-promoting activities as food ingredients, and several alkaloids have pharmacological activities. Controlled transcription of biosynthetic genes is one major mechanism regulating secondary metabolite production in plant cells. Several transcription factors involved in the regulation of metabolic pathway genes have been isolated and studied. There are indications that transcription factor activity itself is regulated by internal or external signals leading to controlled responses.

The success of producing interspecific hybrids between species of different subgenera makes possible the improvement of Alliums by widespread crossing. The morphological characteristics of all hybrid plants were investigated, but only A. chinense x A. giganteum was so weak that we could not leave it alive in the field. Most morphological characteristics of the hybrid plants were intermediate between their parental plants. However, some characteristics represented hybrid vigor. Flowering time of the hybrid plants was intermediate between their parents. However, it was close to the flowering time of the male parents except for A. chinense x A. schubertii.

We investigated the causes of low seed set in four populations of Liriodendron chinense (Magnoliaceae), an insect-pollinated endangered tree endemic to southern China, over 2-3 years. One pistil potentially produces two ovules. The number of pistils per flower varies among populations, but in three of the four populations the variation in a given population was not significantly different among years. Overall, populations with higher pistil numbers tend to set more seeds per flower, but a positive correlation between pistil numbers and seed production per flower was observed in only one of the four populations. The numbers of pollen grains deposited per stigma varied from 0 to 60. The proportion of pollinated stigmas per flower ranged from 44% to 88% among populations and years. The numbers of pollen grains deposited per stigma and the percentages of pollinated stigmas were significantly different between populations, and two populations showed significant differences between years. A positive correlation between stigmatic pollen load and seed set was sought in ten population-by-year combinations but, in a given population, high stigmatic pollen loads did not always result in high seed set. Examination of pollen deposition, pistil and seed production over several sites and years showed that in addition to pollination, other factors such as resource or genetic loads were likely to limit the (lower than 10%) seed set in L. chinense. It appears that small, isolated populations experience severe pollination limitation; one population studied had seed/ovule ratios of 0.84% and 1.88% in 1995 and 1996. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Endangered plant; Pistil production; Pollinator limitation; Reproductive success; Seed/ovule ratio; Stigmatic pollen loads,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036712917

Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks, especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant-pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical-tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (I) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: ln I = 0.575 + 0.61 ln M; R2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible, decreased exponentially with species richness, the sum of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[-0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland (&gt;1500 m elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and tropical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species, A:P, compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction build-up as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.",Food web; Geographic variation; Insects; Interaction-web connectance; Mutualism; Networks; Plant-animal interaction; Pollination; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001380276

Nonrewarding species typically suffer from low rates of pollination and fruit set, yet they appear frequently in the Orchidaceae. In order to understand the dynamics of pollination and fruit set in nonrewarding orchids and to evaluate whether a conservation strategy for C. fasciculatum should include managing for pollinator service, we evaluated factors influencing reproductive success in three widely separated populations. The percentage of open-pollinated flowers maturing fruit varied greatly among populations, equaling 69% in Oregon, 29% in Idaho, and 18% in Colorado. These values are greater than is typical for a nonrewarding orchid. Thus, managing for pollinator service may be unnecessary, especially in the Oregon population. Like many nonrewarding orchids, the species appears to have a self-compatible breeding system; fruit set did not differ between flowers receiving self pollen and flowers receiving cross pollen (Z = 0.81, P > 0.1). Withinseason fruit set may be pollen limited, however, since supplemental hand pollination with cross pollen significantly increased fruit production by ca. 4.5 times in Colorado and 1.5 times in Idaho in comparison with open pollination. Even so, many pollinated flowers failed to mature fruit. Pollen tube growth was studied using fluorescence microscopy, and the percentage of pistils with germinated pollen at the end of the flowering season was found to exceed significantly final fruit set by a rate of approximately two in both Idaho and Colorado.",Fruit set; Orchidaceae; Pollen limitation; Pollen tube; Self-compatible,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036721341

We explore the possible trajectories that a plant-pollinator system describes under certain bound conditions determined by a whole complex of attractiveness and reward scores. Such scores represent genetic relations between two diallelic loci assumed to control both traits. To see how the system would behave over time we created eight different scenarios, differing in the orientation they impose on the system. Half of these situations are of a reinforcing type (indicating a similar input both for attractiveness and rewards) and the remaining ones are conflicting (indicating opposite inputs). A numerical simulation was carried over seventy-five generations starting from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium populations. We detected some general behavioral patterns in the final structure of frequencies. One of these may be viewed as a resilient type of structure (i.e., without memory of the initial population frequencies) which we hypothesize, may reflect the typical attraction-reward structure generally observed in nature. Another pattern is characterized by a pronounced lose of heterozygotes in the final structure, caused by the fixation of the most attractive phenotypes at the expense of the least attracting ones, independently of the pollinator genotype.",Ecological interactions; Genetic models; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347303195

The model requires specification of three elements: (1) the paternity that originates from a single flower, the paternity shadow; (2) the mean number of flowers that pollinators visit during stays in the sink population, the residence; (3) the proportion of pollinators arriving at the sink that carry pollen from the source population. Provided that pollinators visit enough flowers in the sink to exhaust the paternity shadows from the source, the general results are that gene flow is inversely proportional to the mean pollinator residence in the sink population, and is proportional to the fraction of pollinators arriving with pollen from the source. These results are used to propose explanations for two of the widely observed patterns in gene flow among plant populations. Numerical solutions to the model are derived using experimentally determined values of elements (1) and (2) that represent bumblebees, Bombus spp., visiting agricultural fields of oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. In B. napus, the paternity shadow attenuates rapidly over approximately 20 recipient flowers. Mean bumblebee residences in the fields studied varied between 490 and 720 flowers. In the absence of a direct measurement of element (3), we calculated the maximum level of bumblebee-mediated gene flow by assuming that all bees arrived at the sink saturated with pollen from extrinsic sources. In this case, the model predicts that bumblebee-mediated gene flow accounted for between 0.1% and 0.5% of the progeny in the agricultural fields studied. A likelihood analysis of our observations is unable to reveal convincingly the proportion of bees arriving at the sink via a source population, but the literature suggests that bumblebees have high site fidelity, which implies that bee-mediated gene flow may be substantially less than our estimated maximum. We consider the role of various factors, including wind pollination, in accounting for the differences between the model's predictions and the generally higher levels of gene flow observed in previous studies of oilseed rape.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036744202

However, colonies placed inside sweet pepper greenhouses deteriorate quickly, resulting in reduced pollination activity and eventually need for replacement. We tested whether honey bee colonies kept in enclosures of sweet pepper suffer from nutritional deficiencies by following their food reserves and brood production. In both years of the study, colonies not supplemented with a protein diet deteriorated during the 68-day (1999) and 88-day (2000) duration of the study. Colonies that were given pollen supplements (500 g per week) maintained a high level of brood production. Levels of sealed brood provided the most informative measure of the efficacy of the supplementary feedings. As the winter progresses, sweet pepper flowers produce fewer pollen grains and with reduced viability, and thus greater pollinator activity is needed. We show that by feeding pollen supplements, colonies maintained in enclosures of sweet pepper over the long flowering period of the crop, can sustain stable levels of brood production, which are needed for achieving efficient pollination.",Apis mellifera; Brood; Capsicum annuum; Enclosures; Greenhouse; Honey bees; Pollen supplement; Pollination; Sweet pepper,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036738356

(Balsaminaceae), a species with protandrous flowers. We hypothesized that once robbed, a male-phase flower should switch its sex from male to female because the probability that the flower would receive enough visits to disperse all its pollen is low compared with the probability that the flower would receive enough visits to fertilize its three to five ovules. We assumed that robbery results in a greater reduction in the attractiveness of male-phase flowers relative to female-phase flowers. Field observations supported our hypothesis and its assumptions by demonstrating that natural nectar robbery significantly shortened the duration of male phase. A field experiment in which flowers were experimentally pierced with needles ( = flower piercing) showed that the physical damage to the flower caused by piercing alone shortened the duration of male phase. In both the observational and experimental studies, pierced and unpierced flowers did not differ in individual floral life span. Naturally robbed male-phase flowers contained one-fifth as much nectar as unrobbed male-phase flowers, because they either produced less nectar following robbery or had their nectar more frequently removed by robbers. In contrast, naturally robbed and unrobbed female-phase flowers did not differ significantly in nectar volumes. Naturally robbed male-phase flowers had 1.4 times as much pollen remaining on their anthers as unrobbed male-phase flowers, presumably because they were visited less often and for a shorter duration by pollinators. No significant differences in pollen receipt were observed between naturally robbed and unrobbed female-phase flowers. Our results show that both nectar robbery and flower piercing, and not just rates of pollen removal or seasonal climatic variables, may affect phase duration in dichogamous plants and that any negative effects of nectar robbery and flower piercing on I. capensis plants are likely to occur through male, as opposed to female, function.",Dichogamy; Impatiens capensis; Nectar robbery; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036720918

Matsum. & Nakai]. The rates of pollen depletion for these crops were therefore investigated on plots simulating commercial crop production using a mixed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) and bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) pollinator complex. At anthesis, staminate cucumber, muskmelon, and watermelon flowers contained on average 10539, 11176, and 30739 pollen grains/flower, respectively. At the time flowers closed in the early afternoon (1300 to 1400 HR), only 61% of the total pollen produced had been removed from staminate cucumber flowers, 44% to 62% from muskmelon, and 81% from watermelon flowers. The results suggest that total pollen production in these crops may not necessarily reflect total pollen availability to floral visitors (bees). However, of the total amount of pollen actually removed per flower, >57% occurred during the 2 h following flower anthesis of cucumber and muskmelon, and >77% occurred during the 2 h following flower anthesis of watermelon. Thus, most of the accessible pollen was removed shortly after anthesis, which is when these crops are most receptive to pollination. Nonviable triploid and viable diploid watermelon pollen were removed at similar rates (P = 0.4604). While correlation analyses were not possible for the influence of variable bee abundance on pollen depletion rates, higher bee populations in one year appeared to increase the rate at which pollen grains were removed from staminate flowers.",Citrullus lanatus; Cucumber; Cucumis melo; Cucumis sativus; Muskmelon; Pollen depletion; Watermelon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036727146

In extremely early sweet corn the effect of heterosis on flowering time may be reduced or eliminated due to de velopmental and physiological requirements for vegetative growth before the transition to reproductive phase. The objective of this study was to determine the level of heterosis and the combining ability for flowering time and other agronomic traits in a diallel cross of six very early open-pollinated sweet corn cultivars. The diallel was grown in 1995 and 1996. Hybrids and parents averaged over hybrids differed for silk date, plant height, ear height, 10-ear weight, ear length, and 100-kernel weight but did not differ for row number and ear width. Heterosis for silk date was significant, but the difference between parents and hybrids was very small, 0.5 day. No hybrids were earlier than the earliest parent, and average midparent heterosis was -0.8%. In contrast midparent heterosis was significant and relatively high for 100-kernel weight (10.0%), ear length (12.9%), ear height (8.6%), plant height (9.0%), and 10-ear weight (28.2%). The traits with low heterosis had very high general combining ability/specific combining ability ratios while these ratios were much smaller in traits with high heterosis. Heterosis for many of the traits, including 10-ear weight, was higher than published values. Conversely, heterosis for flowering time was small, compared to other traits in this study and to published values for silk date, indicating that this extremely early germplasm may be at or near the limit for flowering time under the photoperiod and temperatures typical of summer in Madison, Wis.

Peak flowering period lasts longer than a month, from mid-June to the end of July. In contrast to statements in the literature that flowers are protogynous and nutlets remain in their calyx until spring we found a distinct protandry and nutlets being dispersed before mid-September. Various insects from 12 families, but mostly Diptera, frequently visited E. nanum flowers, with flies from the families Anthomyiidae and Muscidae being the predominant visitors. Under optimal conditions (max. solar radiation, min. wind force), visitation rates of 200 simultaneously observed flowers reached 32.5-46.7 insects per hour, i.e. 0.16-0.24 insects per flower per hour. However, the commonly observed Anthomyiidae and Muscidae clearly preferred the white-yellowish flowers of Saxifraga exarata and Saxifraga bryoides which are abundant at E. nanum sites and which are certainly also pollinated by species of these two fly families. The flowers of these Saxifraga species offer plenty of nectar and may compete for pollinators with E. nanum, when they are flowering in its proximity. However, various other insects like Pontia callidice and Psodos sp. (Lepidoptera) as well as Andrena sp. (Hymenoptera) and especially Eristalis tenax and closely related hoverflies showed a higher degree of flower constancy to E. nanum, often flying from a blue Eritrichium cushion to the next and hence causing outcrossing. The five fornices of E. nanum flowers which obstruct the tube containing stamens and nectar, are a feature which differs distinctly from the syndrome of flypollinated flowers with easily accessible nectar. Consequently pollination by flies in E. nanum seems to be caused mainly by the unfavorable ecological conditions at high altitudes, where flies are the most frequent insects. Bagging experiments showed that outcrossing and geitonogamy are the prevailing pollination modes, and autogamy, although possible, plays only a minor role.",Eritrichium; Flies; Outcrossing; Selfing; Visitation rates,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036752410

In this paper we present results of a yearlong study of a bat-flower community in cloud forests on the western slopes of the Ecuadoran Andes. Of eight plant-visiting bat species caught, only Anoura caudifera and A. geoffroyi were carrying pollen. These species of Anoura supplement their diets with insects. Unlike glossophagines in other environments, however, which switch completely to a frugivorous or insectivorous diet during certain seasons, they are nectarivorous year-round and were never found with seeds or fruit pulp in their feces. Of the 13 morphotypes of pollen carried by the bats, 11 were identified to genus and 7 to species. Floral characteristics of all of these plants fit the traditional chiropterophilous syndrome well. Our study represents the first direct evidence of bat pollination for those plants identified to species, including four species of Burmeistera (Campanulaceae), as well as the first record of bat pollination for a plant of the genus Meriania (Melastomataceae). While overlap in the diets of the two Anoura was high, significant differences in visitation frequencies to particular plant species were detected.

Koch, (Pinaceae) were surveyed and the insects' seasonal damage to the FRS was assessed during 1990 on five trees in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Sixteen insect species representing six orders were feeding in these FRS; 10 species were on cones and seeds, while the other six were predators or parasitoids of the cone insects. Eight insect species were new records of feeding within tamarack cones, the most notable being the larch casebearer, Coleophora laricella (Hubner) (Tortricidae). The initial feeding of insects on tamarack FRS started shortly after pollination (27 May) and intensive feeding continued during the next 5 weeks when most of the damage occurred. Many FRS did not show symptoms when the insects were feeding internally, but symptoms became visible as the cones matured. One hundred percent of the cones examined in this 1 year study were damaged, and about only 1% of the 5900 cones dissected had one filled seed. Insects were responsible for a portion of the low filled seed, but lack of pollination also played an important part as there were few pollen cones in 1990. Exposure of larch seeds to -20°C for 12 weeks killed 100% of the overwintering seed chalcid larvae, whereas 98% of the chalcids exposed to 4°C survived. Exposure of larch seed to extreme cold may be a way to curb shipping live Megastigmus from one region to another. To significantly increase viable seed productivity in tamarack, FRS must be protected from the cone fly maggot, Strobilomyia sp., which appeared to cause a high incidence of damage to cones and seeds, as well as from the various Lepidopterans.

Pollen loads consisting of pollen from two donors showed significantly lower germination than single-donor pollinations. This reduction occurred even when pollen from different sources was deposited in separate clumps without direct contact between individual grains. Deposition patterns also influenced pollen grain germination. Pollen germination was found to decrease as the degree of contact between the different types of pollen grains increased.

Their somatic chromosome numbers ranged from 2n = 18 to 2n = 23, except for one hyperploid plant with 2n=44. In the BC 3 generation, 64 plants (2n = 19) were generated from 16 BC 2 plants with 2n = 19-23. Each plant with 2n = 19 exhibited both morphological and physiological characteristics diagnostic for the presence of an added chromosome of M. arvensis genome, and showed predominantly the chromosome pairing type of 9II + 1I at metaphase I of PMCs. They were classified into twelve (a-I) types of monosomic chromosome addition lines (MALs) of alloplasmic (M. arvensis) R. sativus carrying M. arvensis cytoplasm by their morphological, physiological and cytogenetical characteristics. The mean of seed setting in the twelve types of MALs ranged from 2.88 grains (f-type) to 0.51 grains (j-type) per pollinated flower when they were backcrossed to R. sativus cv. 'Pink ball'. The transmission rates to the next generation through female gametes ranged from 32.5% (f- and j-types) to 5.5% (h-type) when smaller seeds were selectively grown. The specific characteristics of each type of MALs were transmitted from the BC 3 generation to the BC 4 and BC 5 ones without any modification. The MALs of the distinctive twelve types were also identified using RAPD markers in the BC 5 generation. Pollen fertility of the twelve types of MALs ranged from 85.6% (c-type) to 3.4% (I-type), although four types (g-, h-, i- and j-types) exhibited complete male sterility. Furthermore, alloplasmic (M. arvensis) R. sativus plants (2n = 18) which were derived from male fertile MALs showed complete male sterility. The twelve types of MALs produced in this study should be useful materials to determine the localization of genes for agronomic traits on the individual chromosome of M. arvensis and the alloplasmic (M. arvensis) R. sativus should also be a useful material for the development of a new cytoplasmic male sterility system in R. sativus.",Alloplasmic (M. arvensis) R. sativus; Male sterility; Monosomic chromosome addition lines (MALs); Moricandia arvensis; Raphanus sativus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036741735

Owing to this deficiency, life history traits such as geographic range, pollination vector and seed dispersal capability, which significantly affect gene flow and thus the distribution of genetic variability, were used to evaluate the genetic resources in 23 Norwegian native forest tree species. Based on the combination of life history traits the species' genetic resources were classified either as viable, potentially vulnerable or vulnerable, assuming a decrease in within-population variability in this sequence. Twelve widely distributed species with generally effective dispersal of pollen and seeds were considered viable (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Juniperus communis, Betula pubescens, B. pendula, Alnus incana, A. glutinosa, Salix caprea, Populus tremula, Corylus avellana, Sorbus aucuparia, Prunus padus) and have as such no particular conservation needs. Effective seed dispersal of these species, as inferred from post-glacial migration rates, may be partly responsible for their generally early post-glacial appearance, and may, in combination with the wide ranges and relatively large evolutionary potential, indicate that viable species are best able to cope with climatic change. Among species with restricted ranges and more limited gene flow eight were considered potentially vulnerable (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer platanoides, Taxus baccatu, Ilex aquifolium, Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra) and three were considered vulnerable (Tilia cordata, Malus sylvestris, P. avium). Application of different intensities of a multiple population breeding system (MPBS) is considered the most appropriate mode of conserving genetic resources in these species.",Conservation; Forest trees; Genetic resources; Global warming; Life history traits; Multiple population breeding system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036726950

Various species may disappear before their importance for regional agricultural productivity and ecosystem maintenance is known. In order to assess their assemblage as visitors of cucurbit crops, we sampled more than 2000 bee specimens on fourteen fields of pumpkin, cucumber, melon and watermelon from five localities between 1995 and 1997; sample units consisted of all bees collected by net sweeping in a given field during 25-30 accumulated hours on separate days. The fourteen samples comprised bees of six families, 29 genera and 58 species. Composition per sample ranged between 10 and 27 species and abundance between 28 and 444 individuals. Seven species (six genera) of Apidae, Anthophoridae and Halictidae comprised around 80% of all the individuals collected. Yet, diversity measures indicated intermediate to high evenness in most sampled bee assemblages, i.e. despite the frequent abundance of some species of Augochlora, Partamona, Ceratina, Trigona or Peponapis, other bee visitors were also relatively important, particularly in small samples. Individual samples of pumpkin bee visitors had significantly different evenness among themselves and to other cucurbit crops. The percent similarity and number of shared species among the fourteen samples were both usually low; lumping data per crop and locality showed, however, higher evenness and more common species than individual samples.

In comparison with the self-pollinated or legitimate-pollinated embryo, interspecific hybrid embryos showed various post-fertilization ultrastructural abnormal phenomena such as failure of endosperm development, vacuolated embryo cells with degenerated endosperm, degeneration of embryo, endosperm and suspensor cells. Both endosperm and suspensor cells were degenerated. Their degeneration may lead to the loss of normal endosperm nourishing and failure of nutrient transport to the developing embryo and thus may trigger off the observed embryo abortion. Comparatively fewer abnormalities occurred in the hybrid embryo of the cross between F. cymosum and F. esculentum than in that between F. tataricum and F. esculentum. This indicates that the cross combination F. cymosum × F. esculentum may be considered as a breeding material in buckwheat hybridization. The deficiency and degeneration of endosperm that were observed at 2 to 3 DAP may lead to the degradation of hybrid embryo.

The developing pollen mother cells were observed after the second meiotic division in the diploids with and without the giant pollen grains. Tetraploid progeny production in the crosses was obviously related to the giant pollen grains. Tetraploid F1 progenies were produced in the crosses by using pollen from diploid plants that produce giant pollen; no seed was obtained in the crosses by using pollen from diploids, which produce no giant pollen. More seeds were obtained when sieved giant pollen grains were used for the crosses than when non-sieved pollen grains with giant pollen were used, whereas no seed was obtained in the crosses using only normal-size pollen grains from diploids. Thirteen to 27% of pollen mother cells in the diploids with giant pollen grains formed pollen dyads or triads after the second meiotic division, whereas few pollen dyads and triads were formed in those without giant pollen grains. These observations suggest that most giant pollen grains in diploid cyclamen are unreduced male gametes. Therefore, the origin of tetraploids derived from 4x × 2x cyclamen crosses is the results of fertilization between an unreduced pollen grain from the diploid plant and a normally reduced egg cell from the tetraploid.

Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food resources and nesting material. We used translocation experiments to establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration t9 analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites and suitable food plants in different habitat types. 2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was 150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration, measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability of 50% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than 250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m. 3. These experiments showed that solitary bees have a rather small foraging range so local habitat structure appears to be of more importance than large-scale landscape structure. All requirements for sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches in landscapes to ensure long-term sustainability of wild bee diversity and their ecological function as pollinators.",Body length; Foraging distance; Habitat structure; Translocation experiments; Trap nests,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036743726

A key issue is whether remnant individuals become reproductively isolated. California Valley oak (Quercus lobata) is a widely distributed, endemic species in California, increasingly jeopardized by anthropogenic changes in biota and land use. We studied pollen movement in a savannah population of Valley oak at Sedgwick Reserve, Santa Barbara County, to estimate effective number of pollen donors (Nep) and average distance of effective pollen movement (?). Using TWOGENER, our recently developed hybrid model of paternity and genetic structure treatments that analyses maternal and progeny multilocus genotypes, we found that current Nep = 3.68 individuals. Based on an average adult density of d = 1.19 stems/ha, we assumed a bivariate normal distribution to model current average pollen dispersal distance (?) and estimated ? = 64.8 m. We then deployed our parameter estimates in spatially explicit models of the Sedgwick population to evaluate the extent to which Nep may have changed, as a consequence of progressive stand thinning between 1944 and 1999. Assuming that pollen dispersal distance has not changed, we estimate Nep was 4.57 individuals in 1944, when stand density was 1.48. Both estimates indicate fewer effective fathers than one might expect for wind-pollinated species and fewer than observed elsewhere. The results presented here provide a basis for further refinements on modelling pollen movement. If the trends continue, then ongoing demographic attrition could further reduce neighbourhood size in Valley oak resulting in increased risk of reproductive failure and genetic isolation.",California Valley oak; Genetic isolation; Pollen flow; Quercus lobata; TWOGENER,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036715246

Two open-pollinated cultivars, Noy Yizre'el (Ha'Ogen type) and TopMark (western U.S. shipper type), were grown at plant densities ranging from 0.5 to 16.0 plants/m2 under commercial conditions. The highest marketable fruit yields were achieved with plant densities of 2 to 4 plants/m2. In contrast, the highest seed yields were obtained at 8 to 12 plants/m2. Seed yield index [seed yield (g)/fruit yield (kg)] was used as a parameter to define seed production efficiency. High seed yield was closely related to high value of the seed yield index. High seed yield indexes resulted from high plant densities (up to 12 plants/m2), at which the crops produced many, but relatively small fruit. In all cases, the seed yield per fruit (seed number and seed size) increased with increasing fruit weight. However, the sum of the seed yield of two small fruit was always greater than the seed yield of one, double-sized fruit. There was a clear exception with extremely small fruit (&lt;500 g), which produced both low seed yields and poor seed quality. A positive relationship was found between fruit size and seed size in both cultivars. Nevertheless, relatively small seeds (25 to 30 mg) extracted from relatively small fruit (500 to 1000 g) showed the best performance in terms of germination and emergence percentages and rates, and in the vegetative development vigor of the seedlings.",Cucumis melo; Germinability; Marketable yield; Seed yield index; Yield quality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036729655

Absence of reward is expected to have a fundamental effect on pollinator visitation patterns. In particular the number of flowers visited per inflorescence is expected to be affected in both unrewarding and co-flowering rewarding species. We used arrays of artificial inflorescences, which could be either rewarding or unrewarding and were differentiated by their colour, to test how many flowers bumblebees visit in each type of inflorescence. The frequency of the two colours was varied, thus modelling the case where different frequencies of both an unrewarding and rewarding species were present in a patch. We found that bumblebees visited more flowers per rewarding inflorescence after they have experienced unrewarding or partially emptied rewarding inflorescences. We used these results to simulate pollen transfer and thus predict selfing rates on rewarding inflorescences. We found these increased when nectar depleted or when there was a greater proportion of unrewarding inflorescences in the patch. Conversely, we found that the number of flowers bumblebees visited on each unrewarding inflorescence did not significantly change through experiments. Selfing rates for unrewarding inflorescences were predicted to depend principally on the number of these inflorescences bumblebees visited rather than on the number of flowers they visit per inflorescence. This was because most visitors to orchids are supposed to be naive, and pollinators that commence foraging carrying no pollen will necessarily self any flower they pollinate on the first inflorescence they visit. Thus the average selfing rate is expected to increase as the sequence of inflorescences visited decreases in length.",Bumblebee behaviour; Deceptive pollination; Geitonogamy; Modelling; Selfing rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036045701

Weed beets pose a serious problem for sugar beet Beta vulgaris crops. Traditionally, the only efficient method of weed control has been manual removal, but the introduction of transgenic herbicide-tolerant sugar beets may provide an alternative solution because non-tolerant weed beets can be destroyed by herbicide. We evaluated the possibility that new, transgenic, weed beets may arise by gene flow between wild and crop plants. 2. In a study area in northern France, weed beets were present in variable densities in sugar beet fields of up to 80 weed beet plants m-2. Weed beets arise from a long-lived seed bank, with seeds germinating from depths of 5 cm or less. In addition, diploid F1 crop-wild hybrids and triploid variety bolters (individuals with a low vernalization requirement) were present in low densities in virtually all sugar beet fields. We found gene flow to be possible between all forms, illustrated by both overlapping flowering periods in the field and successful controlled cross-pollinations. 3. The F1 crop-wild hybrids result from pollination in the seed-production region by wild plants possessing the dominant bolting allele B for flowering without experiencing a period of cold. In the case of a transgene for herbicide tolerance incorporated into male-sterile seed-bearer plants, such hybrids will contain both the herbicide-tolerance and the bolting allele. Contamination of the fields by transgenic weed beets will be the result unless bolters are removed manually. The same will apply in the case of a cytoplasmically inherited transgene. 4. Incorporation of the transgene into the pollinator plants will prevent the immediate formation of transgenic weed beets. However, in sugar beet fields, variety bolters may successfully cross-pollinate with weed beets in neighbouring fields. The use of diploid pollinator plants instead of tetraploids will considerably enhance gene flow towards wild beets, and is not, therefore, an attractive option. 5. In conclusion, the appearance of transgenic weed beets is possible but can best be retarded if the transgene for herbicide tolerance is incorporated into the tetraploid pollinator breeding line.",Beta vulgaris; Biosafety; Gene flow; Genetically modified organisms; Population dynamics; Seed bank,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036056510

Patterns of pollinator responses to variation in floral display size have significance for pollen flow among plants. Here we test a theoretical model for explaining such patterns by simultaneously assessing bumble bee behaviour and nectar availability in two native stands of Cirsium purpuratum with different spatial densities. 2. A bumble bee (Bombus diversus) foraging on a plant remembered and avoided only one or two flower heads that it had probed before, so that the flower-head revisitation rate increased as it stayed longer on a plant. Moreover, the revisitation rate increased less rapidly on larger displays. 3. The number of heads probed per plant increased less than proportionally with display size, and this increase was smaller at higher plant density. This pattern is consistent with our expectation that a bee leaves a plant when the cost of flower-head revisitation exceeds that of interplant movement. However, bees left plants slightly earlier than predicted. 4. As predicted, the visitation rate of bees per plant showed a decelerated increase with floral display size, and this increase was greater at higher plant density. 5. As a result of these complementary changes in the number of heads probed per plant and visitation rate per plant across plant densities, nectar rewards per head were equalized among displays (an ideal free distribution was achieved).",Bombus; Floral display size; Flower revisitation; Foraging behaviour; Ideal free distribution; Plant-pollinator interaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036342370

On Santa Cruz Island capitula of S. pedunculata were equipped with fake ray florets while others were untouched. On Isabela Island ray florets were removed on half of the capitula of S. affinis. In S. affinis rayed capitula received more pollinators and more pollen, which resulted in a significantly higher embryo production. In S. pedunculata no effect on embryo production was found.

The first included three indigenous populations with a profile of constituents similar to that observed in their cultivated representatives, suggesting a high chemical heritability. In the second group, with four populations, the major chemical constituents exhibited higher differences between the natural populations and their cultivated representatives, suggesting a lower heritability. Cluster analysis within the first group revealed a remarkable similarity between the chemical composition of the oleoresins from plants in nature, and that of their cultivated representatives, suggesting two different chemotypes: a trans-anethole chemotype, represented by the populations of the Negev desert and of the northern coastal plane, and an estragole dominated chemotype of a northeastern population of Mt. Dov. It is conjectured that northwestern winds, during the flowering season (July-October) restrict free westwards movement of pollinators. As a result, panmictic pollination is adversely affected, enhancing isolation and genetic differentiation. In populations of lower heritability, chemical response to cultivation was variable. In two mountainous populations (Mt. Tayyasim and Mt. Meron) cultivation had reduced trans-anethole, whereas in two other populations of lower elevations (Ramat-ha'Sharon and Ma'alot-Tarshicha), cultivation had decreased the relative content of estragole and elevated that of trans-anethole.

Large inflorescences are most attractive to pollinators, but also promote many flower visits during a single plant visit, which may increase setting and decrease pollen export. A plant might avoid the negative consequences of attractiveness through modification of the floral display to promote fewer flower visits, while retaining attractiveness. This report shows that increasing only the variance in nectar volume per flower results in fewer flower visits per inflorescence by wild hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) and captive bumble bees (Bombus flavifrons) foraging on artificial inflorescences. Inflorescences were either constant (all flowers contained the same nectar volume) or variable (half the flowers were empty, the other half contained twice as much nectar as in the constant flowers). Both types of inflorescence were simultaneously available to foragers. Risk-averse foraging behaviour was expressed as a patch departure preference: birds and bees visited fewer flowers on variable inflorescences, and this preference was expressed when resource variability could be determined only by concurrent sampling. When variance treatments were clearly labelled with colour and offered to hummingbirds, the departure effect was maintained; however, when preference was measured by inflorescence choice, birds did not consistently prefer to visit constant inflorescences. The reduced visitation lengths on variable inflorescences by both birds and bees documented in this study imply that variance in nectar production rates within inflorescences may represent an adaptive trait to avoid the costs of geitonogamy.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036343003

In order to explain why, in the first 3 weeks, the water import rate of me fruit is lower than predicted by this regression, a model of water flow through the pedicel and a model of water import based on the potential of water entering the fruit and calyx transpiration were formulated. Using data sets available in the literature, these models predict a water potential drop along the pedicel that decreases sharply during the first 3 weeks, while the calculated hydraulic conductivity of the pedicel phloem, which is presumed to be the main pathway of the water imported in the tomato fruit, increases sharply in the lower range of values known for plant phloem conductivity. These models also predict an increase in water import into young fruit when calyx transpiration is decreased, which is consistent with data from the literature. In order to explain the increasing pedicel phloem conductivity, a model of water flow in the pedicel sieve tubes was formulated based on the literature data for the fruit stalk of Lupinus albus. It was suggested that the conductivity might increase because of the development of pores in the sieve plates. Using this hypothesis, the increase in pore radius values within an acceptable range was calculated. This study shows that, under a wide range of conditions, water import in young tomato fruit is limited by the low potential of the water entering the fruit due to pedicel resistance and calyx transpiration. It provides a model to predict young tomato fruit expansion and a testable hypothesis, which can be checked by measuring the size of the phloem component in the fruit pedicel.",Growth; Hydraulic conductivity; Lupinus albus; Model; Permeability; Phloem; Pore; Sieve tube,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036331670

The number and abundance of all species of coffee-visiting bees did not show a significant correlation with land-use intensity. The abundance (but not the number of species) of solitary bees increased with land-use intensity, whereas the abundance and number of species of social bees significantly decreased. In a further experiment, abundance and number of trap-nesting species increased with land-use intensity. These results contrast with the common expectation that intensively used agroforestry systems are characterized only by loss of species. Furthermore, they support the idea that many nonpest and beneficial insect species may even profit from agricultural land use. Parasitism and predation of trap-nest inhabitants did not change with land-use intensity, but species diversity (number of enemy species) and ecological function (mortality) were correlated.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036326439

The inheritance mode of morphological characteristics of utsukushimatsu was studied to preserve the genetic resource of this pine. As previously reported, F1 trees grown from open-pollinated seeds harvested from trees inhabiting the native stand showed two phenotypes: one resembling utsukushimatsu, which produces multiple trunks, and the other resembling normal P. densiflora, which produces one or a few trunks. In the present study, controlled pollination was carried out using F1 and normal P. densiflora trees. Segregation ratios of the two phenotypes observed in the F2 population showed that the morphological characteristics of utsukushimatsu are inherited recessively. This suggests that the mutation of one gene or a few closely linked genes controls the morphological characteristics of utsukushimatsu. Since multiple trunk formation of utsukushimatsu might be related to a loss of lateral bud inhibition, it follows that a simple gene mutation breaks apical dominance in P. densiflora.",Apical dominance; Pinus densiflora f. umbraculifera; Pollination; Recessive inheritance; Utsukushimatsu,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037119554

A phylogenetic analysis of this species group was also carried out using nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2). Results of the ordination and cluster analyses agree with species' delimitation revealed by taxonomic and allozyme studies. The groups formed in ordination analysis correspond to the pollinator groups determined in a previous pollination study. Relationships among the species in the cluster analysis using only vegetative characters are similar to those found in a previous allozyme study, but those indicated by cluster analysis using only floral characters differ. These results support the hypothesis that floral similarities are due to convergence driven by similar pollination mechanisms, and therefore floral traits may not be good indicators of phylogenetic relationships in this group. The results of the phylogenetic analysis support this conclusion to some extent. There is no correlation between genetic (allozyme) and morphological variability in the populations nor in the way this variability is distributed among conspecific populations.

Some species are limited by a lack of suitable pollinators, but the introduction of exotic pollinators can facilitate rapid spread. In Tasmania, where many non-native plants are naturalised, exotic honeybees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) have become established. We determined how these species affect the pollination of Lupinus arboreus, an invasive, nitrogen-fixing shrub, which is rarely visited by native pollinators. The proportion of flowers setting seed and the number of ovules fertilised per flower were positively related to the visitation rates of both exotic bee species. There was no effect of bee visitation rates on the proportion of seeds aborted prior to maturity, possibly due to post-fertilisation environmental constraints.

In the lowland rain forest of Malaysia, the solitary and nonresupinate flowers of the fruit fly orchid attract only males of the ME-sensitive fruit fly species (Bactrocera carambolae, B. papayae, and B. umbrosa. During the morning, the fruit fly orchid flower is visited by many fruit flies, which can sometimes cover the whole flower. The number of visitors dwindles in the afternoon. Headspace analysis of the flower shows a high ME peak in the morning, a small one between 12:00 and 14:00 hr, and no detectable ME peak after 14:00 hr. The process of pollination in the wild is initiated by attraction of fruit flies to floral ME. The flower, with the aid of its specialized hinged see-saw lip (labellum), temporarily traps (<1 min) a fruit fly pollinator between its lip and column. Just prior to this, the fly is rewarded by the opportunity to feed on the floral attractant found on surfaces of petals, sepals, and lip. The pollinaria borne by two wild B. papayae males (caught on and near the fruit fly orchid flower) are identical in morphology and structure with those obtained from the flower. Many of the B. papayae males (17 of 22 analyzed) attracted to the fruit fly orchid already possessed both ME metabolites, trans-coniferyl alcohol and 2-allyl-4,5-dimethoxyphenol, in their rectal glands, indicating that they had previously consumed ME.

Pitcairnia corcovadensis was principally an autonomous self-pollinator, having scarce pollinator activity, anthers and stigmas at the same level, and absence of nectar. In P. flammea, many flowers opened per day, the stigma and anther were close to each other, and its nectar was regularly consumed by hummingbirds; all factors that promote geitonogamy in this species.

This compensation can result from greater fecundity and/or superior success of progeny from females. We examined differences in seed production and progeny success between females and hermaphrodites in the geophyte Wurmbea biglandulosa to explain the maintenance of females. Females produced more ovuliferous flowers and had more ovules per flower than did hermaphrodites but this did not necessarily result in greater fecundity, in part because seed production of females was pollen-limited. Over four years in one population, open-pollinated females produced 1.32 more seeds than open-pollinated hermaphrodites (range 1.09-1.63). In two other populations examined for one year only females produced 1.07 and 0.79 as many seeds as hermaphrodites. Seed production of open-pollinated females and hermaphrodites was only 55% and 73% that of cross-pollinated plants, respectively, indicating that both genders were pollen-limited but females more so than hermaphrodites. Open-pollinated seeds from females were 1.18-1.27 times more likely to germinate than seeds from hermaphrodites. No gender differences existed in seedling growth or survival. Hermaphrodites were self-compatible, but selfed seed set was only 80% that of crossed seed set. Crossed seed set of females and hermaphrodites did not differ.

Methods: We quantified visitation rates of endemic birds and introduced honey bees at two endemic species of flowering trees. Diurnal variation in nectar standing crop and nectar production was measured. Pollination efficiency of flower visitors was examined using bagging and caging experiments. Results: White-eyes were only nectar-feeding at the two Sideroxylon species early in the morning, stopping when honey bee foraging activity rapidly lowered nectar standing crops. White-eyes continued nectar-feeding at other flowering plant species, exploited less by honey bees, throughout the day. Honey bees were less efficient pollinators of the two Sideroxylon species than white-eyes. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that introduced honey bees could be interfering with endemic interactions between the two Sideroxylon species and the two white-eye species. However, because of lack of a neutral control site without honey bees, we cannot exclude other explanations.

Both species secrete nectar from extrafloral nectaries distributed among the flowers, which is mainly consumed by ants, cockroaches, and pyralid moths. Pollen grains were found attached to the bodies of these insects. Pyralid moths of the genera Assara and Nacoleia were observed laying eggs on the inflorescences of B. kuroiwai. In both Balanophora species, pyralid larvae were found feeding on vegetative tissue without exploiting the seeds, and adults emerged from the fruited infructescences. In B. kuroiwai, we assessed pollination success under different experimental conditions by estimating the percentage of styles that had pollen tubes reaching the ovules. This revealed that: (1) the plants were at least sporophytically self-compatible; (2) they were generally pollinated within an inflorescence (geitonogamy); (3) outcrossing occurred, but the rates varied greatly among inflorescences; and (4) ants were probably responsible for the geitonogamy. While ants and flightless cockroaches were the most likely contributors to geitonogamous self-pollination, we consider pyralid moths to be the most likely cross-pollinators of Balanophora species.

We hypothesized that, when the showy invasive species Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) was present, pollinator visitation and seed set would be reduced in a native congener, L. alatum (winged loosestrife). To test this hypothesis, we constructed mixed and monospecific plots of the two species. Over two years of study, we found that L. salicaria significantly reduced both pollinator visitation and seed set in L. alatum. Furthermore, pollinators moved frequently between the two plant species, which may cause heterospecific pollen transfer. Thus, reductions in both pollen quantity and pollen quality may reduce L. alatum seed set. If similar patterns occur in the field, invasive plants may be an even greater threat to natives than previously thought.",Competition; Invasive species; Lythrum alatum; Lythrum salicaria; Pollination; Pollinator visitation; Purple loosestrife; Seed set; Winged loosestrife,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0013389539

These high temperatures are results of a change to an alternative metabolic pathway and a burst in respiration and heat production. The giant tropical water lily Victoria cruziana belongs to such thermogenic plants and elevates the temperature in the floral chamber to + 10 K against ambient. Aim of the study: The main body of experiments concerned indirect calorimetric determinations of the metabolic burst during flowering, accompanied by some contact thermometric evaluations. Infrared thermograph was used to receive contact-free temperatures and pictures of temperature distribution in the blossom and on the giant leaves. Methods: More than 60 Victoria blossoms and an equal number of leaves were investigated in a greenhouse pond of a Botanical Garden. Some of them were photographed by a hand-held, un-cooled micro bolometric infrared (IR) camera (AGEMA 570 PRO) and the pictures processed with the software Irwin 5.0. Results: IR pictures show maximum temperature increases of about +9 K in the centre of the blossom around the opening to the floral chamber. Other central organs follow with less significant values while the outer parts of the blossom are near to the air temperature. Interesting thermal surface structures were observed in the huge leaves. Conclusion: IR thermography is an excellent tool in investigations when temperature distributions are essential and not only point values.

In the context of pesticide usage in pest control, natural enemies of herbivores have received increasing attention, because carnivorous arthropods are an important component of insect pest control. However, in plant breeding programmes, natural enemies of herbivores have largely been ignored, although there are many examples that show that plant breeding affects the effectiveness of biological control. Negative influences of modified plant characteristics on carnivorous arthropods may induce population growth of new, even more harmful pest species that had no pest status prior to the pesticide treatment. Sustainable pest management will only be possible when negative effects on non-target, beneficial arthropods are minimized. In this review, we summarize the effects of insect-resistant crops and insect-resistant transgenic crops, especially Bt crops, from a food web perspective. As food web components, we distinguish target herbivores, non-target herbivores, pollinators, parasitoids and predators. Below-ground organisms such as Collembola, nematodes and earthworms should also be included in risk assessment studies, but have received little attention. The toxins produced in Bt plants retain their toxicity when bound to the soil, so accumulation of these toxins is likely to occur. Earthworms ingest the bound toxins but are not affected by them. However, earthworms may function as intermediaries through which the toxins are passed on to other trophic levels. In studies where effects of insect-resistant (Bt) plants on natural enemies were considered, positive, negative and no effects have been found. So far, most studies have concentrated on natural enemies of target herbivores. However, Bt toxins are structurally rearranged when they bind to midgut receptors, so that they are likely to lose their toxicity inside target herbivores. What happens to the toxins in non-target herbivores, and whether these herbivores may act as intermediaries through which the toxins may be passed on to the natural enemies, remains to be studied.",Biological control; Bt; Ecology; Food web; Host plant resistance; Parasitoids; Predators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036689417

The PCMS line is maintained by self-pollination under short-day conditions, and hybrid seeds can be produced through outcrossing of the PCMS line with a pollinator under long-day conditions. Two kinds of fertility restoration systems against the PCMS are known. One is involved with a set of multiple fertility-restoring (Rf) genes in the wheat cultivar 'Norin 61' located on (at least) chromosomes 4A, 1D, 3D and 5D. The other is controlled by a single dominant major Rf gene, Rfd1, located on the long arm of chromosome 7B in the wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring'. To examine the degree of fertility restoration by these two systems, nine PCMS lines were crossed with 'Norin 61' and 'Chinese Spring' as the restorer lines, and the F1 hybrids were investigated. The degree of fertility restoration was estimated by comparing the seed set rates in the F1 hybrids having the Ae. crassa cytoplasm and those with normal cytoplasm.

Cacti also adapted by greatly reducing the presence of vessels in their wood, evolving a novel tracheid type termed wide-band tracheids, and evolving CAM and C4 metabolisms.

However, the empirical examination of such patterns has so far been limited by the fact that information on life span is mainly available in terms of discrete categories; annuals, semelparous perennials and iteroparous perennials. We used transition matrix models to project continuous estimates of conditional life spans from published information on size- or stage-structured demography for 71 perennial plant species. The projected life span ranged from 4.3 to 988.6 years and more than half of the species had a life span of more than 35 years. Woody plants had on average a projected life span more than four times as long as non-woody plants. Life spans were higher in forests than in open habitats and individuals of non-clonal species tended to have a longer life span than ramets of clonal species. Self-incompatible plants on average lived longer than self-compatible plants. There were no clear relations between life span and geographical region, dispersal syndrome, pollination mode, seed size or the presence of a seed bank.

Seed set from active self-, intra- and inter-morph pollinations was high in A. grandiflora, indicating that the cryptic self-incompatibility system does not prevent seed set in the species.

Amsinckia tessellata average seed weight was lower than that of A. grandiflora, which, along with the lower number of flowers produced, indicated lower maternal investment per nutlet than for A. grandiflora. Under conditions of unlimited resources, it appears that A. grandiflora fitness is not intrinsically limited when compared to its weedy relative A. tessellata. The differences in nutlet output between A. grandiflora and A. tessellata under field conditions are more likely due to differential responses to extrinsic factors such as competition and pollinator availability.",Heterostyly; Intrinsic limitations; Pollination biology; Rare plants; Weedy relatives,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036069716

We investigate pollen-vegetation relationships in samples from soil surfaces, animal dung, and sediments in depressions or basins that, in theory, should have pollen spectra that are comparable to those from sedimentary basins elsewhere. Pollen spectra from basins or depressions are very susceptible to long-distance wind and water transport. This can mask representation of pollen from the surrounding insect-pollinated vegetation, as can over-representation of basin-margin halophilous and hydrophilous pollen. Pollen spectra from biogenic materials of animal origin are the best analogues of local and regional vegetation, and show the best analytical potential in terms of pollen concentration and taxon diversity. Pollination properties of the species studied indicate they will rarely be found in most conventional pollen records. It cannot be stressed too strongly that insight into Quaternary vegetation of arid regions demands complementary pollen analysis of coprolites, urine-cemented deposits, and cave sediments with preserved biotic remains, in addition to water-lain sediments. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

OSTF1 was detected as a single copy gene in rice. The transcripts were absent in young panicle or mature spikelet before anthesis, but appeared very early in the pollinated grain with a transient profile. In vegetative tissues examined, expression was only detectable in root. In situ hybridization analysis on developing grains revealed that OSTF1 was strongly and uniformly expressed in the embryo at the globular stage and preferentially localized to the protoderm at 3-6 d after pollination.

It occasionally occurs in apomictic species but at a frequency too low to be a reliable method for genetic improvement. This investigation was undertaken to determine if 2n + n fertilization could be increased by early pollination. Six buffelgrass, Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link [syn. Cenchrus ciliaris L.], accessions, five apomicts and one sexual, were self-pollinated and cross-pollinated with birdwoodgrass, P. ciliare (L.) Link var. setigerum (Vahl.)

Twenty-eight self- and 80 cross-pollinated plants had a higher DNA content and were products of 2u + n fertilization. The overall frequency of 2u + n fertilization when self- and cross-pollinated was 1.4 and 2.6%, respectively. For all protogynous intervals, the frequency ranged from 0 to 5.2% for self-pollinated plants and 0 to 8.2% for cross-pollinated plants. When self-pollinated, there was no correlation between time of pollination and recovery of 2n + n hybrids. When cross-pollinated, there was a linear relationship between time of pollination and number of 2n + n hybrids recovered. More 2n + n hybrids were recovered from crosses made 2 or 3 d before anthesis. Thus in apomictic buffelgrass, the frequency of 2n + n fertilization can be increased by pollinating early, and in apomictic species where sexual germplasm is not available, this approach has potential to produce new apomictic hybrids.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036066608

The stem of sunflower plants grown outdoors in pots at very low densities was exposed to low R/FR ratios by placing selective plastic filters around this organ. Control plants had a dear filter around the stem and received the R/FR ratio of unfiltered sunlight. In experiments with the open pollinated cultivar Guayacán II, the hybrid 'Dekalb G100', and the line MA 566, low R/FR ratios promoted stem extension growth and dry matter accumulation without affecting the ratio between stem dry matter and length. In comparison with the sunlight R/FR ratio controls, low R/FR ratios reduced grain yield and grain number per plant, without affecting grain dry weight. No significant interaction of the R/FR ratio with cultivar or sowing date was observed.

Abortion usually commences early in development and frequently occurs because of stresses such as water deficit or low light. Polyamines have been implicated in development processes of fruits and seeds, but in maize the changes of polyamine levels during kernel growth are still unclear. The objectives of this study were to investigate the roles of polyamines in the early stages of kernel growth and kernel abortion. Two single-cross hybrids with different kernel abortion characteristics were grown in a greenhouse with shade treatment. During early development of normal, naturally aborting, and shade-induced aborting kernels, temporal changes in the concentrations of endogenous putrescine (PUT), spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM) and their free, perchloric acid (PCA)-soluble conjugated, and PCA-insoluble bound forms, were measured. Changes in DNA content and the number of endosperm nuclei were also measured. Total polyamine levels in normal kernels rapidly increased 4 to 6 d after pollination (DAP), and peaked during active endosperm cell division. The most abundant polyamines were, in order, PCA-soluble conjugated PUT, PCA-soluble conjugated SPD, and free PUT. Aborting kernels had significantly lower levels of polyamines than normal kernels after 4 DAP. The low polyamine levels were temporally associated with a low number of endosperm nuclei and low DNA content. The results suggest that polyamines may be involved in the regulation of early endosperm development in maize.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036065619

We test the FDS and DDS assumptions and the predictions of the model using field observations and experimental populations of Begonia gracilis in which population sex ratio and flower density were controlled. We found a marked effect of both FDS and DDS on pollinator visitation, fruit-set, and on the probability of female flowers to setting fruits.

We present results of new phylogenetic and theoretical analyses to assess the frequency and nature of transitions to syncarpy, and the possible advantages of syncarpy over apocarpy under a variety of ecological conditions. Using a recent molecular estimate of angiosperm phylogeny, we ascertained that a minimum of 17 independent evolutionary transitions from apocarpy to syncarpy have occurred; about three-quarters of these transitions allowed pollen tubes to cross between carpels and fertilize ovules that would otherwise be left unfertilized. Most of these transitions also intensified competition between pollen, potentially enhancing offspring fitness. The high proportion of evolutionary transitions promoting pollen competition and pollen-tube access to all carpels supports the hypothesis that the main advantage of syncarpy is in increasing offspring quality and quantity. The potential advantages of syncarpy were more thoroughly evaluated by analytical and simulation studies. These showed that the advantage of syncarpy over apocarpy involving increased offspring-quantity held under conditions of marginal pollination and declined with increasing pollination.

The weed potential of A. baileyana was investigated in terms of its breeding system and seed production. It was found that the purple form is as reproductively efficient as the green form. Both forms were outcrossing, highly self-incompatible, grew very rapidly and flowered by two years of age. For open, natural pollination, final pod set was low - less than 0.41%. However, seed production was high due to the high number of flowers present. Maximum flower production for a 2-year-old plant was over 300 000, resulting in more than 8000 seeds. Precocity and high flower numbers appear to be the reasons for the weed status of A. baileyana.

We examined the effects of this type of water deficit on reproductive characters involved in pollination, ovule fertilization, seed set, and seed filling. Two experiments were conducted under controlled conditions with four genotypes either in soil columns or vermiculite, and with various levels of water deficit that were maintained for 68 d. Treatments were classified as moderate (M) and severe (S) water deficit on the basis of the reduction of leaf relative water content (RWC) compared with the well-watered plants (C) and of previously established relationships between RWC, soil water potential and vegetative growth. Florets were hand pollinated and seed set was determined in all possible cross-pollinations between pollen and florets from plants subjected to C, M, or S treatments. Pollen viability declined as water deficit increased. Control and M plants had similar high levels of nectar production. In S plants, the proportion of florets containing nectar was reduced by 60 to 70%. Pollen from S plants induced a lower fertilization efficiency than pollen from C or M plants. Most of the reduction of seed set by severe water deficit, however, was linked to the decrease in female plant water status resulting in abortion of embryos. These results show that pollination, fertilization, seed setting, and seed filling can be limited by a severe water deficit applied during reproductive development. A moderate water deficit characterized by an avoidance of leaf dehydration and a reduction of vegetative growth did not impair fertilization efficiency and resulted in maximum seed set and thousand seed weight, compared to C and S plants.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036306226

Very little is known about the molecular biology of its gametophyte development despite a longstanding interest in hybrid seeds. We present here a comprehensive characterization of three apparently homeologous genes (TAA1a, TAA1b and TAA1c) and demonstrate their anther-specific biochemical function. These eight-exon genes, found at only one copy per haploid complement in this large genome, express specifically within the sporophytic tapetum cells. The presence of TAA1 mRNA and protein was evident only at specific stages of pollen development as the microspore wall thickened during the progression of free microspores into vacuolated-microspores. This temporal regulation matched the assembly of wall-impregnated sporopollenin, a phenylpropanoid-lipid polymer containing very long chain fatty alcohols (VLCFAIc), described in the literature. Our results establish that sporophytic genes contribute to the production of fatty alcohols: Transgenic expression of TAA1 afforded production of long/VLCFAIc in tobacco seeds (18:1; 20:1; 22:1; 24:0; 26:0) and in Escherichia coli (14:0; 16:0; 18:1), suggesting biochemical versatility of TAA1 with respect to cellular milieu and substrate spectrum. Pollen walls additionally contain fatty alcohols in the form of wax esters and other lipids, and some of these lipids are known to play a role in the highly specific sexual interactions at the pollen-pistil interface. This study provides a handle to study these and to manipulate pollen traits, and, furthermore, to understand the molecular biology of fatty alcohol metabolism in general.",Anther; Fatty alcohol; Lipid; Microspores; Regulation; Sporopollenin,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036017865

The influence of mutualism on population processes is thought to depend on both the benefits and costs of the interaction. However, few studies have explicitly quantified both benefits and costs in terms of demographic rates; furthermore there has been little consideration as to how benefits and costs depend on the demographic effects of factors extrinsic to the interaction. I studied how benefits (pollination) and costs (larval fruit consumption) of pollinating seed-consumers (senita moths) affect the reproduction of senita cacti and how these effects may rely on extrinsic water limitation for reproduction. Fruit initiation was not limited by moth pollination, but survival of initiated fruit increased when moth eggs were removed from flowers. Watered cacti produced more flowers and initiated more fruit from hand-pollinated flowers than did unwatered cacti, but fruit initiation remained low despite excess pollen. Even though water, pollination and larvae each affected a component of cactus reproduction, when all of these factors were included in a factorial experiment, pollination and water determined rates of reproduction. Counter-intuitively, larval fruit consumption had a negligible effect on cactus reproduction. By quantifying both benefits and costs of mutualism in terms of demographic rates, this study demonstrates that benefits and costs can be differentially influential to population processes and that interpretation of their influences can depend on demographic effects of factors extrinsic to the interaction.",Demography; Extrinsic factors; Flower/fruit ratio; Senita cacti; Water resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037036512

Floral mimicry could explain the maintenance of these rewardless orchid species, but most rewardless orchids do not appear to have a rewarding plant that they mimic specifically. We tested the hypothesis that floral mimicry can occur through similarity based on corolla colour alone, using naive bumble-bees foraging on arrays of plants with one rewarding model species, and one rewardless putative mimic species (Dactylorhiza sambucina) which had two colour morphs. We found that when bees were inexperienced, they visited both rewardless morphs randomly. However, after bees had gained experience with the rewarding model, and it was removed from the experiment, bees resampled preferentially the rewardless morph most similar to it in corolla colour. This is the first clear evidence, to our knowledge, that pollinators could select for floral mimicry. We suggest that floral mimicry can be a selective force acting on rewardless orchids, but only under some ecological conditions. In particular, we argue that selection on early-flowering rewardless orchids that receive visits from a large pool of naive pollinators will be weakly influenced by mimicry.",Bumble-bee; Dactylorhiza sambucina; Pollinator; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037036510

The volatiles are emitted from the spadix appendix, as well as the club-shaped organs located directly above the female flowers. Volatile analysis of various regions of the appendix and the club-shaped organs led to the identification of 163 compounds emitted by the appendix top, 124 by the appendix bottom and 105 by the club-shaped organs. The dominant compounds in all investigated tissues were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes that were accompanied by numerous aliphatic, aromatic, sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds of other biosynthetic origins. Within the appendix, levels of one monoterpene, ?-citronellene, showed considerable variation; it constituted the major compound in the appendix top and gradually decreased in the lower regions, being undetectable in the base. The other prominent monoterpenes, ?-pinene, ?-pinene, limonene, ?-phellandrene and ?-phellandrene, showed no changes along the appendix. The club-shaped organs located at the base of the floral chamber also emitted volatiles, though of different composition: the monoterpenes ?-terpinolene and linalool constituted major amounts, instead of ?-pinene and ?-citronellene. These qualitative differences and the absence of methanethiol in the club-shaped organs result in them having a pleasant flowery odour, in contrast to the foul-smelling appendix. The quantitative spatial variation of ?-citronellene within the appendix and the existence of a second osmophore within the floral chamber, emitting a different scent, suggest that both phenomena might participate in creating an odour gradient for efficient pollinator attraction. Apart from ?-citronellene, nearly all major components of the appendix have already been identified as specific attractants to a broad range of insects that have been observed to be lured to the odour-emitting inflorescence. Most likely, the club-shaped organ odour serves to induce the insects attracted by the appendix to move towards the floral chamber. A comparison of the relative emission rates demonstrated that performance of the club-shaped organs equals or even exceeds the appendix. In the club-shaped organ tissues, multivesicular bodies, originating from lipid droplets, are the most notable organelles before and during odour production. They fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their content to the exterior of the cell. The exit route for the volatiles is an extensive intercellular channel system that extends to the surface of the club-shaped organs. Thus, chemical and ultrastructural analyses suggest, in contrast to previous studies, that the club-shaped organs function as an osmophore rather than a food source for insects.",Araceae; Electron microscopy; Gas chromatography; Mass spectroscopy; Monoterpenes; Multivesicular bodies; Qualitative odour analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036084766

Asteraceae species showed a large variability in corolla tube length. Nectar of most species presented a larger proportion of hexoses than sucrose. All species were visited by numerous insects belonging to ? 2 different orders. Results showed that floral traits are not significantly correlated with the diversity of floral visitors. These characters seem to be linked to the phylogeny of the species. Early branching species (species phylogenetically close to the root of the Asteraceae tree) tend to have longer corollas, higher sucrose proportions and lesser diversity of floral visitors than late branching species.

Peabody Drive, Champaign, IL 61820, United States","The pollination biology and flower visitors of Lobelia spicata, an herbaceous prairie perennial, were examined, and this species was found to be xenogamous, self-compatible, and gynodioecious. Hermaphroditic individuals are protandrous, produce nectar, and have secondary pollen presentation (i.e., pump mechanism). Female individuals do not produce nectar. No significant differences were found between the fruit set of open-pollinated hermaphroditic and female flowers. In hermaphroditic bagged flowers seeds were produced (i.e., undeveloped fruits) suggesting self-pollination; however, this was determined to be the result of geitonogamous pollination by thrips. Autogamy is not likely in this species because there is no overlap between the staminate and pistillate phases. This species is pollinated mainly by bees from the genus Augochlorella. Overall, this study shows that L. spicata shares many common characteristics with other species of Lobelia (i.e., L. cardinalis and L. siphilitica) such as protandry, self-compatibility, no autonomous self-pollination, similar flower phenology (i.e., pistillate and staminate phases), and secondary pollen presentation (i.e., pump mechanism). In contrast to these other species, L. spicata blooms early, has smaller flowers, and attracts smaller pollinators.",Bees; Flower visitors; Gynodieocy; Lobelia spicata; Pollinators; Prairies; Pump mechanism; Secondary pollen presentation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036653682

In this work we report the development and characterization of 10 highly variable microsatellite loci for S. macrophylla. Twenty-nine percent of the 126 sequenced mahogany clones yielded useful microsatellite loci. Three highthroughput genotyping systems were developed based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplexing of these mahogany loci. We identified a total of 158 alleles in 121 adult individuals of S. macrophylla, with an average of 15.8 alleles (range 11-25) per locus. All loci showed Mendelian inheritance in open-pollinated half-sib families. The mean expected heterozygosity was 0.84 and the mean observed heterozygosity was 0.73. The combined probability of identity-the probability that two individuals selected at random from a population would have identica genotypes-was 7.0 × 10-15, and combined probability of paternity exclusion was 0.999998 overall loci.

Myrosinase activity was measured in terms of the rate of hydrolysis of exogenous sinigrin by soluble protein extract of the cotyledons. Myrosinase activities of the parental lines were 0.63 nmol mg-1 min-1 (""High"") and 0.22 nmol mg-1 min-1 (""Low"") (P = 0.0001), and mean myrosinase activities for the F1 progeny were 0.35 nmol mg-1 min-1 (with Low as the maternal parent) and 0.51 nmol mg-1 min-1 (with High as the maternal parent). This pattern suggests a maternal effect on myrosinase activity, which is expected because of the maternally dominated genome of cotyledon tissue. In a set of reciprocal backcrosses, significant effects of the original parental lines on myrosinase activity occurred when these lines were pollen receivers in the backcross, not when they were pollinators, also supporting a maternal inheritance pattern.

Before anthesis the epidermis is covered with a cuticle and thin proteinaceous layer. Elongated subepidermal cells constitute the secretory zone. Cell disintegration in the central region of each stigma lobe leads to cavities that become connected to the central cavity in the style. During early anthesis it appears as if the receptive surface of the stigma is confined to the depressions of the stigma surface and to the cleft between the two stigma lobes as the secretory product and pollen grains are mainly confined to these areas. The secretory products of the stigma and style are released during five different stages from prior to anthesis to late anthesis. The stigmatic exudate appears complex and consists of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The style has a hollow, lysigenous, fluid-filled canal that is not lined with an epidermal layer or cuticle. The stylar canal is continuous with the opening between the two stigma lobes and provides an open route for the passage of exudate. The stylar exudate is PAS-positive.

Maize seed companies, once uncommon, have sprung up in many important maize-producing states and offer farmers a wide range of improved open pollinated varieties (OPVs) and hybrids of different characteristics. Private companies have captured the lion's share of the national maize seed market, and are poised for a big leap in future. The upsurge of the private maize seed industry has important implications for public institutions, hitherto entrusted with the sole task of developing improved production technologies for millions of maize farmers. Public institutions have by and large tried to maintain a synergy between efficiency goals by serving the needs of large-scale, commercial farmers and equity goals by addressing the needs of small-scale, semi-subsistence farmers. The policy reforms introduced in the late eighties gave an impetus to the private seed industries, which made substantial investment in maize research and development (R & D) and provided a wide range of improved cultivats benefiting many maize growers. This helped in realising an impressive annual growth of 3.62 per cent in maize production during the nineties (Singh, 2000). This paper is an attempt to examine the organisation and performance of India's maize seed industry and address the question of where the on-going liberalisation process is likely to lead this industry. The specific objectives are: (i) to examine the changes in seed policy, (ii) strengths and weaknesses of the public and private seed industries and (iii) policy perspectives, making maize seed industry more dynamic, efficient and responsive.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036666999

Lindl. (Maloideae, Rosaceae) was studied by fluorescence microscopy. In a compatible combination, pollen grains germinated fast and pollen tubes grew rapidly, through the stylar tissue. Most of pollen tubes reached the base of the ovary within 2-6 days. In the ovary, pollen tube growth was considerably retarded, and fertilization of ovules started at the earliest 3 days after pollination. In an incompatible combination only few pollen grains germinated, and pollen tubes grew slowly and were often completely arrested in the style. The pollen tubes reached the ovary in 6-7 days. Fertilization did not take place until 7-9 days after pollination, and the percentage of fertilized ovules was very low. The same results were obtained when selfing self-incompatible genotypes. However, a small percentage of pollen tubes reached the ovary within 3-4 days in some genotypes including self-pollination (as in a compatible cross-pollination), but fertilization was not observed or considerably delayed compared to cross-pollination. C. japonica thus shows the characteristics of a gametophytic self-incompatibility system. The viable period of the embryo sac was 6-7 days in most of the investigated genotypes, and the effective period of pollination was estimated to 5-7 days. Bagging was not necessary to avoid open pollination, provided that the flowers had been emasculated previously. Emasculation or bagging did not decrease fruit set and could, therefore, be used in breeding. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

First, a population of almond cultivars was characterised as to their individual S-allele combination using separation of stylar protein extracts (non-equilibrium pH gradient electrofocusing) followed by staining for RNase activity, which led to the identification of one putative new allele and several new S-allele combinations. Second, a field pollination scheme was designed to study pollen tube progression and to obtain a spatial and temporal characterisation of this reproductive stage in both incompatible and compatible crosses. In addition, an antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide designed from an almond S-protein (S8) and used for immunological in situ detection in pistil cryosections. S-RNases were found to accumulate intercellularly in the stylar transmitting tissue as previously reported for other rosaceous species. The results are discussed in view of the evolution of the gametophytic SI system and the models proposed for its mechanism. Gametophyte selection is also proposed as an important intraspecific barrier to fertilisation in this species.",Almond; Pollen-pistil interaction; Prunus dulcis; S-RNases; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036072034

In this paper, we describe the normal developmental pathways of sexual and apomictic reproduction and compare these with the development observed in the apomictic hybrids. In sexual diploids, a standard type of megasporogenesis and embryo sac development is synchronised between florets in individual capitula. In contrast, we observed that megasporogenesis and gametogenesis proceeded asynchronously between florets within a single capitulum of natural triploid apomicts. In addition, autonomous endosperm and embryo development initiated independently within individual florets. Parthenogenetic initiation of embryo development in outdoor apomicts was found to be temperature-dependent. Egg cells produced in natural apomicts were not fertilised after pollination with haploid pollen grains although pollen tubes were observed to grow into their embryo sacs. Both reductional and diplosporous megasporogenesis were observed in individual inflorescences of triploid apomictic hybrids.

The mature egg is a large, polarized bulbous-shaped cell, tapering toward its micropylar end. The wide chalazal region has a large nucleus that is surrounded by cytoplasm containing many giant mitochondria and large amyloplasts. The mitochondria contain a large amount of mitochondrial DNA and appear as long stretched rods or complex rings, sometimes consisting of several concentric or half-concentric circles in sections. The time from pollination to cell fusion is approximately 6-9 h and it is 20-24 h until the first zygotic division. The changes in the zygote and its organelles preparatory to division occur in 3 stages. At stage 1 (6-9 h after pollination), cell fusion occurs and the zygote begins to elongate. Many vacuoles of varying size appear surrounding the nucleus. At stage 2 (9-15 h), the zygote nucleus migrates to a central position in the cell and the mitochondria form a single ring that becomes either irregularly crushed or appears as long thin strings. Amyloplasts exhibit a gradual decrease in the number of starch grains. At stage 3 (15-20 h), the vacuoles disappear, except for a few that remain in the micropylar region, and cell size decreases. Mitochondria become short, fine strings or small rings. Amyloplasts with starch grains are no longer observed, but are transformed into large proplastids. Following the first division of the zygote, approximately equal-sized apical and basal cells are formed. Short rod-shaped or small ring-shaped mitochondria are randomly distributed near the nucleus of the apical cell, whereas mitochondria in the basal cell are long and rod-shaped. In the electron microscope, two types of plastids can be distinguished: dark oval plastids originating from the sperm cell, which are observed in both the apical and basal cell, and others with a less dense, amorphous matrix, believed to originate from egg amyloplasts, which are unevenly distributed in the micropylar region of the basal cell. Fluorometry using a video-intensified microscope photon counting system reveals that, correlated with changes in mitochondrial morphology, DNA amount within the mitochondrion decreases linearly during these stages.",Egg cell; Giant mitochondria; Mitochondrial DNA; Pelargonium zonale; Zygote,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036078021

The maximum rate of pollination averaged 83.9 ± 4.7 %, and the number of pollen grains per stigma ranged from zero to 30. Pollen tubes grew through one stigma to the base of the ovary at almost the same speed, but generally only one of the pollen tubes then turned towards the ovule and finally entered the nucellus through the micropyle. The other pollen tubes grew through the ovary base and the receptacle tissue into ovules of adjacent carpels whose stigmas were not pollinated or which had been pollinated later. This phenomenon is termed pollen tube 'reallocation' by the authors. To verify the direct effect of the phenomenon on fruit set, artificial pollination experiments were conducted in which two or more pollen grains were placed onto only one stigma in each gynoecium; frequently more than one fruitlet was obtained from each flower treated. The reallocation of pollen tubes among pistils in the gynoecium could effect fertilization of ovules of unpollinated pistils and lead to an increase in sexual reproduction efficiency. It would, to some extent, also increase pollen tube competition among pistils of the whole gynoecium. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Fruit set; Pollen tube growth; Pollination; Reproductive efficiency; Sagittaria potamogeufolia Merr.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036598963

The genetic effects of habitat fragmentation may be most pronounced in species that form small populations, are fully self-compatible and have limited seed dispersal. However, long-lived seed banks, mobile pollinators and long adult lifespans may prevent or delay the accumulation of genetic effects. We studied a rare Australian shrub species, Grevillea macleayana (Proteaceae), that occurs in many small populations, is self-compatible and has restricted seed dispersal. However, it has a relatively long adult lifespan (c. 30 years), a long-lived seed bank that germinates after fire and is pollinated by birds that are numerous and highly mobile. These latter characteristics raise the possibility that populations in the past may have been effectively large and genetically homogeneous. Using six microsatellites, we found that G. macleayana may have relatively low within-population diversity (3.2-4.2 alleles/locus; Hexp = 0.420-0.530), significant population differentiation and moderate genetic structure (FST = 0.218) showing isolation by distance, consistent with historically low gene flow. The frequency distribution of allele sizes suggest that this geographical differentiation is being driven by mutation. We found a lack mutation-drift equilibrium in some populations that is indicative of population bottlenecks. Combined with evidence for large spatiotemporal variation of selling rates, this suggests that fluctuating population sizes characterize the demography in this species, promoting genetic drift. We argue that natural patterns of pollen and seed dispersal, coupled with the patchy, fire-shaped distribution, may have restricted long-distance gene flow in the past.",Fragmentation; Genetic structure; Grevillea macleayana; Mating system; Microsatellites; Plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036017054

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the profile of allergen components in ash pollen in order to refine diagnosis and therapy for patients with sensitivity to ash pollen. Methods: The IgE reactivity profile of 40 ash pollen-allergic patients was determined by immunoblotting. Antibodies raised to purified pollen allergens from tree and grass pollens were used to identify cross-reactive stractures in ash pollen extract. IgE immunoblot inhibition studies were performed with recombinant and natural pollen allergens to characterize ash pollen allergens and to determine the degree of cross-reactivity between pollen allergens from ash, olive, birch, grasses and weeds. Results: The allergen profile of ash pollen comprises Fra e 1, a major allergen related to the major olive allergen, Ole e 1, and to group 11 grass pollen allergens, the panallergen profilin, a two EF-hand calcium-binding protein, a pectinesterase-like molecule and an allergen sharing epitopes with group 4 grass pollen allergens. Thus, the relevant allergens of ash are primarily allergens that share epitopes with pollen allergens from other tree, grass and weed species. Conclusions: Allergic symptoms to ash pollen can be the consequence of sensitization to cross-reactive allergens from other sources. The fact that ash pollen-allergic patients can be discriminated on the basis of their specific IgE reactivity profile to highly or moderately cross-reactive allergens has implications for the selection of appropriate forms of treatment.",Allergen profile; Antibodies; Ash pollen; IgE inhibition; Recombinant allergens; Spring pollinosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036285827

These alternative in vitro pollination techniques resulted in lower penetration rates of the ovules by pollen tubes in comparison to pollination on the stigma. An explanation was found in the intervention of the normal pollination process, through which less pollen-pistil interactions were built up. After cut style pollination the percentage of ovule penetration by pollen tubes increased when a longer style part was left at the ovary. Probably fewer factors that control pollen tube growth are present in the lower style part. Pollen germinated on the ovules after placental pollination but only rarely penetration of the micropyle by a pollen tube occurred. Activation of the ovary, induced by in vivo prepollination for 6 hours, and pollination two days after anthesis did not increase the fertilization percentage. Grafting a style with active growing pollen tubes to ovules on the placenta (placental grafted style pollination) resulted in a higher fertilization percentage.

The optimal floral phenotype should therefore depend on the relative importance of selection exerted by both mutualistic and antagonistic animals. The perennial, rosette herb Primula farinosa is polymorphic for scape length. Natural populations may include both plants with flowers displayed well above the ground (the long-scaped morph) and those with flowers positioned very close to the ground (the short-scaped morph). In this study, we conducted a field experiment to examine how the relative fitness of the two scape morphs is affected by interactions with pollinators and fruit predators in two different microhabitats (high and low vegetation). As predicted based on the difference in floral display, supplemental hand-pollination showed that fruit initiation was more strongly pollen-limited in the short-scaped than in the long-scaped morph, and that this difference was significantly larger in high than in low vegetation. Moreover, plants with a short scape experienced lower levels of fruit predation than plants with a long scape. Among open-pollinated controls, there was no significant difference in seed output between the two scape morphs. However, among plants receiving supplemental hand-pollination, short-scaped plants produced significantly more seeds than long-scaped plants. The results suggest that the positive and negative effects of a prominent floral display (increased pollination and seed predation, respectively) balance in the study population, but also that the short-scaped morph would have an advantage at higher pollination intensities. Spatial and temporal variation in pollinator activity and seed predation should result in associated variation in the relative fecundity of the two scape morphs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036271419

The cone-set ratio was similar to the expected value, based on literature on woody perennials. The seed-ovule ratio, however, was almost twice as high as its expected value. The investment in protective cone elements was high and did not vary with the seed-ovule ratio of a cone. Pollination factors influenced cone abortion, as indicated by the high abortion rate at the end of the pollination period. Furthermore, abortive cones had lower pollination rates and lower pollen loads than well developed cones. Effects of resource availability were assessed as effects of tree size and cone position on twigs. Small trees aborted more cones than big trees and cone abortion was higher in apical cones than in basal cones. Abortion in P. halepensis is selective, mediated by both pollen quantity and resource availability. The relative importance of pollen and resources is suggested to be flexible, probably varying between trees and years. The high seed-ovule ratio of P. halepensis is the result of high pollination rate and selective abortion. The selective abortion might be due to the high allocation to protective cone elements relative to the allocation to seeds.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036271166

Recent coevolutionary theory has indicated that the geographic structure of species has the potential to impose powerful and continuing effects on coevolutionary dynamics, if that structure creates selection mosaics and coevolutionary hotspots across landscapes. Here we confirm that current coevolutionary selection in interspecific interactions can be highly divergent across both narrow and broad geographic scales, thereby fuelling continuing coevolution of taxa. Study of a widespread plant-insect interaction across a broad range of habitats for several years showed that an insect functioning both as a pollinator and a floral parasite can be strongly mutualistic in some habitats but commensal or antagonistic in neighbouring habitats. The results for one of the habitats span seven years, demonstrating that the local structure of coevolutionary selection can remain stable across multiple generations. Conservation of the evolutionary processes maintaining long-term biological diversity may require preservation of the conditions that allow a long-term shifting geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037071852

This study tested the geographical consistency of phenological synchrony in a meta-analysis of data from 14 biogeographic locations. Data from a single site in British Columbia, Canada, were then used to test the dispersal facilitation hypothesis, which postulates that synchronous bird-fruit abundance patterns result from deterministic seed dispersal processes (i.e. avian fruit consumption). Results showed that phenological synchrony is a geographically consistent pattern. However, fruit production occurred after peak periods of bird abundances in British Columbia. Although phenological patterns were asynchronous at this site, observational and experimental fruit removal patterns supported the dispersal facilitation hypothesis. Avian fruit consumption covaried with bird abundances, suggesting selection may favour earlier fruit production and increased phenological synchrony. Environmental data suggest that earlier fruit production is constrained by cold spring temperatures, which inhibit the activity of pollinators and earlier dates of fruit maturation. Overall, the results show that phenological synchrony is a geographically consistent pattern in seed dispersal mutualisms.

We show that males are more likely to evolve showy flowers than females in animal-pollinated plants, especially when pollinators are abundant. We demonstrate that this dimorphism places showy dioecious plants at a much higher risk of extinction during years of low pollinator abundance because pollinators may fail to visit female flowers. The higher extinction risk of showy dioecious plants provides an explanation for the fact that dioecious plants that do persist tend to have inconspicuous flowers and are more often wind pollinated.

The stigmatic movements in the two floral phenotypes, which occur in a ratio of 1:1 in natural populations, are synchronous and correlate with the foraging behaviour of floral visitors; pollination is effected only between floral forms.

This article examines the costs of non-GMO segregation and IP for seed producers, farmers and grain handlers in the United States. We find that a small fraction of farmers' total costs of segregation and IP actually come from the steps farmers take to clean planting and harvesting equipment. Costs appear to come mainly from the production process itself (i.e. from foregoing planting of cost-reducing GM varieties). We argue that a major cost for handlers comes from a flexibility loss due to the necessity of dedicating equipment to one of two handling channels (one for GMOs and one for non-GMOs). For maize, an additional major cost comes from the necessity of preventing pollination of non-GM varieties by GM pollen at the seed and farm production stages. Tolerance levels are a key element of costs of segregation, and zero-tolerance levels may be impossible to obtain without major organisational and economic costs. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",Consumer preferences; Genetically modified organisms; Grain handling system; Identity preservation; Market segmentation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036109035

At each island site, all interactions between endemic, non-endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators were mapped. Linkage level, i.e. number of species interactions per species, was significantly higher for endemic species than for non-endemic native and introduced species. Linkage levels of the two latter categories were similar. Nine types of interaction may be recognized among endemic, non-endemic native and introduced plants and pollinators. Similar types had similar frequencies in the two networks. Specifically, we looked for the presence of 'invader complexes' of mutualists, defined as groups of introduced species interacting more with each other than expected by chance and thus facilitating each other's establishment. On both islands, observed frequencies of interactions between native (endemic and non-endemic) and introduced pollinators and plants differed from random. Introduced pollinators and plants interacted less than expected by chance. Thus, the data did not support the existence of invader complexes. Instead, our study suggested that endemic super-generalist species, i.e. pollinators or plant species with a very wide pollination niche, include new invaders in their set of food plants or pollinators and thereby improve establishment success of the invaders. Reviewing other studies, super generalists seem to be a widespread island phenomenon, i.e. island pollination networks include one or a few species with a very high generalization level compared to co-occurring species. Low density of island species may lead to low interspecific competition, high abundance and ultimately wide niches and super generalization.",Azores; Biological invasions; Endemism; Mauritius; Mutualisms; Pollination; Super generalist,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036100324

Caixa Postal 6109, CEP: 13083-970, Campinas, SP, Brazil","The pollination process in Trigonidium obtusum Lindl. (Epidendroideae: Maxillariinae) is documented. The flowers are pollinated by sexually excited drones of Plebeia droryana (Meliponinae). When attempting to copulate either with sepals or petals, these bees slip on the waxy perianth surface and become trapped in the funnel-like flower tube. Bees trying to escape from the flowers may instead access the space between the column and lip, fixing the pollinarium on their scutellum. Pollinarium-bearing bees may pollinate the flowers when repeating the above-mentioned steps, leaving pollinia on the concave stigmatic surface, thus effecting pollination. Recently removed pollinaria are too broad to enter the stigma but they begin to dehydrate and within 40 min of removal are small enough to fit the stigmatic cavity. This mechanism prevents insect-mediated self-pollination and promotes cross-pollination. Preliminary evidence based on experiments with cultivated plants suggests that they are self-compatible but that fruit set is pollinator-dependent. The data obtained are discussed in a phylogenetic context. It is suggested that the pseudocopulatory syndrome in Trigonidium could have evolved from rewardless (food advertising) ancestors. Pseudocopulation in the context of the long flowering period of this orchid species (about 7 months) is understandable since the eusocial Plebeia bees produce fertile individuals several times a year. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Maxillaria; Maxillariinae; Meliponinae; Plebeia; Pollination; Pseudocopulation; Trigonidium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036096410

We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16 species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among congeneric species, but also among species of different families. Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community. It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.",Japan; Masting; Ogawa Forest Reserve; Pollination efficiency; Predator satiation; Seed production; Synchrony; Temperate deciduous forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038374943

A survey of 16 loci revealed a high level of genetic variation with approximately two-thirds of the loci being polymorphic and a mean of 1.84 alleles per loci.

Annuals are more likely to flower early than congeneric perennials, and insect-pollinated species more than wind-pollinated ones.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037204986

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the pollination timing on the proportion of sexually formed individuals in progenies of a facultative apomictic Paspalum notatum genotype. Progeny families of approx. 30 plants each were generated at five different pollination times: 1-3 d pre-anthesis; at anthesis; and 2, 4 and 6 d post-anthesis. Cytoembryological analyses indicated that approx. 17% of the ovules carried a meiotic cytologically reduced embryo sac in florets formed simultaneously with those used for crosses. The parental plants and the five F1 families were analysed using RAPD molecular markers. Ninety-five oligonucleotides were assayed on the progenitors in order to search for male-specific bands. Eight primers presenting clear polymorphic bands were selected for use in the progeny tests. The proportion of sexually produced progeny reached 3.4% before anthesis and 20% at anthesis, while pollination after anthesis generated only maternal plants. A second progeny of 97 plants obtained from pollination at anthesis produced 16 off-type plants (16.5%), of which only one was a Bm hybrid (2n + n). Our results indicate that pollination at anthesis allows the greatest potential for sexuality to be expressed in this facultative apomictic genotype. When pollination is delayed as soon as 2 d after anthesis, only the aposporous sacs develop endosperm through pseudogamy to set seed. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Apomixis; Paspalum notatum; Pollination timing; RAPD fingerprinting,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036463807

The reproductive ecology of G. beadleana was compared in two populations with a ten-fold difference in the number of plants. Grevillea beadleana was found to be self-compatible in both populations and an examination of pollen viability and stigma maturation revealed that the species is protandrous. Flowering within inflorescences is acropetallous. In the first season plants in the largest population produced approx, tenfold more inflorescences than those in the smaller population and, although the number of flowers per inflorescence did not vary significantly between populations the first season, the larger population produced more fruit per inflorescence than the smaller population. However, fruit to flower ratios were less than 0-2 in both seasons and populations. In both populations the number of fruit was significantly greater at the proximal end of the inflorescence, where flowers open first, compared with medial and distal positions. Several bird species were observed visiting flowers, although few birds were recorded foraging at plants in the smaller population. Within both populations, birds tended to make more within- than between-plant visits. Self-compatibility, acropetally and proximal fruit-set, combined with the predominantly within-plant movement of honeyeaters, suggests inbreeding may be common within both populations of G. beadleana.

Saccate grains have sometimes been referred to as 'non-wettable' due to their buoyant properties, while non-saccate pollen grains have been described as 'wettable'. The hydrodynamic properties of saccate pollen grains of seven podocarp species in five genera, Dacrydium Sol. ex G. Forst., Dacrycarpus (Endl.) de Laub., Manoao Molloy, Podocarpus L'Hér. ex Pers. and Prumnopitys Phil. have been tested in water, together with saccate and non-saccate pollen of four other conifer genera, Cedrus Trew (Pinaceae), Cephalotaxus Siebold & Zucc. ex Endl. (Cephalotaxaceae), Cupressus L. (Cupressaceae) and Phyllocladus Rich. ex Mirb. (Phyllocladaceae), and spores of three fern species and one lycopod species. All four spore types studied were non-wettable, whereas the bisaccate and trisaccate pollen types, like all other conifer pollen types, were wettable, enabling the grains to cross the surface tension barrier of water. Once past this barrier, grain behaviour was governed by presence or absence of sacci. Non-saccate and vestigially saccate grains sank, whereas saccate grains behaved like air bubbles, floating up to the highest point. In addition, the grains were observed to float in water with sacci uppermost, consistent with the suggestion that distally placed sacci serve to orientate the germinal furrow of the pollen grain towards the nucellus of an inverted ovule. Observations of pollen grains in the pollen chambers of naturally pollinated Prumnopitys ovules confirmed this. The combination of buoyancy and wettability in saccate pollen has implications for the efficiency of the typical podocarp pollination mechanism. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Conifer pollen; Fern spores; Lycopod spores; Podocarpaceae; Pollen hydrodynamics; Pollination mechanisms; Prumnopitys; Prumnopitys ferruginea (G.

Several flowers known to respond to pollination by rapid cessation of attractiveness were also exposed to ethylene: this produced the same effect as pollination, both on flower colour and form.

Its potential as a crop species has long been recognized as a result of the high oil and protein content of its seeds. The reproductive biology and breeding systems of the species were investigated in wild and experimental populations growing in Botswana. Field observations confirmed that the species is heterostylous with the pistil and anthers exhibiting reciprocal heights in the two morphs, although pollen size and sculpturing do not vary. The wet, non-papillate stigma characteristic of the species is the first to be reported in the Caesalpinioideae. In vivo and in vitro diallel crossing experiments demonstrated that a diallelic self-incompatability system exists in T. esculentum. The major site of pollen tube inhibition in the intramorph crosses was found to be in the style. This is the first report of functional heterostyly in the Fabaceae and of a confirmed self-incompatibility system in the Caesalpinioideae. Three separate lines of evidence, the monitoring of fruit development in open-pollinated plants, fruit set in diallel crossing experiments, and observations made in wild populations, demonstrated that fruit set and, by implication, seed set, are very low in this species. Floral abscission was a major limitation to the production of mature pods but there were also significant losses at other developmental stages of fruit production. The results suggest that low seed set may be an adaptation of the species to an environment in which rainfall is scarce. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Caesalpinieae; Fruit production; Heterostyly; Marama bean; Morama bean; Ovule; Pollination; Seed set; Self-incompatability; Tylosema esculentum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036094786

Phenotypes were predominantly similar to the female when cultivated sunflower was the female parent. Progeny from crosses using a wild species as the female parent resembled that parent. Thus, reciprocal crosses led to different progeny. F1 sister progeny shared different sets of molecular markers representing a few of those of the wild species used as the pollen donor.

However, over 3 years of study, the growth of the females, measured as elongation of the main axes, was similar to that of the males. In both sexes, growth decreased with increasing elevation. Neither size of the ripe seed cones, nor the number of developed seeds per cone varied with elevation. The percentage of filled seeds was significantly greater at higher elevations indicating more favourable conditions for wind pollination in these stands. However, cone production decreased with elevation and so, reproductive success of J. communis subsp. alpina in Sierra Nevada decreases towards both upper and lower altitudinal distribution limits.

Very few studies, however, have addressed explicitly the contribution of nonadaptive processes to evolutionary diversification, and no general procedures have been established for distinguishing between adaptive and nonadaptive processes as sources of trait diversity. I use the diversification of flower colour as a model system for attempting to identify adaptive and nonadaptive causes of trait diversification. It is widely accepted that variation in flower colour reflects direct, adaptive response to divergent selective pressures generated by different pollinators. However, diversification of flower colour may also result from the effects of nonadaptive, pleiotropic relationships with vegetative traits. Floral pigments that have pleiotropic relationships to vegetative pigments may evolve and diversify in at least two nonadaptive ways. (1) Indirect response to selection on the pleiotropically related nonfloral traits may occur (indirect selection). (2) Divergent evolution in response to parallel selective pressures (e.g. selection by pollinators for visually obvious flowers) may occur because populations are at different genetic starting points, and each population follows its own genetic 'line of least resistance.' A survey of literature suggests that pleiotropic relationships between flower colour and vegetative traits are common. Phylogenetically informed analyses of comparative data from Dalechampia (Euphorbiaceae) and Acer (Aceraceae), based on trait-transition probabilities and maximum likelihood, indicated that floral and vegetative pigments are probably pleiotropically related in these genera, and this relationship better explains the diversification of floral colour than does direct selection by pollinators. In Dalechampia pink/purple floral bract colour may have originated by indirect response to selection on stem and leaf pigments. In Acer selection by pollinators for visually obvious flowers may to have led to the evolution of red or purple flowers in lineages synthesizing and deploying red anthocyanins in leaves, and pale-green or yellow flowers in species not deploying red anthocyanins in vegetative structures. This study illustrates the broader potential of indirect selection and parallel selection on different genetic starting points to contribute to biological diversity, and the value of testing directly for the operation of these nonadaptive diversifying processes.",Acer; Adaptive radiation; Anthocyanins; Bees; Correlated evolution; Dalechampia; Flower colour; Indirect selection; Nonadaptive diversification; Phylogeny; Pleiotropy; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036092954

The frequency of flowering in C. deodara was highly variable during the two successive years; however, cyclical production of pollen grains was observed in 50 % of the trees. The maximum concentration of pollen grains in the air was found between 1200 and 1600 h, and this period was also noted to be the best time for pollination. Studying migration of pollen grains from isolated single trees in three directions showed that migration was not uniform in all directions. Long-distance transport of pollen grains was observed in the downhill direction. However, in the uphill and horizontal directions grains could travel only up to 97.5 and 195.1 m, respectively, and the frequency of pollen grains to the source frequency at these distances was only 1.9 and 2.5 %, respectively.

Results show that R. leiolepis: (1) has a strong sporophytic self-incompatibility system; (2) exhibits significant clonality and that the importance of vegetative reproduction increases at higher altitudes; (3) is genetically diverse, but that variation within populations decreases and differentiation among populations increases with altitude; and (4) is diploid with 2n = 22 throughout its geographic range. Based on these results, low altitude populations around Cooma and Happy Valley should be made priority areas for in situ conservation in the Species Recovery Plan currently being developed by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service because they exhibit the most sexual reproduction and highest levels of genetic variation within the species. They may also be demographically more viable in the long term, having larger effective population sizes and less likelihood of mate limitation due to low S allele richness than high altitude populations. Sampling strategies for ex situ conservation should vary from large collections within populations at low altitudes to smaller collections spread across populations at higher altitudes where more of the genetic diversity is partitioned among sites. This should give maximum representation of the species' gene pool for minimum sampling effort. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although anther culture was successful in the other genotypes, the open pollinated ones, the highest number of embryo yields per 100 anthers was obtained in the hybrid. High temperature treatment before culture had a beneficial effect on the embryo yields. The responsiveness of anthers to addition of increasing concentration of silver nitrate (AgN03) (the ethylene inhibitor) to the culture medium, showed a progressive increase in the embryo yields in all the genotypes. Since embryos were also formed in the absence of silver nitrate, probably, due to a greater genotype × medium interaction, it is noted that the presence of silver nitrate in the medium may not be essential for cabbage anther culture as reported earlier.

Reproductive features (seed set, number of seeds per capsule, seed weight) and germination responses to constant temperatures, sea water and dry-heat pre-treatments were investigated to determine the extent to which they may have influenced the extinction of the species. Seed set in Lysimachia is not dependent on pollinators, suggesting a functional selfer breeding system. Most plants produced a large mean number of fruits (23.2) and seeds (46.6), and the mean production of seeds per individual was estimated to be almost 1100. Overall, no highly specific requirements were observed for seed germination. Seed germination was not inhibited in the dark, and a high germinability (over 87 % in all cases) was recorded in most experiments, with the exception of those performed at low temperatures (5 and 10°C). These data suggest that fertility and seed viability were not the major causes of extinction. The high reproductive performance of L. minoricensis is in striking contrast to its status as a wild-extinct plant, suggesting that extrinsic factors were responsible for its extinction. © 2002 Annals of Botany Company.",Extinct taxa; Mediterranean flora; Seed germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036561739

In the three independent natural stands of 46 individual plants with 354 seeds of O. xylorrhizus (Liliaceae s. l), we assigned 319 seeds to a single individual with the highest LOD score. Among these, 179 seeds had a significant D-value. An individual (acting either as female or male) mateds with an average of one other individual on average to reproduce, except when it self-pollinated. If an individual that neither donated pollen to other individuals nor selfed, being strictly a pollen acceptor, the number of offspring produced was half that produced by as many offspring as individuals which both provided and accepted pollen (4.1 vs. 9.5). Significant positive relationships were found in all the three stands between the number of self-pollen an individual produced and the number of seeds that individual set. Male outcrossing reproductive success was unevenly varied, both in amount and spatial location. The individuals located in the centre of the stand and the individuals closest to each other had higher male outcrossing reproductive success than those at the edge of the stand. Male selfing reproductive success showed a similar pattern, with an even distribution of female reproductive output. Most mating events were took place within 20 m. The distance between mates mirrored the active ranges of pollinators, and shaped the fine-scale population spatial genetic spatial structure.

They present several characteristics in common with the related species, Rhizanthes lowii, which is a strongly endothermic flower. The possible existence of endothermy in Rafflesia tuan-mudae was investigated here. The internal and surface temperature of the flowers were continuously monitored with fine thermocouples while radiation fluxes and microclimatic variables were recorded. A computational fluid dynamic model was used to predict the concentrations of CO2 inside the diaphragm of the flower. It was found that the internal parts of the flower were maintained a few degrees (1-6 K) above air temperature. It was not possible to account for this temperature rise without postulating a significant internal source of heat. It was concluded that R. tuan-mudae is an endothermic flower that generates a maximum of 50-60 W m-2 of heat in the centre of the column.

The objective of our research was to analyze the response of kernel starch, protein, and oil to changes in the post-flowering source-sink ratio (i.e., post-flowering shoot biomass increase per kernel). Two commercial hybrids of different kernel weight (KW) and protein content were grown at two stand densities (3 and 9 plants m-2) during 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. Pollination treatments were used to modify kernel number per plant (KNP). As KNP increased, starch, protein and oil yield per plant increased, but yield per kernel decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in all treatment combinations. In both genotypes, starch, protein, and oil content per kernel varied between 114 to 238, 15 to 48, and 7 to 17 mg kernel-1, respectively, and concentrations varied between 650 to 700, 80 to 140, and 40 to 60 g kg-1 dry weight, respectively. Within each hybrid, the post-flowering source-sink ratio explained (P &lt; 0.01) the response of each kernel component content to modifications in KNP and stand density. In both genotypes, kernel starch, protein, and oil content were all maximized at the same post-flowering source-sink ratio (?420 and 570 mg kernel-1 in DK664 and DK752, respectively). A decrease in the source-sink ratio beyond a specific threshold promoted a decrease in the relative protein content and an increase in the relative starch content. Limitations other than assimilates seem to govern the relative oil content of kernels, as no relation with the post-flowering source-sink ratio was found.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036235337

We screened a set of 25 inbred lines reputed to differ for drought tolerance for OA expressed in the 8-leaf stage; crossed the extreme lines (high and low OA); and selected four individuals (two high OA, two low OA) from the F2 population derived from this cross. Crops of F3 families obtained by self-pollination of these individuals were grown under a rain-out shelter and subjected to a 30-day drought ending at anthesis. High OA families expressed greater OAft [OA at full turgor, estimated as the difference in osmotic potential between droughted and control treatments] than low OA families at the end of the drought period (0.23 MPa vs. 0.04 MPa). Crops of high OA families extracted more water from the profile during the stress period (117 mm vs. 63 mm) had greater shoot biomass and harvest index (HI) at physiological maturity, and greater grain yield (ca. 30%). There was no effect of OA on these variables in the irrigated controls. Grain size, rather than grain number, was the yield component most affected by level of OA. Yield maintenance under drought conditions was attributable to variations in post-drought shoot biomass increase and HI increase. We conclude that OA can contribute to drought tolerance in sunflower and stress the need to develop markers for this trait. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Location: Samara production and long-term establishment of seedlings were observed along a north-south transect crossing the transition zone between continuous and discontinuous stands of red maple (47°80?-49°27? N) in western Quebec. Methods: Eleven populations of red maple were selected along a latitudinal gradient extending to the northern limit of the species. Seed traps were placed in each stand and distributed under the canopy of mature red maple trees. Seed abundance was tracked for 6 years from 1988 to 1993. Phenological observations were made in 1992 and 1993 at Roquemaure (Roq), a site located at the centre of the latitudinal gradient. Red maple trees were randomly selected within the population; counts of flower buds, pollinated buds and samaras produced were made in 1992-93. Samaras were collected from each branch immediately before dispersal and counted. During the summer of 1987, seedlings (&lt; 1 cm d.b.h.) were collected and aged at each site in twenty 1 m2 quadrants and age of the seedlings (&lt; 1 cm d.b.h.) was determined by counting the annual scars left by terminal buds. Results: Samaras were produced even at the northern limit but large yearly variations were observed. Over the 6-year period we counted 3 years (1989, 1990, 1993) when samara production was high, and 3 years (1988, 1991, 1992) when production was low. Phenological observations indicate that the occurrence of spring frosts at the time of flower bud flushing could contribute to decreasing the abundance of seeds. The age structure of southern localities had a relatively constant production of seedlings, as indicated by an inverse J-shaped distribution. However, the five northernmost localities show sporadic recruitment. Main conclusions: Populations at the northern limit are maintained essentially through vegetative reproduction and infrequent sexual recruitment. Our results indicate that regeneration within established stands through sexual recruitment is possible in all of the populations we studied. This potential becomes very low at more northerly sites and sexual reproduction alone would be unlikely to ensure successful stand regeneration.

Gene flow through pollen is also shown to be mainly restricted to less than 100 m. This result suggests that most pollination events (mediated through small insects) are probably limited to within-patches of individuals, which might explain the high genetic differentiation among patches (FST = 0.11) separated by less than 2 km.

(2n = 24) was made via embryo rescue. Hybrid plants (2n = 19; 7 from cucumber and 12 from C. hystrix) were sterile, but morphologically uniform. Self-pollination and backcrossing of F1 hybrid plants to either parent confirmed presence of both male- and female-sterility that were likely caused by lack of homology and improper pairing during meiosis. While the multiple-branching habit, densely brown hairs (on corolla and pistil), orange-yellow corolla, and ovate fruit of F1 hybrid plants were similar to that of the C. hystrix parent, the appearance of the first pistillate flower was more similar to that of C. sativus parent. The diameter and internode length of the stem, and the shape and size of leaves and flowers were intermediate when compared to the parents. The chromosome number in the hybrid was doubled through somaclonal variation during embryo culture and regeneration process to restore the fertility. Pollen grains were released and fruits with viable seeds matured on fertile, synthetic amphidiploid plants. The results from flow cytometry indicated that, on average, 7.3% of the morphologically unique regenerants had the 4C DNA content of 2.35 pg relative to the 2C DNA content of the original F1 hybrid at 1.17 pg and, therefore, were likely chromosome-doubled F1 hybrids (2n = 38). Nutritional analysis indicated that the synthetic species had higher protein (0.78%) and mineral (0.35%) content compared to the normal pickling cucumber (0.62% and 0.27%, respectively), and could be considered a new Cucumis crop having a special place in the future agriculture. Preliminarily evaluation indicates that C. hystrix possesses a high level of root-knot nematode resistance, and that this resistance is partially expressed in the interspecific F1 and chromosome-doubled F1. This and the fact that the fruit morphology of the fertile amphidiploid differs during the growing season (e.g., short and long fruit) suggest that it could be useful in broadening the germplasm base of cucumber.",Amphidiploid; Cucumis; Interspecific hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036236647

Recent experiments, however, indicate that a hummingbird's ability to feed at artificial flowers of different lengths depends on the widths of the flowers. We examined if the broad range of flower lengths visited by many hummingbird species can be explained by the widths of the flowers. We predicted that both short- and long-billed hummingbirds would include long, wide flower species in their diets, but that short-billed hummingbirds would not include long, narrow flower species because nectar in these species might be beyond the reach of their bills. If so, the slope of the regression for flower width versus flower length should be smaller for flower species visited by longer-billed hummingbirds relative to those visited by shorter-billed hummingbirds. Analyses of data sets for some North American and Monteverde hummingbirds and their food plants were consistent with this prediction, and bill lengths were significantly correlated with the slopes of the regressions of flower width versus length for seven hummingbird species. Comparisons of observed flower use by some Monteverde hummingbird species to flower assemblages generated at random suggest that these significant regressions were not simply a result of allometric relationships between flower lengths and widths, but in some cases reflected active choice by the birds. The two hummingbird-flower data sets also differed significantly in the scaling of corolla width relative to corolla length. In particular, the Monteverde data set contained a large number of long, narrow flower species, which we suggest is a consequence of a different floral evolutionary history and association with long-billed hummingbird species. The evolutionary effects of hummingbirds and their flowers upon one another are more complex than has generally been realized, and a consideration of corolla length jointly with other floral characters may improve our understanding of hummingbird-flower relationships.",Flower morphology; Foraging behavior; Hummingbirds; Monteverde; North America; Pollination; Specialization; Trochilidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036230809

The present study examined visitation frequency, pollination efficiency, and pollinator importance of the full range of floral visitors to Geranium ihunbergii natural population, by measuring seed-set. During 2 years of observations, the flowers were visited by at least 45 insect species belonging to four orders. Among the main 22 visitor species, 11 species belonging to three orders (Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera) acted as the efficient pollinators. In both years, Hymenoptera, especially bees, was the most important pollinator to G. thunbergii. Thus, the flowers could be considered as bee-pollinated. However, the most important species were not constant between years. The study also documented that the efficient pollinators have larger body sizes. The dish-shaped floral morphology, taxonomically diverse pollinators, and temporal change in the most important pollinators indicate that G. thunbergii-pollinator interaction is a rather generalized system. The results suggest that casual observations of visitation, or even precise measurement of pollinator importance in a single season is insufficient to identify important pollinators.",Generalized system; Pollination efficiency; Seed-set; Visit duration; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037701532

Female flowers did not offer any rewards for pollinators and were larger than male flowers. Pollinators of A. quinata, such as small solitary bees and hoverflies, clearly discriminated between male and female flowers. Hoverflies always visited male flowers and rarely visited female flowers. In contrast, solitary bees tended to visit female flowers first when entering the array, but then switched to male flowers within the same foraging bout. This tendency disappeared when the sepal size of female flowers was experimentally reduced to the size of male flowers. Thus, observed non-randomness in flower choice by solitary bees may be caused by female > male sexual dimorphism and may increase the chance of cross-pollination and lower the probability of geitonogamous pollination in a single visit to a plant. Therefore, floral sexual dimorphism in A. quinata is considered to be an adaptation for deceptive pollination associated with discriminating pollinators.",Akebia quinata; Deceptive pollination; Floral dimorphism; Geitonogamous pollination; Unisexual flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038377426

Here, we analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2) Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape context at different spatial scales. We selected 15 landscape sectors and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic Information Systems. The percentage of seminatural habitats varied between 1.4% and 28%. In the center of each landscape sector a patch of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species identification. Species richness and abundance of solitary wild bees showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural habitats at small scales up to 750 m, whereas bumble bees and honey bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast, honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant-pollinator and competitive wild bees-honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape context for local pollinator communities.",Bees; Biotic interactions; Community structure; Connectivity; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape ecology; Pollination; Spatial scales; Species diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0010539443

This work describes the patterns of quantitative genetic variation in susceptibility to attack by Perga affinis ssp. insularis, based on data from a large open-pollinated trial containing genetic material from throughout the geographic range of E. globulus ssp. globulus Forty three per cent of the trees in the trial exhibited damage from sawflies in either their sixth or seventh growth seasons. The incidence of damage was genetically based, with significant variation between geographic races of E. globulus ssp. globulus and highly heritable (h2 = 0.43 ± 0.05) variation in damage incidence within races. Susceptibility to sawfly damage significantly affects plant fitness with both genetic and environmental correlations demonstrating that sawfly damage causes slow growth and increased mortality of trees. Mild and severe sawfly damage resulted in 16 and 31% reduction in the basal area of surviving trees, and the effect was consistent across races and families. Based on this data, we propose a model predicting relative plantation productivity of races of different susceptibility under different infestation regimes. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The spatial and taxonomic extent over which masting is synchronized can determine its success in enhancing individual plant fitness as well as its ecosystemlevel effects, and it can indicate the types of proximal cues that enable reproductive synchrony. Here, we demonstrate high intra- and intergeneric synchrony in mast seeding by 17 species of New Zealand plants from four families across &gt; 150 000 km2. The synchronous species vary ecologically (pollination and dispersal modes) and are geographically widely separated, so intergeneric synchrony seems unlikely to be adaptive per se. Synchronous fruiting by these species was associated with anomalously high temperatures the summer before seedfall, a cue linked with the La Niña phase of El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The lone asynchronous species appears to respond to summer temperatures, but with a 2-yr rather than 1-yr time lag. The importance of temperature anomalies as cues for synchronized masting suggests that the timing and intensity of masting may be sensitive to global climate change, with widespread effects on taxonomically disparate plant and animal communities.",Abiotic factors; Chionochloa; Cross-correlation; Dacrydium; El Niño-Southern Oscillation; Elaeocarpus; Masting; New Zealand; Nothofagus; Phormium; Synchrony; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012168027

Comparison of the phenotypic distributions in zygotic and apozygotic progenies did not reveal significant differences in the CMS expression, although the latter is determined by the maternal S-plasmotype and both maternal and paternal (pollinator) genotypes in zygotic progenies and only by the maternal S-plasmotype and genotype in apozygotic progenies.

The F1 progenies were classified through a visual progeny test carried out on few F2 plants. The number of sexual F1s highly exceeded the apomictics leading to the conclusion that apomixis was controlled by a few recessive genes. The present study examines the inheritance of apospory in bahiagrass. A sexual plant was self-pollinated and crossed with an aposporous apomictic plant as pollen donor. Backcross and F2 progenies were obtained in several combinations. All self-pollinated sexual plants or sexual × sexual crosses produced progenies free of apospory. All crosses involving a sexual and an apomictic plant produced approximately three times more apospory-free plants than plants with apospory. Bahiagrass is of autotetraploid origin and hence is expected to display tetrasomic inheritance. The most widely accepted genetic model for inheritance of apospory in tropical grasses is a single dominant gene with tetrasomic inheritance. In the present experiments none of the apospory-free F1s segregated for the apospory trait indicating that it is most likely a dominant character. However, the observed results fit better a modified model: tetrasomic inheritance of a single dominant gene with pleiotropic effect and incomplete penetrance. The excess of apospory-free plants in the F1 progeny could be ascribed to some distortion in the segregation pattern due to a pleiotropic lethal effect of the dominant A allele with incomplete penetrance. Alternatively, partial lethality of factors linked to aposporous gene may account for segregation distortion against apospory.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036112307

We have shown that Tropicoseius sp. flower mites consume almost half the nectar secreted by the long-lived, protandrous flowers of Moussonia deppeana (Gesneriaceae) pollinated by Lampornis amethystinus (Trochilidae). In this paper, we ask whether mimicking nectar consumption of flower mites alters some aspects of hummingbird foraging patterns, and, if so, how this affects host plant seed production. We observed hummingbirds foraging on (a) plants in which nectar was removed from the flowers and then filled with a sugar solution to half the volume of nectar simulating nectar consumption by flower mites, and (b) plants where nectar was removed and then filled with the sugar solution up to normal nectar volumes. Flower mites were excluded from both groups of plants to control for mite activity. Hummingbirds made fewer but longer visits to plants and revisited more the flowers with nectar removal than those without the treatment. We then conducted a pollination experiment on pistillate flowers using a stuffed L. amethystinus hummingbird to evaluate the effect of pollination intensity (number of bill insertions into one flower) on seed production. Flowers with more insertions produced significantly more seeds than those flowers that received fewer insertions. We conclude that the simulation of nectar consumption by hummingbird flower mites can influence the behavior of the pollinator, and this may positively affect seed production.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036228533

In pH-drift experiments, the final concentration of CO2 was driven below 1 ?mol CO21-1 (0.01-0.07 ?mol 1-1 for at range of alkalinities) and rates of carbon uptake were around 400 ?mol carbon g-1 DW h-1 at an essentially zero CO2 concentration at high alkalinity.

Variation among families in both traits was highly significant in all selection units and at all assessment ages, but the levels of genetic variability varied greatly among them. The estimates of individual, family, and within-family heritability for 15-year height ranged from 0.15 to 0.34, 0.61 to 0.84, and 0.12 to 0.28, respectively, among selection units. The corresponding estimates for 20-year DBH varied from 0.10 to 0.23, 0.50 to 0.81, and 0.08 to 0.18, respectively. In all three selection units, temporal variation in individual, family and within-family heritabilities of height displayed parallel patterns and they all started at the highest values at age 3, decreased to the lowest at about age 10, and raised at age 15. Genetic correlation between height and diameter was always positive and impressively strong (&gt;0.87 at age 15). The estimated coefficients of age-age genetic correlation in height fit the logarithmic relationships (rA = a + b (LAR) and rA = a + b (LAR2)) very well (R2 &gt; 0.94) in all selection units but the prediction models of age-age genetic correlation developed in the Prince Rupert selection unit were apparently different from the others. The optimum plantation ages for early selection were calculated to be 15 and 16 years for Prince Rupert selection unit using the LAR and LAR2 prediction model, respectively, and 7 years for both the East Kootenay and Prince George selection units using both models. Overall, the Lambeth model (rA = 1.02 + 0.308 (LAR)) developed based on phenotypic correlation of height in Pinaceae tends to underestimate the age-age genetic correlation in interior spruce in BC. Type-b genetic correlation between sites within East Kootenay and Prince George selection units was always positive and strong, but weak positive and even negative correlation was observed between sites in the Prince Rupert selection unit. This observation suggests that the first two selection units may need expansion while the third requires more regionalization for proper breeding and seed planning.",Early selection; Genetic correlation; Genotype x environment interaction; Heritability; Interior spruce; Open-pollinated progeny test; Picea englemannii; Picea glauca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037171975

Fifty-two months after planting, mean height was 7.39 m and mean diameter at breast height (dbh) was 8.02 cm. It is difficult to sample natural provenances of this species because of small effective population sizes. However, there were significant differences between provenances in tree height, stem axis persistence and stem straightness. Of provenances represented by five or more families in the trial, the most vigorous was Duck Creek from New South Wales (mean height 7.57 m and dbh 8.63 m), while the slowest-growing was Rappville, New South Wales (height 6.43 m and dbh 6.97 m). This accorded with the good ranking of Duck Creek in provenance trials elsewhere. Assuming a coefficient of relationship of 0.3 among individuals within families, within-provenance individual-tree heritabilities for height and dbh were very high for height and for dbh at 52 months (0.87 and 0.61 respectively), but only 0.11 for axis persistence and non-significant for stem straightness. The breeding system of G. robusta (obligate outcrossing) may also contribute to the high heritabilities in growth traits by reducing within-family variance. The genetic correlation between height and dbh at 52 months age was high (+0.89) while those between axis persistence and height (+0.18) and axis persistence and dbh (+0.19) were much lower.

Vegetation change induced by large herbivores is driven by the effects of grazers on populations of individual plant species. Short-term experimental or demographic studies may be insufficient when investigating the population responses of long-lived clonal plant species. 2. We therefore examined the effects of grazing on such a plant (Veratrum album) by comparing the spatial and genetic structure of populations in grasslands subject to long-term grazing or mowing for hay. 3. V. album is a locally dominant species that is avoided by large herbivores due to its toxicity. RAPD-phenotypes of a subsample of c. 50 shoots, and co-ordinates and dry weight of all shoots, were determined in a 5 × 10 m plot in each of four meadow and four pasture populations. 4. The breeding system of the genus Veratrum was previously unknown but our experimental finding that cross-pollinated but not self-pollinated or unpollinated flowers produced as many seeds as freely pollinated flowers suggested that V. album is a predominantly cross-pollinating species. 5. Both the spatial and genetic population structure differed markedly between the two grassland types. Clonal expansion of established plants in pastures led to populations consisting of larger shoots that were significantly more aggregated at a small spatial scale. Populations also had a higher proportion of flowering shoots, less seedling recruitment and a lower genotypic diversity in pastures than hay meadows. 6. The differences in population structure appear to be due to hay meadow populations reproducing primarily by seeds, whereas clonal reproduction accounts for half of the population growth in pastures. We suggest that, as livestock selectively avoids V. album shoots, grazing indirectly promotes plant growth, which results in an enhanced vegetative reproduction as well as a higher seed production. Experimental studies are, however, needed to determine why and how grazing adversely affects seedling recruitment. 7. Detailed information on population level responses of unpalatable dominant plant species, such as provided by the present study, may help us understand and predict vegetation change in response to changing levels of herbivory.",Breeding system; Genotypic diversity; Herbivores; Mode of reproduction; RAPD-phenotype; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036231520

We studied possible behavioral mechanisms underlying the formation of flower size preferences in bumblebees, using a two-phase laboratory experiment. Experimentally naive Bombus terrestris (L.) foraged on artificial flowers that bore either a large (3.8 cm diameter) or a small (2.7 cm diameter) display of a uniform color. Only flowers of one display size contained nectar rewards. We changed the display color and the locations of large and small flowers in the second experimental phase. We recorded the bees' choices in both phases. Almost half of the bees (41%) made their first visit to a small flower. The bees learned to associate display size with food reward, and chose rewarding flowers with >85% accuracy by the end of each experimental phase. Some learning occurred within the bees' first three flower visits. Learning of the size-reward association was equally good for large and small displays in the first experimental phase, but better for small displays in the second phase. Formation of size-reward associations followed a similar course in both phases. This suggests that the bees did not apply their experience from the first learning phase to the new situation of the second phase. Rather, they treated each phase of the experiment as an independent learning task. Our results suggest that associative learning is involved in the formation of preferences for large displays by bees. Moreover, bees that had learned to prefer large displays in one foraging situation may not transfer this preference to a novel situation that is sufficiently different. We propose that this feature of the bees' behavior can select for honest advertising in flowers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036221651

Yet the theory of coevolution of mutualists is virtually nonexistent, by contrast with well-developed coevolutionary theories of competition, predator-prey and host-parasite interactions. This has prevented resolution of a basic puzzle posed by mutualisms: their persistence in spite of apparent evolutionary instability. The selective advantage of 'cheating', that is, reaping mutualistic benefits while providing fewer commodities to the partner species, is commonly believed to erode a mutualistic interaction, leading to its dissolution or reciprocal extinction. However, recent empirical findings indicate that stable associations of mutualists and cheaters have existed over long evolutionary periods. Here, we show that asymmetrical competition within species for the commodities offered by mutualistic partners provides a simple and testable ecological mechanism that can account for the long-term persistence of mutualisms. Cheating, in effect, establishes a background against which better mutualists can display any competitive superiority. This can lead to the coexistence and divergence of mutualist and cheater phenotypes, as well as to the coexistence of ecologically similar, but unrelated mutualists and cheaters.",Asymmetrical competition; Cheating; Evolutionary branching; Evolutionary stability; Mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041930120

The present study has demonstrated that in the presence of small amounts of water, the type of lipids used defined the time of hydration of pollen in vivo on the stigma and in vitro. Several approaches were used including cryo-scanning electron microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging and Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopic imaging, with the purpose of detecting very small amounts of water. The results show that no water is detectable in the lipid matrix. It was observed and concluded that the water for pollen hydration accumulates as a thin layer at the contact side between pollen and stigma, during the normal process of pollination in plant species with a wet stigma. However, using the same species deprived of the stigma by cell ablation, it was shown that the layer of water observed in wild-type plants is not necessary for pollen hydration.",Hydration; Lipids; Pollen-stigma interaction; Water flow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036222031

Honey bees display foraging behaviour in cashew orchards conducive to cross-pollination, but in plantations originating from clonal material they failed to increase fruit yield despite cashew's dependence on insect pollination.

The level of hybridization was determined using random amplified polymorphic DNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism markers. All of the resulting plants were found to be diploid 2n=34. Reciprocal crosses led to different progenies, with phenotypes that were predominantly similar to that of the female sunflower or the H. mollis type.

The two species have distinct floral morphologies and pollinators, but share a common predispersal seed predator that oviposits under the calyces of buds. Ipomopsis aggregata buds emitted fewer compounds than the corollas. The buds of I. aggregata were dominated by ?-pinene and, to a lesser extent, ?-pinene. The corollas of I. aggregata emitted a mixture of 10 compounds. Like the buds, I. aggregata corollas produced relatively high concentrations of ?-pinene as well as caryophyllene. In addition, the emission of four terpenoids, three esters, and one ketone added to the volatile bouquet of the corollas. Polemonium foliosissimum buds also emitted fewer compounds than the corollas. The buds of P. foliosissimum were dominated by ?-pinene and, to a lesser extent, ?-pinene. The corollas of P. foliosissimum were also dominated by ?-pinene along with three terpenoids, three alcohols, one ester, and two aldehydes. Comparing I. aggregata and P. foliosissimum, bud samples from both species produced considerable amounts of ?- and ?-pinene. Ipomopsis aggregata emitted more ?-pinene than ?-pinene, while P. foliosissimum emitted more ?-pinene. The corollas of the two species, however, differed in their volatile bouquet. The partition of volatiles between I. aggregata and P. foliosissimum buds and corollas and differences in volatile production between I. aggregata and P. foliosissimum are consistent with selection pressures exerted by organisms interacting with these plants.",Floral volatiles; Ipomopsis aggregata; Polemoniaceae; Polemonium foliosissimum; Pollinators; Seed predators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036009713

Three measurements of endoreduplication were calculated from these data and analyzed as quantitative genetic traits. Multiple models of trait inheritance were considered including triploid, diploid, sporophytic maternal, and maternal and paternal zygotic nuclear inheritance. Maternal zygotic effects, often considered a form of parental imprinting, and maternal sporophytic effects were detected. To test the feasibility of introgressing a high endoreduplication phenotype into a midwestern dent inbred line, a backcross population was generated from B73 × Sg18.

At each site two study plots with comparable vegetation and soils but contrasting management (grazing) histories were chosen, the disturbed sites having fewer perennial shrubs and generally more annuals and bare ground. Beetles collected using coloured pan-traps showed a consistently higher abundance in disturbed sites. Lepithrix, Denticnema and Heterochelus had higher numbers in disturbed plots, while Peritrichia numbers were lower in disturbed areas. Measures of species richness and diversity were consistently higher in the undisturbed sites. Distinctive assemblages of monkey beetles and plants occurred at each site. A high compositional turnover (? diversity) was recorded for both monkey beetles and plants along a rainfall gradient; between-site ? diversity values ranged from 0.7 to 0.8 (out of a maximum of 1.0). Species turnover of beetles was higher between the disturbed sites along the environmental gradient than the corresponding undisturbed sites. The high monkey beetle species turnover is probably linked to the high plant species turnover, a distinctive feature of succulent Karoo landscapes. Monkey beetles are useful indicators of overgrazing disturbance in Namaqualand, as their pollinator guilds are apparently disrupted by overgrazing. A shift away from perennial and bulb pollinator guilds towards those favouring weedy annuals was observed in disturbed areas. The consequences to ecosystem processes due to the effects of disturbance on monkey beetle communities and the role of monkey beetles as indicators of disturbance is discussed, as well as the implications of disturbance on monkey beetle pollination guilds.",Beetle/plant associations; Communities; Rangeland disturbance; Species turnover; Succulent vegetation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036206549

Their decline has been greatest in intensively managed agricultural areas and associated with the decline in suitable forage plants. The objective of this study was to compare the abundance and diversity of forage plants and bumblebees in agricultural and semi-natural habitats in Estonia, where land management for agriculture is less intensive than in western Europe. Six localities were surveyed, each by two census transects (1000 m long × 2 m wide), one passing through a semi-natural habitat and the other through an agricultural habitat. Flower abundance and bumblebee visitors to flowers along the transects were recorded on 4 days per transect during late July/early August in each of 3 years. No significant difference in the abundance of either flowering forage plants or bumblebees between agricultural and semi-natural habitats was found. However, the number of bumblebee species observed in agricultural areas was significantly smaller than the number in adjacent semi-natural areas. The smaller proportion of preferred forage plants in the agricultural habitat was a possible reason for its reduced bumblebee species richness. For example, in the agricultural habitat, the annual and biennial plants tended to be more common and the hemiparasitic Melampyrum nemorosum significantly less common, among the flowers visited by bumblebees, than in the semi-natural habitat. The proportion of stable micro-habitats, which are not subjected to ploughing and root disturbance and therefore allow establishment of highly preferred forage plants, rather than the overall quantity of any kinds of refuge areas between cultivated lands, may be critical for the species richness of bumblebee communities in agro-ecosystems. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Anna, Via Carducci 40, 56127 Pisa, Italy","Most agricultural landscapes are a mosaic of farmers' fields, semi-natural habitats, human infrastructures (e.g. roads) and occasional natural habitats. Within such landscapes, linear semi-natural habitats often define the edges of agricultural fields. This paper reviews the role and interactions within and between the flora of these elements. In temperate, intensive agriculture, such field margin habitats, which historically had true agricultural functions, now are important refugia for biodiversity. As manmade habitats, field margins may also have important cultural roles as part of our landscape heritage, e.g. hedges in Britain. Whilst field margins are not usually specific habitat types, they contain a variety of plant communities in a variety of structures. These may range from aquatic elements to ruderal and woodland communities. Studies demonstrate a variety of interactions between fields and their margins. Agricultural operations, such as fertiliser and pesticide application, have effects on the flora. Some margin flora may spread into crops, becoming field weeds. Margins also have a range of associated fauna, some of which may be pest species, while many are beneficial, either as crop pollinators or as pest predators. The biodiversity of the margin may be of particular importance for the maintenance of species at higher trophic levels, notably farmland birds, at the landscape scale. Margins contribute to the sustainability of production, by enhancing beneficial species within crops and reducing pesticide use. In northwestern Europe, a variety of methods to enhance diversity at field edges have been introduced, including sown grass and flower strips. The impact of these on weed flora and arthropods indicate mostly beneficial effects though conflicts exist, notably for the conservation of rare arable weed species. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study examines an array of morphological traits and describes geographic patterns of variation throughout the range of the species. Univariate and multivariate analysis of morphometric data from eight sites across the range of the species shows significant among-population variation in 19 out of 20 vegetative and floral traits measured. Flower size variation is particularly strong and follows a latitudinal cline, with flowers being much larger in the southern part of the range and smaller in the northern part of the range. Observations also indicate differences in floral visitors between northern and southern populations. While flowers in all populations were visited by hummingbirds, the large-bodied hummingbirds visiting plants in the southern regions are not present in the northern regions, where flowers are visited by hummingbirds with nearly half the body size and much shorter bills. This difference in body size of pollinators mirrors the geographic variation in flower size in M. viridiflora, suggesting that pollinator-mediated selection may be acting upon the species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036126548

Incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear phylogenies suggests that hybridization may have played a role in the evolution of L. acerifolia.

Although the best fruit-set success was obtained with PB 5/51 following artificial (hand) pollination, this clonal trait was not reflected in terms of greater numbers of pollen tubes developing it the styles of hand-pollinated PB 5/51 female flowers. It was observed, however, that more pollen tubes reached the ovules in PB 5/51 than in RRIM 600 or PR 107. Significantly, PB 5/51 female flowers required fewer pollen tubes to effect penetration of all three of its ovules. As fruit formation in Hevea is dependent on all three ovules of the flower being successfully fertilised, PB 5/51 female flowers have hence a greater propensity for successful fruit-set. In all the three clones studied, the frequency distribution of female flowers with 0, 1, 2 or 3 of the ovules penetrated by pollen tubes did not conform to binomial expectations. Flowers with no ovule penetrated and flowers with all three ovules penetrated were greatly over-represented. One explanation for this non-random distribution is the existence of 'receptive' female flowers that favour successful fertilisation whereas 'non-receptive' flowers tend to remain unfertilised even when hand-pollinated.",Clones; Female flower; Fruit-set; Hand-pollination; Hevea brasiliensis; Pollen tube; Rubber tree,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036123574

A detailed documentation of the behavior of pollen foragers in the hive under different pollen need conditions is presented here. Taking a broad observational approach, we analyze the behavior of individual pollen foragers in the hive between collecting trips and quantify the different variables constituting the in-hive stay. Comparing data from two colonies and 143 individuals during experimentally induced times of low vs. times of high pollen need, we show that individual foragers modulate their in-hive working tempo according to the actual pollen need of the colony: pollen foragers slowed down and stayed in the hive longer when pollen need was low and spent less time in the hive between foraging trips when pollen need by their colony was high. Furthermore, our data show a significant change in the trophallactic experience of pollen foragers with changing pollen need conditions of their colony. Pollen foragers had more short (< 3 s) trophallactic contacts when pollen need was high, resulting in an increase of total number of trophallactic contacts. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that trophallactic experience is one of the various information pathways used by pollen foragers to assess their colony's pollen need.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036123782

Spurs have arisen frequently and rapidly in many taxa. To test their potential origins, we isolated spontaneous dominant mutations at two loci, HIRZ and INA, that cause novel outgrowths from Antirrhinum petals, resembling the petal spurs of closely related genera. Results: HIRZ and INA were isolated and shown to encode similar KNOX homeodomain proteins that are normally expressed only in apical meristems and are likely to act redundantly. Both dominant mutations were caused by transposon insertions in noncoding regions that caused ectopic expression of functional transcripts, either in petals or in all lateral organs with more pleiotropic effects. Formation of a spur-like outgrowth, which resembled an ectopic petal tube, was dependent both on KNOX gene expression and dorsiventral asymmetry of the flower. Conclusions: These mutations provide an example of how petal spurs might evolve rapidly due to changes in regulatory gene expression.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037006794

In the present paper, the trnL-F and ITS gene sequences of the representatives were used to examine the sister relationships of these two vicariad species. A heuristic parsimony analysis based on the trnL-F data identified Diphylleia as the basal clade of the other three genera, but provided poor resolution of their interrelationships. High sequence divergence was found in the ITS data. ITS1 region, more variable but parsimony-uninformative, has no phylogenetic value. Sequence divergence of the ITS2 region provided abundant, phylogenetically informative variable characters. Analysis of ITS2 sequences confirmeda sister relationship between the presumable vicariad species, in spite of a low bootstrap support for Sinopodophyllum hexandrum vs. Podophyllum pelatum. The combined ITS2 and trnL-F data enforced a sister relationship between Sinopodophyllum hexandrum and Podophyllum pelatum with an elevated bootstrap support of 100%. Based on molecular phylogeny, the morphological evolution of this group was discussed. The self-pollination might have evolved from cross-fertilization two times in this group. The different pollination and seed dispersal systems of Sinopodophyllum hexandrum and Podophyllum pelatum resulted from their adaptations to different ecological habitats. The divergence time of Sinopodophyllum hexandrum -Podophyllum pelatum is estimated to be 6.52±1.89 myr based on the ITS divergence. The divergence of this species pair predated or co-occurred with the recent uplift of the Himalayas 4-3 myr during the late Miocene and the formation of the alpine habitats. Sinopodophyllum hexandrum developed a host of specialized characters in its subsequent adaptation to the arid alpine surroundings. The present study confirmed the different patterns of species relationship between Asian-North American disjuncts.

This research included ten combinations of crosses with six crossing types (Lilium longiflorum X Asiatic hybrid, LA; Oriental hybrid X Asiatic hybrid, OA; Oriental hybrid X Lilium longiflorum, OL; Lilium longiflorum X Oriental hybrid, LO; Asiatic hybrid X Oriental hybrid, AO; and Asiatic hybrid X Lilium longiflorum, AL). Four culture methods - ovary slice culture (OSC), ovule with placenta culture (OPC), young single ovule culture (YOC), and embryo (sac) rescue method (ESR) - were used to culture the fertilized ovules after cut style pollination on plants. The OSC method could be used to obtain hybrid plants in each of the crossing types (0.1-2% success), except for in the OA, AO, and AL crossings. With the OPC method, ovule germinated (0.2-0.8% success) only when Lilium longiflorum ""Gerlia"" was used as the maternal parent. OSC and OPC required more complicated manipulations. When using the YOC method, ovules were harvested 10 days after the interspecific crosses, and embryo could be germinated from various genotype combinations (0.1-1.1% success). The number of days after pollination (DAP) required for ovule germination in this method (60-125 DAP) was fewer than in the OSC (73-155 DAP) and OPC (57-152 DAP) methods. More plantlets were obtained by the ESR method. The value of the ESR method is that, in the OA crossing, the embryo could only be germinated (0.2-0.3% success) after about 2-3 months of cut style pollination. Apomixes were found in the ovules in some of the cases in this crossing type. No plantlets were obtained in the AL or AO crossings with any of the culture methods tested.

Why numerous species develop both of the reproductive modes on the same individuals has long puzzled biologists. In a novel hypothesis presented here, I propose that cleistogamy could be a means by which inbred lines are created and maintained in natural populations; these lines would continuously experience self-improvement via natural selection and via crosses among lines at the chasmogamous flowers to benefit the populations. Supporting evidence for the hypothesis was found in Impatiens capensis where cleistogamous ovules were fertilized proportionately less (56%) than chasmogamous ovules (67%) in natural populations, but crosses among cleistogamous progeny in the greenhouse led to a nearly 10% increase of fertilized chasmogamous ovules. I established a novel fitness model specific to the cleistogamous species to further examine how various aspects of the mating system affect plant performance. A low inbreeding depression (0.07) was consequently found for the surveyed natural populations of I. capensis, suggesting that the individual-level percentage of cleistogamy and the population-level selfing rate may have evolved in the direction of reducing the overall inbreeding depression. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Chasmogamy; Fertilization rate; Fitness model; Inbreeding depression; Ovule number; Percentage cleistogamy; Plant final height,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036553002

Intensive flowering and seed production occur only once in several years, often synchronized over a long distance. In a previous paper, we showed that the limitation of fruit production by the outcross pollen availability can bring about synchronized reproduction of trees in a constant environment, assuming that pollen availability depends on the mean flowering intensity of the trees. However, pollen exchange normally occurs within a distance much shorter than the extent of the whole forest. We studied a coupled map lattice, in which each tree engages in the chaotic dynamics of energy reserve level, but different trees are coupled by pollen exchange with neighbors. We first derived a relation between two statistics of spatial covariance (dynamic spatial covariance and snapshot spatial covariance). A strong synchronization of tree reproduction can develop over the whole forest that may be orders of magnitude larger than the distance of direct pollen exchange between trees. The fluctuation is close to a cycle with a period of two years. The model of local coupling always generates non-uniform spatial patterns, but the enhanced spatial covariance caused by the spatial heterogeneity is restricted to a short range, only a few times larger than the spatial range of direct interaction. When pollen exchange occurs beyond the nearest neighbors, the local spatial pattern becomes proportionally larger, but the condition for synchronization of the whole forest and its magnitude are the same as for the case with the nearest neighbor pollen exchange. When a fraction of the seeds are sired by globally dispersed pollen and the rest are sired by local pollen, long-range synchronization can occur for a wide-parameter region, and trees may engage in a fluctuation with a masting interval longer than two years. We discuss alternative explanations for the long-range synchronization of beech forests.","Beech forest; Coupled map lattice; Dynamic spatial covariance; Japan; Masting; Pollen coupling of trees; Synchronization, long-range",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000418828

In constrast, within the inflorescences, the flowers located at a lower position of the inflorescence and which opened earlier showed higher fruit set than those at a higher position and which opened later. However, the seed set of matured capsules were not significantly different from each other, regardless of the position of flowers within the inflorescences. Patterns of the fruit- and seed set under open pollination indicated that variation in seed reproduction of M. roseum is due to variation in fruit production. The results of clipping experiments of flowers revealed that there was no functional limitation in seed production among flowers located at various positions within the inflorescence. It seemed that the variation in the fruit set within the inflorescences of M. roseum was not attributable to 'architectural effects'. Reduction of the number of flowers within the inflorescences resulted in an increase of fruit set and seed weight, indicating that the flowers in an inflorescence compete for resources. This phenomenon supports the 'resource competition hypothesis', and variation in fruit set within the inflorescence is attributable to competition among flowers within the inflorescence for limited resources. Consequently, it was concluded that, under natural conditions, the early blooming flowers located at lower positions of the inflorescences obtain more resources and produce more fruits than the late blooming flowers located at higher positions in M. roseum.",Clipping experiment; Fruit set; Inflorescence; Melampyrum; Resource competition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036550594

To characterize and evaluate the ecological and reproductive features of wild soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. et Zucc.), which is the most probable ancestor of cultivated soybean (G. max (L) Merr.), the breeding system and genetic diversity of G. soja were investigated. The extent of natural cross-pollination of G. soja was estimated in four populations along the Omono River in Akita Prefecture, Japan by examining allozyme variation. Although it has been previously believed that G. soja is autogamous, as is cultivated soybean, the mean multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) estimate was 13%. These values are much higher than the outcrossing rate previously reported for both G. soja and G. max. Frequent visits by honeybees and carpenter bees to flowers were also observed, which supported this conjecture. Furthermore, to evaluate the genetic variation of G. soja as a genetic resource, the genetic structure of 447 populations over Japan were analyzed. Wild soybean populations had a higher degree of variation of isozyme loci. The GST coefficient of gene differentian values among the sites within the district were particularly high, revealing that the isozyme genotype was greatly different among site populations and homogeneous within the sites. The genetic differentiation among nine districts was observed in the allele frequencies of a few loci, indicating that geographic isolation in the wild soybean population was effectively created through the distance between the districts.

The population of R. metternichii occurred as three subpopulations at the study site (A1-A3). Pairwise relatedness based on microsatellite genotypes at eight loci and Mantel tests revealed a hierarchical structure of relatedness within and among subpopulations: (i) relatedness between individuals within 10 m of one another was significantly positive; (ii) relatedness between individuals in the same subpopulation was significantly positive, but negative between individuals in distant subpopulations; and (iii) relatedness was not significantly different from zero among neighbouring subpopulations. In detail, however, relatedness within each subpopulation was significantly positive in subpopulation A1, relatively weak but significantly positive in subpopulation A2, and not significantly different from zero in subpopulation A3. Relatedness within each subpopulation was inversely related to correlations between interindividual distance and relatedness. The aggregation of related individuals at short distances from one another may lead to decreasing relatedness within subpopulations as a whole. Moreover, negative correlations between interindividual distance and relatedness corresponded to high flowering densities at less than 10-m distance, implying that high flowering densities reduce pollinator foraging distance and lead to stronger genetic structure within subpopulations. Small individuals (<2.0 m in height) showed stronger genetic structure compared with that of large individuals (?2.0 m in height). The different relatedness structure within and among subpopulations may be caused by various degrees of gene flow affected by distribution patterns of individuals and population density.",Gene flow; Genetic structure; Mantel test; Microsatellite; Pairwise relatedness; Population structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036006371

This cDNA clone was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein that oxidized GA9 and GA12 to GA4 and GA14, respectively. The Cv3h protein had the highest similarity with pumpkin GA 2?,3?-hydroxylase, but did not possess 2?-hydroxylation function. RNA blot analysis showed that the gene was expressed primarily in the inner parts of developing seeds, up to 10 d after pollination (DAP). In the parthenocarpic fruits induced by treatment with 1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU), the embryo and endosperm of the seeds were undeveloped, whereas the integumental tissues, of maternal origin, showed nearly normal development. Cv3h mRNA was undetectable in the seeds of CPPU-treated fruits, indicating that the GA 3?-hydroxylase gene was expressed in zygotic cells. In our analysis of endogenous GAs from developing seeds, GA9 and GA4 were detected at high levels but those of GA20 and GA1 were very low. This demonstrates that GA biosynthesis in seeds prefers a non-13-hydroxylation pathway over an early 13-hydroxylation pathway. We also analyzed endogenous GAs from seeds of the parthenocarpic fruits. The level of bioactive GA4 was much lower there than in normal seeds, indicating that bioactive GAs, unconnected with Cv3h, exist in integumental tissues during early seed development.",Citrullus lanatus; Gibberellin 3?-hydroxylase; Parthenocarpic fruit; Seed development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036005915

If pollination is unpredictable, selection may favour the production of selfed seeds in the absence of pollen vectors, even in plant species with obvious adaptations for outcrossing. Pollination may be less predictable for plants growing in certain environments if environmental factors affect the floral phenotype. Through effects on flower morphology and the floral display, the environment may affect the outcrossing rate. 2. We manipulated two environmental factors, water availability and exposure to insect herbivores, in a common-garden experiment using a perennial herb, Datura wrightii. We measured herkogamy (the separation of anthers and stigmas within flowers), total flower length, and flower number, and used a single-gene trichome dimorphism as a marker to determine per-plant outcrossing rates. 3. The large amount of variation in herkogamy was affected by trichome type, irrigation and herbivory. In addition, watered plants had longer corollas, and plants attacked by herbivores had fewer open flowers. Thus environmental factors affect floral phenotype. 4. However, irrigation and herbivory did not directly affect outcrossing rate. There were indirect effects of these treatments on outcrossing because plants with increased herkogamy and fewer open flowers had higher outcrossing rates. 5. A greenhouse experiment showed that autonomous selfing is more likely when herkogamy is reduced, and can occur both as the flower opens and when the corolla is shed. 6. These experiments are among the first to show that within-population variation in the mating system can be due to environmentally induced variation in floral traits.",Floral display; Herbivory; Herkogamy; Outcrossing rate; Self pollination; Water availability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036130001

There, at the margin of their range, both species are rare. Gentianella germanica persists on six remaining locations, whereas Gentianopsis ciliata, with two populations, is nearly extinct. Gentianella germanica is a strict biennial, Gentianopsis ciliata an iteroparous perennial. Both species depend on insects for seed production and suffer from low insect visitation. Pollination experiments in one Dutch population demonstrated that Gentianopsis ciliata is self-compatible, but hardly sets any seed under natural conditions due to pollen limitation. The low reproductive success of both species is partly due to the low pollinator densities at their late flowering time, partly caused by the small population size of the gentians themselves, and partly a result of mowing too early. The latter has destroyed the seed crop of several subsequent years in one population of Gentianopsis ciliata and some of Gentianella germanica. In Gentianella germanica, the early mowing and low insect visitation seems to have resulted in selection of less herkogamous and consequently more autofertile individuals. The perspectives for Gentianopsis ciliata are currently extremely poor in The Netherlands. Under the present circumstances, extinction will most likely occur within 10-20 years. Population reinforcement (seeding, artificial cross-pollination with nearby populations) should be considered if we want to conserve this species. For both gentians, but also of other flagship species of nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands, the total grassland area needs to be enlarged and must constitute an interconnected network of reserves. The traditional management method, sheep grazing, is to be preferred over mowing, but only if the flock visits each grassland patch or reserve for only a short time of less than a day, and with intervals of more than 2 weeks between visits. If mowing is preferred for other reasons, it should be done rotationally, and not before October. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The study population was characterized by exceptionally large phenotypic variation in flower-tube length (range 56-129 mm). Directional selection on tube length was revealed by a significant positive relationship between this trait and both fruit and seed set. Selection was attributed to the effect of tube length on pollen receipt, as supplemental hand pollinations showed fruit and seed set in the population to be pollen limited. Indirect selection on tube length may also occur through the correlation of this trait with inflorescence height, although direct selection on the latter trait was significant only for seed set. The main pollinators at the study site were individuals of the large hawkmoth Agrius convolvuli that had tongue lengths of 85-135 mm. Other hawkmoths had tongues that were much too short to reach the nectar in G. longicollis flowers and seldom carried pollen of G. longicollis. Flowers with tubes shorter than the tongues of A. convolvuli are apparently not effectively pollinated because stigmas do not contact the moth's head effectively.

Reproductive assurance, where self-fertilization ensures seed production when pollinators and/or potential mates are scarce, is the most longstanding and most widely accepted explanation for the evolution of selfing2-8, but there have been few experimental tests of this hypothesis. Moreover, many apparently adaptive floral mechanisms that ensure the autonomous production of selfed seed might use ovules that would have otherwise been outcrossed. This seed discounting is costly if selfed offspring are less viable than their outcrossed counterparts, as often happens. The fertility benefit of reproductive assurance has never been examined in the light of seed discounting. Here we combine experimental measures of reproductive assurance with marker-gene estimates of self-fertilization, seed discounting and inbreeding depression to show that, during 2 years in 10 Ontario populations of Aquilegia canadensis (Ranunculaceae), reproductive assurance through self-fertilization increases seed production, but this benefit is greatly outweighed by severe seed discounting and inbreeding depression.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037149477

Although tobacco is a self-compatible species, it displays unilateral incongruity with other Nicotiana plants. Incongruous pollination also results in ethylene production, but this production differs depending on the pollen used and is related to the extent to which pollen tubes grow in the tobacco style. In the investigation reported here we followed the expression of the ACC synthase- and ACC oxidase-coding genes upon pollination of tobacco pistils and compared self-pollination with incongruous pollination. The pattern of expression of these genes also correlated with pollen-tube growth, although wounding alone cannot explain the results obtained. We also examined the expression of these genes upon pollination of immature tobacco pistils, in which different pollen tubes grew indistinctly inside the tobacco style and reached the ovary at the same rate. In this situation no significant differences in gene expression could be observed between the different pollinations.

Bees moved between trapping stations at different sites within a day, and viable pollen therefore could have been transferred between populations. 4 Although euglossine bees were equally frequent in fragments and continuous forest, those recorded on islands were visitors from mainland sites, and not island residents. 5 Neither male nor female reproductive success were significantly different between island and mainland forest types in 1997. The higher reproductive success in certain sites within both forest types throughout the flowering season could not be explained by variation in overall population floral display. Larger inflorescences had higher male and female reproductive success. 6 In 2 of 3 years, plants on islands had significantly lower fruit set than plants on mainland sites. Female reproductive success differed dramatically across years and sites. 7 The low fruit set in 1996 and 1998 on islands in comparison with mainlands, and the observation that bees are not island residents, conform with expectations of physical isolation of forest patches. In spite of the evidence of fragmentation in this system, patterns of pollinator behaviour and of reproductive success suggest significant connectedness among sites. This 3-year study shows that a single year study may not have highlighted the complexity of the system.",Barro Colorado Island; Epiphytic orchid; Euglossine bee; Forest fragmentation; Plant reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036186765

We used a nuclear ribosomal ITS phylogeny, independent contrasts, and phylogenetically corrected path analysis to explore the patterns of covariance of the developmental and morphological traits potentially influencing mating system. Large-flowered taxa maintain herkogamy (spatial separation of anthers and stigmas) early in anthesis by differential elongation of staminal filaments, which positions each of the four anthers at the tip of the ""keel"" upon dehiscence. Small-flowered taxa do not show this pattern of filament elongation. The styles of large-flowered taxa elongate late in the 2-5 d of anthesis, resulting in late anther-stigma contact and delayed self-pollination. Anther-stigma contact and self-pollination occur early in anthesis in small-flowered species/populations. Thus, we found complex covariation of morphological and developmental traits that can be interpreted as the result of multitrait adaptation for early selfing and high levels of autogamy, delayed selfing and higher levels of outcrossing, or intermediate levels of outcrossing. Continuous variation in these traits suggests the operation of continuous variation in selective optima or the combined effects of divergent selection and phylogenetic inertia.",Autogamy; Collinsieae; Correlated evolution; Cross pollination; Flower development; Herkogamy; Mating system; Pollination; Scrophulariaceae; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036185873

In this study, the variation in flowering schedule among individuals in four subpopulations of Vaccinium hirtum Thunb. (Ericaceae) and the effects of pollinators, flower predators, and predispersal seed predators on fruit production of individuals for 2 years were investigated. To describe variation in the flowering schedule among individuals, new methods for calculating two quantitative indices, rank order and degree of synchrony with others, are presented. The methods are suitable for quantifying between-individual differences in the synchronous schedule of a temperate spring-bloom species. The 2-year phenological census showed that there was variation in flowering schedule within local subpopulations. In all subpopulations, the flowering rank was retained for 2 years, and in two subpopulations, the relative synchrony of individuals was also retained. Correlation analysis between flowering schedule and fruit set suggested that early-flowering individuals were at a disadvantage regarding pollinator availability. However, weevil and fly larvae attacks often counteracted the disadvantage; later-flowering individuals were predated more intensively than early-flowering ones. The response of V. hirtum subpopulations to the selection pressure against early flowering may be disturbed by temporal and spatial variations in the influence of pollinators and predators.",Flower predation; Flowering schedule; Phenotypic variation; Pollination; Predispersal seed predation; Vaccinium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036187868

But these two approaches have limited utility when used alone, because they use only part of the information that is available for a mapping population. More recently, a new mapping strategy has been designed to integrate the advantages of linkage analysis and linkage disequilibrium analysis for genome mapping in outcrossing populations. The new strategy makes use of a random sample from a panmictic population and the open-pollinated progeny of the sample. In this article, we extend the new strategy to map quantitative trait loci (QTL), using molecular markers within the EM-implemented maximum-likelihood framework. The most significant advantage of this extension is that both linkage and linkage disequilibrium between a marker and QTL can be estimated simultaneously, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of genome mapping for recalcitrant outcrossing species. Simulation studies are performed to test the statistical properties of the MLEs of genetic and genomic parameters including QTL allele frequency, QTL effects, QTL position, and the linkage disequilibrium of the QTL and a marker.

Forest fragmentation is likely to decrease gene fiow, increase endogamy, and eventually produce a high differentiation among remnant populations. Our objectives were to evaluate the effect of forest fragmentation on the reproductive success, progeny vigor, and genetic variation of the tropical dry-forest tree Samanea saman. We conducted our study in the dry forest of Costa Rica and compared two tree conditions to evaluate forest fragmentation: (1) isolated, individual trees more than 500 m from the nearest conspecific and surrounded by agricultural fields, pastures, or small remnant forest patches and (2) trees in continuous populations of 10 or more individuals per hectare and surrounded by undisturbed forest. We compared the probability of natural pollination, seed production, genetic variation, and progeny vigor of trees in isolation and in continuous populations. The probability of fiowers receiving more than 23 pollen tubes at the base of styles (the fiowers more likely to produce a mature fruit) was significantly greater for trees in continuous populations (2.1%) than for trees in isolation (0.4%). However, flowers from the two tree conditions received similar pollen loads on their stigmas. Fruits of trees from continuous populations produced similar numbers of seeds as isolated trees did and had a similar probability of seed abortion. The probability of seed predation by bruchid beetles was significantly greater in continuous populations (30%) than in isolated trees (20%). The number of undamaged seeds (potentially viable) was similar for both tree conditions. A genetic analysis of progeny showed that levels of genetic diversity in trees in isolation and in continuous populations were comparable. The effective self-fertilization rate and inbreeding coefficient of the progeny were slightly higher for isolated trees than for trees in continuous populations. In addition, there was more genetic similarity in the progeny of isolated trees, within and between fruits. Seeds produced by different fruits within a tree were more likely to be related in an isolated tree than in a tree from continuous populations. Seeds produced by trees from continuous populations were more likely to germinate and to produce greater leaf area and biomass as seedlings than progeny from isolated trees. We concluded that the fragmentation of tropical dry forests affects the genetic variation and vigor of S. saman progeny. Isolated trees showed high reproductive capacity, however, in spite of their habitat condition.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036185294

Shoots of Kashiwa oak withered away during winter because of sea breeze and cold, and succeeding production of female inflorescences were strongly affected by mortality of buds. Thus, strong sea breeze and cold winters reduced the survival ratio of buds and further resulted in reduction of female flowering. Number of female flowers was related with current acorn crops, however, survival of female flowers after pollination was strongly influenced by warmth in the flowering period. Regression analysis of the annual acorn crop versus weather conditions suggests that acorn crop was decreased by cool conditions in the flowering period. A model equation was constructed to estimate the annual acorn crops by three weather variables: cumulative velocity of sea breeze and mean monthly temperature in winter (December-March) and maximum monthly temperature in current flowering period (June).

Similarly, there were stronger J-M correlations in the high- than in the low-temperature treatment. The results suggest that genotype x environment (GxE) interaction between the juvenile and mature environment is one of the reasons for low J-M correlations.

Variation in extent and pattern of integration was neither distance-dependent nor significantly related to between-population variation in taxonomical composition and morphological diversity of the pollinator assemblage. Patterns of floral integration were closer to expectations derived from consideration of developmental affinities between floral whorls than to expectations based on a pollinator-mediated adaptive hypothesis.

However, scattered populations from southwestern Alps (southeastern France) are poorly represented in this network. Using a sample of 16 populations, two of which are already included in the network, the structural pattern of genetic diversity was investigated to help decide whether additional populations should be included in the conservation network. Traits were analyzed using both seeds and progenies of selected trees from natural stands (19-43 per stand) grown 4 years in nursery. The southwestern Alpine regional resource was structured into three ecological groups: Sub-Mediterranean Alps, Intermediate Alps and Ligurian Alps. Multivariate analyses were used to compare phytoecological distribution and variability of adaptive and non-adaptive traits. The following traits were analyzed: (i) isozyme diversity of open-pollinated seeds harvested from the stands (seven variables), (ii) mean monoterpene composition of original stands using nursery test progenies (seven variables) and (iii) growth, bud phenology and drought resistance traits using nursery test progenies (nine variables). The 3-group ecological diversity can be relatively well-explained by terpene data but not by isozyme or adaptive trait data. Synthetic variables generated from grouped original data concur with the ecological pattern. Most adaptive trait variability was found within populations, which indicates that selective forces operate at the micro-geographical level. This study suggests a lack of representative populations for the Abies alba genetic conservation network both in Ligurian and Sub-Mediterranean Alpine ecological group. It also suggests that due to isolation, the scattered Sub-Mediterranean ecological group has less non-adaptive genetic diversity and may require additional conservation focus. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The term diallagy (adj. diallagous) is proposed to describe the strategy of reversible change between the green and coloured states. It is here recorded for 99 species in 59 genera of 24 families of flowering plants, both monocots and dicots. These species occur in a number of widely distributed habitats. In some species, extent of colour change increases as long as the dry weather continues. The change generally is reversed after 10-15 mm or more of rain falls over a short period (24 hours). Regreening takes from several days to several weeks. The mechanisms operating within the plants are yet to be investigated, but possibilities are discussed to point the way to further research; some are likely to be similar to that reported for Borya. In an extreme dry summer such as that of 2000-2001, death occurs in some species. Paradoxically, other species flower at this season, in some cases close to diallagous species. It is suggested that these have retained a summer/autumn flowering period (from a tropical origin) to take advantage of pollinators at a season when few sources of nectar and pollen are available.",Autumn floweing; Diallagy; Dicots; Foliage colour change; Monocots; Sumer/autumn drought,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036523871

Threshold temperatures between 4 and 12°C were chosen using linear regression equations forced through the origin and their root mean square error (RMSE) of predicted against the observed dates for each observation site. Above the threshold, the average growing degree days (up to 1999) for the studied years was taken as the predictor value. Results showed a relationship between the selected threshold and elevation and a stronger and statistically significant correlation between threshold and yearly mean temperature, for each site. Regression analysis indicated that the selected threshold and the calculated heat accumulation were optimum for most of the localities.

On the other hand insufficient pollination is also possible, and is manifested by low crop production. In the present work, characteristics of nectar reward and floral morphology revealed that 'Jonathan' and 'Topred' flowers had similar nectar constitutions. However, honeybee behaviour was totally different in the two cultivars. 'Jonathan' flowers attracted fewer honeybees but, due to their anther arrangement, more of the flowers were approached from the top by honeybees collecting nectar than in 'Topred'.

The use of RAPD PCR for evaluating seed purity in a commercial F1-hybrid broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) cultivar is demonstrated. DNA from an F1-hybrid and its parental lines was subjected to RAPD PCR analysis with 20 random decamer arbitrary primers. Two primers produced suitable male and female specific markers and were chosen for purity testing of the F1-hybrid seeds. The level of sib (inbred seed, seed from self pollination of parental lines) contamination detected by RAPD analysis was comparable with the commonly used grow out trial, whereas isozyme analysis failed to differentiate between the parental lines. Our study clearly demonstrates that RAPD PCR is a useful tool for genetic purity testing of commercial F1-hybrid broccoli seeds.",F1 hybrid seed; Seed purity test,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036165713

The corollas and sepals were prevented from transpiring by greasing, to investigate the extent of evaporative cooling. In the exposed natural habitats of these flowers the maximum temperatures of air and soil were high (32 and 42°C, respectively) and corolla, sepal and gynoecium temperatures were often intermediate. Despite being almost astomatous, significant evaporative cooling was observed in the corolla. Between 20 and 80% of the energy absorbed by the corollas was dissipated as evaporation. The sepals were stomatous and their evaporative cooling was very important in reducing the temperature of the gynoecium. The temperatures of the non-transpiring gynoecia and corollas were significantly higher than the temperatures of the normally transpiring corollas and gynoecia. Furthermore, the gynoecia temperatures were significantly higher with non-transpiring corollas than with normally transpiring corollas, suggesting that the corollas alone play a role in maintaining the gynoecium within optimal temperatures levels. It was shown in an incubation experiment that temperatures exceeding 32°C may damage the carpels, and temperatures exceeding 42°C may damage sepals. Pollen grains were killed after 200 min of exposure to temperatures in the range 32 to 47°C. It is concluded that the cooling mechanisms (evaporation and self-shading) are critical for the reproductive success of these flowers in their natural environment.",Convolvulaceae; Corolla; Gynoecium; Heliotropism; Pollen viability; Pollination; Sepal; Stomata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036164640

We determined that flower buds at <2.5 mm in length, corresponding to microspore mother cell meiosis to tetrad dissolution, and flowers that reached anthesis during the high temperature exposure had reduced fruit set when exposed to 33°C for 48 or 120 h. Flower buds at <2.5 mm in length also had reduced pollen viability when exposed to 33°C for 120 h. Morphological examination demonstrated that meiocytes initiated tetrad formation, but after dissolution the microspores remained small and clumped without a thick exine.

In this paper we describe the physiological and biochemical bases of the color change, and examine possible environmental signals that influence anthocyanin expression. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to identify malvidin as the major anthocyanidin and myricetin as the major copigment in YTT. The amount of malvidin increases as color appears, while the myricetin concentration remains constant. A slight decrease in petal pH values as the flowers age is not sufficient to cause a color change. Comparison of emasculated and intact flowers shows that the presence of pollen on the stigma is necessary to produce the color change. YTT flowers exposed to light change color while those maintained in darkness do not. Applying an ethylene inhibitor, silver thiosulphate, does not prevent color change. The increase in malvidin over time suggests that anthocyanin synthesis is upregulated by proximate triggers such as pollination and light. YTT presents an excellent model system for the study of anthocyanin regulation because it is a floriferous annual, the appearance of color is easily triggered, and only one anthocyanin is involved. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Although a number of breeding programs have recently released dwarf sunflower cultivars for production in western Canada, the drought adaptability of dwarf cultivars has not been studied. Therefore, field studies were conducted under rainfed conditions at two Manitoba locations during 1994 and 1995 to compare seasonal water relations of 'Sun-wheat-103' (SW-103), a dwarf hybrid, and 'AC-Aurora' (Aurora), a dwarf open pollinated cultivar, with 'IS-6111', a standard height hybrid. The dwarf hybrid, SW-103, experienced less stress (up to 0.44 MPa higher leaf water potential) than the standard height hybrid, IS.6111. Genotypic variation for osmotic adjustment was observed in both 1994 and 1995. SW-103 and Aurora respectively had up to 0.42 and 0.39 MPa lower osmotic potential at full turgor compared with IS-6111. Aurora displayed greater osmotic adjustment per unit decrease in leaf water potential than other cultivars. All cultivars maintained positive pressure potential during the study and whenever significant differences in pressure potential were observed, SW-103 usually had higher pressure potential than other cultivars. IS-6111 maintained higher photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance than the dwarf cultivars. These results suggest that under conditions of adequate water supply, the tall hybrid had the highest productivity despite experiencing the lowest leaf water potential and osmotic adjustment.

Löve] and to recommend cost effective sampling methodology to maximize NeINc during seed regeneration. Three accessions of each species were grown at two field locations and variation in seed number among plants and mean seed production per plant used to estimate NeINc. Mean seeds per whole plant, standard deviations, and NeINc differed among species, and accessions within species (P &lt; 0.05). For whole plant samples, average NeINc for each species differed with values of 0.42, 0.51, and 0.63 for L. perenne, F. pratensis, and P. spicata, respectively. However, average NeINc based on two inflorescences per plant was 0.69, 0.88, and 0.86 for L. perenne, F. pratensis, and P. spicata, respectively, which was higher than that of whole plant samples. This higher NeINc resulted from the elimination of the variation in inflorescence number per plant, a major source of variation in seed number among plants. The results showed the high potential for genetic drift in small regeneration populations. Increased plant populations and harvesting a constant number of inflorescences per plant are recommended as cost-effective methods to minimize genetic drift during regeneration of outcrossing grass germplasm.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036153989

In this study, RNA populations extracted from ovaries of a parthenocarpic fruit (pat) tomato line and from the corresponding near isogenic wild-type were compared by differential display. cDNA was obtained from ovaries collected 1-2 days before anthesis, the stage when the expression of parthenocarpy is first visible. We describe here the sequencing and characterization of three genes that were differentially displayed in pat mutant ovaries compared to the wild-type. The protein predicted by the full-length cDNA reconstructed from clone 66 showed homology to peptides encoded by self-incompatibility alleles of Papaver rhoeas and had a strictly ovary-specific expression. The up-regulation seen at fruit set was an event specific to the expression of parthenocarpy, because it was also found in ovaries of a parthenocarpic fruit-2 line, a mutation which is not allelic to pat. The putative polypeptide deduced from the cDNA reconstructed from clone 72 showed high homology to plant H2A histones. Several EST sequences of this gene have been sequenced from expression libraries of tomato flowers, ovaries and leaves, although it seems to be preferentially transcribed in ovaries. A third fragment (clone 91) was identical to the 3? region of GAD3, a tomato mRNA sharing similarities to short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases. RT-PCR-based expression analysis revealed that this gene is preferentially transcribed in ovaries, sepals and leaves. The tenet that this enzyme family has important functions in developmental pathways controlled by hormones, and in particular gibberellins, is supported by its increased transcription at the time of fruit set, by its positive response to treatments with gibberellin A3, and by its expression in the mitotic cell layers of the placenta.",Differential RNA display; Fruit set; Lycopersicon esculentum; Parthenocarpy; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035703203

A transgenic barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) line carrying a marker gene coding for neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) was used as a pollen donor. For maximum resolution, a cytoplasmically male-sterile barley line was utilized as recipient and the flow of nptII transgene was monitored at distances of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, and 100 m from the donor plots of 225 and 2000 m2.

The number of seeds obtained from male-sterile heads diminished rapidly with distance and only a few seeds were found at distances of 50 and 100 m. Molecular genetic analysis (polymerase chain reaction - PCR) revealed that all seeds obtained from male-sterile heads at a distance of 1 m were transgenic, as anticipated. However, only 3% of the distant seeds (50 m) actually carried the transgene, whereas most of them resulted from fertilization with nontransgenic background pollen. This background pollen was mainly due to pollen leakage in some male-sterile heads. In normal male-fertile barley, the cross-fertilization frequency with transgenic pollen varied from 0 to 7% at a distance of 1 m, depending on weather conditions on the heading day. We conclude that, because of competing self-produced and nontransgenic background pollen, the possibility of cross-pollination is very low between a transgenic barley field and an adjacent field cultivated with normal barley. However, adequate isolation distances and best management practices are needed for cultivation of transgenic barley.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036151726

It is shown that this reduction mechanism has no effect on the qualitative behavior of the model. By using these results, the possible mechanism of enhancing pollinator visitation rate accompanied by the herbivore upon the system is also examined.

GF events occur at multiyear intervals. In GF, most dipterocarp species and many plants of other families come into flower and set fruit massively; these species and plants rarely flower except during GF events. GF is unique, because it can occur over thousands of kilometers and involve hundreds of plant species representing diverse families and lifeforms. It also involves strict mast fruiting. Satiation of generalist seed predators has been considered a primary force for GF. However, recent observations indicate that several selective agents rather than a single major factor may shape GF. In addition to the satiation of generalist predators, promotion of pollination could be one of the selective factors for GF, since synchronized flowering of many species causes an increase in pollinator activity through immigration and population growth. Although environmental prediction for better establishment of seedlings may also be involved in GF, no field data have been reported to support this idea. Longterm monitoring and further understanding of GF are essential for the conservation of this unique and diverse tropical forest in south-east Asia, especially in a period of global climatic change. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Dipterocarpaceae; Environmental prediction; Masting; Plant reproductive phenology; Predator satiation; Promotion of pollination; Tropical forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036486585

Sexual reproduction is elaborated in the history of plant life cycles and strongly connected with plant dispersal. In mosses and ferns fertilization takes place in water. In most seed plants, the water is replaced by the cytoplasm of the pollen tube and a degenerated synergid. The gametes are simple cells. In seed plants the sporophyte develops an interaction with the male and female gametophytes. A pollination stimulus seems to include the activation of the ovule to attract and receive the pollen tube. The syngamic phase includes pollen tube attraction, penetration into the micropyle and a synergid, the release and transport of the sperm cells and fusion of cells and nuclei. For pollen tube attraction, calcium, carbohydrates and proteins are mentioned and seem to be excreted by the synergids. Before penetration a swelling and stop of the pollen tube tip and reorientation of the pollen tube growth can happen. The pollen tube enters the synergid passing the filliform apparatus and arrives in a degenerating cell. There, pollen tube growth stops and the pressure in the pollen tube cytoplasm results in bursting of the pollen tube tip and release of the cytoplasm. Sperm cells become located near and in the ""intercellular space"" between the egg apparatus and the central cell. There are several types of gamete fusion with and without the exclusion of the cytoplasm of the sperm cell in the egg cell or central cell. There are different types of double fertilization and profitable to angiosperms by having increased numbers of ovules, successful seed set and a short generation time.

PCNA is completely recessive to non-PCNA types, and no PCNA offspring have yet resulted from crossings between PCNA and non-PCNA local cultivars of Japanese origin. 'Nishimurawase', a non-PCNA cultivar, has been believed to be an F1 from a cross between PCNA and non-PCNA cultivars. In addition, it is an early ripening leading cultivar in Japan with little fruit cracking that has potential to yield early ripening offspring. When 'Nishimurawase' was crossed with six PCNA cultivars and selections, no PCNA offspring occurred among 95 offspring. Two F1 offspring ('170-10' and '170-26') were selected from an 'Okitsu-25' (PCNA) x 'Nishimurawase' cross, and when crossed with PCNA genotypes, they produced 23 and 15%, respectively, PCNA genotypes. These percentages of PCNA offspring were nearly the same as the 15% produced from the backcross (non-PCNA x PCNA) x PCNA, as reported earlier.

A polyethylene cage was used during pre-blossom development of flower buds to increase maximum temperatures by 6-7°C and mean temperatures by 3°C in orchard conditions. This increase in temperature accelerated flower bud development, caused a hastening in flowering time and following hand-pollination, reduced fruit set. At anthesis, flowers that had developed in warmer conditions weighed less and showed less development of the pistil than control flowers. Pistil growth of flowers under warm conditions did not differ from that of the control flowers when both the populations were compared on a real time scale in spite of the fact that warmed buds were at an advanced external phenological stage. Thus, hastening of external floral development by warm pre-blossom temperatures was not accompanied by advance in pistil development. This lack of synchrony resulted in premature flowering of flowers with underdeveloped pistils that had a reduced capability to set fruit.

A primary prediction of this hypothesis is that the strength of competition for pollination, mediated by variation in plant abundance, should directly influence the strength of selection on floral traits. To test this prediction, I examined the relationships between multiple components of plant abundance and pollination, reproductive success, and phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits in artificial and natural populations of the hummingbird-pollinated Ipomopsis aggregata. In the artificial arrays, I manipulated the absolute density and interspersion of neighboring I. aggregata and a competitor for pollination (Castilleja linariaefolia). I also measured natural variation in the absolute and relative density of these two species within a 2.5-m radius of focal I. aggregata plants in three natural populations. The strength of competition for pollination in the I. aggregata-C, linariaefolia system was only weakly influenced by local plant abundance. Both the absolute density and interspersion of plants in the arrays significantly influenced at least one component of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but the effects were not consistent across these components. For example, the treatment groups that received more conspecific pollen were not the same ones that set more seeds/fruit. Within the natural populations, variation in relative and absolute plant density influenced two components of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but only in one to two populations per component. As would be expected from these inconsistent effects of plant abundance on pollination and reproduction, the strength of selection on floral traits of I. aggregata in both the arrays and natural populations was also only weakly dependent on abundance. Previous studies have indicated (1) that self-incompatible species such as I. aggregata should experience strong, abundance-dependent effects on pollination, and (2) that variation in plant abundance at a local scale should have a stronger effect on pollination than variation at a larger spatial scale. In contrast, my results suggest that the effect of plant abundance on pollination cannot be easily predicted from simple diagnostic traits such as breeding system or spatial scale.",Castilleja linariaefolia; Competition; Density; Floral traits; Ipomopsis aggregata; Natural selection; Phenotypic selection; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036143386

Vibrations generated by bees grasping the apices of the corolla tubes must be transferred via short broad filaments to the anthers. The anthers do not have pores but each dehisces from the apex by a slit that elongates over the time the flowers take to senesce (up to 10 days). This may limit self-fertilisation as the stigma is receptive as soon as it appears from between the very short corolla lobes, so little pollen is released at first but later this would increase as the slit elongates. Visitation by pollinators has rarely been seen but several observations of native bees (Leioproctus and Lasioglossum) working the flowers are presented. The bees visit the nectarless flowers of Conostephium only for pollen and must forage at other kinds of flowers to obtain nectar. Pollen tubes occurred in the stigmas of most older flowers of C. pendulum, so pollen delivery does not seem to limit seed set. Despite this, the species sets few fruit. From examination of the taxonomic positions of likely buzz-pollinated taxa in the family, it appears that pollination by sonication has arisen independently several times in the Epacridaceae, with primarily two different floral configurations. © 2002 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036122139

Seed production, fruit production, and percent seed germination were reduced when insect visitation to P. grandiflorus was limited. Approximately six visits per flower were required for maximum seed set. Most seeds were produced by flowers opening during the first four days of the blooming season. Visitation rates to natural plant populations showed high variation within and among years and within and among sites during nine site-year combinations. Analysis of weather records combined with visitation observations indicated that insect visits to plants in natural populations usually exceeded the number required for maximum seed production. Small and large populations, whether recently planted or long established, received ample visitation over the plant's short blooming period during most years. Comparison of observed natural visitation levels with levels experimentally determined to be adequate indicates that P. grandiflorus is unlikely to experience pollinator limitation of seed set in south-central Minnesota, USA, during most years.",Insect visitation; Penstemon grandiflorus; Pollinator limitation; Prairie; Reproductive ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036066979

Paeonia broteroi flowers exhibit traits of a highly generalized pollination system, but previous studies have revealed that not all flower visitors are effective at pollen delivery. Plants differed between regions in the number of flowers per plant, petal size, number of stamens per flower, and ovules per carpel. Differences between regions could not be attributable to differences in the size structure of the plants. Flower visitors in the two regions differed in assemblage and body size at all the spatiotemporal scales. Larger visitors were more effective as pollinators in the region with the largest and more rewarding (as measured by the number of stamens) flowers, suggesting that pollinators may create opportunities for selection of certain floral traits. In contrast, the two regions did not differ in the probability of damage by herbivores, which did not select flowers based on any of the measured traits, nor affected maternal fecundity. Despite the differences in flower phenotype, potential maternal fecundity, and pollinator effectiveness, plants did not differ between regions in seed production. The role of pollinators as determinants of the differences between regions in floral phenotype, through male and female reproductive success, is discussed. Also, alternative explanations to divergence are addressed, with special reference to the patterns of resource allocation between sexual functions and genetic drift.",Floral traits; Floral variation; Herbivores; Paeonia; Pollinators; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036677873

This study investigates the pollination biology of four distylous species of Rubiaceae in the Atlantic rain forest, SE Brazil. Data on flowering phenology, floral lifespan, stigmatic receptivity, pollen availability, nectar volume and concentration, and pollinator activity were collected. The species studied flower sequentially throughout the wet season, and produce terminal inflorescences which bear small, tubular, diurnal, nectariferous flowers. Despite these similarities, some of the species studied are pollinated by different groups of pollinators, probably due to their distribution, availability of flowers and corolla length. On the other hand, pollinator specificity does not seem to be so important for distylous species. Long mouthparts, like those of most of the recorded pollinators, may reach lower sexual organs and, together with the self- and intramorph-incompatibilities observed, be sufficient to perform legitimate pollination and maintain levels of intermorph mating.",Atlantic rain forest; Bees; Butterflies; Distyly; Pollination; Psychotria; Rubiaceae; Rudgea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036447112

An exception has been work on the apioid umbellifers (Apiaceae, subfamily Apioideae), which typically exhibit andromonoecy and both intra- and interfloral dichogamy. Several students of apioid umbellifers have suggested that variation in proportions of perfect and staminate flowers among sequentially blooming inflorescences (umbels) of individual plants has evolved in response to dichogamy. Here, we report a 2-yr study of dichogamy, pollination, and sex expression in Pseudocymopterus montanus, a common wildflower of the Rocky Mountains. We recorded floral phenology, determined the timing of pollination, collected and identified floral visitors, documented variation in sex expression and fecundity within and among plants, and examined possible reasons why some perfect flowers did not set fruit. Floral visitors included andrenid and halictid bees and anthomyid, muscoid, syrphid, and tachinid flies. Autogamy was prevented by strong intrafloral protogyny of the perfect flowers, which were pollinated before their anthers dehisced. Flowering individuals produced a single primary (terminal) umbel, one or two secondary (lateral) umbels, and occasionally a tertiary (sublateral) umbel. Umbels of different orders matured sequentially, producing multiple cycles of protogyny. Weak interfloral protogyny within and among umbels allowed the possibility of geitonogamous selfing. All individuals expressed the same pattern of variation in sex expression among sequentially blooming umbels. Over 90% of flowers in primary umbels were staminate, but the frequency of staminate flowers fell to 65% or less in secondary and tertiary umbels. Primary and secondary umbels differed significantly in sex expression, even though their prepollination reproductive efforts (floral biomass) were the same. We favor the view that this distinctive pattern of within-plant sex expression, i.e., decreasing proportions of staminate flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, evolved in response to protogyny. In apioid umbellifers, protogyny appears to have been derived from protandry. The selective forces involved in the derivation of protogyny may have included more specialized interactions with pollinators and the ability to geitonogamously self-pollinate if cross-pollination failed. Sex allocation theory predicts that protogyny is a sufficient condition for the evolution of increasing relative allocations to female function in sequentially blooming flowers or inflorescences. Plants with higher reproductive effort had higher absolute allocations to both male and female reproductive functions as well as higher relative allocations to female function (higher phenotypic femaleness). The more female-biased gender of larger plants may result from higher frequencies of geitonogamy in inflorescences with more flowers.",Geitonogamy; Protandry; Sex allocation; Umbelliferae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036241932

Sex ratios (female:male) ranged from 1:1.05 for O. jacoti to 1:2.46 for O. excavata. Apple, Malus domestica Borkh (Rosaceae), pollination was enhanced following the release of either species in orchards in Shandong. Fruit diameter increased following the release of either Osmia species in Red Delicious blocks compared with control blocks where no pollination treatment was applied. The number of seeds per fruit was also increased relative to controls, and the percentage of asymmetrical fruit decreased. Release of O. excavata produced the best results for this cultivar. For Ralls Janet, the number of seeds per fruit increased following the release of either species and the percentage of asymmetrical apples decreased. Effects on fruit diameter were confounded by poor cultural practices (i.e., lack of adequate fruit thinning) in these Ralls Janet blocks. Fruit set increased relative to controls following release of either Osmia species for both apple cultivars. Release of O. excavata also produced higher fruit set relative to blocks that received hand pollination treatment; release of O. jacoti was better than hand pollination only for Red Delicious. Observations on the behaviour of individuals showed that O. excavata averaged 49.6 foraging trips per day and set an estimated 3108 fruit on Ralls Janet; O. jacoti made fewer foraging trips (average of 31.2) per day and set 1831 fruit.

The first experiment compared staminode presence and removal in open-pollinated flowers. Staminode removal significantly reduced total pollen deposition but had no effect on total pollen removal. The second experiment utilized single bee visits to assess the interaction between pollinator size and staminode presence on the rate of pollen deposition and removal. This experiment indicated that staminode removal resulted in fewer pollen grains deposited on stigmas and less pollen removed from anthers for both large and small bees (the contrary was true for medium bees). Although the number of pollen grains deposited was greatly reduced for large bees, staminode removal reduced deposition efficiency most notably for small bees by 41.3%, reducing female reproductive success.

We investigated the reproductive ecology of two closely related, woody legumes, Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and Genista monspessulana (French broom), invading the same sites. Both species are considered noxious non-native weeds in California, and are considered to be ecologically similar, but Genista has much smaller flowers than Cytisus. Neither species showed appreciable levels of autogamous selfing. When experimentally self-pollinated, Genista demonstrated less depression of fruit set and seed set relative to outcrossed flowers than did Cytisus. At two sites on the Matin peninsula, Calif., Genista flowers were consistently less likely to be pollinated than Cytisus flowers. Genista was significantly pollen limited at both sites, while Cytisus was pollen limited at only the site with lower visitation rates. In the three populations with demonstrable pollen limitation, we found a significant relationship between fruit production and natural pollinator visitation at the level of the individual plant. However, we did not find that overall patterns of fecundity were strongly predicted by differences in pollen limitation between species or between sites. While a previous study found a tight link between patterns of pollinator visitation and patterns of reproduction in Cytisus in Washington State, we conclude that a more complex and variable environment (in terms of resources, herbivores, and florivores) on the Marin Peninsula de-coupled the relationship between pollinators and fruit production in these invaders.

Estimates of the horizontal P (Joseph-Sendner diffusion velocity) and the vertical diffusivity (Gaussian K) of filamentous particles were small (P ? 4 × 10-4 m/s; K ? 10-4 m2/s) compared to theoretical values that do not consider plant canopies. These findings support the concept that eelgrass canopies modify the fluid dynamics (i.e., reduced turbulent mixing) within their canopies. These results indicate that 1000-10 000 Z. marina pollen are required to pollinate a single flower. Similarly, it was estimated that under some conditions, the probability of particle impaction on eelgrass vegetation approaches certainty.

Aristolochia is the most diverse genus of Aristolochiaceae, with ?120 species distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics. All the Aristolochia species studied so far are pollinated by saprophagous flies of different families, which are presumably deceived by floral odor. Flowers of many species have trap-and-release mechanisms. The flowers attract and imprison pollinators during the female stage first day of flowering and release them after anther dehiscence. Pollination systems of A. maxima and A. inflata are different from those of other Aristolochia in lacking trap mechanisms. Furthermore, the pollinators oviposit in the flowers, and their larvae grow on the fallen, decaying flowers on the ground. Therefore, the plants have a mutualistic relationship with their pollinators. Self-compatible A. inflata is pollinated by Megaselia sakaiae (Phoridae, Diptera). The pollinator may be specialized to Aristolochia flowers, which is the only substrate for larval development. On the other hand, self-incompatible A. maxima is pollinated by Drosophila spp. (Drosophilidae, Diptera), which utilize Aristolochia flowers as a breeding site only occasionally.

Pollinator behavior can also influence hybrid fitness by determining receipt and export of pollen. We incorporated information on pollinator effectiveness and visitation behavior into a simulation model that predicts pollen transfer between Ipomopsis aggregata, Ipomopsis tenuituba, and hybrids. These predictions were compared with estimates of pollen transfer derived from movement of fluorescent dyes in experimental plant arrays. Interspecific pollen transfer was relatively uncommon in these arrays, whereas transfer between hybrids and the parental species was at least as common as conspecific transfer. Backcrossing was asymmetrical; I. aggregata flowers frequently received mixed loads of hybrid and conspecific pollen. The simulation suggests that these patterns of pollen transfer are largely explained by the visitation sequences of hummingbird and insect pollinators, with little contribution from mechanical isolation. Pollen receipt by hybrids exceeded that of both parental species in a year when pollinators preferred to visit F1 and F2 hybrids and was intermediate in another year when they preferred to visit I. aggregata. This suggests that natural variation in pollination may produce spatiotemporal variation in hybridization and hybrid fitness.",Ethological isolation; Hummingbird; Hybridization; Ipomopsis; Pollen carryover; Pollen transfer,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036227854

In this study, we present evidence for thrips pollination in the dioecious pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae). Macaranga hullettii is pollinated predominantly by one thrips species, Neoheegeria sp. (Phlaeothripidae, Thysanoptera). As a reward for pollinators, the protective floral bracteoles function as breeding sites for thrips and trichomal nectaries on the adaxial surface of the floral bracteoles provide alimentation. Flowering phenology of both staminate and pistillate trees was highly synchronized within 3-4 wk periods. In contrast to pistillate trees, staminate trees start to breed the thrips inside the developing inflorescences ?2 wk before anthesis. Breeding of Neoheegeria sp. in the laboratory indicates that the thrips development is completed within ?17 d. Thus, staminate trees offer breeding sites for one thrips generation until the onset of pollen presentation. Intraspecific pollen transfer by thrips was proved by pollen loads of thrips taken from receptive pistillate inflorescences of M. hullettii. Bagging experiments of different mesh sizes showed that seed set reached almost the level of open-pollinated flowers when exclusively tiny insects like thrips were able to enter the net bags, but no apomictic seed set occurred when no insect access was given to the flowers.",Dioecy; Euphorbiaceae; Flowering phenology; Macaranga hullettii; Malaysia; Seed set; Thrips pollination; Thysanoptera,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036191975

The ""semidry"" stigma of Senecio is characterized by the presence of a surface cuticle overlaid by a proteinaceous pellicle and a small constitutive surface secretion consisting of lipid, carbohydrate, and protein. We anticipate that this semidry stigma may be a general feature of the Asteraceae. Secretion by the Senecio stigma is enhanced after both compatible and incompatible pollinations, when material secreted by the stigma combines with pollenkitt extruded from the alveolar exine of the pollen to form a heterogeneous ""attachment foot"" between pollen and stigmatic papillae. During this period, discrete inclusions, ""wall bodies,"" can be seen within cell walls of papillae in contact with pollen grains, apparently exporting their contents across the cell wall and onto the surface of the stigma. Following compatible pollination, the emergent pollen tube grows through the attachment foot and between the tightly packed stigmatic papillae before penetrating the stigma at the base of the papilla cells, where the cuticle is absent. The pollen tube then grows intercellularly, within the middle lamella, through the stigma toward the style. Following incompatible pollinations, development of pollen is highly variable. Most incompatible pollen grains fail to germinate, but many do germinate to produce pollen tubes, some of which penetrate the stigma before they are inhibited. Such extensive development of incompatible pollen tubes is unusual for a species with homomorphic sporophytic self-incompatibility. These observations are discussed as a comparison with events at the dry stigma surface of Brassica following compatible and incompatible pollinations and in relation to current theories on the evolution of wet and dry stigmas.",Asteraceae; Pollen-stigma interactions; Pollination responses; Self-incompatibility; Senecio; Stigma surface,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036141558

(Moraceae) is a remarkable species in the ecosystem of tropical rainforests in Xishuangbanna, China. The figs and fig-pollination wasps (Chalcidoidae: Agaonidae) are highly co-evolved mutualists that depend completely on each other for propagating descendants. Pollination of all fig species is done by fig wasps; their unique symbiotic associates, the fig wasps, cannot develop in anywhere except in the fig syconia. The present paper reports on the biology and flowering phenology of F. hispida, as well as the propagation character and pollination behavior of the fig wasps (Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr) based on our observations in the rainforests of Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan of China. F. hispida is a dioecious tree that annually blossoms and bears fruits 6 - 8 times, with four to five fruit-bearing peaks. The male trees produce pollen and provide fig wasps with reproductive havens, while the female trees produce fig seeds after pollination by the female wasps. Pollen of F. hispida cannot escape from the dehiscent anthers until they are disturbed by fig wasps. The female wasps open the anthers and collect pollen with their antennal scrapes, mandibles and legs, and then carry pollen to the female receptive syconia where fertilization takes place. Meanwhile, some of the female wasps lay eggs in the male receptive syconia. It takes about 3 - 67 min to search for the receptive syconia for pollination, and 15 - 23 h to enter the female receptive syconia. The number of female wasps entering a syconium has close relation with the impregnation and seed-bearing rate of female flowers, as well as the oviposition and reproduction rate of the fig wasps themselves. F. hispida is endowed with a relatively high level of seed bearing (54.1% - 82.5%, average 73.8%). The wasps oviposition rate on the male flowers is between 72.3% and 93.8% with a mean of 84.4%.",Ceratosolen solmsi marchali; Ficus hispida; Pollination biology; Tropical rainforest; Xishuangbanna,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036320910

Pollination by insects of this order comprises two entirely different sets of pollinators, night-flying moths (Noctuidae or Sphingidae) and butterflies (evidently only one species of Satyridae). These lepidopteran-pollinated flowers have quite different floral adaptations and both types are specialist systems, although moth flowers may be pollinated by a range of different moths. In Gladiolus moth-pollinated fowers are usually large, long-tubed and pale-colored, or mottled dull purple to brown, are usually richly scented, often open fully only at night, and produce relatively concentrated nectar that is sucrose-rich. Butterfly flowers, in contrast, are fully open during the day, close partially or completely at night, are often bright crimson to scarlet, usually with prominent white splashes on the lower tepals, but are also large, have a long tube, and produce quantities of relatively dilute nectar, either sucrose-rich or hexose-rich. Comparing the pollination systems of related species, we infer that night-flying moth pollination arose 6 times in the genus, whereas butterfly pollination arose 3 times in the 165 species of southern Africa, and that the two lepidopteran pollination systems in Gladiolus arose quite independently of one another.",Butterflies; Floral ecology; Gladiolus; Iridaceae; Moths; Nectar; Pollination systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036107251

Extensive screening of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes failed to reveal sequence variation within Lophocereus.

We discuss possible hypotheses that may explain the transition from bat pollination (ancestral) to moth and hummingbird pollination in Lophocereus and P. marginatus, respectively. Additional phylogenetic analyses suggest that the genus Pachycereus should be expanded to include Lophocereus, Carnegiea, Neobuxbaumia, and perhaps other species, whereas P. hollianus may need to be excluded from this clade.

We studied its pollination ecology by monitoring phenology and by evaluating pollen and nectar production, pollinator activity (frequency and behaviour of visitors), quantity and quality of pollination services, pollen/ovule ratio, and seed set in response to insect exclusion and self-compatibility tests. We also analysed the effect of population size on reproductive mechanisms by comparing a large and a small population. Flowers of P. montsicciana produced nectar and were visited by Hymenoptera (79.7%), Diptera (11.5%), and Lepidoptera (8.8%). The most frequent pollinators (60.6% of total visits) were long-tongued bees of the genus Anthophora. Both populations had a similar range of pollinators. We found a correlation between the number of visited flowers and the number of open flowers per census; 88.7% of pollen grains deposited on the stigmas were conspecific and the main competitor was another chasmophyte plant, Antirrhinum molle. Bagged flowers set seeds but significantly less so than hand-self-pollinated and control flowers. Thus, although self-compatible and self-pollinated, entomophilous pollination of P. montsicciana is required in order to explain c. 10-40% of total seed set, in accordance with P/O ratio estimations. Bagged flowers from the small population set significantly more seeds than the large one. Visitation rates were lower in the small population, but, unexpectedly, showed higher stigmatic pollen loads and similar or higher seed set. These results suggest an increase of spontaneous selfing rates in the small population, probably favoured by a smaller flower size, which can not only assure reproductive success when pollinators are scarce, but also provide additional potential to adapt to climatic changes. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Anthophora; Chasmophyte plant; Competition; Floral rewards; Seed set; Self-compatibility; Self-pollination; Stigmatic pollen load,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036586086

Here, I investigate covariation between striking geographic variation in pollinator fauna and the mating system of a widespread self-compatible wetland plant, Decodon verticillatus. Flower visitor surveys in two northern populations from Canada and three southern populations from the southeastern United States revealed that flowers in northern populations were visited primarily by bumblebees (30%), nonnative honeybees (39%), and small, apparently ineffective, pollinators including wasps, flies, and solitary bees (31%). In contrast, southern populations were visited by butterflies (27%), large native bees (Bombus and Xylocopa; 65%), and only rarely by honeybees (2%). The frequency of visits to inflorescences was also much higher in southern (mean = 3.3/h) than in northern populations (1.1/h). The foraging behavior of butterflies may enhance outcrossing by reducing geitonogamy, the predominant mode of self-fertilization in northern populations. Compared to bees, butterflies moved between inflorescences more frequently (64% vs. 43% of the time) and flew longer distances between inflorescences (medians = 50 vs. 25 cm). Despite large regional differences in visitor composition and movement patterns, multilocus estimates of the proportion of outcrossed progeny did not differ between five southern populations (mean ± SE = 0.75 ± 0.04; range = 0.65-0.87) and 10 northern populations (0.72 ± 0.02; 0.62-0.86). Similarly, the fixation index of mature plants did not differ from 0 in either northern or southern populations. These results indicate that variation in the pollinator fauna, including major geographic shifts in the frequency of butterflies versus bees and native versus nonnative pollinators, does not greatly affect the mating system of D. verticillatus.",Inbreeding depression; Outcrossing; Pollinator behavior; Pollinator visitation; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036144489

However, in these pollination mutualisms the pollinator's larvae impose a cost on plants through consumption of developing seeds and fruit. The effects of pollinators on benefits and costs are expected to vary with the abundance of pollinators, because large population sizes result in more eggs and larval seed-eaters. Here, we develop the hypothesis that fruit abortion, which is common in yucca, senita, and plants in general, could in some cases have the function of limiting pollinator abundance and, thereby, increasing fruit production. Using a general steady-state model of fruit production and pollinator dynamics, we demonstrate that plants involved in pollinating seed-eater mutualisms can increase their fecundity by randomly aborting fruit. We show that the ecological conditions under which fruit abortion can improve plants fecundity are not unusual. They are best met when the plant is long-lived, the population dynamics of the pollinator are much faster than those of the plant, the loss of one fruit via abortion kills a larva that would have the expectation of destroying more than one fruit through its future egg laying as an adult moth, and the effects of fruit abortion on pollinator abundance are spatially localized. We then use the approach of adaptive dynamics to find conditions under which a fruit abortion strategy based on regulating the pollinator population could feasibly evolve in this type of plant-pollinator interaction. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).",Adaptive dynamics; Benefits; Costs; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Fruit abortion; Mutualism; Pollinating seed-eaters; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036583959

When flowers were emasculated and hand-pollinated every day after anthesis, their longevity was reduced. In the absence of emasculation and hand pollination, the staminate phase of the flowers of both varieties was 1 d longer. After the staminate phase, flowers of the outcrossing variety dropped their androecium, exposing the stigma and initiating the pistillate phase, which lasted for ?2 d. In contrast, flowers of the mixed-mating variety self-pollinated autonomously and then terminated their flowering. Under great seasonal variation in the pollinator visitation rate, which was observed in their natural populations, the outcrossing variety should maximize expected outcross success through the phenology of floral sex phases, whereas the mixed-mating variety self-pollinated ovules that were not outcrossed within the staminate phase.

The pollination ecology and breeding system of C. grandis were investigated from three natural populations occurring in two wetlands near the top of Mangshan Mountain in Hunan Province, central China. The species is in flower from early July to late September with a peak in August. The process of flower anthesis in C. grandis-begins at about 10.00 am and lasts about four-and-one-quarter h. The flowers lasted ca. 5.5 h. Caldesia grandis is self-compatible; however, autogamy resulted in lower seed set than geitonogamy and xenogamy as well as free pollination. Both pollen viability and the seed set in open-pollinated controls at the same site were typically high (65.44% and 71.78% respectively). Mean pollen: ovule ratios in the three populations ranged from 901.75 to 931.354. No seed germination was observed, either in the field or in laboratory experiments. Propagation is achieved through turions, which commonly occur in the inflorescences. Flies (Insecta; Diptera) were the most frequent visitors to the flowers of C. grandis; however, bees (Insecta; Hymenoptera) composed a larger proportion of effective pollinators. Existence analysis revealed a peak of mortality density in mid-May corresponding to an environmental sieve in the period following the establishment of plantlets. An updated diagnostic of the conservation status of C. grandis in China was formulated. The main threats to this species are catastrophic events, especially human impact activities (agriculture, hobbyists' collections, and infrastructure construction). Establishment of a monitoring program is proposed, and both in-situ and ex-situ strategies are recommended for effective conservation of C. grandis.",Alismataceae; Breeding system; Caldesia grandis; Conservation; Endangered; Pollination; Rare endemic,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036326119

These spores are transmitted to healthy plants mainly by flower visitors. The behavioral responses of flower visitors to a variation in floral characters, are not only likely to affect rates of pollen export/import, but also the rate of spore deposition and probability of disease. In a transplantation experiment, using plants from four different populations, we tested for correlation between variation in female floral morphology and patterns of spore and pollen deposition, and a resulting risk of disease. The source populations in this experiment were located on four islands in Skeppsvik archipelago in northern Sweden, and represented a gradient of disease incidence from completely healthy (Island 1), low incidence (Island 2) to high incidences (Islands 3 and 4) of disease. Fifty plants from each population were transplanted to the center of the population on Island 4. There were significant differences among the transplants in floral characters, i. e. corolla size, style length and ovule number. Plants from the non-diseased population had larger flowers and longer styles than plants from the highly diseased populations. Numbers of pollen grains and spores deposited on flowers were strongly and positively correlated. We found that plants originating from the non-diseased population captured approximately 4 times more pollen and 9 times more spores per flower than the individuals from the resident population (Island 4, population 4). The incidences of disease among plants from the four populations differed significantly, and was 37%, 20%, 18% and 0 for populations 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

The outcome of the interaction therefore depends on the number of ovules fertilized by adult visits and the number of seeds destroyed by larvae. Among the very few cases of such mutualisms reported so far is the globeflower-globeflower flies mutualism, which is unique in that it involves several congeneric fly species (Chiastocheta genus) coexisting within a single host-plant species, Trollius europaeus. These species exhibit contrasted oviposition behaviors resulting in a more or less beneficial outcome for the plant. We designed an adaptive dynamics model to investigate how morphological traits of globeflower could affect the evolution of oviposition in its pollinating flies. Three fly traits (flower age at oviposition, clutch size and the level of avoidance of already parasitized flowers) and one plant trait (closed or open corolla) were examined. Whatever the shape of the flower, evolutionary branching occurs between early and late ovipositing flies, driven by strong competition among larvae within a fruit. Once this branching occurred, the closed shape of the corolla is likely to offer a better protection to eggs of early but not of late ovipositing flies. The difference in egg survival results in higher competition among early larvae and thus selects for decreased clutch size in early flies. This can be seen as a first step in the evolution of a mutualistic behavior. The prediction of our model fits field observations of fly behavior, giving theoretical support to the hypothesis of fly sympatric speciation within its host plant. Moreover, flower closed globe shape can be positively selected in globeflowers as it results in a reduction of parasitism strength. This last evolution therefore leads to a stable mutualism between globeflowers and globeflower flies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036382766

Floral visitation rate alone was not a good indicator of pollination effectiveness, as not all floral visits resulted in successful pollination events. As a group, pollen-harvesting taxa pollinated >85% of flowers visited as compared with under 25% for nectar foragers. Equivalencies derived from floral visitation rates and pollination percentages show that the most effective pollen-harvesters, Bombus spp. queens and Andrena spp., would pollinate 6.5 and 3.6 flowers, respectively, in the time it would take a nectar-foraging honey bee, Apis mellifera L., to pollinate a single flower. Average pollen deposition for nectar-foragers (A. mellifera and Megachile rotundata F.) did not exceed 13 tetrads per visit, which was significantly less than all pollen-harvesters. Among pollen-harvesters, Bombus spp. workers, M. rotundata and Halictus spp. deposited moderate stigmatic loads (34, 28, and 26 tetrads, respectively), whereas Bombus spp. queens and Andrena spp. deposited >45 tetrads per single visit.

Theory predicts a female-biased sex ratio, becoming less female biased as female (foundress) density increases. We used Liporrhopalum tentacularis to test two mechanisms of sex ratio control when foundresses oviposit simultaneously: (1) foundresses facultatively adjust the number of males in clutches, and (2) they produce the same number of males regardless of clutch size, which, given limited numbers of oviposition sites, would lead to increases in sex ratio with increasing density. We then examined whether foundresses can oviposit sequentially into figs. When oviposition was simultaneous, brood composition indicated facultative adjustment, although sex ratios were more female biased than predicted. Instead, foundresses appeared to adjust their sex ratio in response to both others ovipositing and their own fecundity. We also found that foundresses are able to oviposit completely sequentially, with those arriving second adjusting their sex ratio in response to the previous oviposition. Hence, pollinating wasps may fail to fit the predictions of classical sex ratio theory because the conditions under which foundresses oviposit, and their responses to changes in such conditions, are more complex than once assumed. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The survey showed that among 40 insect taxa visiting both subspecies of H. sphondylium approx, only 53% carded significant pollen loads. However, the Pollinator Importance Coefficient (IC) calculated for each insect group, and based on observation of insects' abundance, within-umbel activity and pollen load revealed that only two taxa in case of H. s. ssp. sibiricum (Thricops nigrifrons, Eriozona syrphoides) and four in case of H. s. ssp. sphondylium (T. nigrifrons, E. syrphoides, Meliscaeva cinctella and Arge ustulata) were truly important pollinators. Although both subspecies were visited by similar insects, H. s. ssp. sphondylium, with its characteristic compact and white umbels, was visited more frequently by Diptera and Hymenoptera, while yellow-greenish loose umbels of H. s. ssp. sibiricum were preferred by Coleoptera.

Previous studies have compared the pollination values of different bee species solely by the speed with which they handle flowers and the proportion of visited flowers tripped. In this greenhouse study, five species of bees, including the three commercially managed U.S alfalfa pollinators, are likewise compared for their floral tripping frequencies. These bee species are also compared for the pod set and mature seed that results from their single visits to virgin flowers. Regardless of the identity of the pollinating bee, tripped flowers had the same probabilities of pod set and seed set. Thus, differences in the single-visit pollination efficiencies of the various bee species are entirely attributable to the proportion of visited flowers that they trip. Females of the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi Cockerell, and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F, tripped 81 and 78% of visited flowers, respectively. Males of these species are significantly less effective (61 and 51%, respectively), but still significantly superior to the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. (22% of visited flowers tripped). These relationships are supported by field data for tripping frequencies.

There was no significant effect of site location on the bees' activity, but there was a significant effect of cultivar - the average number of bees per blooming head ranged between 0.5 and 1.1. The differences in bee activity were probably due to differences in nectar production and/or accessibility of the nectar to bees. Bagged blooming heads exhibited 0-1% setting, except for one exception, which set 16%. Exposed heads set 49-86% of the seeds. Those results indicate the dependency of the tested confection varieties on bee activity for commercial production. Hand cross-pollination of the exposed blooming heads did not result in increased yield, which indicates that the bees' activity in the field was adequate, and that the empty seeds in the exposed heads probably resulted from physiological characteristics of the cultivars rather than limitations in their pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036014584

Staminate and pistillate flowers are receptive at anthesis. Bagging tests for apomixis were negative. Although geitonogamy can occasionally occur, outcrossing predominates. Pollen is relatively dry, but wind pollination is not a significant factor in cross pollination. Although inflorescences are visited by large numbers of insects, pollination is effected mainly by small sap beetles (Mystrops sp.) and weevils (Phyllotrox tatianae), which feed and breed in fertile staminate flowers. Pistillate flowers, which offer no reward to pollinators, appear to attract insect visitors by olfactory and visual imitation of staminate flowers, that is, via Bakerian mimicry. Flower production, fruit maturation, leaf production and leaf abscission occur continuously throughout the year. Flowering exhibits a distinct peak during the warmest months (Dec-Apr).

Heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated for volume, specific gravity, and latewood percentage at three different growth stages: juvenile (ages 0-10 years), mature (11-17 years), and total (0-17 years). Heritabilities of growth traits (0.09-0.11) were consistently lower than for wood property traits (0.16-0.33). Growth traits for Florida loblolly exhibited high genotype x environment interaction (rB = 0.44), whereas wood properties did not (rB = 0.90). The higher heritabilities and genetic stability across environments make wood properties amenable to genetic manipulation through breeding programs. In contrast, the high genotype x environment interaction of growth traits for Florida loblolly pine requires more research to understand the possible implication of these effects on breeding programs. Trait-trait and age-age genetic correlations were determined for growth and wood properties. Strong positive age-age correlations were present for latewood percentage, volume, and specific gravity. Weak negative trait-trait genetic correlations existed between specific gravity and volume across ages (-0.13 to -0.43). No genetic correlation existed between latewood percentage and volume, while a moderate favorable genetic correlation existed between latewood percentage and specific gravity (0.47 to 0.59). Genetic gains in volume and specific gravity were compared for various types of selection. In one type, forward selection of the top 20 individuals (of 3484) based on 17-year volume, resulted in a 20.5% genetic gain in volume; however, a concomitant loss of -6.4% also occurred in specific gravity. If a selection index was used to hold specific gravity constant, a gain in total volume of 14% was obtained.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036445191

Although the adhesion and the germination of self-pollen and the growth of self-pollen tubes were not inhibited, the proportion of cross-pollen tubes that entered the style was 1.7-2.3 times higher than that of self-pollen tubes, indicating a partial self-incompatibility that inhibits self-pollen tubes from entering the style hollow.

We also suggest a threshold effect in number of pollen tubes or late-acting self-incompatibility to fully explain the drastic and uniform selection against self-pollinated flowers before ovary swelling. After that, maternal selection and/or inbreeding depression caused the abortion and delayed maturation of self-pollinated flowers.

Shipboard environments, driven by war fighting, hoteling, and safety arguments, are already influencing the development of high impulse weapons systems away from chemical or nuclear derived charging mechanisms. Shipboard High Energy Laser (HEL) weapons system concepts, for example, are already under pressure to adopt environmentally integratable, all-electric, solutions to meet requirements. Because of these influences, HEL weapons systems that employ solid-state cavity technology are being favorably received. Alternative technologies that are more difficult to integrate, such as the Free Electron Laser (FEL) and possibly the Chemical Oxygen-Iodine Laser (COIL) systems, are still under consideration but will require different electric power resources. For HEL systems, there are several critical factors in electric power delivery. Depending on the HEL technology; source capacity, flow rate regulation, drop-out and other source stability aspects can significantly influence weapons availability or performance. The nominal solution to achieving these reserve capacity and regulation requirements is to incorporate specialized components within the weapons system. Given the infrequency of weapons use, these specialized components should not be relegated to specific tasks only when their functions could be generally beneficial to the over-all power grid. Design approaches that cross-pollinate weapons systems power solutions with those being considered for the transmission, distribution and storage solutions in the power system would be more practical and cost efficient. Reserve power components designed to insure a consistent supply voltage and insulate against power failure can, for example, be used to enhance the performance of a nearby power grid node. With this approach, the all-electric ship power grid could undergo performance improvements with the addition of each new weapons system. ©2002 IEEE.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-23844514511

Response of maize seed number to growth or light interception soon after pollination has been described with different types of functions. The objective of this study was to compare maize seed number responses to intercepted solar radiation or growth with data from a diverse set of sites. Pioneer hybrid 3394 planted near Temple, TX in 1999 at 2.5 to 20 plants·m-2 showed a linear function for seed number responses to light intercepted per plant in the 11 d following silking and to ear growth rate in these 11 d. Similar linear seed number responses were found for three hybrids in Canada at 4 to 13 plants·m-2. Likewise, the function for Pioneer 3394 in Temple was found to be similar to a regression for the same hybrid grown in Pennsylvania, and was similar to a function developed in Kenya. Thus, under the diverse environmental conditions of these studies, linear seed number functions appeared reasonable at these sites. Such seed number functions are critical to the understanding of optimization of planting density to maximum seed production per unit ground area. In the absence of drought stress, the optimum density will be the minimum planting density which could attain near-complete light interception at silking. As the probability of drought stress increases due to decreased soil water holding capacity or decreased expected rainfall, the optimum density would decrease accordingly.",Crop modeling; Harvest index; Maize; Photosynthetically active radiation; Seed number,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036101572

Species richness of longicorn beetles was poorer in second-growth forests and conifer plantations than in old-growth forests. It was proved by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) that the beetle assemblages of old-growth forests were distinct from those of conifer plantations, while those of second-growth forests were intermediate between them. Further analysis showed that a number of species, including many Pidonia spp., were specific to or closely associated with old-growth forests, and the results were largely supported by the indicator value (IndVal) approach. It is likely that many of such old-growth forest species in the larval and pupal stages require large broad-leaved trees standing or fallen with thick bark.

Increase of gold particles in the central cell began about 2 h earlier than that in the egg cell. There was no distinct difference of CaM amount between the degenerated and the persistent synergids. It is interesting to observe an obvious change of CaM distribution form during pollination and fertilization from scattered single particles to clustered particles, and back again to single particles after the fertilization finished. CaM was also localized extracellularly in the embryo sac wall as well as in the wall and intercellular space of nucellus cells.

We test these hypotheses using data from a plant-pollinator system that has been grazed by cattle (i.e., a biological disturbance) in southern Argentina. We quantified specialization in species interactions, specialization of interaction partners, and species' responses to disturbance. We found no relationship between degree of specialization and a species' response to disturbance. We also found that plant-pollinator interactions tend to be asymmetric in this system; there was no relationship between the degree of specialization of a given species and the degree of specialization of its interaction partners. However, asymmetry of interactions did not explain the variability in species' responses to disturbance. Thus, both hypotheses are rejected by our data. Possible reasons include failure to assess crucial resources, substantial direct effects of disturbance, inaccurate measures of specialization, difficulty detecting highly nonlinear relationships, and limitations of a nonexperimental approach.

Box 3020 STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3N5, Canada","The reproductive biology of Pterocarpus macrocarpus Kurz (pradu) was studied in 37-year-old plantation trees in Thailand to determine the causes of seed and fruit loss. Trees flowered at the end of March or early in April at the end of the hot dry season and start of the rainy season. Flowering occurred over about a one-month period. Fruits developed over the next six months during the rainy season and matured at the start of the cool dry season in October and November. Phenology was similar in the four trees that were studied in detail. Racemes averaged 30 flowers each and each raceme was receptive for several days, although each flower was only receptive for one day. After pollination, floral parts were shed over several days and fruits began to develop. Pradu is entomopholous but its insect pollinators were not identified. The stigma is covered by hairs and a secretion is produced. A high proportion of flowers were pollinated. Then, there was a rapid loss of flowers and young fruits. These observations and earlier genetic studies indicate the probability of a high level of self-incompatibility in this predominantly outbreeding species. Pradu may have a very late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism found in many other hardwoods. The zygote remains quiescent for six weeks as the endosperm develops. During this time most of the ovules and fruits abort, suggesting resource allocation preferentially to cross-pollinated ovules. Pradu has a high reproductive potential but a low preemergence reproductive success (0.8), which is common for many hardwood species. The major cause of the low reproductive success was fruit loss during early development. Fruit production may be enhanced by increased cross-pollination among unrelated parent trees. This may be accomplished in seed orchards and seed production areas by the introduction of additional insect pollinators that travel greater distances between trees and by the relatively close spacing of unrelated parent trees.",Phenology; Pterocarpus macrocarpus; Receptivity; Reproduction; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036229282

The morphs exhibit approach and reverse herkogamy, floral designs that in most species typically occur as monomorphic conditions. We investigated the floral biology of stigma-height dimorphism in the Mediterranean geophyte Narcissus papyraceus (Amaryllidaceae) in an effort to understand the evolutionary forces maintaining stylar polymorphism. Our survey of 66 populations in Spain, Portugal, and Morocco indicated that 56% were dimorphic with the long-styled morph at an average frequency of 0.79. The remaining 44% of populations sampled were monomorphic for the long-styled morph. In dimorphic populations there was a significant positive relation between population size and the frequency of the short-styled morph. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that N. papyraceus is self-sterile with no significant differences in female fertility between intra- and intermorph crosses.

We investigated plasticity in floral longevity in Campanula americana, a protandrous, insect-pollinated herb. In greenhouse studies, we found that the longevity of the morphological male phase was shortened by pollen removal and that the longevity of the morphological female phase was shortened by pollen deposition. In a natural population, male and female sexual functions saturated within a few hours of morphological gender phase onset. In contrast to theory, morphological gender phases did not terminate immediately upon saturation of sexual function.

Wild and cultivated rice (variety Minghui-63) were grown in a common garden in Hunan province, China, and crop-specific genetic markers were used to detect hybridization following hand-pollinations. Using 11 sequential pollination treatments, the effects of the relative timing of pollination on the success of foreign pollen was investigated. Foreign pollen from the crop resulted in lower pollen germination, fewer pollen tubes per style, and a significant reduction of seed set, demonstrating a disadvantage of foreign pollen even in the absence of pollen competition. When 1:1 pollen mixtures were applied, only 2% of the resulting seeds were hybrids, revealing a much stronger disadvantage of foreign pollen when competing with conspecific pollen. Testing the effects of the relative timing of pollination on the success of foreign pollen suggested that conspecific pollen is often more successful than foreign pollen. Nonetheless, hybridization is possible following the deposition of pollen mixtures, especially when foreign pollen arrives earlier than conspecific pollen. Pollen competition between wild and cultivated rice could slow the rate of crop-to-wild gene flow, but even if pollen competition was ubiquitous it would not prevent gene flow from the crop. © New Phytologist (2002).",O. sativa; Oryza rufipogon; Pollen competition; Reproductive isolation; Sequential pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036163141

Bees of 79 species, representing about 40% of the taxa occurring at the study site, were collected on 19 species of flowering plants with poricidal anthers of the families Melastomataceae and Solanaceae. The majority of flower visitors were able to buzz (sonicate) to release pollen. Buzzing is thought to be the only mode of pollen collection that results in pollination. No oligolectic bee-plant relation based on buzz pollination was detected. Most bees were not specialized to forage on plants with poricidal anthers. According to the abundance of visitors at specific flowers, three major groups of buzz pollinators could be distinguished; these were bumble bees, stingless bees of the genus Melipona and halictid bees. The pollen sources mainly exploited by them differ in flower structure, flowering syndrome and forest stratum. Therefore, the structure of the bee community seems to be closely related to the composition of the local vegetation. The extent to which bees of a species show preference for poricidal flowers, however, is more dependent on habitat than on plant taxa. The evolution of buzzing behaviour by female bees to maximize pollen harvest may have preceded the appearance of poricidal anthers and the syndrome of buzz pollination. © 2002 International Bee Research Association.",Araucaria forest; Brazil; Buzz pollination; Community structure; Evolution; Melastomataceae; Poricidal anthers; Solanaceae; Sonication,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036037320

In addition, the male parent of open-pollinated seedlings was identified by comparing their phenotypes with the genotypes of the orchard clones. In this way the male parents of 559 seedlings of 648 seedlings of progenies from 14 parental (orchard) clones were determined. The level of external pollen contamination in the seed orchard was estimated to be 2.2% for the total population. The effective mean selfing rate observed was 1.5%. Male reproductive success among clones varied widely, from 0.8 to 24.4%, for the total population.

Pollen allergens found in small, respirable particles have been implicated in a number of asthma epidemics, particularly ones following rainfall or thunderstorms. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine how pollen allergens form the respirable aerosols necessary for triggering asthma. Methods: Flowering grasses were humidified and then dried in a controlled-environment chamber connected to a cascade impactor and an aerosol particle counter. Particles shed from the flowers were analyzed with high-resolution microscopy and immunolabeled with rabbit anti-Phl p 1 antibody, which is specific for group 1 pollen allergens. Results: Contrary to what has been reported in other published accounts, most of the pollen in this investigation remained on the open anthers of wind pollinated plants unless disturbed - eg, by wind. Increasing humidity caused anthers to close. After a cycle of wetting and drying followed by wind disturbance, grasses flowering within a chamber produced an aerosol of particles that were collected in a cascade impactor. These particles consisted of fragmented pollen cytoplasm in the size range 0.12 to 4.67 ?m; they were loaded with group 1 allergens. Conclusion: Here we provide the first direct observations of the release of grass pollen allergens as respirable aerosols. They can emanate directly from the flower after a moisture-drying cycle. This could explain asthmatic responses associated with grass pollination, particularly after moist weather conditions.",Aerosol; Air pollution; Allergen; Asthma; Grass; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036155228

Hand pollination was used to produce pure individuals and FI hybrids between Salix caprea and S. repens, and S. caprea and S. aurita. Leaves from these individuals were presented to adults of two chrysomelid species. Lochmaea caprea and Crepidodera fulvicornis, in multiple-choice preference tests. Lochmaea caprea showed an additive ?esponse: its level of grazing of the FI hybrids of S. caprea (host) and S. repens (non-host) was mid-way between that of the parent species. This was consistent with the inheritance pattern of condensed tannins in hybrids. This suggests an additive inheritance of resistant traits and a linear (dose dependent) response by the herbivore. When both parent taxa (S. caprea and S. aurita) were hosts, L. caprea utilization did not differ between any of the plant categories (FI hybrids and parents). Crepidodera fulvicornis exhibited a dominant response towards the susceptible parent for the S, caprea × S. repens crosses and a dominant response towards the resistant parent for S. caprea × S. aurita crosses. This indicates that C. fulvicornis might respond to changes in resistant trait at specific thresholds. Our results suggest that different herbivores, even those with a similar host plants range, differ in their response to hybrids.

These restrictions may reduce the siring success or increase the probability of inbreeding depression in the offspring. To test if this was the case, we hand-pollinated maternal plants in small and large populations of the rare, endemic plant Cochlearia bavarica (Brassicaceae) with pollen from one, three, or nine donors from the same population or with nine donors from a different population. In one additional population of intermediate size, maternal plants were hand-pollinated with ten donors located at a distance of 1, 10, 100, or 1000 m. We then recorded seed and offspring characters. On average, offspring from small populations were smaller than normal and fewer survived to maturity. Increasing the number of pollen donors had a positive effect on reproductive success in small and large populations, but at the highest pollen diversity this occurred at the expense of slightly reduced offspring fitness. Because the total amount of transferred pollen was held constant, these effects could not be attributed to increasing pollen load. Rather, the increasing pollen diversity may have increased the chances of selecting a particularly ""good"" donor for fertilization - an example of a sampling effect of diversity. Pollen from outside a population or from 10-100 m away resulted in higher reproductive success and greater offspring size. Effects of population size and pollination treatments on reproductive success and offspring fitness were additive. Apparently, there is no obvious size threshold above which the potential of inbreeding depression can be ignored in C. bavarica.","Brassicaceae; Cochlearia bavarica; Endemic plant species; Inbreeding depression; Munich, Germany; Pollen competition; Pollen diversity; Pollination distance; Population size; Sampling effect",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036678853

However, the inference of insect pollination of extinct plants usually must be based on comparative morphology of plants and insects or based on phylogenetic relationships and pollination habits of extant taxa. The presence of insect coprolites can provide additional evidence supporting the inference of plant-insect interactions based on the morphology and composition of the fossilized feces. In this article, we describe Noferinia fusicarpa gen. et sp. nov. based on fossil flowers and fruits recovered from the Buffalo Creek Member of the Galliard Formation (late Santonian, Cretaceous) of central Georgia. The morphology of the flowers - differentiated perianth, basally connate calyx and corolla, inferior ovary, and possible nectiferous pores surrounding the base of the style - is consistent with generalized insect pollination. Associated with Noferinia flowers and fruits in the same sediment samples are five morphotypes of coprolites that are similar in shape and composition to the feces produced by modern beetles that feed on pollen and flowers. On the basis of the morphological features exhibited by Noferinia and by the coprolites containing its pollen, we suggest that Noferinia fusicarpa was insect pollinated.",Angiosperm; Coprolites; Cretaceous; Mesofossil; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036288858

The use of soft-X-irradiated pollen resulted in normal pollen tube penetration into the synergid and discharge of sperm cells. Two to three days after pollination, the sperm nucleus was present alongside the egg nucleus before fusion. The polar nuclei divided and the endosperm cell spread in the embryo sac before zygote division. A globular embryo was observed on day 7 to 10 after pollination. Subsequently, the embryo failed to differentiate to organ tissue and degenerated. These results indicate that double fertilization occurred after pollination with the irradiated pollen and that abortion of the embryo results from soft-X-ray induced chromosomal abnormalities in generative nucleus.",Abortion; Citrullus lanatus; Embryo; Fertilization; Parthenocarpy; X-ray,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036110749

In Wachendorfia (Haemodoraceae), a small genus of insect-pollinated geophytes restricted to the Cape Province of South Africa, populations are usually polymorphic for asymmetry. Here we investigate dimorphic enantiostyly in the four species of Wachendorfia to determine whether variation in their reproductive systems influences the maintenance of this genetic polymorphism. Experimental field pollinations of W. paniculata and W. thyrsiflora indicated higher fertility for cross- than for self-pollinations, whereas in W. brachyandra, these types of pollination produced similar levels of fertility. Outcrossing rates were highest in W. paniculata (t = 0.78-0.98), with W. brachyandra (t = 0.39-0.79) and W. thyrsiflora (t = 0.76) exhibiting mixed mating systems. Outcrossing rates in two populations of W. parviflora varied from mixed mating (t = 0.61) to predominant selfing (t = 0.07). Population style-morph ratios ranged from 1:1 in outcrossing W. paniculata to monomorphism in selfing W. parviflora and clonal W. thyrsiflora. In W. brachyandra, a species with delayed selfing, morph ratios were usually biased. The maintenance of enantiostyly in Wachendorfia appears to be strongly influenced by levels of disassortative mating and the balance between sexual and clonal recruitment.",Delayed selfing; Enantiostyly; Experimental pollinations; Floral design; Haemodoraceae; Outcrossing rates; Spatial analysis; Style-morph ratios; Wachendorfia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036189277

The overall average scab score was 1.61 for the open-pollinated families with known provenance in subline 91, with the lowest score for the families from the Netherlands (1.03), followed by Denmark (1.27) and Sweden (1.30). For subline 94, the average scab score for the Kazak families (2.60) was much lower than that for the families derived from cultivars (3.57).

We conducted a series of experiments investigating floral longevity in the Iron Mountain population of M. guttatus under controlled conditions. In the absence of pollinators, flowers typically last 4-6 d. However, this trait exhibits considerable plasticity. Reduced longevity is triggered by the successful deposition of pollen on the stigma but not by removal of pollen from the flower. Reducing water availability also reduced the duration of the floral life span. Experimental manipulations reveal that both male and female reproductive capacity declines continuously throughout the life span of a flower. This may indicate that flowers have obtained the maximum benefit possible by the time the corolla is abscised. We also performed manipulative experiments to determine when autogamy occurs in the lifetime of a flower. Although some autogamy occurs in the first couple of days postanthesis, most of it occurs late in the floral life span. Considering these results in relation to previous studies, we argue that the amount and timing of autogamy in M. guttatus flowers is likely to be determined by the level of pollinator activity in a population.",Autogamy; Floral longevity; Inbreeding; Mating systems; Mimulus guttatus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036296884

Hay fever is more predominant in urban than in rural areas, despite the increasingly smaller areas of surrounding grassland. The effect of vehicle exhaust pollutants, mainly diesel particles, and other industrial sources of atmospheric pollution leading to plant damage has been implicated in this phenomenon. Objective: This study compared the in vivo and in vitro allergenicity of pooled samples of Lolium perenne grass pollen harvested from 10 different urban areas with that of samples of the same pollen from 10 neighboring rural areas. Methods: Lolium perenne pollen from different parts of a city and from a nearby rural area was harvested in 1999 and 2000 during the peak pollination period. Protein composition was compared by SDS-PAGE and in vivo and in vitro IgE-binding capacity was compared by skin-prick tests, RAST-inhibition and measurement of the major allergen, Lol p 5. Results: In the two years under study, urban samples contained approximately twice the protein content of the rural samples. Biological activity and Lol p 5 content was higher in urban pollen than in rural pollen and showed differences in the two years under study. Conclusions: The protein content and allergenicity of Lolium perenne pollen was higher in urban areas than in rural areas. These differences might explain why allergy to grass pollen is more prevalent in urban areas.

However, we still largely lack the quantitative information that is necessary to compare plant-animal interactions and plant life histories. This is because most studies have focused on only a single interaction and a single component of fitness. This review suggests a protocol for how plant-animal interactions, as well as other, interactions can be quantitatively investigated. I review results from the forest herb Lathyrus vernus to examine how plant performance is influenced by mollusc damage of shoot buds, vertebrate grazing, leaf damage, pre-dispersal seed predation, flower herbivory and pollinator visitation. More specifically I ask: (1) What are the effects of these interactions on components of plant fitness? (2) How do such effects translate into total fitness? (3) Do trade-offs among components of plant fitness influence the net effect of animals? (4) Are antagonistic and mutualistic interactions influenced by the same plant traits? The results illustrate why it is often necessary to monitor plants over several seasons and over all life cycle phases to assess the total effects of environmental factors. In L. vernus many components of fitness were affected by multiple interactions with animals. A large proportion of these effects was carried over to subsequent seasons and could only be detected after one or two seasons. Assessing the effects on overall performance in perennial plants is particularly difficult because fitness components have very different influence on total fitness. The matrix model approach used to estimate the effect of herbivores, seed predators and pollinators on L. vernus provides one possible way to make such assessments for organisms with complex life cycles. The results show that the cryptic damage of emerging shoots has the largest negative effects on total fitness. Correlations between different components are an essential feature of many life histories and must be incorporated into demographic models if we want to assess the net effect of environmental factors. In L. vernus costs of reproduction were present and demographic modelling showed that the positive effects of an increased seed production after additional hand-pollination on total fitness was completely offset by poorer performance in the following year. Lastly, this study provides an example of how optimal trait values can be assessed when traits influence several fitness components and several interactions. In L. vernus a higher number of flowers was correlated to both an increased fruit set and an increased risk of grazing damage and these effects were, in turn, carried over to the next season. The results clearly illustrate the limitations of inferences about phenotypic selection pressures that are based on single fitness components or single interactions. Taken together the results for L. vernus show that the selective pressure constituted by a given amount of animal interference is highly dependent on the context, in terms of both plant life history and other interactions. A life cycle approach like the one outlined in this study may avoid several problems and provide the basis for assessments of the total effects of animals on plants. Such an approach must be based on in-depth studies of plants.",Flower number; Herbivory; Matrix models; Pollen limitation; Seed predation; Trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037647410

The predicted ranges of the parental orchid species rarely overlapped (only 2% of the core range), with the geographic separation of the species reflecting the occupation of largely distinct climatic niches and limiting opportunities for hybridisation. Comparison of the predictions with independent distributions of the orchid taxa revealed a close match.

In the best case the pollen grains are transfered at anthesis to the stigma. Due to weather conditions pollination may be delayed and the stigma may be senescent at the time of pollen transter. To simulate this situation hand pollination was undertaken at intervalls (two days before and at anthesis and up to 9 days after anthesis) in the self-stertile cultivar 'Lützelsachser'. The ageing of the stigma was studied to find out if the collapse of the stigma effects pollen grain germination and finally fruit set. It was found that the papillae collapsed within about 4 days after anthesis. Hand pollinations caused within a short time structural changes on the surface of the stigma, i.e. the break down of the papillae was enhanced by the presence of pollen grains. Scanning-electronmicroscopical pictures showed that within 4-5 day the complete stigmatic surface was covered by a dense layer.

Naturalised specimens can also be found along river banks. The pollen records analysed are from different periods comprised between 1994 and 2000 in Barcelona, Bellaterra, Cambrils, Girona, Lleida, Manresa and Tarragona. All data were obtained using seven-day volumetric spore Hirst traps. Platanus pollination is concentrated in a few weeks, between March and April. Platanus pollen is present in all the atmospheric pollen spectra for the sites mentioned above. In Barcelona, Platanus pollen attained the highest concentrations, with an extreme annual index (sum of the mean daily concentrations) of 25790 in 1997, and a maximum daily concentration of 2567 P/m3 on 15th March 2000. The lowest annual index (647) corresponds to Cambrils, 2000, and the lowest maximum daily concentration (74 P/m3) was registered on 7th April 1996, in Manresa. The interannual variation of Platanus pollen values can be explained not only by meteorological parameters and the endogenous factors of the tree, but also by human activity such as elimination, pruning and watering.",Aerobiology; Allergy; Catalonia; Main pollen season; Platanus; Pollen dynamics; Spain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036765342

The hypotheses tested here are that the incidence of seed predation by bud-infesting insect larvae in capitula of Asteraceae is positively related to (1) capitulum size among species, (2) capitulum size within species, (3) capitulum lifespan, and (4) the degree of flowering asynchrony on individual plants. Three populations of each of 20 common herbaceous species of Asteraceae from disturbed ground and grassland habitats were monitored for the presence of pre-dispersal, seed-eating insect larvae. Mean capitulum size (receptacle width) of each species was measured. In a sub-set of eight species, individual capitula were tagged to determine their flowering phenology and lifespan (from anthesis to Seed shedding). From these data an index of flowering synchrony on individual plants was derived. Among species, the incidence of larval infestation increased with capitulum size. Small-flowered species such as Achillea millefolium were largely free of bud-infesting larvae, whilst large-flowered species such as Arctium minus were heavily infested. In three cases investigated in greater detail, bud infestation was found to increase with capitulum size within species, suggesting a potential for natural selection to favour smaller capitula. No relationship was found between infestation levels and either capitulum lifespan or degree of flowering synchrony, and there was no evidence that the relationship between capitulum size and infestation was confounded by correlations with these other features. The results support hypotheses 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4. It is suggested that the characteristic capitulum size of each species may represent a trade-off between the opposing selection pressures of pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators.",Bud-infesting larvae; Flower lifespan; Flower size; Flowering synchrony; Tephritidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036940429

However, the causes of these irregular productions are not entirely understood. This may be related to the lack of information as far available in this species on reproductive biology and the onset of fruiting. In order to provide a framework where the low adaptability shown by most of the cultivars could be studied, anatomy of the pistil and pollen tube growth through the pistil structures have been explored from pollination to fertilisation. Likewise, early fruit growth and fruit drop have been characterised in two apricot cultivars, 'Moniqui' and 'Bulida'. The phase elapsing from pollination to fertilisation took place in a considerably shorter period of time than in other related species. Thus, the first pollen tubes reached the base of the style in 3-4 days, and fertilisation was completed by 7 days after pollination. Most of the flowers and fruitlets dropped within the first 4 weeks following pollination, and the biggest drop wave took place 3-4 weeks after pollination. At this time, all the unpollinated flowers remaining in the tree dropped. In spite of starting with a synchronised population of flowers at anthesis, large differences in development were recorded among flowers and fruitlets in the days following pollination and some flowers clearly outgrew others, that eventually dropped. These differences, although at a different scale, also occurred in unpollinated flowers. The continuous fruit growth and fruit drop in both pollinated and unpollinated flowers, together to the fact that a number of fertilised fruits also dropped, suggest that in addition to pollination or fertilisation, other factors may be involved in flower and fruit drop and fruit set. Results are discussed in terms of the implications of the nutritional status of the flower in fruit set.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036239801

However, this differential success may be due to a decrease in stigmatic receptivity soon after the flowers open. We performed controlled pollinations to determine the effect of stigma age on pollen germination and seed set. We pollinated flowers at 12-h intervals up to 120 h and divided these into two sets: from one set, we removed stigmas 24 h after pollination to examine percentage of pollen germination. The second set of flowers was allowed to produce fruits, and the seeds were counted and weighed. Pollen germination declined significantly with stigma age, but there was no significant effect of stigma age at pollination on the number or mass of resulting seeds. Thus, the decreased pollination success of bees is not due to a decrease in stigmatic receptivity but is most likely a result of pollinator inefficiency.",Caryophyllaceae; Nocturnal anthesis; Silene alba; Silene latifolia; Stigma age; Stigma receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036679506

We have defined the disruptions in detail, plotting their time course during gynoecial development, mapping disruptions to xylem lignification, and testing their effects on fertilization. In spt mutants, defects were first seen soon after the gynoecial tube started to elongate. Medial regions where carpels adjoin grew slower than in wild type and were often unfused later at the apex. Development of the septum was severely disrupted, and extracellular matrix-secreting transmitting tract was not seen in null mutant lines. Even so, some pollination was observed. The amount of stylar and stigmatic tissue was also reduced, and vascular development in medial and stylar regions was disrupted. SPT apparently plays a role in promoting the development of all specialized tissues from carpel margins. In crc mutants, defects were very different. They were seen from the inception of gynoecial development and characterized by additional cells arising across the width of the gynoecium but fewer cells in the longitudinal dimension. In addition, cells were larger on average. All cell types arose in crc mutant gynoecia, but they seemed to differentiate earlier. Mutant gynoecia were always unfused in apical regions, and the medial vasculature was again disrupted. CRC may normally restrain lateral cell division but promote longitudinal division, ensuring the gynoecium adopts an elongated linear form. In crc spt double mutants, nonadditive disruptions were present, with the carpels even shorter, much less fused, and lacking stylar xylem elements. These interactions may be secondary, however, as the expression patterns of the two genes do not overlap. Disruptions in both spt and crc mutants match closely the time and place of expression of the wild-type genes, indicating that each acts cell autonomously. We have integrated these findings with those of other known regulatory genes to propose a general model of growth and pattern formation in the developing gynoecium. In an initial ""neogenic"" phase, lateral and medial regions are defined. Meristematic genes (including SPT) are active in the medial zone, maintaining its pluripotent potential, while growth and polarity genes (including CRC) are active in the lateral zones, providing the valve initials with the ""competence"" to support medial tissue. Later, in a ""determination and differentiation"" phase, the medial zone is genetically divided into differentiating subregions, with septum and placentae developing internally and the replum developing externally. At the same time, the lateral regions mature into the tissues of the ovary wall.",Arabidopsis; Carpel; CRABS CLAW; Flower development; Gynoecium; Pollination; SPATULA; Vasculature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036144482

Moraea lilacina, from the northern Langeberg foothills in the Little Karoo of southeastern Western Cape Province, can be distinguished from the related M. unguiculata by its relatively large flower, pink pigmentation, trilobed inner tepals with a long, erect central cusp, and often densely hairy filament column. Nomenclatural adjustments include the reduction of M. neopavonia in M. tulbaghensis and the provision of a new name for the homonym M. flexuosa Goldblatt. Newly discovered populations of M. saxicola and M. rivulicola increase their known geographical ranges and require some adjustment to their delimitation.",Beetle pollination; Iridaceae; Iridoideae; Moraea; Moraea subg; Vieusseuxia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036394481

In 1977, we began studying the reproductive biology of this eastern North American arborescent shrub by examining floral phenology and rewards, pollen-ovule ratios, breeding system, pollination, pollinator and resource limitation, and seed dispersal. The homogamous, self-incompatible flowers emit a faint odor, bear nectar with sucrose ratios typical of bee- and fly-pollinated flowers, and produce abundant sticky pollen. Flowers were visited infrequently by insects representing six orders. Flies were the most common floral visitors, specifically members of the genus Bradysia, but small bees also carried high percentages of Hamamelis pollen. Despite high pollen/ovule ratios (11445 grains/ovule), bees and flies are likely pollinators, as experiments indicate wind pollination is less likely. Pollen quantity and resource availability did not appear to limit reproductive output, but pollen quality did. Tests of >40000 flowers showed natural fruit set to be < 1%. The flowering time, breeding system, and clumped distribution of plants, likely due in part to limited seed dispersal, combine to yield this remarkably low fruit set. Because all other species of Hamamelis flower from late winter to early summer, it may be that H. virginiana evolved a fall flowering phenology to avoid competition for pollinators with the closely related H. vernalis.","Breeding system; Floral phenology; Fruit/flower ratios; Hamamelidaceae; Hamamelis, pollen/ovule ratios; Pollination; Pollinator limitation; Reproductive limitations",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036188659

Because of the acropetal blooming of this species, the display sizes when upper flowers opened was much greater than the display sizes when lower flowers opened. Our experiments revealed that large displays lead to a high rate of pollen removal from individual flowers, though they do not lead to a high rate of ovule fertilization. Consequently, the rate of pollen grains removed per flower by pollinators was greater in upper flowers than in lower flowers. The pattern of sex allocation in individual flowers within a raceme was consistent with such variation. Namely, both maleness [stamen mass/(stamen mass + pistil mass)] and pollen: ovule ratio were larger in upper flowers. We suggest that the temporal variation in display size, in addition to such factors as dichogamy and pollinator directionality, also produces variation in the probability of successful pollen transfer from individual flowers that may cause the variation in the sex allocation of individual flowers.",Display size; Individual flowers; Liliaceae; Mating environment; Narthecium asiaticum; Sex allocation; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036207832

Flowering season varied from late May to early August among species. There was a positive correlation between flowering time and fruit-set under natural conditions. Pollinator exclusion by net-bagging and hand-pollination revealed that very low fruit-set in early-flowering species was caused by severe pollen limitation, while late-flowering species tended to have high fruit-set with slight pollen limitation. Such seasonal patterns reflect the changes in seasonal activity of pollinating insects, which are highly influenced by ambient temperature. A similar research program was conducted in a subarctic heathland in northern Sweden with almost similar species composition. In Sweden, however, there was no positive correlation between flowering time and fruit-set. The difference between the alpine fellfields and the subarctic heathland may be caused by the specific seasonal pattern of temperature change in either region.

Here we investigate through controlled pollinations factors that may contribute toward low seed:ovule ratios in Trillium grandiflorum, a self-incompatible woodland herb from eastern North America. Reduced fruit and seed set in open-pollinated plants in comparison with hand cross-pollinated plants demonstrated that pollen limitation was a contributing factor to low female fertility. However, seed:ovule ratios of hand cross-pollinated flowers averaged only 0.66. Experimental pollinations involving the manipulation of pollen age, the number of pollen donors, the timing of pollination, and the application of self-pollen before cross-pollen each had no effect on fertility. This indicated that aspects of pollen delivery were not responsible for low seed:ovule ratios and that resources might influence variation in seed:ovule ratios. An analysis of the relation between plant size and seed set in hand cross-pollinated plants provided evidence that resources limited fertility when ovules of T. grandiflorum were not pollen limited.

Alternatively, a larger display may reduce fitness by increasing pollen movement within an individual. In dichogamous species the frequency of this geitonogamy also depends on floral gender ratio and pollinator response to floral gender and to inflorescence architecture. We explored the relationships of floral display size and dichogamy to potential geitonogamy in Campanula americana, a protandrous herb. We observed pollinators in a natural population, in which individuals differed in display size, gender ratio, and distance to conspecifics, and in experimental arrays, in which individuals differed only in display size. In both settings, bees responded to increased floral displays by increasing the number and length of foraging bouts. The number of potentially geitonogamous visits, those to female-phase flowers after male-phase flowers, also increased with display size. In addition, although proportion of flowers visited did not increase with the floral display, the proportion of geitonogamous visits did. There was no evidence that dichogamy reduced the potential for geitonogamy. The ratio of male- to female-phase flowers did not affect bee behavior, and bees did not display a gender preference. In contrast to other studies, the presentation of female-phase flowers below male-phase flowers on reproductive branches did not reduce geitonogamy. Variation in floral display size may cause the mating system to vary among populations. We found that display size varied among 12 populations and that geitonogamy may be infrequent in many populations as a result of small display sizes. Finally, within populations, the selfing rates of larger biennial C. americana are likely to exceed those of smaller annual individuals.",Display size; Geitonogamy; Pollinator behavior; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036143301

Nocturnal, hawkmoth-pollinated flowers are among the most reflective and strongly scented known, suggesting the potential for multimodal sensory communication with pollinators. We measured the relative importance of these overstated signals, both alone and in combination, to nectar feeding by naïve male hawkmoths, Manduca sexta. In the absence of fragrance, moths hovered and repeatedly passed (in flight) within 1 m above arrays of model paper flowers. The presence of plant odours elicited significantly more hovers and close passes, as well as three additional behaviours: approaches to the paper flowers, approaches to the hidden odour source and nectar feeding. However, approaches to odour sources never resulted in proboscis extension or probing in the absence of a visual target. Nectar feeding increased six-fold when paper and natural flowers were presented in mixed arrays, but moths did not show preferential visits or constancy to either type of flower. Significantly ordered behavioural sequences were observed when both visual and olfactory stimuli were present, but not when fragrance was absent. The largest conditional probabilities indicated a chain of responses beginning with hovering and leading to floral approach and nectar feeding. As single modality cues, both floral fragrance and visual display are innately attractive to male M. sexta, but the combination thereof is required to elicit proboscis extension and feeding. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

A major purpose with this study was to evaluate the selection of accessions for the international Barley Core Collection, complementing existing passport data. Allelic variation was found in all three species. The variation was mainly between accessions, as most accessions were fixed for certain alleles. Since all three species are self-pollinated, this was anticipated. The fact that the accessions have undergone one or several regeneration cycles from a rather limited number of individuals, after being collected, likely also have reduced the variation. The accessions were clustered by subjecting the genetic distances between them to UPGMA statistical treatment. The clusters in the dendrograms displayed for H. brachyantherum subsp. californicum and H. pusillum distinct patterns related to the geographical origin of the accessions. The accessions of H. murinum subsp. glaucum were less variable than the other two, and did not reveal such a clear pattern.

Here I present a comparative analysis of data drawn from the literature, indicating that time to first reproduction is shorter in woody angiosperms than in gymnosperms. In addition, age at maturity is negatively correlated with the rate of diversification (measured as the number of species per genus) at all the taxonomic levels analyzed and also when phylogenetically independent contrasts were conducted. This correlation suggests that early reproduction promotes diversification in woody angiosperms. Furthermore, this correlation is not a confounding effect of the association between age at maturity and other ecological factors that promote angiosperm diversification, such as pollination and seed dispersal systems.",Dispersal; Early reproduction; Phylogenetically independent contrasts; Pollination; Species diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036345371

A combination of high selfing rates and strong inbreeding depression suggests that the mating system is unstable. The population-level selfing rate measured in three years ranged considerably from 0.425 (SE = 0.138) to 0.704 (0.048); family measures of selfing rate varied from zero to one in all three years. Inbreeding coefficients did not differ from zero, suggesting that inbred plants do not survive to reproduction in the field. Average inbreeding depression measured in two greenhouse experiments was 0.608-0.870, with values for individual plants ranging from -0.170 to 0.940. The magnitude of inbreeding depression expressed at different life-history stages depended on experimental conditions. When plants were grown during the winter, inbreeding depression was expressed at early and late life-history stages. When plants were grown during the summer, inbreeding depression was detected for germination but not for later life-history stages. Inbreeding depression for vegetative and inflorescence biomass was also measured using field-collected seeds where cross status was assigned using genotypes determined electrophoretically. We did not detect a relation between inbreeding depression and the selfing rate at the level of the individual plant. We saw no evidence for intrafloral selfing, suggesting that the evolution of increased selfing through autogamy is unlikely, despite high selfing rates. A more likely outcome of breeding system instability is the evolution of gynodioecy, which occurs in species of Schiedea closely related to S. menziesii. Females have been detected in progeny of S. menziesii that have been raised in the greenhouse. In the absence of biotic pollen vectors, the failure of these females to establish in the natural population may result from the absence of adaptations for wind pollination.",Gynodioecy; Inbreeding; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Outcrossing; Schiedea menziesii; Self-fertilization; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036695182

White clover (Trifolium repens) was a major competing species for honey bees and lupin (Lupinus arboreum) for bumble bees. Bumble bees exhibited a greater degree of crossover between male and female flowers than honey bees, based on an examination of male and female pollen in corbicular loads.

The phylogenetic placement of Madagasikaria was estimated by using combined data from ndhF and trnL-F chloroplast sequences and phytochrome (PHYC) and ITS nuclear sequences. It forms a strongly supported clade with the Malagasy endemic genera Rhynchophora and Microsteira. Despite nearly identical floral morphology among species in this clade (here called the madagasikarioid clade), these genera are easily distinguishable on the basis of their fruits. The schizocarpic fruits of Madagasikaria have distinctive mericarps. Each mericarp has a lateral wing, which completely encircles the nut, and a peculiar dorsal wing, which folds over on itself. The morphology of this fruit suggests that the homology of the unusual wing in Rhynchophora is lateral in nature and represents a reduced wing similar to the lateral wing in Madagasikaria. Taxa in the madagasikarioid clade all appear to be morphologically androdioecious and functionally dioecious, producing both staminate and ""bisexual"" (i.e., functionally carpellate) individuals. This condition appears to be exceedingly rare in flowering plants and has important implications for floral evolution within Malpighiaceae. Neotropical Malpighiaceae are pollinated by specialized oil-collecting anthophorine bees of the tribe Centridini and exhibit highly conserved floral morphology despite tremendous diversity in fruit morphology and habit. These oil-collecting bees are absent from the paleotropics, where most members of the Malpighiaceae lack both the oil glands and the typical floral orientation crucial to pollination by neotropical oil-collecting bees.

Thirty-one different taxa were found among 652 specimens of myxomycetes recorded in the field or obtained from 358 moist chamber cultures prepared with decaying floral parts. A comparison with the results of 696 moist chamber cultures prepared with various other litter substrates showed that thirteen myxomycete taxa occurred more often on inflorescences. Six taxa had a strong preference for this microhabitat, and three of those seem to be new for the Neotropics. Correspondence analysis of the data set compiled for inflorescences indicated that the assemblage of myxomycetes was relatively consistent across all of the various study sites. The actual myxomycete substrates were the rapidly decaying floral parts enclosed by the massive, still living bracts. Richest in myxomycetes were species of Heliconia and Costus. Here, nectar residuals probably promoted a rapidly developing community of yeasts and bacteria. A high density of these organisms was indicated by the frequent occurrence of myxobacteria in the moist chamber cultures prepared with floral parts. Results from canonical correspondence analysis suggested that a substrate pH between 8 and 9 and the presence of massive, compact inflorescences on plants occurring at lower elevations in localities with moderate annual rainfall provide optimal conditions for inflorescence-inhabiting myxomycetes. An incidental dispersal of myxomycete spores by birds that pollinate the flowers or feed upon the fruits seems possible and may have accounted for the high degree of preference exhibited by some of the inflorescence-inhabiting myxomycetes, for which the term ""floricolous"" is proposed.",Dispersal; Ecology; Inflorescence; Neotropics; Slime molds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036061863

Flowers of the short-styled morph had larger corollas but showed no difference in the volume or concentration of nectar produced. Over the 2 yr of this study, 20-30% of plants suffered floral herbivory. The pattern of damage was morph-specific. Long-styled flowers were more likely to have damaged pistils, while stamens were more often damaged in short-styled flowers. In this distylous species, exserted flower organs were more likely to be eaten. Such differential herbivory based on the position of floral organs within a flower may result in reduced fitness via either male (short-styled morph) or female function (long-styled morph).",Distyly; Floral herbivory; Flower predation; Flower size; Gelsemium sempervirens; Heterostyly; Nectar production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036678538

Major variations in gynoecial structure in lilioids include degree of syncarpy, occurrence and position of septal nectaries, and hypogyny versus epigyny. Structural evidence from septal nectaries, combined with recent molecular phylogenetic studies, indicates multiple origins of epigyny within monocots in general and Asparagales in particular, including possible separate de novo evolution of epigyny within the orchids and some other lower asparagoids. However, the infralocular septal nectaries that occur in genera of the sister clade to the higher asparagoids (e.g., Xanthorrhoea and Phormium) support a reversal from epigyny to hypogyny in this group, as indicated by optimization of this character on a recent phylogeny of Asparagales. The complex pattern of evolution of gynoecial structures in monocots may be linked with the evolution of different pollination syndromes such as vibratile (buzz) pollination, the latter often associated with loss of septal nectaries.",Asparagales; Epigyny; Floral evolution; Hypogyny; Liliales; Syncarpy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036176539

In this study, the variation of range-size rarity was analyzed among the bromeliad communities of 74 forest sites in the Bolivian Andes and adjacent lowlands with respect to 14 environmental factors reflecting mostly climatic conditions and to species attributes such as life-form, ecophysiological type, pollination mode, and fruit type. The global ranges of all 192 recorded bromeliad species were mapped on a 1° grid, quantified as the number of 1° grids occupied by a species, and range-size rarity indices were calculated as the mean inverse range size of all species at a given study site. At the community level, range-size rarity increased with elevation, most notably among epiphytic taxa. Range-size rarity of terrestrial forest species increased with decreasing habitat area, presumably reflecting the agglomeration of endemic species in isolated dry forest valleys with restricted area. Epiphytes showed higher range-size rarity in the most humid areas, which are also geographically isolated. At the species level, range size revealed a limited relationship to pollination mode or ecophysiological type but differed significantly between epiphytic species (large ranges) and terrestrial and saxicolous taxa (small ranges). However, this pattern was outweighed by differences among fruit types, with berries corresponding to large ranges, wind-dispersed seeds with flight appendages to intermediate ranges, and wind-dispersed seeds without appendages to small ranges. It is hypothesized that the tendency toward larger ranges among epiphytes (of any plant group) is due at least partly to the prevalence of taxa with adaptations to long-distance dispersal, ensuring efficient colonization of canopy habitats while preventing the differentiation of populations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036112558

Based on the sequences the genephylogeny was inferred through PAUP. The sequences were highly diversified. Of the 339 randomly cloned copies, only 13 pairs (3.8%) were identical, with length varied between 307-548 bp (average 438.6 bp). The sequence differentiation index (SDI) in O. xylorrhizus was 0.078, in O. sylvicola was 0.032, and between these two species was 0.149. In the most parsimonious tree reconstructed, all of the 294 copies of O. xylorrhizus were grouped into one clade, and those of O. sylvicola were grouped into another clade with 100% bootstrap support. The result demonstrated that the copies of 5S rRNA genes originated from just one progenitor copy, ""founder copy"", in both of the species respectively, followed by a series of proliferation, and little, if any, homogenization ever occurred in the copies. As the common ancestor of the two species must have borne multiple copies of the genes, all the other copies were lost during or after the speciation. Additionally, the phylogeny clearly showed that the founder copy was proliferated continuously through time, not just once. O. xylorrhizus is an extremely endangered species in which high genetic diversity, selfing and depression on seedlings were observed previously. In our study the sequences from different populations or different individuals were mixed in the branches of the O. xylorrhizus clade, although they evolved independently. It is assumed that gene flow of the species happened much more frequently in the past, making the proliferated copies dispersed to different populations, and the species maintained an amount of genetic diversity. Therefore, the selfing and seedling depression would be the result of a recent event. We suggest that some changes in outer mechanisms, such as the pollinators or seed-dispersers, might cause the species selfed, depressed and, finally, endangered.",5S rRNA; Evolution; Ophiopogon sylvicola; Ophiopogon xylorrhizus; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036328602

Larvae of the Chiastocheta genus feed exclusively on Trollius (Ranunculaceae) seeds. Six Chiastocheta species (and two vicariant taxa) coexist on Trollius europaeus in Europe, where they were shown to be the sole pollinator of their host plant. In Asia, several Trollius species are parasitized by Chiastocheta spp., and several other Trollius species are free of Chiastocheta. The plant-insect association is thus obligate in Europe but facultative in Asia. This system therefore provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution of an obligate mutualism between a plant and its seed parasite pollinators and its consequences on insect diversification. Most parsimonious, distance, and maximum likelihood analyses of 16 haplotypes from Europe and 14 from Asia show that European species do not form a monophyletic group. The species relationship indicated by egg morphology is only partly supported by molecular data. Moreover, a strong discrepancy between nucleotide variation and male genitalia morphology variation was found, particularly within and among European species coexisting on a single host plant. Molecular divergence across species ranges from 0 to 4.6%, suggesting a recent origin of the genus and several events of diversification, involving both host shifts and within-host-plant radiation.

Recent research has raised the debate on the application of the species concepts to Oncocyclus irises. All the Oncocyclus species are able to produce vital progenies when crossed, thus, according to the Biological SC, they are a single biological species. Quantitative morphological characters are continuous among populations and also correlate with environmental conditions, preventing species delimitation according to Phenetic and Ecological SC. Genetic studies revealed high genetic diversity within the populations, thus, obscure delimitation by Phylogenetic SC. Pollination of the Oncocyclus irises is not species-specific, yet no transitional forms exist on the rare occasions of sympatric/parapatric distribution, roughly supporting delimitation according to the Recognition SC. The conclusion is that Oncocyclus populations do not clearly fit into species boundaries according to the relevant species concepts. Oncocyclus irises are distributed along an Ecogeographical Speciation Cline that could lead to one of three patterns of divergence, that is, discrete, ecotonal, or continuous, along the spatial dimension. Nonetheless, the exact variation pattern is not clear because of the patchy distribution.

This study describes the development of an emasculation protocol that did not require removal of the anthers, did not result in female sterility, and maintained fruit retention. Cotton flowers were saturated with water at different times throughout the day. Water sprayed into the flower after the pollen dehisced resulted in the osmotic disruption of the pollen grains and prevented self-pollination of the cotton flowers. Morphological analysis of isolated pollen grains before and after water treatment showed the exudation of pollen cytoplasm into the surrounding water medium within seconds of the water treatment. The water treatment resulted in the loss of fruiting bodies. Hand pollination of water-emasculated flowers produced seed numbers equivalent to self-pollinated controls. To quantify the level of self-pollination following water emasculation, 'Gregg 65' cotton (glandless, recessive trait) was water-emasculated, the stigma allowed to dry, and the flower pollinated with pollen from 'Paymaster HS-26' cotton (glanded, dominant trait). Evaluation of 66 flowers revealed that 100% of the seedlings obtained from these crosses had the glanded phenotype, thereby showing that no self-pollination had occurred. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the use of water as an effective emasculation tool for hybrid cotton production that does not result in female sterility and maintains fruit retention and seed set following subsequent pollination with pollen from another flower.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036329214

All members of the EREBP subfamily described to date are from dicotyledonous plants. In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a rice gene, OsEBP-89, encoding a protein 326 amino acids long with a typical EREBP domain; this is the first report of an EREBP transcription factor in a monocotyledonous plant. Except for the EREBP domain, the OsEBP-89 protein does not have substantial sequence similarities to other members of the subfamily. The DNA-binding activity of the EREBP domain was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. An activation domain rich in acidic amino acids was identified by using a yeast one-hybrid system. Two putative nuclear-localization signals were also identified. The results of northern blot hybridization experiments showed that the transcript of the OsEBP-89 gene accumulates primarily in immature seeds, roots, and leaves (low levels). More detailed information about the pattern of OsEBP-89 gene expression was obtained by histochemical studies of transgenic rice plants carrying an OsEBP-89 52?/GUS reporter gene. The reporter gene was expressed in the endosperm starting at 7 days after pollination and in the intercalary meristem of plants. Expression of OsEBP-89 was induced in roots of rice seedlings by treatment with ACC, NaCl, or 2, 4-D. Two cis-acting elements, an endosperm motif and a primary PERE, are present upstream of the OsEBP-89 coding region and may be involved in regulating its expression. Collectively, these results suggest that the OsEBP-89 gene is a new member of the EREBP subfamily and may be involved in ethylene-dependent seed maturation and shoot development of rice.",EREBP transcription factor; Gene expression; Gene family; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036790348

Nine percent of the native flora of 1159 taxa are already extinct, and 52.5% are at risk (extinct, endangered, vulnerable, or rare). Risk is strongly associated with limited geographic distribution at several scales: endemic taxa (native only to the Hawaiian Islands) are at far greater risk than indigenous taxa (with both Hawaiian and extra-Hawaiian ranges); single-island endemics are more at risk than multi-island endemics; small islands have the highest proportion of endemic taxa at risk; and endemics with more limited habitat distributions (elevation, community type) are more at risk. Historic population density is a strong predictor of risk, and taxa with low historic population densities are at greatest risk with rapid anthropogenic changes. Among the major islands, Maui Nui has the highest percent of taxa that are extinct. Kaua'i has the lowest percent of extinct taxa and the highest proportion of single-island endemic taxa that are rare. Endemic taxa at risk are associated with distributions in shrublands, forests, bogs, and cliff habitats. Endemic taxa with distributions in low elevation dry habitats have the highest proportion of taxa at risk, but the greatest absolute numbers of taxa at risk have distributions in mesic lowland and montane forests, and in wet montane forests. The life history patterns associated with risk are complicated, and inclusion of the effects of evolutionary relationships (lineages) changes some of these patterns. Species level analyses without respect to lineage shows risk associated with monomorphic (hermaphroditic) breeding systems and bird pollination because of the large number of hermaphroditic, bird-pollinated species in the Campanulaceae. Analyses incorporating the effect of lineage greatly reduce the impact of large lineages and result in an association of risk with insect pollination, and no effect of breeding system. There is no association of lineage size and the percent of taxa at risk within the lineage; endemic taxa from lineages with large radiations are at no greater risk than endemic single-taxon lineages. The percentages of taxa at risk at the family level in the Hawaiian Islands and worldwide (excluding Hawaiian taxa) are positively correlated, although flowering plant families in the Hawaiian Islands have a much greater proportion of taxa at risk. Some of the approaches described here may be useful to predict geographical and biological patterns of endangerment in island and island-like ecosystems under increasing pressures of endangerment and extinction. © Oxford University Press 2001.",Angiosperms; Biogeography; Conservation planning; Endangered plants; Endemism; Extinction; Hawaiian Islands; Rarity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036554505

The primary goals were to assess the level of heritable variation in asymmetry, the effect of selfing on mean asymmetry, and the relationship between asymmetry and components of fitness. A paternal half-sibling analysis of data on flower asymmetry failed to detect significant levels of genetic variation at the within-population level, whereas the between-population component reached significance for all measures of asymmetry. Analysis of family-structured data from another crossing experiment revealed significant between-population variation in cotyledon asymmetry and a tendency for inbred progeny to produce more asymmetric cotyledons than outbred progeny. However, the response to inbreeding was weak and differed in magnitude between populations. Judging from the ranking of populations, we found no support for the hypothesis that the mean expression of developmental stability is controlled by genomewide characteristics such as the level of inbreeding. Correlations between measures of asymmetry and fitness were too low to be declared statistically or biologically significant.

The disease causes plant defoliation, which reduces yield and fruit quality, and contributes to significant crop loss. Sources of resistance have been identified within related wild species of tomato. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for EB resistance in backcross populations of a cross between a susceptible tomato breeding line (NC84173; maternal and recurrent parent) and a resistant Lycopersicon hirsutum Humb. and Bonpl. accession (PI126445). Sixteen hundred BC1 plants were grown to maturity in a field in 1998. Plants that were self-incompatible, indeterminant in growth habit, and/or extremely late in maturity, were discarded in order to eliminate confounding effects of these factors on disease evaluation, QTL mapping, and future breeding research. The remaining 145 plants (referred to as the BC1 population) were genotyped for 141 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and 23 resistance gene analogs (RGAs), and a genetic linkage map was constructed. BC1 plants were evaluated for disease symptoms throughout the season, and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the final percent defoliation (disease severity) were determined for each plant. BC1 plants were self-pollinated and produced BC1S1 seed. The BC1S1 population, consisting of 145 BC1S1 families, was grown and evaluated for disease symptoms in replicated field trials in two subsequent years (1999 and 2000) and AUDPC and/or final percent defoliation were determined for each family in each year. Two QTL mapping approaches, simple interval mapping (SIM) and composite interval mapping (CIM), were used to identify QTLs for EB resistance in the BC1 and BC1S1 populations. QTL results were highly consistent across generations, years and mapping approaches. Approximately ten significant QTLs (LOD ? 2.4, P ? 0.001) were identified (and validated) for EB resistance, with individual effects ranging from 8.4% to 25.9% and with combined effects of &gt;57% of the total phenotypic variation. All QTLs had the positive alleles from the disease-resistant parent. The good agreement between results of the BC1 and 2 years of the BC1S1 generations indicated the stability of the identified QTLs and their potential usefulness for improving tomato EB resistance using marker-assisted selection (MAS). Further inspections using SIM and CIM indicated that six of the ten QTLs had independent additive effects and together could account for up to 56.4% of the total phenotypic variation. These complementary QTLs, which were identified in two generations and 3 years, should be the most useful QTLs for MAS and improvement of tomato EB resistance using PI126445 as a gene resource. Furthermore, the chromosomal locations of 10 of the 23 RGAs coincided with the locations of three QTLs, suggesting possible involvement of these RGAs with EB resistance and a potential for identifying and cloning genes which confer EB resistance in tomato.",Composite interval mapping; QTL mapping; Resistance gene analogs (RGAs); Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP); Self-incompatibility (SI),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036950007

Gene transfer from wild species into cultivated background depends on the success of interspecific hybridization, F1fertility, chromosome pairing for genetic recombination, efficient screening methods, and sufficient progenies for selection. Most wild annual species x sunflower crosses produce F11 seeds and can be backcrossed easily. For the more difficult perennial x sunflower crosses where hybrid seed set is rare, a two-step embryo culture technique has been established for rescuing immature interspecific embryos prior to abortion. The chromosome homology between genomes of wild species and cultivated sunflower is high, and the meiotic chromosome pairing of wild diploid x cultivated F11 is reasonably good, except for the multivalent formation, bridges, and fragments due to translocation and inversion differences. Chromosomal doubling by colchicine treatment substantially increases the F11 fertility, improves backcrossing success, and leads to the production of amphiploids. The amphiploids have restored fertility and can be maintained by sib-pollination, and will serve as a bridge for gene transfer. Using this approach, we successfully transferred genes resistant to the new broomrape race F, which attacks all the cultivated sunflower in Spain.

This study used a controlled greenhouse experiment to examine the effect of self- and cross-pollination in Mimulus guttatus (Scrophulariaceae) on resistance to and host plant quality for the xylem-feeding spittlebug Philaenus spumarius (Homoptera: Cercopidae). Spittlebugs were found to have a negative effect on two important fitness components in M. guttatus, flower production and aboveground biomass. One of two M. guttatus populations examined showed a significant interaction between the pollination and herbivore treatments. In this case, the detrimental effects of herbivores on biomass and flower production were much more pronounced in inbred (self) plants. The presence of spittlebug nymphs increased inbreeding depression by as much as three times. Pollination treatments also had significant effects on important components of herbivore fitness, but these effects were in opposite directions in our two host plant populations. Spittlebug nymphs maturing on self plants emerged as significantly larger adults in one of our host plant populations, indicating that inbreeding increased host plant quality. In our second host plant population, spittlebug nymphs took significantly longer to develop to adulthood on self plants, indicating that inbreeding decreased host plant quality. Taken together these results suggest that the degree of inbreeding in host plant populations can have important and perhaps complex effects on the dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions and on mating-system evolution in the host.",Herbivory; Host plant quality; Inbreeding; Mating system; Mimulus guttatus; Philaenus spumarius; Resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036006012

Pistils were collected seven days after controlled pollinations on the day of flower opening, and pollen tubes were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Diallel analysis showed significant specific combining ability, general combining ability and reciprocal effects between cultivars for pollen tube growth in the pistil. 'Frantoio' was cross-compatible, as either a male or female parent, with each of the other cultivars, but showed a high degree of self-incompatibility. 'Manzanillo', 'Kalamata', 'Pendolino', and 'Picual' were cross-incompatible, and all except for 'Manzanillo', were self-incompatible. It is concluded that 'Frantoio' is a good general polleniser for the other cultivars investigated. Pollen tube growth decreased in discrete steps from stigma to upper style, and from upper style to lower style, with the result that only one, and rarely more, pollen tube penetrated ovules. The sex ratio of flowers, and pollen viability using fluroescein diacetate staining and in vitro germination, were examined. 'Frantoio', 'Manzanillo' and 'Pendolino' had more than 80% perfect flowers, while 'Kalamata' and 'Picual' had less than 30%.

These features of a plant species can provide indirect information pertinent to conservation such as patterns and maintenance of genetic diversity, risk associated with inbreeding depression, and changes in pollinator abundance or effectiveness. The species is self-compatible, with 97% of selfed flowers setting fruit; pollinators were not required for reproduction. However, seed set in self-pollinated fruits averaged 17-20% less than that in open-pollinated fruits. Geitonogamous and facilitated selfing are possible throughout anthesis and autonomous selfing is possible late in anthesis as corollas abscise. Delaying self-pollination until after outcrossing opportunities likely limits selfing rates and thus reduces risks associated with inbreeding but allows reproduction in absence of pollinators. Supplementing pollen on open-pollinated flowers yielded no additional seed set over controls. Neither early-season browsing of primary stems nor conspecific plant density had significant effects on number of fruits per plant, on fruit size, or on number of seeds from open-pollinated flowers. Currently, reproduction appears to be high (about 2400 seeds/plant), and future risks due to lack of genetic diversity are likely low.",Agalinis acuta; Endangered species; Mating system; Reproductive ecology; Scrophulariaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036302738

Don] Spach) exhibit a low capacity for germination, primarily as a result of coat-imposed dormancy. Dormancy of the mature (intact) seed is effectively terminated by a three day soak (21°C) and a warm moist period (four weeks at 20°C) followed by at least eight weeks of moist chilling (2-4°C). This treatment is used by most nurseries and the B.C. Ministry of Forests, albeit with some variation. A chemical treatment using the anaesthetic 1-propanol promotes high germinability of yellow-cedar seeds, when combined with a three day warm water soak (30°C), a two day GA3 treatment and 60 days of moist chilling. Here we compare the effectiveness of the more traditional warm/cold treatments (performed on moistened Kimpak or in moist sand) with our chemical treatment in terms of their capacity to elicit vigorous post-germinative growth following seedling emergence under nursery greenhouse conditions. Two seed lots (42313 and 43697) and open-pollinated seed from parent trees 19-8 and 13-6 showed equivalent emergence and vigorous post-germinative growth following the chemical and more traditional dormancy-breaking treatments. The chemical protocol offers three advantages over more traditional procedures: (1) it reduces the time required to break seed dormancy; (2) it leads to synchronous and high germinabillty and rapid post-germinative growth and (3) it minimizes the unpredictability of traditional protocols that require more rigorous monitoring of moisture content.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036339168

These functional responses express how the population growth rate of a mutualist is modified by the density of its partner. We present several possible dependencies of gross benefits and costs, and hence net effects, to a mutualist as functions of the density of its partner. Net effects to mutualists are likely a monotonically saturating or unimodal function of the density of their partner. We show that fundamental differences in the growth, limitation, and dynamics of a population can occur when net effects to that population change linearly, unimodally, or in a saturating fashion. We use the mutualism between senita cactus and its pollinating seed-eating moth as an example to show the influence of different benefit and cost functional responses on population dynamics and stability of mutualisms. We investigated two mechanisms that may alter this mutualism's functional responses: distribution of eggs among flowers and fruit abortion. Differences in how benefits and costs vary with density can alter the stability of this mutualism. In particular, fruit abortion may allow for a stable equilibrium where none could otherwise exist.",Benefits and costs; Density dependence; Functional response; Mutuatism; Population dynamics; Stability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036183752

Levels of genetic diversity in Q. acutissima populations were comparable to mean values for other oak species.

Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed little evidence of significant genetic structure at spatial scales of 100-120 m. The failure to detect genetic structure within populations may be due to intraspecific competition or random mortality among saplings, resulting in extensive thinning within maternal half-sib groups. Alternatively, low genetic differentiation at the landscape scale indicates substantial gene flow among local populations. Although wind-borne pollen may be the primary source of gene flow in Q. acutissima, these results suggest that acorn movement by animals may be more extensive than previously anticipated. Comparison of these genetic data for Oenaro Island with a disturbed isolated inland population suggests that population-to-population differences in internal genetic structure may be influenced by local variation in regeneration environment (e.g., disturbance).",Allozymes; Coancestry; Fagaceae; Landscape scale; Quercus acutissima; Seed dispersal; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036678064

In 1986 and 1999 we recorded numbers of pin-thrum flower morphs in respectively 34 and 89 populations. No structural imbalance in flower morph numbers was found, but imbalances were significantly larger in small populations. Moreover, relative imbalance also increased between 1986 and 1999. Population persistence however, was not correlated with morph imbalance: changes in population size between the two survey periods did not depend on initial flower morph imbalance. Results are compared with other heterostyly-related population research in Primula species and the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes for population persistence are discussed. To conclude, the introduction of missing morphs into relic populations with only pin or thrum plants is suggested to reduce pollinator-limited seed set.",Conservation; Heterostyly; Primula vulgaris; Small landscape element,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036388040

Don., is one of the most important endemic species in Japan. A long history of heavy logging has resulted in natural populations being discontinuously distributed and scattered among small, restricted areas. An understanding of the patterns of genetic variability among and within populations of C. japonica is important for conserving the genetic resources of this economically important species. We studied genetic variation by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers in C. japonica of Kyoto prefecture, western Japan. A total of 398 plants sampled from six natural populations were analyzed by ten arbitrarily chosen decamer primers, resulting in 50 highly reproducible RAPD bands. Analysis of molecular variance partitionated the RAPD variation into the among- and within-population components. The within-population component accounted for 93.75% of the variation. The among-population component accounted for only 6.25%. Indirect estimates of gene flow indicated that the average number of migrants exchanged among six populations per generation was 3.72. A Mantel test for each population did not yield significant correlations between geographic and genetic distances. The extent and distribution of C. japonica diversity in the Kyoto prefecture is in agreement with the conclusion that long-lived, wind-pollinated, out-crossing species with wide ranges retain a considerable amount of genetic diversity within populations and exhibit little genetic differentiation among populations.",Clonal propagation; Conservation; Cryptomeria japonica D.

Consequently, there are ample opportunities for gene flow between domesticated and free-living Cucurbita populations. We used allozymes to examine genetic variation and gene flow among these three Cucurbita taxa in the state of Jalisco in Western Mexico. Twelve polymorphic allozyme loci were used to calculate genetic diversity for 16 populations of Cucurbita.

Grain yields in pearl millet were greater in plots treated with 1,3-dichloropropene than in control plots and were negatively correlated with leaf blight severity.

The most widespread system of self incompatibility is gametophytic, in which pollen tube growth is inhibited in the style by the action of a single locus (S-locus). Similar inhibition of pollen tube growth can also be observed in interspecific crosses, where successful pollinations occur in only one direction, termed unilateral incompatibility. We observed unilateral incompatibility in crosses between Solanum pinnatisectum and S. cardiophyllum, and viable interspecific hybrid seed was generated only when S. pinnatisectum was the pistillate parent. Segregations in the backcross to S. cardiophyllum revealed two independently segregating putative loci controlling interspecific crossability. Both putative loci were inherited independently of the S-locus. Segregation ratios in the back-cross to the S. pinnatisectum parent did not agree with those observed in the backcross to the S. cardiophyllum parent. These reciprocal backcross families revealed that unilateral incompatibility is not conditioned by a single locus, and is inherited independently of the S-locus.

Our study was conducted on populations of sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia L. f.) separated by a road and natural woodland, and buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis L.) separated by a railroad. Bumblebees showed high site fidelity and only rarely crossed roads or railroads. When bees captured at one sweet pepperbush population were moved across a road to a new sweet pepperbush population and released, they returned to their original site, some within 20 min of their capture. When all inflorescences were removed from one sweet pepperbush patch, most bees moved to another sweet pepperbush population on the same side of the road. The results show that while bumblebees have the ability to cross a road and railroad, these human structures may restrict bumblebee movement and act to fragment plant populations because of the innate site fidelity displayed by foraging bees. Moreover, marked bees were almost never observed to move between populations unless they were displaced, or forced to seek additional forage sites. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Only one of the four dwarf cultivars (SW-103) displayed a higher harvest index than IS-6111. Higher seed yield for the standard-height cultivar, IS-6111, and the dwarf open-pollinated cultivar, Aurora, compared to other cultivars was attributed to both greater DM and improved DM partitioning.

We examined behaviours related to the choice and collection of pollen by foragers among six floral species and three artificial substrates (pollen analogues). First, we evaluated the responses of honeybees to the odours produced by different pollens (or pollen analogues) and pollen lipid extracts. Honeybees displayed similar levels of preference to the odours produced by all pollen species over those of pollen analogues, with a similar pattern of response shown to their extracts. We then evaluated behaviours of foragers in response to variation in particle size, using soybean meal that was ground and sifted to create a hierarchy of particle size classes. Bees preferred particle sizes below 150 ?m, but the greatest response was shown for those particle sizes below 45 ?m. We also assayed the effect of varying protein content on the foraging decisions made by bees by mixing soy flour with different proportions of cellulose powder. Foragers, however, were incapable of discriminating protein content. We determined changes in the response of foragers to different levels of handling time using different sized screens through which bees were forced to crawl to reach an attractive pollen odour source. In these tests, pollen-seeking behaviours were seen to decrease with increases in handling time. When odour was presented simultaneously with other stimuli, it was the primary and overriding cue used by bees to select pollen. These results suggest that individual honeybee foragers do not discriminate among pollen sources based on intrinsic differences in quality, but instead evaluate cues that may increase their efficiency of collection and recruitment to such a food resource. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036057267

We report on a pollination experiment with the fleshy-fruited tall-shrub Prunus mahaleb at the margin of its distributional range, where reproduction might be especially limiting. Two small and isolated populations in northern Switzerland were studied for effects of pollen quantity and pollen quality on the timing of fruit abortion. There was evidence that spontaneous self-pollination led to particularly high abortion. Fruit abortion was delayed after hand pollination, which indicates limitation of pollen quantity. Self-pollination led to earlier abortion compared with experimental pollination within or between populations. There was no significant evidence for outbreeding depression in fruit abortion. We conclude that reproduction and dispersal of P. mahaleb in central Europe might be negatively affected by pollen limitation and inbreeding effects, i.e. by both pollen quantity and quality.",Breeding system; Fruit abortion; Inbreeding depression; Margin of distribution; Prunus mahaleb; Relict populations; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036030227

At five commercial fields in 1998 and 1999, biennial caraway flowered for 7 wk, beginning in late May or early June and finishing by early to mid-July. Under optimal conditions, and assuming intense foraging activity by honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), caraway might yield 70-134 kg honey ha-1. However, weights of colonies near fields of caraway (0.47-4.2 hives ha-1) changed little while honey bees were predominant foragers on that crop. Then, in the second half of the caraway flowering period, when honey bees had almost deserted those fields as indicated by observation and pollen-trap analyses, hive weights rose steadily due to a switch to nearby crops of canola (Brassica spp.) and sweet clover (Melilotus spp.), which had begun to flower. Whereas biennial caraway is rated as negligible to only moderate for its honey potential in Saskatchewan, 83% of honey bees visiting caraway florets gathered pollen. Moreover, caraway pollen entering hives averaged 11% of total pollen (dry weight) over the entire flowering period of the crop, but 36.5% during the first half of flowering phenology, suggesting that biennial caraway may constitute a valuable source of protein for honey bees, particularly during colony build-up in spring.",Caraway (Carum carvi); Flowering phenology; Hive weights; Honey bee foraging; Honey potential; Pollen-trap collection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036216699

Rare species were significantly more likely than common species to be associated with open-habitat communities (tallgrass prairie, alvar, and meadow) and significantly less likely to be found in aquatic habitats. Rare species were also significantly more likely to be insect-pollinated and to have larger fruits than common species. Furthermore, they were less likely to be dioecious, wind-pollinated, shrubby, clonal, or to produce fruits having many seeds. Rare-common differences were examined across nine large, ordinal-level monophyletic groups in order to reduce the phylogenetic influences of derived traits. Results concerning pollination, fruit size, number of seeds per fruit, life form, and clonality were each confirmed within at least one monophyletic group, suggesting that over-abundance of derived traits did not produce these rare- common results. In a separate comparison of rare woody species, rare species were significantly more likely (than common woody ones) to have a short flowering period, animals as dispersers, and large fruits: rare woody species were less likely to be wind dispersed or to inhabit moist/wet substrates. An inability to exploit new habitats or to cope with anthropogenic change appear to be the most important general features associated with rarity.

More traditional warm/cold treatments were also effective, provided that high seed moisture content was strictly maintained, particularly during moist chilling (35-40% on a fresh weight basis). Protein reserve mobilization and induction of isocitrate lyase activities in the embryo and megagametopbyte following germination indicated that early post-germinative events were equivalent when dormancy termination of seeds was achieved by the chemical versus the more traditional warm/cold treatment.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036339354

Winslow, Broadhurst, Buchanan, Krumwiede, Rogers, and Smith] following field infection were recorded using families resulting primarily from open-pollination of Malus sylvestris (L.) Mill. var.domestica (Borkh.) Mansf. cultivars and a few other Malus Mill. sp. The families were structured as three sublines, planted in three successive years (1992 to 1994), of a diverse population of apple germplasm established at HortResearch, Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. The incidence of fire blight varied among the sublines with the oldest planting exhibiting more fire blight. Flowering trees were more likely to be infected than nonflowering trees, in terms of both incidence and severity. Furthermore, the level of fire blight was related to flowering date, with later flowering trees having higher levels. Thus, family means and narrow-sense heritability estimates were computed after first adjusting the fire blight score for flowering date by fitting a linear model. Provenance of origin of the maternal parent explained little variation except that M. sieversii Lebed. families were more resistant than M. sylvestris var. domestica families in one subline. Family means computed using all trees, and those from only flowering trees were highly correlated. Families from open-pollination of M. honanensis Rehder and M. xhartwiggii Koehne females were among the more susceptible. Those from several European M. sylvestris var. domestica cultivars as well as from M. baccata (L.) Borkh. and M. toringoides (Rehder) Hughes females were among the more resistant families. Narrow-sense heritability estimates ranged from 0.05 to 0.85 depending on the subline, with most estimates between 0.12 and 0.36. They were higher in the two older sublines that consisted primarily of open-pollinated families from M. sylvestris var. domestica, and lower in the younger subline that consisted primarily of M. sieversii, due to lower incidence and severity in the latter subline. Breeders who consider potential complications of juvenility, tree size, and flowering date in relation to infection periods should be able to exploit field epidemics to perform effective selection.",Disease resistance; Erwinia amylovora; Flowering; Heritability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036191704

The formulae considered: number of seeds collected, ratio of seeds from selfing, fertility variation of pollen parents, relatedness among pollen parents and amount of pollination by alien fathers from outside the seed orchard (pollen contamination). The results showed that the status number of seeds collected from a single clone generally varied between 2 and 4 in most cases. Typically it was close to 4, thus close to that of an ""ideal"" half-sib family. Relatedness among pollen parents and selfing decreased status number and gene diversity while pollen contamination increased it. Effect of the level of pollen contamination and fertility variation among pollen parents on gene diversity of crops from the same seed parent was usually small. High degree of relatedness and selfing can be important. If there were few pollen parents, the gene diversity depended greatly on relatedness, selfing and fertility variation. However, if there were many pollen parents (about 10 or more), these factors were not important.

One possible cause of differential family performance in eucalypt species with mixed mating systems is variation in the level of inbreeding. Outcrossing rates were estimated for ten trees from each of four populations in the Petford region of north-east Queensland using allozymes. They were amongst the highest recorded in eucalypts (mean tm = 0.95) with relatively little variation among families (tm = 0.60-1.0). Regression analyses revealed a significant association between family outcrossing rates and growth which varied among populations. A positive association was observed in one population; negative relationships in the other three populations may reflect outbreeding depression associated with hybridisation. Differences in outcrossing rates did not explain a significant level of variation in seedlot viability or survival assessed at two years of age. The high mean outcrossing rates for the four populations of E. camaldulensis, together with the low proportion of variation in growth attributed to outcrossing rate, suggest that inbreeding is unlikely to be a problem in the first generation of tree improvement using open-pollinated families sourced from natural populations in the Petford region.",Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Outbreeding depression; Outcrossing rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036067942

To test this hypothesis, we performed controlled pollinations using C. scandens as the female parent and C. scandens or C. orbiculatus as the male parent. Although both the interspecific and intraspecific pollinations resulted in a comparable percentage of germinating seedlings, the seedlings from the interspecific crosses had less seed dormancy and were more vigorous than the intraspecific seedlings.

Studies have indicated that high levels of saturated fat consumption are correlated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. The total saturated fat content of oil from current sunflower hybrids averages about 130 g kg-1. To identify sunflower germplasm with reduced saturated fatty acid composition, a total of 884 cultivated sunflower accessions from the USDA-ARS North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station, Ames, Iowa, were screened for fatty acid composition by gas chromatography. PI 250542, a cultivar collected in Egypt by Paul Knowles and deposited into the National Plant Germplasm System in 1958, was identified as an accession with reduced saturated fatty acid content. The fatty acid composition of 26 halfseeds of PI 250542 was determined, and the seeds with lowest saturated fatty acids were grown in the greenhouse. Pollen from a single plant was used to pollinate NMS HA 89, and the F1 seed was grown in the field and self-pollinated. After three generations of selection by half-seed analysis, two lines with a low saturated fatty acid trait were selected. Line RS1 has a striped black and dark gray achene, whereas line RS2 has a light gray achene which often bleaches to white when grown in the field. The total saturated fatty acid composition of RS1 including C16 to C24 fatty acids was 77 g kg-1, and for RS2 was 76 g kg-1when grown at Fargo, North Dakota, in 2000. To determine inheritance of the reduced saturated fatty acid trait, RS1 and RS2 were pollinated by HA 821, a high saturated fatty acid line, and grown in the greenhouse.

F. crenata in PO-type forests regenerates sporadically rather than constantly, whereas regeneration in the JS-type forests is relatively constant with gap dynamics. F. crenata has dominated in snowy areas both in the past, after the last glacial age, when there was less human disturbance, and in the present. Snow accumulation facilitaties beech regeneration in snowy JS-type forests, but not in the less snowy PO-type. Snow protects beechnuts from damage caused by rodents, desiccation, and freezing. In addition, snow suppresses dwarfbamboo in the spring, thus increasing the amount of sunlight available for beech seedlings on the forest floor. Snow also supplies melt water during the growing season and limits the distribution of herbivores. Moreover, snow reduces the number of forest fires during the dry winter and early spring seasons. The low densities of F. crenata impede its regeneration, because disturbed wind pollination lowers seed fertility and predators are less effectively satiated. In snowy JS-type beech forests, F. crenata dominates both at the adult and the juvenile stages because it regenerates well, while other species are eliminated by heavy snow pressure. On the less snowy PO-side, deciduous broad-leaved forests with various species are a primary feature, although F. crenata dominates because of its large size and long lifespan.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036903728

Three sheep trails with altogether 12 calcareous grassland sites were chosen for the analysis of the tussock grass Bromus erectus, which is known to be the species with the highest rate of dispersal via sheep fleece. Each trail links two to four isolated populations. Allozymes were chosen as genetic markers. Six loci were used, five of which were polymorphic. While genetic variability within populations was found to be quite high (averaged h = 0.352), only little between-population differentiation was measured (GST = 5.5%). Despite this, the UPGMA-dendrogram of Nei's genetic distance shows genetic similarity relations largely congruent with the sheep herding trails. However, a (more) detailed comparison reveals several differences between genetic patterns and trail system. Hence, additional factors other than dispersal by sheep are regarded as being responsible for exchange of genes, and sheep herding is considered to have only minor importance for the genetic patterns of the investigated species. The comparison of Bromus erectus to species with the same life history traits (i.e. pollination by wind, a perennial life cycle, and autopolyploid constitution) shows similar values, thus providing further evidence for the relatively small contribution of dispersal via sheep fleece. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The flowers are morphologically highly diverse and offer either nectar, pollen or resin as a reward for pollinators. Resin production in flowers is a poorly studied phenomenon, known from only five angiosperm genera. Variation in sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region was analysed cladistically in order to trace the evolution of floral resin production in Clusia, and as a first step towards a phylogenetically based reclassification of the genus. The most parsimonious trees show that the genera Havetia, Havetiopsis, Oedematopus and Quapoya are nested inside Clusia. Traditionally, Clusia has been divided into sections based on androecial variation, and most of these groups are supported as monophyletic based on the ITS data. Sections Retinostemon, Havetia and Cochlanthera together form one of very few well-supported suprasectional groups. Character optimisation experiments suggest that resiniferous flowers have evolved at least three times independently in Clusia, but a character-evolution model with a single origin for floral resin is only slightly less parsimonious. Clades of resiniferous species are morphologically the most diverse, and it is concluded that resin production has been a key innovation triggering floral morphological diversification.

Our previous studies have shown that natural populations of this species in southern France exhibit higher male frequencies (?50%) than predicted on theoretical grounds. Thus, the male functionality of hermaphrodites is still debated. To assess the functional breeding system of this species in the wild, a paternity analysis was performed with two highly polymorphic microsatellite loci on 729 seeds collected on 10 maternal shrubs in a natural population of 24 mature individuals of P. angustifolia. A large proportion of seeds were found to have been sired by pollen from outside the population. Analysis of seeds sired by individuals within the study population revealed a high male fertility of hermaphrodites resulting in a low male advantage in fertility for male plants. Intermate distances were found to have a strong impact on male reproductive success, whereas sexual morph had no effect, with males and hermaphrodites performing equivalently.

Management, Darwin Building, King's Building, Mayfield Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JU, United Kingdom","This study represents the third investigation into the additive genetic variances operating within an unselected population of Sitka spruce trees of known single origin. The work presented here involves wood density; how the additive genetic variances vary with age, optimum selection ages and the genetic relationship between wood density and stem diameter. A genotypic selection ellipse constructed with existing data collected within the open-pollinated progeny test for 17-year density and 16-year diameter was used to help select a subsample of 46 families from the 125 available. To avoid possible bias, the complete data for each trait used to construct the ellipse were included as covariates in the calculation of all wood density variance components. Wood density weighted by surface area was estimated on a ring by ring basis using X-ray densitometry. Subsequent analyses such as correlations between ages of density assessment or between density and diameter were carried out by combining consecutive rings together into ring-groupings. The youngest available ring grouping represented years 6 to 9 from planting (RG6-9), whilst the oldest (RG19-22) represented years 19 to 22 from planting which was considered as the breeding goal. The study confirmed the very high single-tree and family heritability for wood density found in earlier studies but demonstrated that these values can fall sharply with age, leveling off around RG12-15. The high heritability values for wood density of RG6-9 (h2i = 0.85; h2f = 0.96) coupled with the very high genetic correlations (rA = 0.95) between wood density of RG6-9 and RG19-22 suggests that selection for mature wood density can safely be made based on measurements of wood density in the juvenile core. Both generation (Qgen) and genetic gain per year (Qyear) efficiencies are improved by around 40% if selection for wood density is carried out as young as nine years from planting. Further improvements of 90% and over 100% are achieved if the delay (d) necessary to bring about flowering in young selection could be reduced to five or three years respectively after selection. High (negative) genetic correlations between early wood densities (RG6-9) and later diameter assessments (DM16) of around rA = -0.70 indicates the problems of selecting Sitka spruce trees for improved diameter growth whilst preventing a fall in wood density.",Genetic correlations; Genetic variation; Heritability; Indirect selection; Phenotypic correlations; Picea sitchensis; Progeny testing; Selection age,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2242490023

The frequency distribution of the right-minus-left scores had a narrower peak than expected for normally-distributed data, but there was no directional asymmetry or antisymmetry. Despite evidence for inbreeding depression in seedling biomass and cotyledon size, the type of cross had negligible influence on cotyledon asymmetry. Separate analyses of between-population hybrids revealed differences among progenies from different pairs of populations and a tendency for the F1 hybrid means to decrease with the geographic distance separating the parent populations, but only for the two size variables. Based on these and other observations, we propose that the degree of cotyledon asymmetry is unrelated to genome-wide characteristics, such as the level of heterozygosity and genomic co-adaptation, and that cotyledon asymmetry is unrelated to the level of genetic stress experienced by each individual. Hence, there is no reason to consider measures of asymmetry as more sensitive indicators of genetic health than conventional fitness variables.",Brassica cretica; Brassica oleracea; Crossing distance; Developmental stability; Fluctuating asymmetry; Genomic co-adaptation; Heterozygosity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036010103

The study aims to test the monophyly of tribe Acherontiini; the hypothesis that all taxa with extremely long probosces (some Acherontiini, Meganoton rubescens, Neococytius, Xanthopan) form a monophyletic group, or at least fall within a single reasonably compact clade; and, within this group, to determine whether Xanthopan is more closely related to Acherontiini or to Cocytius and Neococytius. The data set comprises 109 characters derived from adult and immature stage morphology, biology and behaviour. These data were analysed using equal weighting, successive approximations character weighting (SACW) and implied weighting. All weighting schemes agreed on the monophyly of Acherontiini and of a group of genera comprising Amphimoea, Cocytius and Neococytius (the Cocytius group). Several other generic and suprageneric clades were also consistently recovered. However, those hawkmoths with extremely long probosces were never recovered as a monophyletic group. The relationships of Xanthopan were also ambiguous. Equal weighting and SACW placed Xanthopan + Meganoton rubescens (Butler) as sister to the Cocytius group, while implied weighting placed Xanthopan as sister to Acherontiini. This latter relationship is based primarily on shared possession of a pilifer/palp hearing organ. Further analyses suggested the two components of this organ were not biologically independent. Downweighting this feature accordingly resulted in all weighting schemes converging on the topology found by equal weighting. Exclusion of the incomplete subset of immature stage data had no effect under implied weighting but equal weighting and SACW now recovered a Neotropical clade comprising Manduca and the Cocytius group, while Xanthopan was placed with M. rubescens and Panogena. Downweighting the pilifer/palp hearing organ under implied weighting again caused convergence with the equal weighting/SACW results. Thus, the relationships of Xanthopan remain equivocal and further data, particularly from the immature stages, will be required to elucidate its phylogenetic position further. © 2002 The Linnean Society of London.",Cocytius group; Immature stages; Implied weighting; Morphology; Orchidaceae; Phylogeny; Pollination; Sphinginae; Successive approximations character weighting; Total evidence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036058990

However, the lack of specific commercial extracts combined with the early pollination period of cypress trees make a precise diagnosis difficult. The need for a reliable and effective cypress extract for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is increasingly felt. METHODS: Mixed or single Cupressus arizonica, lusitanica and sempervirens pollen extracts precipitated with ammonium sulfate (PPT) were compared by direct RAST, RAST inhibition and SDS-PAGE techniques. The major allergen of C. arizonica (Cup a 1), purified by anion exchange chromatography, was checked by immunoblotting experiments before chemical modification, in parallel with a C. arizonica extract, with potassium cyanate (KCNO) to obtain a monomeric allergoid. The allergoid extract was characterized for its biological, chemico-physical and immunological features by RAST inhibition, SDS-PAGE and ELISA assays. RESULTS: Direct RAST, RAST inhibition, and SDS-PAGE data indicated that the PPT C. arizonica pollen extract showed the most allergenic potential, and it can be considered representative of the Cupressus spp. Immunoblotting data confirmed Cup a 1 as a major allergen. RAST inhibition and ELISA showed that modified PPT C. arizonica extract had less IgE reactivity than the native, non-modified extract, while preserving the immunogenic capacity typical for an allergoid. Finally, the SDS-PAGE profile of Cup a 1 allergoid was similar to native Cup a 1 allergen, suggesting the modified C. arizonica extract shows the characteristics of a monomeric allergoid. CONCLUSIONS: The PPT C. arizonica pollen extract shows good in vitro diagnostic potential and its chemically modified form offers the features of a monomeric allergoid. It might therefore lend itself to the development of a product to be administered by the sublingual or oromucosal route for immunotherapy of individuals with cypress pollinosis. Copyright 2002 S.

The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate a rapid, simple technique for characterizing apomictic potential (percentage of ovules that produce apomictic embryos) in guayule breeding lines. Initial in vivo experiments were based on an auxin test that permitted quantification of apomictic frequency in grasses. In our trials, floral application of NAA or IBA resulted in embryo production similar to that of open-pollinated controls, but 2,4-D inhibited embryo production. Breeding lines could be separated based on embryo production using an in vivo auxin test; however, accuracy of the results was questionable because 1) pollen release and insect activity within isolation bags prevented distinguishing between sexual and apomictic embryos, and 2) high temperatures and large humidity fluctuations could have affected results. Thus, in vitro flower culture was investigated using liquid medium, because it would provide better control of these factors. Flowers developed normally in vitro, except that pollen was not released from the anthers; therefore, any embryos produced in vitro were considered to be apomictic. Embryo production was similar on both Nitsch and Nitsch and Woody Plant Media. Addition of growth regulators inhibited embryo production. Embryo production was tested on Nitsch and Nitsch medium without growth regulators for seven breeding lines. Based on statistical analyses, four classes of apomictic potential were identified, ranging from none (sexual) to high. Chemical names used: 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D); indole-3-butyric acid (IBA); ?-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).",Apomixis; Asteraceae; Auxin; Mitotic diplospory; Ovule culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036220830

Using direct and indirect methods, the viability and longevity of pollen grains from young and mature individuals of the species N. antarctica, N. obliqua, N. dombeyi, and N. betuloides were assessed. Pollen germination in vivo was evaluated in hand-pollinated and naturally pollinated receptive stigmas of both categories. To assess pollen viability indirectly, in vitro germination on a sucrose-agar culture medium was performed. Alexander's procedure (an indirect method) was used to evaluate viability immediately after pollen collection and longevity after 3, 6, and 12 months of storage. Pollen germination in vivo ranged from 52 to 74% in young individuals and 68 to 84% in mature trees. In vitro germination ranged from 46 to 71% in young individuals and 49 to 85% in mature trees. Fresh pollen dyed with Alexander's stain reached 91-100% viability. Similar values were obtained after three months of storage. After 6 months, pollen viability reduced to 66% and after one year of storage, viability had dropped to 21 to 50%, with mature individuals showing the highest loss of viability.

It is distributed principally along the Andes from Colombia to Chile and Argentina, and it is especially diversified in the Central Andes and in the deserts and semideserts of southern South America. The genus exhibits a wide array of leaf-morphology types and two different head and floral types apparently related to hummingbird and insect pollination. In this study, phylogenetic relationships among Chuquiraga species were resolved by parsimony cladistic analysis using morphological characters. The resulting cladogram was used to interpret morphological, ecological, and biogeographical patterns in a historical context. Biotic and abiotic environmental factors hypothesized to have exerted selective pressure on morphological traits of its species were optimized onto the phylogeny to suggest how and when these factors may have affected the evolution and diversification of the genus. Results suggest an origin of the genus in southern South America, with two major evolutionary radiations, one more northern in the Central and Northern Andes, and the other in the Southern Andes and the North Chilean, Patagonia and Monte Deserts. Pollination by hummingbirds seems to have been an important factor in the origin of the northern clade, affecting floral morphology. Herbivory by vertebrates and increased aridity seem to have been important selective forces in the evolution and diversification of the southern clade, especially affecting leaf morphology. These changes were probably associated with the major elevation of the Andes in late Tertiary and with the hyperaridization and climatic fluctuations of Pleistocene and Holocene times.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036114312

The natural fruiting rate of L. ovata is relatively high (up to 90%) and does not seem to be pollinator limited. Some costs of reproduction especially in terms of leaf size were observed. The dormancy is important in the population dynamics. In some years even one third of the population may be dormant. L. ovata produces enough seeds and offspring to maintain or even increase population sizes.

Spring shoot elongation patterns were similar in all populations and families for 9 out of 10 years. In contrast, at all ages, populations differed significantly in total summer shoot growth and number of summer flushes. Families within populations differed in number of summer flushes in 7 out of 10 years. Summer shoot growth was the major cause of the differences in annual height growth among the six populations. Significant and high correlations were observed between summer shoot growth at Ages 7 to 12 and height at Age 13. A population from near the middle of the species' altitudinal range had more summer flushes than populations from higher or lower elevations, indicating an opportunistic growth pattern. Compared with mid-elevation populations, low- and high-elevation populations had more conservative growth patterns that depended mainly on growth of spring shoots.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying speciation is a key problem of evolutionary biology. Studies on the genetic basis of adaptation to particular site factors and the role of these adaptations in plant speciation are fundamental to our understanding of the origin of plant biodiversity. In this project, we study the genetic basis of adaptation to serpentine soil as an incipient step in habitat-driven speciation in the bladder campion, Silene vulgaris. 2. Previous studies have shown that Silene vulgaris plants growing on serpentine soil near Davos (CH) and plants growing in neighbouring non-serpentine areas are morphologically distinct and differ largely in tolerance to high nickel concentration. We will carry out pollination experiments to test whether reproductive isolation has already evolved between neighbouring serpentine-adapted and non-adapted populations in Davos and if so, if barriers are genetically determined or habitat-induced. 3. The genetic architecture of adaptation to the serpentine habitat will be studied by constructing a linkage map in an F2 population resulting from a cross between a tolerant and a non-tolerant plant. Mapped molecular markers will then be correlated with morphological traits of plants and with physiological tolerance to high Ni concentration and low Ca/Mg ratio to determine quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adaptation to serpentine soil. 4. To study the relevance of particular QTL for plant performance under natural conditions, cuttings of plants used in genetic mapping will be transplanted into the field at sites with serpentine and non-serpentine soils. The performance of transplants will be monitored during two growing seasons. 5. This combination of genetic mapping with physiological studies and tests of the ecological performance of the same plants under natural conditions will make it possible to study relationships between adaptation and fitness at a much finer scale than population-level studies. The results of our project should therefore considerably increase our understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation and, eventually, of speciation in plants.",Heavy-metal tolerance; QTL; Reciprocal transplant experiment; Reproductive isolation; Serpentine; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036377372

The goal of this study was to determine whether production of chasmogamous (CH) and cleistogamous (CL) flowers as well as delayed CH selfing in the perennial herb Viola pubescens enhances reproductive output in a heterogeneous environment. A central Ohio population was monitored for several years to study its reproductive biology and to measure selfing rates in CH flowers. A temporal switch from CH to CL flowers corresponded with a reduction in light availability as the forest canopy formed. Although similar numbers of CH and CL flowers were produced per plant, CH flowers were nearly twice as likely to disperse seeds as CL flowers. Both floral types had similar numbers of seeds with comparable mass, and there was no difference in emergence of CH and CL seedlings. In addition to outcrossing, CH flowers were capable of delayed selfing if left unvisited by insect pollinators. This was consistent with the rate of selfing over a 2-yr period (0.60, 0.07) measured with allozymes. Both CH and CL flowers contributed to reproduction in V. pubescens as well as delayed CH selfing, thereby creating a mating system that may be an adaptation to pollinator or resource unpredictability within the flowering season.",Chasmogamy; Cleistogamy; Delayed selfing; Viola pubescens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036144488

I found no significant difference in pollen deposition and fecundity between individuals on non-isolated and isolated islands. Furthermore, there were no differences in seed germinability, seed predation, and survival associated with isolation.

The cultivars CNY and CKR differed markedly in their ability to produce pistillate flowers under the experimental conditions. Nevertheless, both cultivars did set parthenocarpic fruits spontaneously, after emasculation and covering of the female flowers. In the autumn (late November), parthenocarpic fruit-set was promoted by cool night temperatures. However, the unfavourable winter climate (late January) limited fruit set in both parthenocarpic and pollinated treatments. There were no significant differences in fruit number per plant or in mean fruit weight between plants subjected to active hand pollination and those that underwent passive (covering pistillate flower without emasculation) self-pollination, but the plants in each of these treatments produced more fruits than those in the parthenocarpy treatment. As expected, parthenocarpic fruits had no viable seeds. Fruits developed by passive pollination had significantly fewer seeds than those developed by active pollination treatments, but their seeds were larger and exhibited inferior germination. Pollen source (self or cross) had no significant effects on fruit set or on fruit weight, but it significantly affected the number of fully developed seeds in CKR in the autumn experiment.

Through these varied functions, plant thigmo systems have evolved impressive controls of cell differentiation, localized growth rates, regulated synthesis of novel products, and some elegant traps and projectile systems. For most thigmo events, there will be a dependence upon transmission of a signal from the cell wall through the plasmalemma and into the cytoplasm. We propose the possible involvement of integrin-like proteins, Hechtian strands, and cytoskeletal structures as possible transduction components. Many thigmo mechanisms may use some modification of the calcium/calmodulin signal transduction system, though the details of transduction systems are still poorly understood.

There is evidence that it maintains the individuals with greater grain yield. The question arises whether natural selection preserves the individuals which are more adapted only to the environment where the generation advance occurred, that is, if it contributes to increasing the genotype x environment interaction in the family assessment. This study was carried out to check this hypothesis in the common bean plant using families derived from a segregating population from a cross between the Carioca MG x ESAL 686 cultivars. The segregating populations increase in homozygosity was obtained by the population (bulk) method until the F14 generation, in three distinct locations in Minas Gerais state: Lavras, Lambari and Patos de Minas. Forty-seven F14:15 families were randomly taken from the population in each location and later multiplied to obtain F14:16 families.

Tests of this ""pollen-competition hypothesis,"" however, have been equivocal, and this may, in part, result from the levels of pollen competition (pollen load sizes) and/or progeny growth environment chosen. Our study of Fragaria virginiana controlled for these variables by identifying seeds produced under low and high pollen loads from an empirically derived pollen load - seed set response curve. We assessed fitness of seeds at germination under uniform conditions but fitness of progeny at juvenile and adult life stages under two different resource levels in the greenhouse. We hypothesized that the effect of pollen load size on progeny vigor would be stronger when progeny were grown under low resources than when grown under high resources. We found that the effect of pollen load size was negligible at germination but was significant in later life when assessed under two resource levels. The direction of the pollen load effect, however, depended on the progeny growth environment. Under low resources, progeny from high pollen loads grew faster, attained greater biomass, and had a higher probability of flowering than progeny from low pollen loads, while the reverse was true under high resource availability. These results indicate that the effects of pollen competition on juvenile and adult characters depend on progeny growth environment.",Fragaria virginiana; Gametophyte; Pollen competition; Progeny vigor; Relative growth rate; Resource environment; Sporophyte; Strawberry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036183254

However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta-analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r = -0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r = -0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental variation; phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast, the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores, type of plant, type of defense (constitutive, mechanical, or induced), concentrations of defensive compounds, or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through, diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncontrolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.",Allocation costs; Antiherbivore defense; Ecological costs; Meta-analysis; Opportunity costs; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036141744

Production of waxes with different compositions - and hence changed wax properties such as viscosity, boiling point, and thermal stability - may be of importance for future requirements of the jojoba industry. Wax composition of 23 female clones was determined for two growing seasons. The ratio of FA elongated to the sum of those reduced and esterified differed among genotypes, resulting in differences in the percentage of wax esters longer than 40 or 42 carbons. The clones 'Yarden', 'Gvati', 'Hazerim', 'BGU', and 'Negev' had higher percentages of long-chain wax moieties than the clones '879-154', 'MS 55-4', and 'Forti'. The contribution of the male genotype to wax composition was tested by pollinating bagged female flowers of four female clones with pollen from three male plants. Both male and female genotypes additively influenced the composition of the wax esters. Wax composition varied between growing seasons and locations, but differences between genotypes were consistent. Salinity of the irrigation water did affect wax composition in some clones. Under high salinity, the salt-sensitive clone '64' produced a smaller percentage of long-chain wax esters, whereas in clone 'Q-106' wax composition did not change. In clone '874-154' the chain lenghts of the wax moieties in the seeds increased under medium salinity. We conclude that jojoba wax composition is influenced by both female and male genotypes and by environmental factors such as climate and salinity.",Jojoba; Salinity; Simmondsia chinensis; Wax composition; Wax moieties,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036500823

The phases of pollen tube growth include interactions that establish pollen polarity, entry of pollen tubes into female cell walls, and adhesion-based pollen tube motility through a carbohydrate-rich matrix.

Fifteen primers that produced 35 highly repeatable polymorphic markers were used to screen over 600 plant samples from various Canadian ginseng farms and seed lots. Ten samples from a Wisconsin seed lot and 58 samples from three natural ginseng populations in Quebec were also included for comparison. Genetic distance values, estimated as the complement to the simple matching coefficient, within cultivated populations ranged from 0.21 for a population in Nova Scotia to 0.34 for a British Columbia population, with an overall mean of 0.3. Distance values within three natural populations were either similar (0.33) or lower (0.12, 0.19) when compared with cultivated populations, indicating that populations under cultivation have not undergone a reduction in overall genetic diversity. However, one RAPD marker was polymorphic only in natural populations. Monotonic multidimensional scaling and ?2 analyses indicated that natural populations were genetically distinct from cultivated ones. Individual plants originating as seeds from the same mother plant had much lower genetic diversity (mean of 0.18) compared with individual field-grown plants chosen at random from the same farm. Segregation of some RAPD markers was observed among the progeny, indicating that parental plants have some degree of heterozygosity and that a level of outcrossing may be present. Estimates of the component for genetic diversity between populations (G?ST) were 18.0% and 28.0% for cultivated and natural populations, respectively; much of the variation was detected within and not between populations. These results imply that North American ginseng is a heterogeneous mix of genetic material and that the observed genetic diversity in cultivated populations in Canada results largely from the mixing of different seed lots. In addition, heterozygosity within the parent plants and cross-pollination appear also to contribute to genetic variation in this species.",Genetic polymorphisms; Ginseng; Molecular markers; Random amplified polymorphic DNA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036233102

Kyoryokutoko treated with iodoacetamide (IOA) and suspension -culture-derived protoplasts of L. chmielewskii (LA1330). A multiple-step selection procedure was used in selecting the hybrids depending on IOA treatments and a culture medium that only allows cotyledon protoplasts to regenerate. Plants were regenerated on the calli derived from fused protoplasts. After acclimation, the hybrid plants with fruits through self-pollination were obtained. Identification of the regenerated putative hybrid plants was carried out by morphological, chromosomal and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, as well as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) comparison of parental and hybrid plants. The hybrids showed unique morphologies in leaf, flower and stem compared with that of two fusion partners, 2n=4x=48,47, 69-72 chromosomes, both of the parental-specific RAPD bands, and genomic recombination and elimination occurred in mitochondria level. Cell fusion technique shows its new potential in foreign gene transformation between L. esculentum and L. chmielewskii. © 2002, Japanese Society for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology.
