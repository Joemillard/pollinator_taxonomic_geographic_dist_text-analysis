Recent evidence indicates that events beginning in the Early Permian and increasing during the Middle Jurassic provided repeated opportunities for insect feeding on pollen, pollination drops, and reproductive tissues of extinct gymnosperm lineages. Pollination was an associated development. Studies on the detailed mouthpart structure of several fluid-feeding insect lineages indicate targeting of certain tubular features of gymnosperm ovulate organs that previously were considered anomalous and difficult to interpret. One mouthpart type, the long-proboscid condition, consists of elongate, tubular (siphonate) proboscises that accessed surface fluids powered by a cibarial pump, often assisted with a distal proboscis sponging organ. These proboscises were received in ovulate organs through often intricate cupulate integumental tubes, interovular channels, salpinx tubuli, pappus tubules, prolonged micropyles, and a catchment funnel-pipe-micropyle device. These ovulate structures also are consistent with insect access to nutritive rewards, including pollination drops, nectarial secretions, and pollen. Other evidence for pollination includes the entomophilous structure and size of pollen found on insect and plant contact surfaces and in insect guts, nutritional levels of modern pollination drop fluids similar to angiosperm nectar for supporting metabolically high activity levels of aerially active insects, and plant-host outcrossing. While the long-proboscid pollination mode of fluid feeding targeted gymnosperm hosts that deployed unisexual reproductive organs at some distance from each other, either on the same or on different plants, another mode of pollination, that of mandibulate insects, consumed typically solid tissues in compact bisexual strobili, targeting pollen and perhaps pollination drops (adults), and associated sterile tissues (larvae). These two groups of pollinator associations were irretrievably altered as angiosperms diversified during a 35-million-year interval of the Early Cretaceous, evident in three patterns. First was the demise of most pollinator associations that evolved during the preceding 65 million years; second was the lateral transfer of some of these associations onto angiosperms that continue today as relicts; and third was emergence of new pollinator associations with angiosperms. © 2010 Missouri Botanical Press.",Bennettitaleans; Caytonia; China; Cretaceous; Daohugou; Diptera; gymnosperm; Jurassic; long-proboscid insects; Mecoptera; Neuroptera; pollination drops; seed ferns; Yixian,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650503566

Molecular and morphological studies over the past two decades, however, leave uncertain many relationships within Poales and among allied commelinid orders. Here we present the results of an initial project by the Monocot AToL (Angiosperm Tree of Life) team on phylogeny and evolution in Poales, using sequence data for 81 plastid genes (exceeding 101 aligned kb) from 83 species of angiosperms. We recovered highly concordant relationships using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP), with 98.2 mean ML bootstrap support across monocots. For the first time, ML resolves ties among Poales and other commelinid orders with moderate to strong support. Analyses provide strong support for Bromeliaceae being sister to the rest of Poales; Typhaceae, Rapateaceae, and cyperids (sedges, rushes, and their allies) emerge next along the phylogenetic spine. Graminids (grasses and their allies) and restiids (Restionaceae and its allies) are well supported as sister taxa. MP identifies a xyrid clade (Eriocaulaceae, Mayacaceae, Xyridaceae) sister to cyperids, but ML (with much stronger support) places them as a grade with respect to restiids graminids. The conflict in resolution between these analyses likely reflects long-branch attraction and highly elevated substitution rates in some Poales. All other familial relationships within the order are strongly supported by both MP and ML analyses. Character-state mapping implies that ancestral Poales lived in sunny, fire-prone, at least seasonally damp/wet, and possibly nutrient-poor sites, and were animal pollinated. Five subsequent shifts to wind pollinationin Typhaceae, cyperids, restiids, Ecdeiocoleaceae, and the vast PACCMAD-BEP clade of grassesare significantly correlated with shifts to open habitats and small, inconspicuous, unisexual, and nectar-free flowers. Prime ecological movers driving the repeated evolution of wind pollination in Poales appear to include open habitats combined with the high local dominance of conspecific taxa, with the latter resulting from large-scale disturbances, combined with tall plant stature, vigorous vegetative spread, and positive ecological feedback. Reproductive assurance in the absence of reliable animal visitation probably favored wind pollination in annuals and short-statured perennials of Centrolepidaceae in ephemerally wet depressions and windswept alpine sites. © 2010 Missouri Botanical Press.",Commelinids; correlated evolution; cyperids; graminids; long-branch attraction; molecular systematics; monocots; plastid; plastome; restiids; xyrids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650470488

After mating is completed, exit of adult female fig wasps from their natal figs is usually aided by the flightless males that chew a communal exit hole through the fig wall. We recognised three sub-phases in the exit of the pollinating fig wasp Ceratosolen capensis Grandi 1955 from the figs of Ficus sur, a species where male wasps do not re-enter figs after they have exited. The presence of ants was correlated with fig wasp exit dynamics, and as males generally exited first, they were 10 times more likely to be captured by the predatory ants that are routinely waiting on the fig surface. The males also occupied more ants, for a longer duration, than female fig wasps. As a result, predation on males seemed to reduce predation on the females. This would be advantageous for males since females are often siblings and/or could have previously mated with the males. Once ant numbers on a fig increase beyond 15, however, the proportion of females captured seemed to climb steeply, indicating a possible breakdown of protection by males at high ant densities. We conclude by examining the role of ants in the evolutionary dynamics of figs and fig wasps, and argue that the plant-pollinator mutualism needs to be considered within the broader context of the complex interactions taking place on the plants.",Ant predation; Ficus; Fig wasps; Life history; Mutualism; Protection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650346443

In this study, we examined whether robbers pollinate flowers of distylous Primula secundiflora. Distylous plants have two floral morphs. Pin flowers have long styles and short stamens, and thrum flowers have short styles and long stamens. Flowers of P. secundiflora were commonly robbed by bumblebees, and robbing holes were always situated between high and low sexual organs for both floral morphs. We observed that pollen grains of pin flowers were removed while thrum flowers eceived fresh pollen grains immediately after lowers were robbed. We manipulated flowers so that only nectar robbers could visit them. This resulted in 98 per cent of thrum flowers and 6 per cent of pin flowers setting fruit, and seed number per thrum fruit was also significantly higher than per pin fruit. Our findings suggest that nectar robbers transfer pollen from pin flowers to thrum flowers effectively, and consequently increase male fitness of the pin morph and female fitness of the thrum morph. Such asymmetrical pollen flow caused by nectar robbers may act as an important selective agent in floral fitness and evolution of distyly. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Distyly; Nectar robbing; Reciprocity; Robber-like pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649808093

The principal method to create new rose cultivars is through hybridization. Unfortunately, not all genotypes make suitable genitors because some are sterile, intersterile or incompatible. Furthermore, seed germination rates are either poor or produce descendents with limited value. In this research, two groups of hybrid combinations were studied to establish the suitability of several rose cultivars as genitors. Group one contained 13 combinations selected from 21 different Polyantha cultivars whilst in group two, 18 hybrid combinations were made from Hybrid Tea and Floribunda cultivars selected from 36 different lines. Following crossing of the Polyantha genotypes, 'Bella Rosa' × 'Golden Fiesta' and 'Bella Rosa' × 'Lichtkönigin Lucia' no seeds or fruits resulted. In the other combinations, the number of seeds produced per pollinated flower ranged from a mean of 0.1 for 'Heidekind' × 'Golden Fiesta' to 9.9 for 'Nobilia' × 'Super Excelsa'. The number of seeds per fruit ranged between 2.0 to 10.7 ('Simina' × 'Nostalgica'). The mean seed germination rate in nine combinations was 66.8%. It was found that from a population of 1441 seedlings; seven elites were selected from which just two have the potential to become new cultivars.

The genetic effect of habitat fragmentation depends largely on the level of gene flow within and among population fragments. In the present study, Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, a canopy tree found throughout subtropical China, was selected as a representative insect-pollinated plant species to assess genetic consequence of forest fragmentation. Contemporary pollen dispersal and mating patterns were estimated in two physically isolated stands of E. cavaleriei within fragmented forests using six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found high genetic diversity (HE=0.670-0.754) in both adults and offspring in the fragmented agricultural landscape, suggesting that habitat fragmentation did not necessarily erode genetic diversity of E. cavaleriei. Although substantial pollen travelled less than 100m, paternity analysis revealed that a large amount of long-distance pollination events occurred, with the average pollen dispersal distance being 1107m and 325m for the two stands, respectively. Extensive pollen immigration (39.3-42.6%) indicated that there was effective genetic connectivity among E. cavaleriei stands in the fragmented forests. twogener analysis revealed that the exponential power model was the best-fitting dispersal curve with a fat-tailed (b&lt;1) dispersal feature. The results from a multilocus mating system analysis suggested that a small amount of biparental inbreeding and some correlated mating events occurred in the fragmented forests, which were similar to our parallel findings in the continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. Estimates of pollen pool structure (?FT=0.128-0.174) indicated large genetic differences between pollen clouds accepted by maternal trees. The number of effective pollen donors (Nep) in E. cavaleriei, estimated using both mltr (Nep=4.2-5.3) and twogener (Nep=2.9-3.9) models, was equivalent to the number of effective pollen donors detected in continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. The pollen dispersal and mating patterns detected here indicated that habitat fragmentation did not have a negative impact on pollen movement in E. cavaleriei, possibly due to its generalist pollination system and the resilient foraging behavior of its pollinators in response to changes in landscape structure. The long distances of pollen-mediated gene flow between patches highlight the conservation value of remnant forest fragments in maintaining genetic connectivity at the landscape scale in subtropical China. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Eurycorymbus cavaleriei; Habitat fragmentation; Mating patterns; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Twogener,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049277113

However, RNA degradation might be only the beginning of the SI response, not the end. Recent in vitro studies suggest that S-RNase triggers mitochondrial alteration and DNA degradation in the incompatible pollen tube of Pyrus pyrifolia, and it seems that a relationship exists between self S-RNase, actin depolymerization and DNA degradation. To further uncover the SI response in pear, the relationship between self S-RNase and tip-localized reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated. Our results show that S-RNase specifically disrupted tip-localized ROS of incompatible pollen tubes via arrest of ROS formation in mitochondria and cell walls. The mitochondrial ROS disruption was related to mitochondrial alteration, whereas cell wall ROS disruption was related to a decrease in NADPH. Tip-localized ROS disruption not only decreased the Ca2+ current and depolymerized the actin cytoskeleton, but it also induced nuclear DNA degradation. These results indicate that tip-localized ROS disruption occurs in Pyrus pyrifolia SI. Importantly, we demonstrated nuclear DNA degradation in the incompatible pollen tube after pollination in vivo. This result validates our in vitro system in vivo.",Actin cytoskeleton; Ca2+ channels; NAD(P)H; Nuclear DNA; Pyrus pyrifolia; Reactive oxygen species; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649738923

To analyze possible difference among immunotherapeutic protocols, we also compared patients receiving preseasonal, seasonal, or prolonged sublingual therapy (?3 y); patients receiving symptomatic therapy alone were enrolled as well in the study. Clinical and immunological parameters were measured twice in and out of the pollination period. Clinical benefits, as measured by the visual analog scale for symptoms and for use of drugs, were evident in all three groups of individuals receiving immunotherapy, but were significantly better in patients undergoing prolonged SLIT. Immunologically, SLIT resulted in increased IL-10 production, programmed cell death ligand 1 expression, and concentration of allergen-specific IgG4, as well as in the reduction of CD80 and CD86 expression and IL-4 production. SLIT, thus, is associated with modulation of programmed cell death ligand 1 expression and IL-10 synthesis and favors the production of allergen-specific IgG4. These effects are evident from the first pollen season, independently from therapeutic regimen (preseasonal or seasonal) even if a prolonged treatment is necessary to obtain full clinical efficacy. A more detailed understanding of the interaction of allergen and APCs within the oral mucosa will allow improved targeting of allergy vaccine.

Box 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland","The accurate prediction of the flowering period and the amount of released pollen of wind-pollinated trees is important for predicting the aerobiological pollen amounts and for estimating the intensity of background pollination of orchard seed production. Current phenological models, such as the commonly used temperature sum (thermal time) model, are efficient for predicting the timing of point events, e.g. the onset of flowering or leaf unfolding. However, the flowering period of boreal trees, including Betula pendula and B. pubescens, may last up to 5 weeks with widely varying flowering intensity. Therefore, the ability to predict the duration of the whole flowering period and the intensity of pollination is very important.In this paper, we present a new phenological model that predicts the whole flowering period and daily (normalized) variation of flowering intensity. The model is based on similar principles as the temperature sum model. The model was calibrated against pollen data recorded with pollen traps placed in several locations in Southern and Central Finland. Our new model predicted accurately the variation in the intensity throughout the flowering period. Moreover, it was able to predict the start and end of the pollination season with accuracy comparable to that achieved with an ordinary temperature sum model for point events. Due to limited amount of test data, the data-dependency of the model had to be tested with a bootstrapping approach. With this method, the model fit and parameter values showed to be independent of the parameter fitting data. The model can be used to predict the whole flowering period of wind-pollinated boreal trees for many different purposes, such as aerobiological forecasts of allergenic pollen, or generation of input data for models of long-range pollen transport. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Birch; Bootstrap method; Flowering; Modeling; Phenology; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957878644

Its genetic impact can be greater in rare taxa, due to their vulnerability to pollen swamping by more abundant congeners. We assessed the likelihood of pollen dispersal from exotic eucalypt plantations into all of Australia's rare native eucalypts, and conducted a case study of Eucalyptus perriniana, which is rare in Tasmania. The Australia-wide study involved spatial analyses of the locations for each rare species superimposed on distributions of eucalypt plantations, which were combined with known taxonomically based reproductive barriers. Of the 74 nationally listed rare eucalypt taxa, 22 had locations within 10km of plantations of the same genus, and eight were within 1km. These eight proximal taxa are considered priorities for monitoring. In the most extreme case, 30% of point locations originating from herbarium records and field surveys for Eucalyptus conglomerata were within 1km of exotic plantations. In the case study, E. perriniana revealed considerable reproductive compatibility with adjacent recently established Eucalyptus nitens plantations. However, F1 hybridisation between these species was limited, with 0.2% of the 18,625 seedlings grown from 100 single-tree open-pollinated seedlots being hybrids. For now, the probability of exotic gene flow into E. perriniana appears to be low, however this probability is likely to increase as more E. nitens flowers in the surrounding landscape. These studies suggest that understanding the breeding system and biology of these populations may reveal surprising resistance to such exotic hybridisation as well as identifying high risk situations to focus conservation management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Biological invasion; Forest management; Gene flow; Genetic contamination; Genetic pollution; Introgression; Off-site impacts; Plantation forestry; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049266700

The same requirements complicate the development and deployment of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in polyploid species. We report here a strategy that satisfies these requirements and deploy it in the sequencing of genes in cultivated hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) and wild tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, genomes AABB) from the putative site of wheat domestication in Turkey. Data are used to assess the distribution of diversity among and within wheat genomes and to develop a panel of SNP markers for polyploid wheat.Results: Nucleotide diversity was estimated in 2114 wheat genes and was similar between the A and B genomes and reduced in the D genome. Within a genome, diversity was diminished on some chromosomes. Low diversity was always accompanied by an excess of rare alleles. A total of 5,471 SNPs was discovered in 1791 wheat genes. Totals of 1,271, 1,218, and 2,203 SNPs were discovered in 488, 463, and 641 genes of wheat putative diploid ancestors, T. urartu, Aegilops speltoides, and Ae. tauschii, respectively. A public database containing genome-specific primers, SNPs, and other information was constructed. A total of 987 genes with nucleotide diversity estimated in one or more of the wheat genomes was placed on an Ae. tauschii genetic map, and the map was superimposed on wheat deletion-bin maps. The agreement between the maps was assessed.Conclusions: In a young polyploid, exemplified by T. aestivum, ancestral species are the primary source of genetic diversity. Low effective recombination due to self-pollination and a genetic mechanism precluding homoeologous chromosome pairing during polyploid meiosis can lead to the loss of diversity from large chromosomal regions. The net effect of these factors in T. aestivum is large variation in diversity among genomes and chromosomes, which impacts the development of SNP markers and their practical utility. Accumulation of new mutations in older polyploid species, such as wild emmer, results in increased diversity and its more uniform distribution across the genome. © 2010 Akhunov et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649998799

Insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton is planted on millions of hectares annually and is a potential source of transgene flow. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored 15 non-Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seed production fields (some transgenic for herbicide resistance, some not) for gene flow of the Bt cotton cry1Ac transgene. We investigated seedmediated gene flow, which yields adventitious Bt cotton plants, and pollen-mediated gene flow, which generates outcrossed seeds. A spatially-explicit statistical analysis was used to quantify the effects of nearby Bt and non-Bt cotton fields at various spatial scales, along with the effects of pollinator abundance and adventitious Bt plants in fields, on pollenmediated gene flow. Adventitious Bt cotton plants, resulting from seed bags and planting error, comprised over 15% of plants sampled from the edges of three seed production fields. In contrast, pollen-mediated gene flow affected less than 1% of the seed sampled from field edges. Variation in outcrossing was better explained by the area of Bt cotton fields within 750 m of the seed production fields than by the area of Bt cotton within larger or smaller spatial scales. Variation in outcrossing was also positively associated with the abundance of honey bees. Conclusions/Significance: A comparison of statistical methods showed that our spatially-explicit analysis was more powerful for understanding the effects of surrounding fields than customary models based on distance. Given the low rates of pollen-mediated gene flow observed in this study, we conclude that careful planting and screening of seeds could be more important than field spacing for limiting gene flow. © 2010 Heuberger et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649761457

Among the most common plant volatiles are homoterpenes, which are often emitted from night-scented flowers and from aerial tissues upon herbivore attack. Homoterpene volatiles released from herbivore-damaged tissue are thought to contribute to indirect plant defense by attracting natural enemies of pests. Moreover, homoterpenes have been demonstrated to induce defensive responses in plant-plant interaction. Although early steps in the biosynthesis of homoterpenes have been elucidated, the identity of the enzyme responsible for the direct formation of these volatiles has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CYP82G1 (At3g25180), a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase of the Arabidopsis CYP82 family, is responsible for the breakdown of the C20-precursor (E,E)-geranyllinalool to the insect-induced C16-homoterpene (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyltrideca-1,3,7,11-tetraene (TMTT). Recombinant CYP82G1 shows narrow substrate specificity for (E,E)- geranyllinalool and its C 15-analog (E)-nerolidol, which is converted to the respective C 11-homoterpene (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). Homology-based modeling and substrate docking support an oxidative bond cleavage of the alcohol substrate via syn-elimination of the polar head, together with an allylic C-5 hydrogen atom. CYP82G1 is constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis stems and inflorescences and shows highly coordinated herbivoreinduced expression with geranyllinalool synthase in leaves depending on the F-box protein COI-1.

Kenya has been one of the more progressive African countries, particularly in maize, where testing and development of Bt maize has been ongoing since 1999. As part of the introduction process, biosafety protocols are being developed. The protocols require adequate measures to ensure the coexistence between GM and conventional maize varieties, minimize risks of cross contamination, and preserve the biodiversity of traditional maize varieties. Establishing coexistence between GM and conventional maize imposes additional costs on potential adopters of GM maize, especially in Kenya, where adoption will take place within highly populated smallholder farming communities. This article estimates the costs of establishing coexistence between GM and conventional maize in Kenya's coastal lowlands. Using a transect survey, data was collected on the size and distribution of maize fields at 100 locations in lowland coastal Kenya. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the costs of coexistence, achieved through spatial isolation, and its effect on the potential adoption of GM maize. The results indicate that the cost of coexistence could be prohibitively high if Kenya were to adopt stringent requirements on spatial isolation, such as the measures adopted by Denmark. For meaningful adoption to occur, isolation distances would need to be less than 50 meters. © 2010 AgBioForum.",Agro-ecological zone; Bt maize; Coexistence; Regulatory; Spatial,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649621893

A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) proteome survey of the most abundant proteins of the reciprocal hybrids and their parental inbred lines 25 and 35 days after pollination revealed that 141 of 597 detected proteins (24%) exhibited nonadditive accumulation in at least one hybrid. Approximately 44% of all nonadditively accumulated proteins displayed an expression pattern that was not distinguishable from the low parent value. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analyses and subsequent functional classification of the 141 proteins revealed that development, protein metabolism, redox-regulation, glycolysis, and amino acid metabolism were the most prominent functional classes among nonadditively accumulated proteins.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of pollinator guild and of variation in time and space on the reproductive success of a widespread species. Methods: Changes in fruit set, seed set, and pollinator activity through time were recorded in three widely separated populations of Stenocereus thurberi. Breeding system and sources of pollination limitation were determined by controlled pollinator exclusions in each population. Key results: Significant differences were found in the timing of activity and in the effectiveness of pollinators among sites. In the northern and central populations, reproductive success depends on bats, whereas in the southern population a combination of pollinators was more effective. No difference between open and hand cross-pollination treatments was found in the northern and central populations, which suggests no pollen limitation. However, significant differences were detected in the southern population, which indicates temporal differences in pollinator abundance or arrival time. Conclusions: Local variation in pollinator assemblages and reproductive success could greatly affect the evolution of pollination systems. The pattern of generalist pollination in the southernmost populations and specialized pollination in the central and northern populations contradicts the hypothesis of latitudinal variation. In the absence of nocturnal pollinators, the accumulated nectar can sustain visits by diurnal pollinators, a bet-hedging strategy that increases the chances of fruit set in some populations. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Bats; Bet-hedging; Fruit set; Generalist; Pollen limitation; Seed set; Sonoran desert; Spatial variation; Specialist; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649763828

This observation has led pollination ecologists to question the role played by pollinators in flower diversification and the extent to which floral similarities reflect convergent evolution to specific pollinator assemblages rather than other factors, such as phylogenetic constraints. In this paper, we review several ecological and evolutionary models that help to explain how pollinators can play a key role in floral evolution despite heterogeneities in plant-pollinator interactions. Our basic tenant is that, in animal pollinated species, the trajectory of pollen grains is determined by the foraging strategy of pollinators. Starting from a first approximation based on optimal foraging theory, ecological models related to the principles behind the ideal free distribution can be used to predict differences in floral and pollinator traits that will lead to resource partitioning. Building upon these results, evolutionary models based on game theory can be used to predict changes in traits of flowers and pollinators. These models show that pollinators can drive the evolution of floral divergence in the presence of behavioural noise and temporal variability in the composition of pollinator ensembles. © Rodríguez-Gironés and Santamaría.",Co-evolution; Flower diversification; Nectar barriers; Optimal foraging theory; Pollination syndromes; Spatiotemporal heterogeneity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960786791

The main pollinators are bees, which represent over 70% of pollinators of cultivated plants. However, only about a dozen species are managed for this purpose, and Apis mellifera is the main species used. The reports of pollinator decline indicated a global pollination crisis and triggered initiatives for conservation and sustainable use of pollinators around the world, encouraging detailed studies of crop pollination and native pollinators. However, there are authors who question the real requirements of biotic pollinators for world production of food, since most of these crops is autogamous or pollinated by wind. Detailed analysis circuscribed some cultures essentially dependent on biotic pollinators for their production. If such crops are not as important in terms of production value, they seem to be vital to maintaining the diversity of food habits and local cultures. These recent meta-analysis studies also showed the dependence of pollination services in relation to pollinator diversity and the conservation of areas surrounding such crop plantations. However, studies in this direction, especially in Brazil are restricted to a few crops and production areas. Passion fruit, Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa Deneger (Passifloraceae) in Triângulo Mineiro Region was used as a crop model to analyze aspects of the conservation of natural areas and the pollination service. This interaction involves a self-incompatible crop that needs pollination of large bees for fruit production, especially bees of the genus Xylocopa, with solitary habit, which nest in wood. In addition, the study area is among the areas of highest human pressure in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna), with estimates of degradation up to 92% of the original vegetation. The results for the region showed natural productivity of the crop (about 25%) was higher than the values considered economically viable (20%), which may be explained by the relatively higher species richness of pollinators when compared to other regions of Brazil. Nevertheless, those results showed no relation with the remnants of natural areas of Cerrado in the surrounding crop, indicating the necessity for more research effort on this aspect.",Bees; Cerrado; Native pollinators; Passiflora,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856538390

Methods: Airborne pollen was monitored by continuous sampling with a Hirst volumetric sampler. Pollen trends were investigated by linear regression and correlation analysis using mean annual and monthly pollen concentrations. The aerobiological results were compared with meteorological data (temperature and rainfall). Results: During the study period, the mean total annual rainfall was 66.2 mm lower than normal and the mean annual temperature 0.8°C higher than normal. No temporal trend was found for total airborne pollen concentration, but differences were observed for monthly data, namely, an increase in January, February, and May and a decrease in March and June. For the different pollen types studied, there was a general trend toward increased values in the month with the highest values, and this trend seemed to be related to temperature. The beginning of the main pollen season occurred later, and the end occurred sooner; therefore, the main pollen season seems to be shorter. Conclusions: Our data reflect trends in the response of plants to changing rainfall stress patterns in Mediterranean countries, and these trends seem to be different from those of temperate countries. Nonetheless, a longer study period will be required to confirm these preliminary conclusions. © 2010 Esmon Publicidad.",Aerobiology; Airborne pollen trends; Climate change; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251510257

Inter-specific crosses were made between C. torelliana [CT(maternal parent)] and C. citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV), C. henryi (CH) and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora (CCC) using conventional pollination, one-stop pollination (OSP) and artificially-induced protogyny on yellow buds (AIP Y) pollination methods. Additional treatments included AIP on green buds (AIP G) and the use of exclusion bags for the OSP and AIP methods. Inter-specific hybrids (CT x CCV, CT x CH and CT x CCC) were successfully created using all three pollination methods. The AIP Y treatment provided the highest seed yields and achieved time savings of >41% over the conventional and OSP methods, resulting in up to five-fold increases in operator productivity. However, the AIP Y treatment also had the highest C. torelliana contamination levels (9.3-13.2%). The use of exclusion bags with the AIP method had minimal effect on contamination rates, indicating a high proportion of selfpollen contamination. Contamination rates varied between maternal parents, suggesting variation in selfcompatibility for C. torelliana individuals. AIP using semi-ripe green buds was not effective at reducing selfing and had low operator productivity. The AIP method is suitable for use in a large-scale hybrid breeding program for C. torelliana.

However, so far most studies on plant-animal interactions have focused on single interactions in isolation. In this study, we studied the effect of florivory by the weevil Cionus nigritarsis on pollinator visitation rate in the self-incompatible perennial herb Verbascum nigrum by combining observations of florivory and pollination in natural populations with records of pollinator visitation to plants with different levels of experimentally inflicted damage.Increasing levels of damage through either natural or simulated florivory resulted in fewer pollinator visits per plant and per flower. As expected, the magnitude of the indirect effect of florivory on pollinator visitation was proportional to the intensity of florivory. Our results indicate that biotic non-pollinating agents, such as florivores, may induce substantial changes in pollinator availability. Therefore, studies addressing different plant-animal interactions in parallel are necessary to better comprehend the factors influencing the reproductive performance and demography of flowering plants. © 2010.",Bombus spp.; Cionus nigritarsis; Floral herbivory; Plant-insect interactions; Pollination; Verbascum nigrum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649445775

It is a key process for food production and biodiversity conservation because pollinators mediate reproduction in most flowering plant species. To take practical actions directed to conservation and sustainable management of pollinators, it is essential to invest in training experts with appropriately deep knowledge in the field. In this context, initiatives devoted to improving novel pedagogical strategies that generate highly qualified personnel in a short time must be improved. The international pollination field course is one of such initiatives. The aim of this course is to qualify researchers, professors at higher education institutions, undergraduate and graduate students and other professionals working in the general area of pollination with practical and theoretical skills as future researchers, human resource trainers and disseminators of knowledge in local and/or regional levels.

Consequently, their pollination service may also be influenced by the presence of other flower visiting species. Ants are solely interested in nectar and frequent flower visitors of some plant species but usually provide no pollination service. Obligate flower visitors such as bees depend on both nectar and pollen and are often more effective pollinators.In Hawaii, we studied the complex interactions between flowers of the endemic tree Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) and both, endemic and introduced flower-visiting insects. The former main-pollinators of M. polymorpha were birds, which, however, became rare. We evaluated the pollinator effectiveness of endemic and invasive bees and whether it is affected by the type of resource collected and the presence of ants on flowers.Ants were dominant nectar-consumers that mostly depleted the nectar of visited inflorescences. Accordingly, the visitation frequency, duration, and consequently the pollinator effectiveness of nectar-foraging honeybees (Apis mellifera) strongly decreased on ant-visited flowers, whereas pollen-collecting bees remained largely unaffected by ants. Overall, endemic bees (Hylaeus spp.) were ineffective pollinators.The average net effect of ants on pollination of M. polymorpha was neutral, corresponding to a similar fruit set of ant-visited and ant-free inflorescences.Our results suggest that invasive social hymenopterans that often have negative impacts on the Hawaiian flora and fauna may occasionally provide neutral (ants) or even beneficial net effects (honeybees), especially in the absence of native birds. © 2010 The Authors.

Several non-pollinating fig wasp lineages have dimorphic males, typically with winged males that disperse from natal figs to mate and flightless males that seek mating opportunities in natal figs.Walkerella sp. from Ficus benjamina has dark and pale wingless males. Observations and experiments in Xishuangbanna, Southern China found that (i) the sex ratio of Walkerella sp. did not vary with foundress number or brood size. (ii) The frequency of dark males increased with brood size and foundress number and they were absent from figs with a single foundress. This produced a higher proportion of dark males at higher densities. (iii) Males of both morphs fought, but injuries to dark males were more frequent. (iv) Dark males were more likely to disperse away from their natal figs and (v) they were more resistant to dehydration.Responses to selection are constrained by the genetic options available. Consequently, selection pressures acting on different lineages can produce similar outcomes that are achieved in different ways. Walkerella species lack winged males, but dark males display some of their features, dispersing from natal figs and displaying appropriate physiological and behavioural adaptations. However, dark males also displayed increased levels of damage from fighting - a feature unlikely to be shared with the winged males of other species. © 2010 The Authors.

Juss (seed kernel extract - 5%), formulated neem product (Achook - 0.8%), Azadirachta indica (seed oil - 1%), Azadirachta indica (leaf extract - 10%) replicated 4 times. Reduction in pollinator population was estimated one day after application of the botanicals; whereas, 3 and 5 days after the treatment the mean percentage increase or decrease in the pollinator abundance over control was computed. The plant origin insecticides evinced a decrease in pollinator intensity ranging from (-) 14.52 to (-) 25.06 per cent. The maximum reduction of insect pollinators (25.06%) was recorded from plots treated with neem seed oil (1%). Three days after the treatment the percentage of visiting insect pollinators did not change in plots treated with karanj oil (1%), but the pollinator percentage increased in plots treated with NSKE (5%) and neem leaf extract (10%). Most of the botanical treatments did not have any side-effect 5 days after the treatment; however, plots treated with seed oil (1%) of Azadirachta indica A.

If this is the case, then we should expect to see similar patterns of trait matching and phenotypic divergence between populations and between species in model systems for coevolution. As measures of divergence are frequently only available at one scale (population level or taxon level), this contention is rarely tested directly. Here, we use the case of co-divergence between different varieties of Joshua tree Yucca brevifolia (Agavaceae) and their obligate pollinators, two yucca moths (Tegeticula spp. Prodoxidae), to test for trait matching between taxa and among populations. Using model selection, we show that there is trait matching between mutualists at the taxon level, but once we account for differences between taxa, there is no indication of trait matching in local populations. This result differs from similar studies in other coevolving systems. We hypothesize that this discrepancy arises because coevolution in obligate mutualisms favours divergence less strongly than coevolution in other systems, such as host-parasite interactions. © 2010 The Authors.

Few studies have combined correlative with experimental evidence, and hence the mechanisms underlying selection processes are not well understood. In this study we quantified the magnitude, direction and form of pollinator-mediated selection acting upon morphological traits in the Chilean endemic orchid Chloraea bletioides. Results revealed strong selection differentials for plant height and flower number, and absence of total selection for morphological flower characters. Multivariate analysis of selection revealed a strong and positive directional selection gradient for flower number. The labellar lobe and flower tube were under negative correlational selection, indicating that selection promoted alternative combinations of traits. Plants with long floral tubes and small labellar lobes, and short floral tubes with large labellar lobes were selected for. Interestingly, selection on flower number increased at a higher rate through the female function than through the male function, which suggests that size-dependent resource limitation may be more important than pollinator-mediated selection for fruit set. In addition to estimates of phenotypic selection, we evaluated through phenotype modification the impact of pollinators on the correlation and potential integration of flower traits coming from different whorls. We removed the tip of the lateral sepals and the labellar lobe in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Results revealed that phenotypic modification had no effect on male and female fitness. The absence of effect was consistent with the low and non-significant selection coefficients. Nevertheless, the observation of significant correlational selection for labellar lobe and flower tube suggests that experimental studies performed on these characters may be of interest to evaluate the functional and adaptive integration of flower design in orchids. © 2010 The Authors.

Competition through interspecific pollen transfer may select for specialization through costs to male fitness (pollen lost to heterospecific flowers) or female fitness (heterospecific pollen deposited on stigmas). Previous theoretical treatments of pollination focused solely on seed set, thus overlooking male fitness. Here we use individual-based models that explicitly track pollen fates to explore how competition affects the evolution of specialization. Results show that plants specialize on different pollinators when visit rates are high enough to remove most pollen from anthers; this increases male fitness by minimizing pollen loss to foreign flowers. At low visitation, plants generalize, which minimizes pollen left undispersed in anthers. A model variant in which plants can also evolve differences in sex allocation (pollen/ovule production) produces similar patterns of specialization. At low visitation, plants generalize and allocate more to female function. At high visitation, plants specialize and allocate equally to both sexes (in line with sex-allocation theory). This study demonstrates that floral specialization can be driven by selection through male function alone and more generally highlights the importance of community context in the ecology and evolution of pollination systems. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Community context; Competition through heterospecific pollen transfer; Generalization; Simulation model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649707333

Among honey bee pathogens, RNA viruses are emerging as a serious threat and are suspected as major contributors to CCD. Recent detection of these viral species in bumble bees suggests a possible wider environmental spread of these viruses with potential broader impact. It is therefore vital to study the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses in the hymenopteran pollinator community as a whole. We studied the viral distribution in honey bees, in their pollen loads, and in other non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from flowering plants in Pennsylvania, New York, and Illinois in the United States. Viruses in the samples were detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR and confirmed by sequencing. For the first time, we report the molecular detection of picorna-like RNA viruses (deformed wing virus, sacbrood virus and black queen cell virus) in pollen pellets collected directly from forager bees. Pollen pellets from several uninfected forager bees were detected with virus, indicating that pollen itself may harbor viruses. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to be infective, with the queen becoming infected and laying infected eggs after these virus- ontaminated foods were given to virus-free colonies. These viruses were detected in eleven other non-Apis hymenopteran species, ranging from many solitary bees to bumble bees and wasps. This finding further expands the viral host range and implies a possible deeper impact on the health of our ecosystem. Phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the flower pollen itself. Notably, in cases where honey bee apiaries affected by CCD harbored honey bees with Israeli Acute Paralysis virus (IAPV), nearby non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators also had IAPV, while those near apiaries without IAPV did not. In containment greenhouse experiments, IAPV moved from infected honey bees to bumble bees and from infected bumble bees to honey bees within a week, demonstrating that the viruses could be transmitted from one species to another. This study adds to our present understanding of virus epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator population decline in general. © 2010 Singh et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650985060

In addition to this strategy, the genus has evolved several other pollination mechanisms. The present study aimed to characterize the pollination strategies of the Cretan Arum species by investigating the flowering phenology, thermogeny, inflorescence odours, and the pollinating fauna. The results obtained show that Arum cyrenaicum and Arum concinnatum emit a strong dung smell and exhibit the distinctive features associated with this pollination syndrome. Both species are highly thermogenic, have a similar odour profile and attract small-bodied Diptera. Although sharing the same habitat, these two plant species are never found growing sympatrically as a result of the early blooming period of A. cyrenaicum. By contrast, Arum creticum and Arum idaeum have evolved a more traditional and mutually beneficial pollination mechanism. The stinking smell has been replaced by a more flower-like odour that attracts bees (Lasioglossum sp.) and, occasionally, bugs (Dionconotus cruentatus). Although attracting the same pollinator, the main compound present in the odour of A. creticum is different from that of A. idaeum. Principal component analysis (PCA), based on physiologically active components of the flower odours determined by testing on the antenna of the Lasioglossum bee, revealed two different clusters, indicating that pollinators can potentially discriminate between the odours of the two species. A further PCA on the main floral odour volatiles as identified by gas chroatography-mass spectroscopy from all the Arum species under investigation displayed odour-based similarities and differences among the species. The PCA-gas chomotography-electroantennographic detection active peaks analysis showed that the two species, A. creticum and A. idaeum, form two groups and are clearly separated from A. cyrenaicum and A. concinnatum, which, conversely, cluster together. The evolutionary forces and selective pressures leading to diversification of pollination mechanisms in the Cretan Arum spp. are discussed. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Araceae; Diversification; Flower constancy; Flowering time; Odour; Pollinator competition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649431821

Supporting this trend, some nocturnal distylous flowers may also receive floral visitors during the day, and since the latter contribute to fruit set, the pollination system is mixed and less specialized. Common among the Rubiaceae, distyly has been regarded as a reproductive strategy which requires a precise and specialized pollination system, and in this important tropical family, environmental disturbance and pollination failure have been used to explain anomalies in distylous features. . Faramea cyanea Müll. Arg. is a common tree species in forest formations in the increasingly threatened Cerrado biome, the Neotropical savannas in Central Brazil. We evaluated the floral morphology, pollination biology and breeding system of a population of . F. cyanea. Despite their moth pollination features, flowers were visited by diurnal (bees) as well as nocturnal (moths) pollinators. Experimental results showed that both pollinator groups contributed equally to pollen flow and legitimate pollination. The population presented distyly, isoplethy and heteromorphic self-incompatibility. Although . F. cyanea did not present exact reciprocal herkogamy between floral morphs, pollination and reproductive success were not impaired.

Female fitness may thus be low when hermaphrodites are locally rare. To test this hypothesis, we analysed how the reproductive output of females varied among patches within two natural study sites of the gynodioecious wind-pollinated Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima. Plants growing in female-biased areas and experiencing pollen limitation were found to have low fruit and seed sets but did not reallocate resources towards better offspring. Our results show that fine-scale processes influence individual fitness and the evolution of sex ratio in sexually polymorphic plants. © 2010 The Authors.

Natural selection by pollinators on floral traits is often assumed because in outcrossing animal-pollinated plants flowers are generally thought to function as advertisements of rewards directed at pollinators. We tested the role of bee pollinators in selection on Penstemon digitalis and found that pollinators were driving selection for larger and more flowers. However, what makes our publication unique is the additional information we gained from reviewing the few other studies that also directly tested whether pollinators were agents of selection on floral traits. As we would expect if pollinators are important agents of selection, selection on floral traits was significantly stronger when pollinators were present than when their choices were experimentally removed. Taken together, these results suggest that pollinators can be important drivers of selection in contemporary populations. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.",Natural selection; Penstemon; Plant vigor; Pollinators; Selection gradient,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551666573

While the fruit-set for C. globosa was high, independently if the pollen donor/stigma receptor was a pin (long-styled) or thrum (short-styled) individual, in C. leucocephala the fruit-set was low and occurred only when a thrum individual was the pollen donor. This raises the possibility of this species moving towards dioecy. The high natural fruit-set of C. globosa confirms the generalist bee as its effective pollinator. The low fruit-set after manual crosses in C. leucocephala may be due to low pollen viability.

However, examination of pre- and post-pollination pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms requires sympatric, co-flowering species pairs that do not produce hybrid swarms. In this study, we analyzed a contact zone between Orchis italica and O. papilionacea, in which hybrid forms have never been reported, although hybridization between members of their groups of appurtenance has been signaled. We investigated pre-pollination barriers observing the floral phenology of both species and identified pollinators by means of molecular analysis of pollinaria collected on the insects captured in the study site. Post-pollination barriers were tested performing manual crosses in order to evaluate pollen germination/pollen tube growth in vivo and fruit and seed formation. Floral phenologies of O. italica and O. papilionacea display nearly overlapping trends, and two common pollinators have been identified by molecular analysis of pollinaria. Thus, pre-pollination barriers are very weak or nonexistent. Bidirectional crosses have shown that the growth of heterospecific pollen tubes is fully blocked in stigmatic cell layers. Since no fruit formation was detected in bidirectional interspecific crosses, we assume that reproductive isolation between the examined species is fully guaranteed by post-pollination pre-zygotic mechanisms acting at stigmatic level. Such condition has been rarely described and may mask the potential action of post-zygotic mechanisms. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Contact zones; Food-deceptive orchids; Orchis italica; Orchis papilionacea; Reproductive barriers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650076299

Studies were conducted to investigate whether the gametes of C. argentea flowers are self-compatible, and to verify the dependence of reproduction on insects. Pod set and seed production were assessed in a pollination experiment with 4 treatments (spontaneous self-pollination, artificial self-pollination, insect pollination and artificial cross-pollination). Our results (0-1.2% pod set after selfing, 3.4% after insect pollination and 20.3% after artificial crossing) suggest that C. argentea is mostly self-incompatible. Seed:ovule ratios were 0.63 with insect pollination and 0.78 with artificial crossing. We found that pollen grains mature before the stigma becomes receptive, which suggests that the species is cross-pollinated. We also found evidence that C. argentea depends on large solitary bees for pollination, based on flower structure and the stigma becoming receptive only after tripping of the flower.

The pollen from all pollen balls in a nest represented the harvest from an entire breeding season (BP). This analysis showed that each bee on average collected pollen from 3.24 (SFTs), 2.02 (SD), and 3.12 (BP) flowering species. Bees collected pollen from a total of 14 flowering plant species. Furthermore, we calculated when pollen balls were created and found no significant interaction between seasonal pollen availability and bee preferences. Moreover, bees had consistent flower preferences, even if the preferred flower was not dominant at all times.

Timber industry and agriculture activities are threatening the integrity and functionality of the Amazon forest. The ecological sustainability of forest management practices must include criteria and indicators for genetic variability maintenance and its correlated processes. Habitat fragmentation reduces continuous forest lands to small isolated areas, thus reducing the effective number of trees, the number of pollen donors, and the amount of compatible pollen deposited on the flowers pistils. This may lead to low fruit set. A decline on the pollinators' population, increase on inbreeding and changes on the pollinator species composition is also expected. In order to guarantee the forest management sustainability, including the upholding of genetic diversity in managed forests, it is essential to contemplate information on the reproductive biology of the target species.

The objective of this research was to study seed production and seed quality in O. cumana using three different bag types to isolate flowering plants. Maximum seed production was obtained on unbagged plants (91.2 mg per plant), followed by micro perforated transparent plastic bags (MPB) (84.2 mg per plant), white paper (46.5 mg per plant) and brown paper bags (37.5 mg per plant). Seed quality, measured as germination percentage and infectivity, did not differ between unbagged plants and plants isolated with MPB, whereas it was considerably reduced in plants isolated with paper bags. A second experiment studied bagging effect on controlled hybridisation. When using white paper bags and MPB, 45.2% and 60.1% of the emasculated and hand pollinated flowers were fertilised, respectively, compared with 88.6% in unbagged plants. The data suggested that O. cumana plants produce seed under isolation, even though the bag type affects seed production and quality.

Although also aquatic, Trithuria differs from water lilies in that all species are extremely small, and most have an annual life form and grow in seasonal wetlands. Very little is known about their reproductive ecology. This paper reports on reproductive timing, mode of pollination and characteristics of the breeding system of Trithuria submersa in Western Australia. Methods Mass collections of open-pollinated plants from different ecological settings were used to characterize the reproductive developmental sequence and natural pollen reception. Hand-pollination, caging and emasculation experiments were used to measure outcross + geitonogamous pollen reception versus autonomous self-pollination in two populations over two field seasons.Key Results Natural outcross or geitonogamous pollination was by wind, not by water or insects, but pollen reception was extremely low. Pollen production was very low and pollen release was non-synchronous within populations. The pollen to ovule (P/O) ratio was 23·9, compared with 1569·1 in dioecious Trithuria austinensis. Stigmas became receptive before male phase and remained so until anthers dehisced and autonomous self-pollination occurred. Natural pollen loads are composed primarily of self pollen. Self- and open-pollinated plants had equivalent seed set (both >70 ). Self-pollinated plants produced seed within 17 d.Conclusions Autonomous self-pollination and self-fertilization are predominant in T. submersa. The low P/O ratio is not an artefact of small plant size and is inconsistent with long-term pollination by wind. It indicates that T. submersa has evolved a primarily autogamous breeding system. Selfing, along with the effect of small plant size on the speed of reproduction, has enabled T. submersa to colonize marginal ephemeral wetlands in the face of unpredictable pollination. © The Author 2010.

We characterized pollination in three populations of Quercus macrocarpa occurring in a highly altered landscape in northeastern Illinois to determine whether isolated remnant stands were reproductively isolated. Methods: We used microsatellites to genotype all adults and 787 acorns from two isolated savanna remnants and a stand in an old-growth forest. One isolated remnant occurred in a highly urbanized/industrialized landscape, and one occurred in an agricultural landscape. Parentage assignment was used to assess pollen-mediated gene flow. Key results: Pollen donors from outside the study sites accounted for between 46% and 53% of paternities and did not differ significantly among sites, indicating that similar high levels of gene flow occurred at all three sites. Within stands, the mean pollination distance ranged from 42 to 70 meters, and when accounting for outside pollinations, mean pollination distances were well over 100 meters. Genetic diversity of incoming pollen was extremely high in all three stands. The number of effective pollen donors, Nep, calculated from paternity assignment was higher than that estimated by an indirect correlated paternity approach. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that extremely isolated stands of oaks are unlikely to be genetically and reproductively isolated, and remnant stands may contribute to maintaining genetic connectivity in highly modified landscapes. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Microsatellites; Oaks; Paternity; Pollen flow; Pollination; Quercus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649794389

The timing of this flight is advanced not only by higher late winter/spring temperatures but also by higher temperatures in the previous summer and autumn.This earlier activity gives hope that the reported earlier flowering of many native and cultivated species will not cause a pollination synchrony crisis. © 2010 The Authors.

It blooms during October to January and the flowering period usually lasts about 20 days for single plant and 4-5 days for single flower. The volume of nectar, containing sugar ((23.13 ± 1.03)%) and 17 kinds of amino acid (1.73%), is (145.40 ±24.89) ?L per flower (n =30). Andrena camellia and Colletes gigas (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) are the effective pollinators and the pollination efficiency of the A. camellia is higher than that of the Colletes gigas. Flies and butterflies are casual visitors. Breeding experiments showed that C. oleifera is primarily self-incompatible with a significant difference in reproductive success between self-pollination and cross-pollination. There is no apomixis and autonomous self-pollination, so the pollination, fruiting and seeding of this species depends on pollinators. The result of hand cross-pollination of C. oleifera showed that when pollen is supplemented, seed number increases but fruit production remains the same. The nectar characteristics that we found in C. oleifera, i.e. high volume nectar and dilute sugar content, suggest the bird-pollination syndrome but the phylogenetic position of C. oleifera in the genus Camellia does not allow us to interpret how this syndrome could have evolved in this species.",Breeding system; Camellia oleifera; Nectar; Pollination syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952724970

One method, the RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit was used subsequently to extract nucleic acid of amplifiable quality from nine plant species, and pollen infected with three ilarvirus and two nepovirus species. A real-time TaqMan RT-PCR for the detection of TRSV was reliable and specific using 167 extracts of pollen from plants of Nicotiana glutinosa. The assay was highly sensitive, with extracts testing positive to a 10-6 dilution, equivalent to a single pollen grain. This demonstrated that RT-PCR methods can detect virus-infected pollen reliably, sensitively and specifically.

Few studies have investigated the impact of invasive alien plants on butterflies in insular ecosystems, despite butterflies representing a key indicator group for terrestrial arthropod diversity. Using the Pollard Technique, we quantified butterfly species richness and abundance in eight wet lowland forest areas invaded by alien plants, principally the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) on the tropical volcanic island of Mauritius, and compared the results with paired adjacent forest plots that had been weeded of alien plants between 2 and 12 years previously. Butterfly assemblages in weed-infested and weeded forests were distinctly different with higher species richness and much higher butterfly abundance in the latter. At least some of these differences seemed attributable to weed removal effects on forest structure, but understanding the precise mechanisms involved will require further study. The results suggest that alien plant invasion may have contributed to the extinction of certain endemic taxa and can increase the likelihood of butterfly species extinction by reducing population sizes through reduced habitat quality. Such a shift in a forest's butterfly assemblage is likely to have negative effects on both their indigenous predators and the plants they pollinate. It is argued that in order to maintain butterfly and other arthropod diversity and function in these forests, alien plant control must be maintained and extended beyond the current 1% of surviving forest remnants. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.2010.",Arthropods; Biodiversity hotspot; Butterflies; Canopy cover; Conservation management; Exotic invasive plants; Forest restoration; Mauritius; Psidium cattleianum; Weed control,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649732603

However, in some cases interspecific hybrids can be more invasive than any of the parent species. This is problematic for policy makers, and for horticulturists developing or trading in new ornamental cultivars. We explore these issues in the context of the need to manage naturalized populations of Kangaroo Paws (Anigozanthos species) in South Africa. Self-sustaining, dense populations of naturalized Kangaroo Paws occur at several localities and are highly attractive to local nectar-feeding birds. The populations show high levels of seed set with or without bird pollination. Given the known propensity of Kangaroo Paws to hybridise in their native range in Australia, and confusion about the species identity of naturalized populations in South Africa, it was essential to resolve some key taxonomic issues in the group. We constructed the first molecular phylogeny for all species of the Kangaroo Paw group (genera Anigozanthos and Macropidia; family Haemodoraceae). As previously determined by taxonomists working on herbarium specimens, naturalized populations were identified as A. flavidus. In addition, we also identified a second species, A. rufus. Relative genome size estimates for Anigozanthos species indicated that small inter-specific differences in genome sizes are positively correlated to hybrid fitness. Anigozanthos flavidus and A. rufus have relatively 'compatible' genomes and may produce fertile hybrids under field conditions. However, for species whose genome size differ more than ~30%, there is little inter-specific compatibility and consequently a very low risk of producing fertile hybrids. In conclusion, we recommend that trade in Kangaroo Paws in South Africa should be temporarily restricted and that particular cultivars should first be subjected to a careful risk assessment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Anigozanthos; Biological invasions; Breeding system; Hybridisation; Kangaroo Paws; Macropidia; Pollination; Self-compatibility; Systematics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149416023

Unless rewardless plants have an extremely efficient means of deceit or are autogamous, they tend to experience less fruit set than those that offer pollinator rewards. In Puerto Rico, we studied the reproductive biology of a rewardless epiphytic orchid, Pleurothallis ruscifolia (Pleurothallidinae), a widespread Neotropical species. The Pleurothallidinae are primarily myophilous, self-incompatible, and pollinator dependent for fruit set and seed production. However, because our preliminary observations indicated that populations of P. ruscifolia on the island of Puerto Rico exhibited an unusually high fruit set, we hypothesized that our population is autogamous and that reproductive effort and fruiting success are resource limited. We monitored 168 plants in a single population during the 2009 reproductive season to determine the mating system of P. ruscifolia while looking for evidence of reproductive constraints. Fruit set in our population was high (66%) and no floral visitors were seen. Fruit set for our pollinator exclusion experiment was no different than fruit set for open pollinated plants. Most plants produced both chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers, the majority of fruits produced by the latter. Furthermore, reproductive effort and fruiting success were limited by plant size, which is likely the result of resource constraints. We expect that autogamy is prevalent in P. ruscifolia of the West Indies, but outcrossing should be dominant in continental populations. Selection for reproductive assurance in the absence or rarity of an effective pollinator is the likely process leading to this autogamous system.

It can be grown in both the first and second crop production seasons in the Aegean Region with high yield capacity. According to the production data of 2008, sunflower was produced on 577,958 ha and 992,000 metric tons of sunflower seed were harvested in Turkey (Anonymous, 2010). Because of the gap in vegetable oil production in Turkey, sunflower is one of the alternative and leading oilseed crops for Increasing vegetable oil production. One possibility for increasing this production Is for sunflower to also be grown as the second crop in the Aegean Region. The mission of the Oilseed Research Project at the Aegean Agricultural Research Institute (AARI) is to reduce the cost of sunflower production by improving well adapted and high yielding varieties. A number of different approaches are utilized to achieve this goal. Improved germplasm for hybrid development and breeding lines of oilseed and confectionary type of sunflower germplasm (A, B and Rf lines) and also improved populations have been developed by conventional breeding techniques. To improve sunflower varieties with desired characters, genetic investigations and germplasm development of sunflower with improved yield, oil quality, resistance to disease [Sunflower rust (Pucctnia heltanthl Schw.)), insect, Orobanche sp., and adverse conditions are under consideration. The research program is aiming to develop oilseed and confectionary type of sunflowers for both the first and second crop production seasons. Sunflower germplasm has been developed from sources such as cultlvars, populations created through breeding methods, or inter-specific crosses with wild germplasm and then tested for general and specific combining abilities, oil percentage, and resistance to prevalent disease and adverse conditions to construct improved varieties. For hybrid variety development, combining ability studies in oilseed and confectionary sunflower breeding program were undertaken with line x tester analysis. More than 2000 lines, candidate varieties, and commercial varieties were evaluated in preliminary and yield trials In the first and second crop produc-Hon seasons. Variety performance tests and yield trials Indicated that sunflower can be grown with satisfactory yield performance (approximately 500-550 kg da -1) in both the first and second crop production seasons In the Aegean Region of Turkey. Improvement of oilseed and confectionary types of sunflower parental germplasms (A, B and Rf lines) including hybrid and open pollinated varieties has been carried out.

The goals of our study were to resolve relationships among the 11 generic segregates from the New World genus Mascagnia, test the monophyly of the largest remaining Malpighiaceae genera, and clarify the placement of Old World Malpighiaceae. Methods: We combined DNA sequence data for four genes (plastid ndhF, matK, and rbcL and nuclear PHYC) from 338 ingroup accessions that represented all 77 currently recognized genera with morphological data from 144 ingroup species to produce a complete generic phylogeny of the family. Key results and conclusions: The genera are distributed among 14 mostly well-supported clades. The interrelationships of these major subclades have strong support, except for the clade comprising the wing-fruited genera (i.e., the malpighioid+ Amorimia, Ectopopterys, hiraeoid, stigmaphylloid, and tetrapteroid clades). These results resolve numerous systematic problems, while others have emerged and constitute opportunities for future study. Malpighiaceae migrated from the New to Old World nine times, with two of those migrants being very recent arrivals from the New World. The seven other Old World clades dispersed much earlier, likely during the Tertiary. Comparison of floral morphology in Old World Malpighiaceae with their closest New World relatives suggests that morphological stasis in the New World likely results from selection by neotropical oil-bee pollinators and that the morphological diversity found in Old World flowers has evolved following their release from selection by those bees. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Biogeography; Floral symmetry; Malpighiaceae; Matk; Mutualism; Ndhf; PHYC; Phylogeny; Pollination biology; RbcL; Systematics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649788893

Although these other birds do not rely only on floral resources, there are many plant species that do depend solely on them for pollination. These flowers display some features, including morphology and different kinds of resources, quite different from the ornithophilous flowers pollinated by hummingbirds. We review the syndrome of ornithophily in the Neotropical region and tear it apart into the two exploitation methods to determine the floral features that might favor pollination by hovering birds or by perching birds. We listed the Neotropical perching bird species mentioned in the literature as pollinators to take a look at that avian richness.

We have little idea how landscape-scale factors influence the success of wild bumblebee nests over time. Here for the first time we use molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the numbers of nests. 2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape in late May-June and late July-August, and the numbers of nests represented in each sample were estimated. We compare the methods available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of nests provide the best fit to our data. Changes in numbers of nests at the two time points were used to infer nest survival. 3. The two bee species appeared to differ markedly in survival over time, with estimates of 45% of nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius and 91% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that the foraging range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us to overestimate nest survival in this species. Differential survival may also reflect differences in phenology between the two species. 4. The land use class which had the most consistent effects on nest number and survival was gardens; for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens within a 750 and 1000 m radius positively influenced nest survival, while for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at sites with more gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum, the area of grassland within a 250 and 500-m radius also positively influenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the preferred nesting habitat for this species. 5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore, our data suggest that the positive influence of gardens on bumblebee populations can spill over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland. 6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial effects that even small areas of local resources such as rough grassland or clover leys can have on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear relevance for the design of pollinator management strategies. © 2010 The Authors.

Instead, some visitors circumvent the floral opening, usually removing nectar without contacting the anthers andor stigma. Here we review the evolutionary ecology of nectar robbing from both the plant and animal perspective. Effects of robbing on female and male components of plant reproduction range from negative to positive. Their underlying mechanisms are diverse, including direct effects and indirect effects mediated through changes in pollination. We detail how plants may be able to deter robbers through morphological and chemical traits. For the evolutionary ecology of robbing to move beyond a phytocentric perspective, studies must also address the causes of robbing and the consequences for both robbers and pollinators. We use an energetics approach to evaluate these causes and consequences. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions in need of further research. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

Material and methods: To measure population exposure to ragweed pollen, the R.N.SA (NationalAerobiological Monitoring Network, a French association) has a pollen trap network located in urban areas. These traps allow continuous recording of airborne pollen, the light microscope analysis (with a bi-hourly time step) allows one to know the daily concentrations of ragweed grains and the circadian rhythm of grains impaction. It is thus possible to follow the evolution of pollination during each day of each season and to compare seasons and years at each station. Biomnis is a biological Laboratory which performs more than 85% of ragweed specific IgE assay in France. It seems to be clear that when allergists ask ragweed IgE for a patient, it is because they think that this patient seems to be allergic to this specific pollen. The statistical analysis of results about specific IgE (for ragweed) from the Allergology laboratories Biomnis (located in Lyon and Paris) can determine the number of patients sensitized to ragweed in French departments. Results: The distribution of sensitized patients to ragweed is compared to ragweed pollen distribution studied by the R.N.S A from the year 2005 to 2008 in France, whatever the ragweed plant origin: local (closed to pollen trap) or imported (by wind). Conclusion: The biological database (Health impact) allows a correlation between the geographical distribution of ragweed pollen and the number of patients with specific IgE against ragweed (sIgEw1), i.e whose sensitization is due to local plants. That also permits one to estimate the expected number of allergy cases in the next years, because the sensitivity precedes the allergy.",Allergy; Pollens; Ragweed; Sensitivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650215545

Thus, having a lower intra-individual correlation between signal and reward (signal accuracy) than other plants in the population provides the opportunity to reduce investment in rewards and cheat pollinators. However, pollinators' cognitive capacities can impose a limit to the evolution of this plant cheating strategy if they can punish those plants with low signal accuracy. In this study, we examined the opportunity for cheating in the perennial weed Turnera ulmifolia L. evaluating the selective value of signal accuracy, floral display and reward production in a natural population. We found that plant reproductive success was positively related to signal accuracy and floral display, but not to nectar production. The intensity of selection on floral display was more than three times higher than on signal accuracy. The pattern of selection indicated that pollinators can select for signal accuracy provided by plants and suggests that learning abilities of pollinators can limit the evolution of deceptive strategies in T. ulmifolia. © 2010 The Authors.

However, subjective human judgements of flower colour may be inaccurate and are irrelevant to the ecology and vision of the flower's pollinators. For precise, detailed information about the colours of flowers, a full reflectance spectrum for the flower of interest should be used rather than relying on such human assessments. Methodology/Principal Findings: The Floral Reflectance Database (FReD) has been developed to make an extensive collection of such data available to researchers. It is freely available at http://www.reflectance.co.uk. The database allows users to download spectral reflectance data for flower species collected from all over the world. These could, for example, be used in modelling interactions between pollinator vision and plant signals, or analyses of flower colours in various habitats. The database contains functions for calculating flower colour loci according to widely-used models of bee colour space, reflectance graphs of the spectra and an option to search for flowers with similar colours in bee colour space.

Annual nesting cycle, nest substrate selection and use of wood and bamboo trap nests were studied during 2006. In this region, X. frontalis has an univoltine cycle, with a peak of nesting founding from October to December. External flight activities started earlier in summer and were restricted to warmer hours of the day in winter. Number of flights per hour was significantly correlated with minimum air temperature, among main climatic variables. Number of new nests founded was more strongly correlated with average values of the regional historical climate variables prevailing two months after the nest foundations, suggesting selection pressure for emergence of new bees under favorable conditions of precipitation, temperature and photoperiod. During the main blooming period of P. edulis, a synchrony between the peak of daily flight activities and the beginning of anthesis was observed, a pattern confirming the tight interaction between these two species.

The commonest form of asexual reproduction is clonal growth, in which vegetative modules (ramets) are produced by the parental genotype (genet). In plants, sexual and asexual reproduction usually occur simultaneously, and this can lead to allocation trade-offs and antagonism between reproductive modes. Our review considers the ecological and evolutionary consequences of functional interactions between clonal reproduction and pollination and mating. Clonal reproduction is commonly associated with mass flowering, restricted pollen dispersal, and geitonogamous self-pollination, processes that can result in inbreeding depression and pollen discounting. We review evidence for the correlated evolution of clonality and sexual systems, particularly self-incompatibility, and identify several floral mechanisms that function to reduce mating costs by limiting selfing and pollen discounting. We conclude by discussing the loss of sexuality in clonal plants and consider the genetic and environmental basis of sexual dysfunction. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

This link can be studied by using experimental or natural variation in seed input to the soil to assess how reproductive success affects vital rates of offspring. We previously reported for Ipomopsis aggregata that per-seed probability of germinating is insensitive to density of seeds sown into plots, whereas per capita flower production among adults that grow from the seedlings declines in nonlinear fashion with density. Here we describe a parallel non-experimental study. We related seedling emergence to estimated natural seed input ('seed rain') in three populations across ten summers and monitored seedlings that emerged in the first two summers throughout their life histories. Seedling emergence in 1996 was linearly related to seed rain from plants that flowered in 1995. This density independent seed-to-seedling transition recurred over the next nine summers, but the slope varied with springtime precipitation. Total numbers of 1996 seedlings that survived to flower and numbers of flowers they produced increased linearly with seed rain in one population, but did not vary detectably in the other two, consistent with negative density dependence. In consequence ? (the dominant eigenvalue of a population projection matrix) decreased from high values at low densities of seed rain to a relatively constant low value with greater seed rain. We also detected density dependence in the 1995 seedling cohort in survival and flower production.

Sampling was performed in an area of hyperxerophytic caatinga shrub vegetation in the ""Estação Biológica de Canudos"" (Canudos Biological Station - EBC), Bahia State, Brazil. The pollen spectrum present in the nests of C. analis was determined by examining the pollen residues found on the walls of the larval cells and in feces incorporated into the construction of the nests. The pollen spectrum in the studied nests (n=5) of C. analis was composed of a total of six pollen types, of which Byrsonima vacciniifolia (45.98%) and Chamaecrista ramosa (44.73%) demonstrated the highest occurrence frequencies. The pollen types C. ramosa, Banisteriopsis muricata and Byrsonima vacciniifolia also appear to be important resources for C. analis in the caatinga vegetation at the EBC. The presence of the pollen type Rhaphiodon echinus probably indicates a nectar source used by C. analis during specific periods.

Estimation of the breeding systems of these taxa using nuclear microsatellite markers scored in mother-progeny arrays demonstrated that, in pure populations, G. urbanum is predominantly selfing (outcrossing rate, t = 0.058 to 0.177), whereas G. rivale is predominantly outcrossing (t = 0.686-0.775). Theory suggests that hybridization between inbreeding and outcrossing species can potentially generate novel inbreeding lineages. However, the establishment of such lineages may be restricted either by self-incompatibility loci or deleterious recessive alleles derived from the outcrossing parent. To assess the likelihood that hybridization between G. urbanum and G. rivale will generate novel inbreeding lineages, self-incompatibility and inbreeding depression were investigated in the two taxa. Seed set in the absence of pollinators, and after controlled self- and cross-pollination, was measured to study self-incompatibility. Inbreeding depression was measured by estimating the relative fitness of offspring from controlled self-and cross-pollinations. Geum urbanum was fully self-compatible [self-compatibility index (SCI) = 1] and bagged flowers showed full seed set. By contrast, only 3% of bagged flowers set seed in G. rivale and controlled self-pollinations showed a 60-80% reduction in seed set compared to controlled outcross pollinations (SCI = 0.28). There was no evidence for inbreeding depression in G. urbanum, although significant, albeit low levels of inbreeding depression were detected in one of two G. rivale populations (? = 0.33). The implication of these results is that if genetic material from G. rivale was incorporated into a hybrid with a selfing morphology, the establishment of this selfing lineage could be compromised by self-incompatibility and inbreeding depression. The wider implications of these results for evolution in hybrid swarms between G. urbanum and G. rivale are discussed. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Breeding system; Common garden experiment; Geum rivale; Geum urbanum; Mating system; MLTR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649415726

Here, we use the controversial genus Orchis s.l. as a case-study to explore the broader issues that surround the definition and circumscription of genera, and suggest a new approach to selecting among competing formal classifications that focuses on the biological cohesion of the resulting taxa. Levels of postzygotic reproductive isolation, assessed as differential embryo mortality through extensive artificial crosses between species, are compared with three taxonomic treatments: a pre-cladistic morphological classification permitting polyphyly; a cladistic classification generated by applying monophyly to Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences; and a 'post-cladistic' classification that aimed to compromise between morphological and molecular differences and permitted paraphyly. The monophyletic cladistic classification is by far the most consistent with levels of postzygotic isolation through embryo mortality. Reproductive isolation, sequence divergence and morphological similarity can all usefully be quantitatively compared with formal classifications, though floral morphology in orchids offers a high risk of rapid co-evolutionary divergence with pollinator guilds, often generating spurious monospecific 'genera'.

In the Northeastern United States, the primary insect pest is the striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum F. Using a Blue Hubbard squash (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne) perimeter trap crop system can reduce insecticide use by >90% in butternut squash (C. moschata Poir), the primary winter squash grown in this region. Despite the savings in insecticide costs, growers may be reluctant to give up field space for a perimeter crop of Blue Hubbard squash, which comprises only 5% of the winter squash market in New England as compared with 19% for buttercup squash. Finding a more marketable trap crop would lower the barrier for adoption of this system. We tested eight varieties of three species of cucurbits for attractiveness to beetles relative to Blue Hubbard and butternut squash, and chose buttercup squash as the most promising replacement. We compared the effect of a buttercup border, Blue Hubbard border, or control (no border) on beetle numbers, herbivory, insecticide use, pollination, and pollen limitation in the main crop. We found that buttercup squash performed equally well as Blue Hubbard as a trap crop, with 97% reduction in total insecticide use compared with control fields. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and squash bees (Peponapis pruinosa Say) were the predominant pollinators, and border treatments did not affect visitation. Hand pollination did not increase reproduction or yield, indicating that natural pollination was sufficient for full yield. This study confirms the effectiveness of perimeter trap crop systems and offers growers a more marketable trap crop for managing cucumber beetle damage. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",Acalymma vittatum; butternut squash; Cucurbita maxima; integrated pest management (IPM); pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251491059

The extent to which post-fertilization events might differ among these unfused carpels may promote variations in the reproductive strategies of plants. We report a study of the variation, within and among carpels and flowers, in seed production and mass in the apocarpous Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae), in relation to the number of carpels per flower. Differences within and among carpels in female reproductive success were affected by carpel number and pollination environment. When analysing whole flowers as functional units we also found that the magnitude of the differences related to carpel number and pollination treatment actually depended on the ""distribution"" of pollen types within flowers. Thus, variable within-flower pollination environments, more likely to occur in apocarpous than in syncarpous flowers, may affect the strategies of resource allocation for fruit development at different stages of the reproductive process. Regarding seed production, we found that producing more flowers with four carpels was under directional; however, when mean diaspore mass was considered as a measure of fitness, directional selection was found on producing flowers with two and three carpels (the modal carpel number found in wild populations). We discuss ecological and developmental reasons which could explain the observed pattern, and conclude that selection on an optimum carpel number may be very variable across the species range, as the discussed reasons may impose constraints on eventual evolutionary response, thus contributing to the maintenance of the intra-individual variability in carpel number. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Apocarpous flowers; Carpel number; Helleborus foetidus; Ovule position; Pollination environment; Seed mass; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149497079

Moreover, such variation could be linked to individual susceptibility to pollen limitation (PL) because those individuals strongly affected by ? for seed production will require more outcross pollen for setting a given number of fruits or seeds. However, no study has tested explicitly for associations between PL and ? at the individual plant level. This study assesses the extent of among-individual variation in PL and ?, the consistency of ? across life stages, and the relationships between individual PL and ? in the mixed-mating shrub Myrtus communis. Methods Controlled hand-pollinations were performed in a natural M. communis population. Marked flowers were monitored until fruit production and a greenhouse experiment was conducted with the seeds produced.Key Results Compared with selfing, outcross-pollination enhanced seed number per fruit, germination rate and seedling growth, but did not enhance fruit-set. Only seed number per fruit was pollen limited and, thus, cumulative pollen limitation depended more on pollen quality (outcross pollen) than on quantity. The effects of ? varied considerably across life stages and individual plants. Cumulative ? was high across individuals (mean ? = 0·65), although there were no positive correlations between ? values at different life stages. Interestingly, maternal plants showing stronger ? for seed production were more pollen limited, but they were also less affected by ? for seedling growth because of a seed size/number trade-off. Conclusions Results show a general inconsistency in ? across life stages and individuals, suggesting that different deleterious loci are acting at different stages. The association between ? and PL at the individual level corroborates the idea that pollen limitation may be 'genotype-dependent' regardless of other factors. © The Author 2010.

Values of also h2 increased with age. Pilodyn penetration, assessed at only one site, was more heritable, than the average of growth traits. Estimated individual-tree heritabilities were moderate to low for stem straightness (h2) average of 0.20) and relative bark thickness (0.16). The estimated additive genetic correlations between diameter and height were consistently high and positive (rA average of 0.90). High additive genetic correlations were observed between growth variables and pilodyn penetration (rAaverage of 0.58). Relative bark thickness showed a negative correlation with diameter (rA = -0.39) and height (rA = -0.51.)

Previous work in other woody perennial plant species has shown the importance of carbohydrates accumulated in the flower in the reproductive process. Thus, in order to explore the implications of the nutritive status of the flower in the reproductive process in avocado, the starch content in the pistil has been examined in individual pollinated and non-pollinated flowers at anthesis and during the days following anthesis. Starch content in different pistilar tissues in each flower was quantified with the help of an image analysis system attached to a microscope. Flowers at anthesis were rich in highly compartmentalized starch. Although no external morphological differences could be observed among flowers, the starch content varied widely at flower opening. Starch content in the ovary is largely independent of flower size because these differences were not correlated with ovary size. Differences in the progress of starch accumulation within the ovule integuments between pollinated and non-pollinated flowers occurred concomitantly with the triggering of the progamic phase. The results suggest that starch reserves in the ovary could play a significant role in the reproductive process in avocado. © Physiologia Plantarum 2010.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78349235840

These organisms serve critical roles as herbivores, predators, parasitoids, and pollinators, with several species functioning as models for agricultural, behavioral, and genomic research. The collective anatomical knowledge of these insects, however, has been described or referred to by labels derived from numerous, partially overlapping lexicons. The resulting corpus of information-millions of statements about hymenopteran phenotypes- remains inaccessible due to language discrepancies. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology (HAO) was developed to surmount this challenge and to aid future communication related to hymenopteran anatomy. The HAO was built using newly developed interfaces within mx, a Web-based, open source software package, that enables collaborators to simultaneously contribute to an ontology. Over twenty people contributed to the development of this ontology by adding terms, genus differentia, references, images, relationships, and annotations. The database interface returns an Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) formatted version of the ontology and includes mechanisms for extracting candidate data and for publishing a searchable ontology to the Web. The application tools are subject-agnostic and may be used by others initiating and developing ontologies. The present core HAO data constitute 2,111 concepts, 6,977 terms (labels for concepts), 3,152 relations, 4,361 sensus (links between terms, concepts, and references) and over 6,000 text and graphical annotations. The HAO is rooted with the Common Anatomy Reference Ontology (CARO), in order to facilitate interoperability with and future alignment to other anatomy ontologies, and is available through the OBO Foundry ontology repository and BioPortal. The HAO provides a foundation through which connections between genomic, evolutionary developmental biology, phylogenetic, taxonomic, and morphological research can be actualized. Inherent mechanisms for feedback and content delivery demonstrate the effectiveness of remote, collaborative ontology development and facilitate future refinement of the HAO. © 2010 Yoder et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650837915

One example of this is fruit size, which is commonly observed to decrease from proximal to distal positions within an inflorescence. The resource limitation hypothesis proposes that because proximal fruits usually develop first, they have temporal priority on access to resources over distal fruits. The non-mutually exclusive architectural effects hypothesis suggests that these position effects in fruit size may also be due to inherent architectural variation along infructescence axes. We separated out the effects of resource competition and inflorescence architecture by removing the outer or the inner flowers within capitula of Tragopogon porrifolius. We also studied if fruit position influenced germination and seedling performance in order to assess fitness consequences of position effects. Inner fruits were significantly heavier when outer flowers were removed. However, outer fruits did not significantly increase when inner flowers were removed, suggesting later fruits were limited by the development of early fruits. Our findings also suggest that architectural constraints restricted the size of inner fruits in comparison with outer ones. We found that both resource competition and inflorescence architecture affected the fruit size of T. porrifolius, even though this species does not have linear, indeterminate inflorescences. We advance the hypothesis that, when such effects on fitness occur, resource competition-mediated position effects could turn, in evolutionary time, into architectural position effects. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Architectural constraints; Asteraceae; Flower removal, position effects; Tragopogon porrifolius",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449271834

This occurs due to a number of factors, which deforestation of natural areas may be considered as a major problem though besides reducing the substrates availability for nesting bees, reduce the resources used by them for their sustenance and procreation. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the nest of Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens in trap nests, alternatives cavities provided in the field that may facilitate the transfer of nests from one area to another and facilitate growth of the populations of those species in areas of growing passion fruit as well. As trap-nests were available bamboo canes, closed at one end by the node and put into holes in ""baiano type"" brick which were placed on shelves under roofs built on the campus of USP, in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. The length of the trap-nests used by X. grisescens ranged from 18.8 to 28.8 cm and those for X. frontalis from 16.1 to 30.6 cm, while the diameter for the first species ranged from 1.7 to 2.1 cm and the second from 1.6 to 2.2 cm. The thickness of the walls of the trap-nests used by both species ranged from 3 to 5mm. The nesting behavior of the two species were very similar and did not differ significantly from those reported by others studying the same species from natural nests or nesting in other types of trap-nests. Nests of X. grisescens contained two to five cells and X. frontalis one to six cells. The cells had the shape similar to a barrel and those built by X. grisescens were significantly larger and had the cellular partitions thicker than the cells of X. frontalis. The duration of the egg to emergence was similar between the sexes of the two species and between the two species. The provision of the sexes in the nest followed the pattern in other species of Xylocopa building cells in linear arrangement and the production of females was higher than that of males corroborating data from other authors from nests laid on other substrates, both natural and alternative. The total mortality of immature individuals was higher in X. frontalis and unknown causes, fungi and Cissites sp (Coleoptera: Meloidae) were the causative agents of mortality in nests of both species. The results showed that X. frontalis and X. grisescens showed no significant change in their nesting activities in bamboo canes used as trap nests. The verification of the viability of an alternative cavity to nesting is one of the most important steps in the sequence of studies that should be made to the use of those kinds of bees in pollination programs.",Bees; Behavior; Nesting; Trap-nests; Xylocopa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051962259

Cass. (Asteraceae) is a strictly self-incompatible crop species with a sporophytic self-incompatibility mechanism. This characteristic presents a number of difficulties in plant improvement programs. The objective of this study was to determine the number and distribution of S-alleles in Ethiopian niger populations and to identify and develop self-compatible genotypes with various associated advantages. Several aspects of self-incompatibility in niger were compared in self- and cross-pollination experiments in which seed-set was considered to be a measure of compatibility. Our results indicate the presence of a minimum of ten self-incompatibility alleles and one self-compatibility allele at the S-locus in niger. Most of these alleles behave differently in the pollen and pistil. About two-thirds of the allelic interactions in both the pollen and pistil were dominant/recessive, and one-third were codominant. The reciprocal cross-pollinations (RCPs) resulted in progeny with similar levels of compatibility within and among populations because of a wide distribution of S-alleles in the populations and, consequently, low population differentiation at the S-locus. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that only 2% of the total genetic variation at the S-locus differentiates the populations.

A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007-08 growing seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm). Conclusions/Significance: The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952118619

However, before implementing them it is important to understand the mating system in annatto, a tropical species that is highly commercial for its unique capability to produce bixin. This report focuses on estimating outcrossing rates in an open-pollinated population of B. orellana by sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP). Eleven open-pollinated progeny arrays of 10 individuals each were used for this determination. Sequence-related amplified polymorphism data indicated a multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) of 0.748 and an average single-locus outcrossing rate (ts) of 0.651. Outcrossing was predominant in the B. orelllana open-pollinated population. The multilocus estimates differed from the single-locus estimates (0.097), suggesting the existence of mating among relatives (biparental inbreeding). A Wright's fixation index (F) of 0.332, indicated high homozygosity in the progeny evaluated with random mating, suggesting low variability.

We analyzed 25 stages/organs of rice reproductive development including early microsporogenesis stages with 57,381 probe sets, and identified around 26,000 expressed probe sets in each stage. Fine dissection of 25 reproductive stages/organs combined with detailed microarray profiling revealed dramatic, coordinated and finely tuned changes in gene expression. A decrease in expressed genes in the pollen maturation process was observed in a similar way with Arabidopsis and maize. An almost equal number of ab initio predicted genes and cloned genes which appeared or disappeared coordinated with developmental stage progression. A large number of organ-/stage-specific genes were identified; notably 2,593 probe sets for developing anther, including 932 probe sets corresponding to ab initio predicted genes. Analysis of cell cycle-related genes revealed that several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), cyclins and components of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were expressed specifically in reproductive organs. Cell wall biosynthesis or degradation protein genes and transcription factor genes expressed specifically in reproductive stages were also newly identified. Rice genes homologous to reproduction-related genes in other plants showed expression profiles both consistent and inconsistent with their predicted functions. The rice reproductive expression atlas is likely to be the most extensive and most comprehensive data set available, indispensable for unraveling functions of many specific genes in plant reproductive processes that have not yet been thoroughly analyzed. © The Author 2010.",Ab initio predicted genes; Flower development; Microarray; Reproductive stage; Rice; Transcriptome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651314945

Insects with biological-control potential recorded at the EFNs included ants, wasps and ladybird beetles. Ants, comprising ten species, constituted by far the most abundant group (84.44 ± 4.34 % of individuals) at the EFNs. Insect pollinators included honey bees, butterflies and wasps, which, while visiting the floral nectaries (FNs), also visited the EFNs. Ants were found in large numbers on EFN-bearing plant parts, particularly leaves and calyces. Aggressive and abundant ant species visiting the plants included Camponotus compressus, C. paria and Pheidole sp. The major insect herbivore was the red pumpkin beetle, Raphidopalpa foveicollis Lucas, which fed predominantly on the corolla of the plants and, to a lesser extent, on each of the EFN-bearing vegetative parts. The low abundance of herbivores on vegetative parts indicates that the ants and, to a lesser extent, wasps, bees and ladybirds visiting the EFN-bearing plant structures may be aiding in crop plant protection from the herbivores. Thus, though the EFNs of sponge gourd plants attract predators, pollinators and also extrafloral nectar thieves such as flies, ants are the major group involved in the facultative association with the annual crop plant. Such studies may aid an environmentally-friendly management approach involving the natural enemies of insect pests of EFN-bearing annual crop plants. © Vivek Mohan Agarwal and Neelkamal Rastogi.",Ants; Extrafloral nectaries; Insect visitors; Sponge gourd plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866296238

It can also be beneficial for breeding of self-pollination varieties, clones and synthetics. The discovery of heterotic groups in standard grain quality maize significantly improved the process of testing. The improvement in sweet maize was relatively modest in comparison to standard grain quality maize due to a relatively narrow genetic base ofsweet maize, then poorly defined heterotic relations, scarce sources of germplasm that satisfy commercial standards, poor seed vigour, low quality of root and stalk, as well as, a short period of time for the estimation of yield and quality. The efficiency of hybrid breeding programmes would be significantly higher if heterosis could be predicted prior to the evaluation in the field. The application of the multivariate analysis method to data of phenotypic characterisation according to the UPOV Descriptor was an attempt to establish whether such a procedure can be beneficial for the determination of related groups and whether the phenotypic distance, obtained on the basis of a visual estimation of a plant group, can be an indicator of heterosis. Obtained results indicate that clustering is highly analogous to the pedigree. Since sweet maize breeders have at their disposal less significant genetic variability and search for the development and defining of heterotic groups, as such a procedure can be useful in both, the process of the hybrids development and the process of new inbreed development and genetic variability increasing. Certainly, further systematic studies aimed at this direction are necessary to reliably ascertain that the phenotypic distance is a justifiable indicator of heterosis.",Heterosis; Phenotypic distance; Sweet maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957603973

The 'boom and bust'response of many vertebrates is commonly invoked for invertebrates and especially insects. This perception of the Australian arid zone is exacerbated by the lack of long-term surveys of insects identified at high levels of taxonomic resolution. From an 18 mo continuous survey of insects in central Australia I determine the phenology of many insect taxa, and clarify which climatic variables most influenced the activity of these taxa. Total abundance and taxon richness were higher in the warmer months and lower in the cooler months. Minimum temperature, rainfall during the survey month, and rainfall during the previous month had significant effects on phenology, demonstrating that there is pronounced and predictable activity of many species in the absence of rain, although rainfall has a marked effect on the activity of some species. Other species were more active or only active in the coolest months. These findings have implications for the most productive time for surveys in the Australian arid zone, the availability of insects as prey or pollinators, and for the potential effects of climate change. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",climate; Insects; phenology; seasonality; taxa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251489496

Half the plots in each experiment were treated with insecticides following pollination. Thrips populations within ears were enumerated at six stages of ear development. Grain was examined microscopically and the percentages of kernels with silk-cut and ear rot symptoms were quantified by weight. Fumonisin B1 contamination in grain was measured by ELISA. Immature stages of thrips predominated, and maximum thrips populations occurred 21 days after pollination. Insecticides reduced thrips numbers, as well as silk-cut, ear rot symptoms and fumonisin B1 contamination. Immature thrips populations were more strongly correlated with silk-cut/ear rot symptoms (R = 0·75) and fumonisin B1 accumulation (R = 0·53), than were adult thrips (R = 0·48 and 0·36, respectively). Silk-cut kernels all had ear rot symptoms and the percentage of kernels with symptoms was highly correlated with fumonisin B1 contamination (R = 0·84). Results suggest that thrips are not occasional feeders, but can complete a substantial portion of their life cycle on maize ears. The results also indicate that thrips activity may be a cause of silk-cut symptoms, and this may be the mechanism that connects thrips activity with fusarium ear rot and fumonisin contamination of grain. © 2010 The Authors.

In Costa Rica, these plants are found growing in small and isolated patches, some of them consisting of just four to six individuals. Information about the genetic variability within and among populations is very important for the conservation of this endangered species. A total of 160 samples were collected in six locations and analyzed with amplified fragment length polymorphism technique. The genetic diversity of P. longifolium in Costa Rica (Hw = 0.1711) is high and differentiation among sampled locations is moderate (?pt = 0.2013) in comparison with results of studies in some other terrestrial orchid species using the same technique. The percentage of polymorphic loci was, on average, 51.5. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated the main genetic variation was within sampled locations (80%), even though the variation among locations was also significant. In situ conservation is recommended because, in addition to protecting habitat and avoiding fragmentation, mycorrhizal fungi and pollinators are also protected. Close proximity between populations is required to maintain high genetic variability through a gene flow continuum. It is suggested that conservation of patches with higher genetic variability be prioritized as many are located in unprotected areas. A germplasm bank for ex situ conservation has been established in the living collection at Lankester Botanical Garden using the plants collected in this study. Finally, a search for new locations of this species is also suggested. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",AFLP; Conservation genetics; Genetic diversity; Phragmipedium longifolium; Slipper orchid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149498298

Coning and leaf flushing events occur during April-June. The plant is typically anemophilous and it is highly effective for optimal seed set. In both the sexes, during maturation process the cones show weak thermogenesis and emit mild foetid odour, which apparently do not have any significant role in pollination. Alphitobius beetles use male cones for feeding and breeding during which they get coated with pollen. These beetles in search of other male cones visit female cones by mistake and effect pollination. The female cones offer only warmth to the beetles during night. The beetles diapause on male plants or in the soil until the next coning season. Leaf flushing episode occurs immediately after the maturation of cones in both sexes, to gain the lost energy and also to supply photosynthate for the growing seeds in female plants. The squirrels, Funambulus palmarum and Ratufa indica act as seed dispersal agents. A beetle species uses the seeds for breeding and causes seed infestation to a great extent. The adults that emerge from the seeds diapause in the soil until the next seed season to repeat the next breeding cycle.

In this work, we purified PG and PT plasma-membrane vesicles from Lilium davidii Duch. using the aqueous two-phase partition technique, then enriched plasma membrane proteins by using Brij58 and KCl to remove loosely bound contaminants. We identified 223 integral and membrane-associated proteins in the plasma membrane of PGs and PTs by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and 2-D high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. More than 68% of the proteins have putative transmembrane domains and/or lipid-modified motifs. Proteins involved in signal transduction, membrane trafficking and transport are predominant in the plasma-membrane proteome. We revealed most components of the clathrin-dependent endocytosis pathway. Statistical analysis revealed 14 proteins differentially expressed in the two development stages: in PTs, six upregulated and eight downregulated are mainly involved in signaling, transport and membrane trafficking. These results provide novel insights into polarized PT growth. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649531413

(castor bean). The proricin travels through the Golgi appar-atus and co-localizes throughout its route to the storage vacuoles of developing castor bean endosperm. We report here the pattern of seed morphological and ultrastructural changes during various stages of seed development, associated with ricin accumulation. ELISA was used to compare the ricin content in mature seeds of four Brazilian commercial cultivars. ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy anal-ysis were used to study ricin accumulation during seed development from 10 to 60 days after pollination (DAP). Results have shown that no ricin could be localized in the endosperm cells in the early development stages (before 20 DAP) and only a few localization points could be observed at 30 DAP. However, a significant ricin localization signal was observed at 40 DAP in the matrix of the protein storage vacuoles. The signal increased significantly from 50 to 60 DAP, when ricin was observed in both the matrix and crystalloids of the protein storage vacuoles. Understanding ricin expression at the cellular level is fundamental for the development of strategies for gene suppression using molecular breeding approaches. © A.B.

We have redesigned 21 cylindrical OTCs, commonly used to study the effects of atmospheric pollutants, by adding (1) a pollen filter at the top of each unit to minimize the possibility of the escape of GM pollen; with pollen filters in place, the OTCs are referred to as mesocosms, (2) an evaporative cooler to help mitigate elevated temperatures during the summer months, and (3) an automated watering system that eliminates the need to enter a mesocosm for irrigation during pollination, thereby minimizing potential pollen escape and entry of insect pollinators. Each sunlit mesocosm contains three large plastic pots (each with 1.2-m2 surface area) that simulate field plots and that contain a constructed plant community. For example, the community may consist of a GM and a non-GM cultivar of canola (Brassica napus), compatible weedy relatives, and non-compatible species that may be found in mesic disturbed areas such as roadsides or ditches beyond crop fields. The sunlit mesocosms provide a well-replicated outdoor testing system that confines pollen and that can be used to precede or supplement field tests that evaluate the potential ecological consequences of transgenic crops. The mesocosms are proposed as test systems in which transgenic crops and other plants (e.g., biofuel crops) that have been proposed to be grown in new geographies, or plants that produce novel compounds, may be studied to evaluate their potential effects on plant communities. The pollen confinement and insect exclusion features of our mesocosms may also minimize exposure of sensitive humans and insect pollinators to pollen and cellular debris from other plant parts. © 2010 US Government.",Gene flow; Modified open top chambers; Plant communities; Pollen filter,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149471030

VAM3/SYP22 and PEP12/SYP21 are Qa-SNAREs that act in the vacuolar transport pathway of Arabidopsis thaliana, and are localized predominantly on the vacuolar membrane and the pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC), respectively. Previous studies have shown that loss-of-function mutants of VAM3/SYP22 or PEP12/SYP21 showed male gametophytic lethality, suggesting that VAM3/SYP22 and PEP12/SYP21 possess different, non-redundant functions. We have re-evaluated the effects of mutations in these genes using T-DNA insertion mutants in the Columbia accession. We found that a mutation in VAM3/SYP22 (vam3-1) caused pleiotropic abnormalities, including semi-dwarfism and wavy leaves. In contrast, a loss-of-function mutant of PEP12/SYP21 (pep12) showed no apparent abnormal phenotype. We also found that the double vam3-1 pep12 mutant had severely reduced fertilization competence, although male and female gametophytes (vam3-1-pep12-) maintained the ability to fertilize. Moreover, promoter swapping analysis revealed that expression of a GFP-PEP12/SYP21 fusion under the control of the VAM3/SYP22 promoter suppressed all phenotypes of the vam3-1 mutant. These results indicate that the functions of VAM3/SYP22 and PEP12/SYP21 were redundant and interchangeable.

As food-deceptive orchids are poorer competitors for pollinator visitation than rewarding orchids, their occurrence in a given habitat may be more constrained than that of rewarding orchids. In particular, the success of deceptive orchids strongly relies on several biotic factors such as interactions with co-flowering rewarding species and pollinators, which may vary with altitude and over time. Our study compares generalized food-deceptive (i.e. excluding sexually deceptive) and rewarding orchids to test whether (i) deceptive orchids flower earlier compared to their rewarding counterparts and whether (ii) the relative occurrence of deceptive orchids decreases with increasing altitude.Methods To compare the flowering phenology of rewarding and deceptive orchids, we analysed data compiled from the literature at the species level over the occidental Palaearctic area. Since flowering phenology can be constrained by the latitudinal distribution of the species and by their phylogenetic relationships, we accounted for these factors in our analysis. To compare the altitudinal distribution of rewarding and deceptive orchids, we used field observations made over the entire Swiss territory and over two Swiss mountain ranges.Important FindingsWe found that deceptive orchid species start flowering earlier than rewarding orchids do, which is in accordance with the hypotheses of exploitation of naive pollinators and/or avoidance of competition with rewarding co-occurring species. Also, the relative frequency of deceptive orchids decreases with altitude, suggesting that deception may be less profitable at high compared to low altitude. © 2009 The Author.

Gymnosperms, especially conifers, are important components of forests, and there is an urgent need for them to be identified through DNA barcoding because of their high frequency of collection in the field. However, the feasibility of DNA barcoding in gymnosperms has not been examined based on a dense species sampling. Here we selected seven candidate DNA barcodes from the plastome (matK, rbcL, rpoB, rpoC1, atpF-atpH, psbA-trnH, and psbK-psbI) to evaluate their suitability in Picea (spruce). The results showed that none of them or their different combinations has sufficient resolution for spruce species, although matK+rbcL might be used as a two-locus barcode. The low efficiency of these candidate barcodes in Picea might be caused by the paternal inheritance of the chloroplast genome, long generation time, recent radiation, and frequent inter-specific hybridization aided by wind pollination. Some of these factors could also be responsible for the difficulties in barcoding other plant groups. Furthermore, the potential of the nuclear LEAFY gene as a land plant barcode was discussed. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649699936

The objective of this work was to characterize aspects of the mating system in the sweet passion fruit using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers, particularly the rate of outcrossing in P. alata progenies. A multilocus outcrossing rate of tm-0.994 was determined from RAPD and tm-0.940 from microsatellites, supporting P. alata as an outcrossing species. The fixation indices of the maternal generation (Fm) were -0.200 and 0.071 with RAPD and microsatellite loci, respectively, indicating the absence of inbreeding in the maternal generation. The paternity correlation (rp) varied from -0.008 with RAPD markers to 0.208 with microsatellite markers, suggesting a low probability of finding full sibs within the progenies.

Both artificial removal of pollinia and ethrel treatment of the flowers also induced this labial color change. Labia in color-changed flowers showed a decreased reflectance of wavelengths less than 670 nm compared to control intact flower. Both reflectance irradiance spectra and ultraviolet photographs showed that only the nectar guide in white (unchanged) flowers reflected ultraviolet light, and that this reflectance decreased with labial color change.

The difficulties of accurately predicting the fate of a given introduction has led to increased interest in identifying situations where the risk posed by invaders is particularly high. We analyse patterns of plant invasions in arid zones to develop explicit invasion risk protocols. The study zones are five arid regions in three continents: the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts in North America, the Atacama Desert in South America, the Sahara in northern Africa and the Tabernas and Monegros in southwest Europe, (Spain). We test which life-history traits are related to invasiveness in these areas. We use Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to model variation between species in invasion success as a function of eight predictors, potentially related to invasiveness: clonality, pollination model, dispersal syndrome, linking to moist soils, seed size, linking to disturbed habitats, salinity tolerance and longevity. We also analyse the differences that exist between the total alien flora in these six areas of the world with respect to die attributes that were considered. From the species perspective, when taxonomie effects were accounted for, only dispersal syndrome and linking to disturbed habitats appeared to be related to the invasive nature of plants. However, if taxonomie effects are not taken into account the variable salinity tolerance is also significantly related. In spite of the fact that the regions have important climatic analogies, there does not appear to be a clear general pattern in the attributes of alien flora, as these are largely dependent on local conditions.",Alien flora; Arid zones; Plant invasions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954596671

In 2008, according to the production data, sunflower was grown in Turkey on an area of 577,958 ha and 992,000 metric tons of the seed were harvested (Anonymous, 2010). Because of the gap in vegetable oil production in Turkey, sunflower is one of the alternatives and the leading oilseed crop that can be used to increase the vegetable oil production in the country. Growing sunflower as a crop in the Aegean Region is one of the possibilities to increase the production. The main objectives of this study were to identify oilseed hybrids and open-pollinated confectionary varieties that could be grown with satisfactory yield performance in the Aegean Region. The experiments including oilseed and confectionary types of cultivars were conducted separately during the first crop-growing seasons of 2008 and 2009 on the experiment field of the Aegean Agricultural Research Institute in Menemen, Izmir. The experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Oilseed hybrids and open-pollinated confectionary sunflower candidate varieties were used in the study as the material. An adaptation study was undertaken for the characters of seed yield, seed oil content (%), 1000-seed weight, plant height, head diameter, seed length, seed width, hull percentage (%), seed color (white, black, and intermediate), days to flowering, and days to physiological maturity. The results Indicated that statistically significant differences were found among the sunflower varieties for the characters In question. In the oilseed variety experiments, the highest seed yield (572 kg da -1) and the lowest seed yield (343 kg da -1) were obtained in 2009 from the varieties ETAE-Y-TM-2007-5 and Armada, respectively. In the confectionary variety experiments, the highest seed yield (563 kg da -1) and the lowest seed yield (202 kg da -1) were produced in 2009 by the varieties ETAE-D1-2-B2 and ETAE-Ç-P-1-2, respectively.",Adaptation; Agronomy; Breeding; Confectionary variety; Helianthus annuus l; Hybrid variety; Oilseed variety; Openpollinated variety; Sunflower; Yield components,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053030498

Sweet and grain sorghum are in the same species, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench. In optimum conditions, sweet sorghum can grow 4.5 meters tall and produce 45 to 110Mg of fresh weight biomass per hectare with less N and water than maize. Ethanol can be produced from sweet sorghum stalks by extracting the juice and fermenting the sugars with yeast. Bagasse remaining after extraction can be fed to livestock or converted to useable energy by burning to produce steam for generating electricity, anaerobic digestion to make methane, or reacting with oxygen at high temperature to produce synthetic gas. Sweet sorghum can be grown in most climates. Some cultivars will grow as far north and south as the 45° latitude. It is normally grown as an annual crop. But, in warm climates, a single seed planting can be managed for two or three years by leaving lower stalks and roots at harvest to produce new tillers for the next growing cycle. Rotating sweet sorghum in alternate years with a nongrass crop is an effective management tool for reducing insect, weed, and disease pests. Nitrogen fertilizer can often be reduced when sweet sorghum is planted after a legume crop such as soybean. Most of the sugar for syrup and ethanol from sweet sorghum is currently produced with open pollinating cultivars. Recently, hybrid sweet sorghums with increased sugar content and biomass yield have been developed in India, China, and the United States. © 2011 Royal Society of Chemistry.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863940100

The current study aim are to 1) contribute to the reduction of this gap by presenting data obtained from passion- fruit cultures in the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, and 2) discuss the possibilities of maintaining these native bees in agricultural areas. The flowers of passion-fruit are hermaphroditic, typically melitophyle, auto-incompatible and require large size pollinators, capable of promoting the nototribic transfer of pollen. Of the 19 bee species considered pollinators of P. alata in this study, 13 belong to the tribe Centridini. Species richness was particularly high in Uberlândia, close to Cerrado areas. Flower visits by these bees corresponded to 44-49% of the observed total. Epicharis flava was the most frequent polinator in both study sites. Species of Eulaema Bombus (Apini) and Xylocopa (Xylocopini) were also considered potential polinators. Anthesis begun at 5h and pollinator visits were more frequent between 7h and 11h. The presence of Centridini bees in the cultivation area is facilitated by its nesting habits, frequently on bare areas on the ground. However, the necessity of other specific resources, such as floral oils, creates a dependence of plants that can be present only in native vegetation fragments or in secondary vegetation situated close to the cultivation areas. Therefore, the maintenance of populations of these pollinators is related to the proper management of the landscape. Currently, attempts to breed pollinator bees are restricted to species the nest in pre-existing cavities, by supplying bait- nests. Soil preservation in native areas and the recovery of degraded areas may be essential for the maintenance or introduction of bee species that nest on the ground.",Atlantic forest; Centris; Cerrado; Epicharis; Oil bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051980227

Here, we investigated the effect of population age structure and isolation by distance in the patterns of genetic diversity in a wind-pollinated, zoochorous tree (Olea europaea subsp. guanchica) sporadically affected by volcanic events across the Canarian archipelago. Genetic variation was assessed at six nuclear microsatellites (nDNA) and six chloroplast fragments (cpDNA) in nine subpopulations sampled on four oceanic islands. Subpopulations occurring on more recent substrates were more differentiated than those on older substrates, but within-subpopulation genetic diversity was not significantly different between age groups for any type of marker. Isolation-by-distance differentiation was observed for nDNA but not for cpDNA, in agreement with other metapopulation studies. Contrary to the general trend for island systems, between-island differentiation was extremely low, and lower than differentiation between subpopulations on the same island. The pollen-to-seed ratio was close to one, two orders of magnitude lower than the average estimated for other wind-pollinated, animal-dispersed plants. Our results showed that population turnover and geographical isolation increased genetic differentiation relative to an island model at equilibrium, but overall genetic structure was unexpectedly weak for a species distributed among islands. This empirical study shows that extensive gene flow, particularly mediated by seeds, can ameliorate population subdivision resulting from extinction-recolonization dynamics and isolation by distance. © 2010 The Author(s).

However, many aspects of their basic biology remain relatively unexplored. For example, one important and unusual natural history feature in bumble bees is the massive size variation seen between workers of the same nest. This size polymorphism may be an adaptation for division of labor, colony economics, or be nonadaptive. It was also suggested that perhaps this variation allows for niche specialization in workers foraging at different temperatures: larger bees might be better suited to forage at cooler temperatures and smaller bees might be better suited to forage at warmer temperatures. This we tested here using a large, enclosed growth chamber, where we were able to regulate the ambient temperature. We found no significant effect of ambient or nest temperature on the average size of bees flying to and foraging from a suspended feeder. Instead, bees of all sizes successfully flew and foraged between 16 °C and 36 °C. Thus, large bees foraged even at very hot temperatures, which we thought might cause overheating. Size variation therefore could not be explained in terms of niche specialization for foragers at different temperatures. © 2010 Margaret J.

The mean pollen production per anther is 5819, ranged from 580 in Salicornia ramosissima to 12 467 in Salsola vermiculata, and is related to the size of the anthers. In six of the species, pollen production per anther has been studied in two populations and a strong interaction between species and populations was found. Pollen production of central and lateral flowers has been compared in four species, showing that central flowers produce significantly more pollen than lateral ones. In Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, a comparison between the pollen production of upper and lower stamens was performed and no significant differences were found. The pollen/ovule (P/O) ratio has been estimated for each of the species studied for the monoecious species, using the previously calculated male flower/female flower ratio. The monoecious species have the highest P/O ratios, followed by those with hermaphrodite flowers and allogamous reproduction. The lowest P/O ratios were found in Salicornia ramosissima (681) and Suaeda albescens (6025), possibly due to them being autogamous, which is consistent with the annual cycle and ecology of the species. The biggest value was found in the monoecious species Halimione portulacoides (88 405). In the remainder of the species, the P/O ratio depends on the density of individuals of each species in the communities. © 2010 Collegium Palynologicum Scandinavicum.",Chenopodiaceae; Marsh; P/O ratio; Pollen; Pollination; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649734314

Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Adaptation; Climate change; Cooperation; Corals; Dispersal; Invasive species; Pollination; Rhizosphere; Selection pressures; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649536349

In this study, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has two cPGM genes (PGM2 and PGM3) encoding proteins with high sequence similarity and redundant functions. Whereas pgm2 and pgm3 single mutants were undistinguishable from the wild type, loss of both PGM2 and PGM3 severely impaired male and female gametophyte function. Double mutant pollen completed development but failed to germinate. Double mutant ovules also developed normally, but approximately half remained unfertilized 2 d after pollination. We attribute these phenotypes to an inability to effectively distribute carbohydrate from imported or stored substrates (e.g. sucrose) into the major biosynthetic (e.g. cell wall biosynthesis) and respiratory pathways (e.g. glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway). Disturbing these pathways is expected to have dramatic consequences for germinating pollen grains, which have high metabolic and biosynthetic activities. We propose that residual cPGM mRNA or protein derived from the diploid mother plant is sufficient to enable double mutant female gametophytes to attain maturity and for some to be fertilized. Mature plants possessing a single cPGM allele had a major reduction in cPGM activity. However, photosynthetic metabolism and growth were normal, suggesting that under standard laboratory conditions cPGM activity provided from one wild-type allele is sufficient to mediate the photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes in leaves. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649791556

Since fall 2006, honey bees in the U.S. have faced a serious population decline, due in part to a phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), which is a disease syndrome that is likely caused by several factors. Data from an initial study in which investigators compared pathogens in honey bees affected by CCD suggested a putative role for Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus, IAPV. This is a single stranded RNA virus with no DNA stage placed taxonomically within the family Dicistroviridae. Although subsequent studies have failed to find IAPV in all CCD diagnosed colonies, IAPV has been shown to cause honey bee mortality. RNA interference technology (RNAi) has been used successfully to silence endogenous insect (including honey bee) genes both by injection and feeding. Moreover, RNAi was shown to prevent bees from succumbing to infection from IAPV under laboratory conditions. In the current study IAPV specific homologous dsRNA was used in the field, under natural beekeeping conditions in order to prevent mortality and improve the overall health of bees infected with IAPV. This controlled study included a total of 160 honey bee hives in two discrete climates, seasons and geographical locations (Florida and Pennsylvania). To our knowledge, this is the first successful large-scale real world use of RNAi for disease control.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651237035

Box 13185-116, Tehran, Iran","Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) is a widespread monoecious and wind-pollinated tree species. It is one of the major components of the Hyrcanian forests of Iran and it is of both ecological and economical importance. Twelve beech stands were surveyed at 9 chloroplast (cp) and 6 nuclear (n) polymorphic microsatellite loci (simple sequence repeats, SSR) to provide information on distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations and on gene conservation and silvicultural management of this species. High levels of genetic differentiation were detected for the chloroplast genome (FST = 0.80 and RST = 0.95), in sharp contrast to the nuclear genome (FST = 0.06, RST = 0.05). The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 48% of the total cpSSR variation was attributable to differences among regions and 30% to differences among populations within regions, suggesting multiple origins of beech populations in Hyrcanian forests. Nuclear SSRs confirmed the presence of significant differentiation among populations and among geographic regions, even if, as expected, this was less pronounced than that found with cpSSRs (based on AMOVA, differences among regions and among populations within regions each contribute 5% to total nSSR variance). A highly significant correlation between genetic (nSSRs) and geographic distances (R2 = 0.522) was estimated, thus showing an isolation by distance effect. The application of spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) using both marker data allowed identification of genetically homogeneous groups of populations. Possible applications of these results for the certification of provenances and/or seed lots and for designing conservation programs are presented and discussed. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",cpSSR; Fagus orientalis Lipsky; Genetic diversity; nSSR; Phylogeography,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049417513

Despite the widespread nature of this strategy, we still know little about how spatial memory develops and guides individuals toward suitable routes. Here, we investigate whether flower visitation sequences by bumblebees Bombus terrestris simply reflect the order in which flowers were discovered or whether they result from more complex navigational strategies enabling bees to optimize their foraging routes. We analyzed bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long (suboptimal) route. Bees' tendency to visit patches in their discovery order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities. We discuss how maintaining some level of route flexibility could allow traplining animals to cope with dynamic routing problems, analogous to the well-known traveling salesman problem. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Bombus terrestris; Pollination ecology; Spatial cognition; Trapline foraging; Traveling salesman problem,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649687913

Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) EcoRI/MseI primer combinations were employed and, based on the resulting polymorphic bands, genetic similarities were estimated, and an unweighted pair group method using arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was conducted. The open-pollinated cocozelle cultivars clustered with the resistant hybrids. The hybrids had greater similarities with one another than did the open-pollinated cultivars. The zucchini cultivars and their resistant backcross lines formed their own exclusive cluster. However, the resistant backcross lines showed less than 0.80 similarity with their recurrent parent. As the chromosome number of Cucurbita is high (2n=2x=40) and the resistances are inherited monogenically and oligogenically, these results, after six generations of backcrossing, cannot be explained by classical genetic linkage. © 2010 NIAB.",cucurbit breeding; interspecific crosses; introgression; molecular markers; near-isogenic lines; quasi-linkage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952899320

In the present study on developing ovules of the recalcitrant-seeded species, Encephalartos natalensis, cells of the megagametophyte were found to become progressively packed with starch and protein as the two main storage reserves, a limited number of discrete lipid bodies, and occasional mitochondria all of which appeared to be embedded in a homogeneous matrix. ER-derived vesicles (and not Golgi-derived vesicles) appeared to be the principal contributors of the primary cell wall components, pectin and xylan, during megagametophyte cellularisation. This was confirmed by the use of enzyme-gold localisation. High-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze substitution (FS) of samples the following season showed that while the apparently featureless cytomatrix of the megaspore was an artefact of conventional fixation, there was still an insignificant occurrence of Golgi bodies during primary wall formation. When enzyme-gold localisation was employed on the HPF-FS material, label for pectin and xylan was found only in the regions of ER and vesicles and not in any of the few Golgi bodies or their associated vesicles. Immunocytochemistry revealed that pectin and xylan were restricted to the ER and not to any vesicles or to the occasional Golgi body that was found. This suggests that the ER exclusively, is involved in the deposition of these primary cell wall components during the cellularisation of the E. natalensis megagametophyte. While cellularisation took place over approximately 1-2 weeks, subsequent development of the megagametophyte cells involved the accumulation of storage reserves, this phase lasting approximately 8 months-after which the seeds were shed whether pollination/fertilisation had recently occurred, or not. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cycad; Enzyme-gold localisation; Histochemistry; Immunocytochemistry; Ovule ontogeny; Recalcitrant; Ultrastructure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249285917

As a result of the diagnosis studies, it was determined that A. flavipes species collected the pollens of 13 families and that the dominant pollen group belonged to the Brassicaceae. It was ascertained that A. flavipes collected sweet cherry pollen and that the sweet cherry flowers do not represent a primary pollen source, however. © 2010 Y. Guler and K.

Poir. (Mimosaceae) is a xerophilous plant which is very common in degraded areas in the Brazilian semi-arid region, including areas of beekeeping. The ingestion of leaves from M. tenuiflora by ruminants is responsible for malformations. Chemical analyses of this plant revealed that it contains several secondary compounds including three triterpenoidal saponins, designated Mimonosides A-C, four flavones, five flavanones and four chalcones. Several plant species contain secondary compounds in nectar and pollen that could be toxic to pollinators, including bees. Experimental approaches are necessary to identify plant species that produce pollen that is toxic to bees. The present study aimed to determine the toxic potential of M. tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Mimosaceae) pollen to Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Materials, Methods & Results: The plant species utilized in this study was Mimosa tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir. (Mimosaceae) and a voucher specimen was deposited (no. 9591) at the Dárdano de Andrade-Lima (MOSS) Herbarium, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Árido (UFERSA), Mossoró, RN, Brazil. Pollen samples were collected near Mossoró city, RN, in northeastern Brazil (5°11'15""S and 37°20'39""W). Honeycombs that contained pupae of africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera) were collected from the apiary of UFERSA. Newly emerged forager bees, identified on basis of their body size and coloration, were used for the experiment. All the bees used were of the same age. Groups of twenty bees were put into wooden boxes (11 x 11 x 7 cm). The boxes were kept in an acclimatized chamber (BOD) at 32°C and 70% humidity. M. tenuiflora pollen was added to the food (5 parts of sugar mixed to one part of honey) at doses of 0 (control group; n=195), 2.5% (n=178), 5.0% (n=186) and 10.0% (n=186). The bees were observed daily until the last one died. Statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software (GraphPad Prism v.4 for Mac). Median survival times, with 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Differences in the time distributions between groups were tested for statistical significance using the logrank test. The median survival times of the bees were four days for all groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a significant difference (P=0.0041) between the survival curves, but the log-rank test did not show statistical difference (P=0.2825). The survival curve of controls differed (P=0.001) from the survival curve of the group fed 2.5% M. tenuiflora, but did not differ from the other groups. Discussion: Several plant species contain secondary compounds in nectar and pollen that could be toxic to animals that consume them. Bees collect large amounts of pollen grains very efficiently, making these grains generally unavailable for pollination. Thus, presence of secondary compounds in pollen grains could be a strategy designed to restrict the loss of pollen to bees. Even though it contains several secondary metabolites, the results of the present study indicate that the ingestion of the pollen of Mimosa tenuiflora by Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) at conditions of the present study did not promote toxic effect.","""Jurema preta""; Apidae; Hymenoptera; Mimosaceae; Poisonous plants; Toxic pollen",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954631356

Although there have been descriptive and mechanistic models to describe pollen dispersion, there has rarely been a comprehensive mechanistic model to dynamically simulate pollen release, dispersion, and deposition and to finally relate them to the gene flow (outcrossing). This research developed and validated such a comprehensive mechanistic model for corn crop gene flow risk management. Dynamic pollen dispersion and deposition were predicted by a 3-D random walk model according to inputs of weather data and plant and domain characteristics. Actual gene flow (outcrossing ratio) was obtained according to predicted grand total deposition flux at silk height during the whole pollination season. The model was validated by experimental data and was appropriate to predict gene flow with acceptable accuracy under different atmospheric and environmental conditions; on average, the ratios of measured and simulated values ranged from 0.82 to 1.21, while R2 ranged from 0.56 to 0.68.

The experiment was done in a phytotron using one female ('Fjellgull') and one hermaphroditic ('Nyby') cultivar. Plants were grown at 9, 12, 15 and 18°C in 24-h photoperiod. The female cultivars were pollinated with pollen from a male ('Apollen') clone and from the hermaphrodite clone. Parthenocarpic fruit development was induced by gibberellic acid (GA 3). Ripe berries were frozen individually at -80°C and stored until analyses. There was a linear, double logarithmic relationship between temperature and number of days from pollination/GA3-treatment to ripening. 'Fjellgull' had significantly larger berries than 'Nyby', and the largest berries were obtained at 12 and 9°C. Pollen clone did not have a significant effect on berry size. GA3 induced parthenogenesis in 'Fjellgull' and partial parthenogenesis in 'Nyby'. In 'Fjellgull', the parthenocarpic berries were comparable to pollinated ones at low temperatures, but at 18°C their development was restricted. The level of total anthocyanins was significantly higher in 'Fjellgull' than in 'Nyby', and these levels were significantly enhanced at 9 and 12°C compared to higher temperatures. Levels of total phenolic compounds were not significantly affected. In conclusion, the present results indicate that low temperature is favourable both for size and quality of cloudberries. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

In order to get an insight into the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in sexual embryogenesis and to define somatic embryogenesis induction capability, global DNA methylation and the somatic embryogenic competence were quantified. On cross-pollinated trees once fertilization takes place, at least one ovule per ovary becomes dominant, and transient DNA demethylation occurs coinciding with the start of the sexual embryogenic programme. Unfertilized ovules from the same cluster, which maintain their prior size, increase their methylation level and undergo degeneration. These results were validated using non-cross-pollinated trees and the asynchrony of flower receptivity. When testing in vitro somatic embryogenesis response of isolated dominant ovules and axes from zygotic embryos under cross-pollinated conditions, the highest competence was found for reaching seed maturity. Thus, a ""developmental window"" of somatic embryogenesis in chestnut has been characterized. It includes from fertilization to embryo maturity, and a transient decrease in methylation is necessary after fertilization for the development of the somatic embryogenesis response. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Castanea sativa Miller; DNA methylation; Epigenetic plasticity; Sexual embryogenesis; Somatic embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650174896

Pollen grains were isolated by centrifugation or directly from mature male flowers and were cultured with mature ovules. We assessed pollen grain viability, fertilization ability, and fertilized ovule development. The developing ovules (becoming enlarged and green) were transferred to media supporting embryogenesis (with ascorbic acid, caseinhydrolysate, coconut water and gibberellic acid). The highest level of regeneration after in vitro pollination was callus formation from ovules. We found caseinhydrolysate to be the most beneficial component during in vitro pollination (CP medium) and during development of fertilized ovules (ON medium). The hybrid character of fertilized ovules arisen from crosses between cucumber and muskmelon was checked but not confirmed by RAPD analysis, for reasons we suggest.

In this study, the forest refuge theory is examined at the molecular level in Milicia excelsa, a dioecious tree with a continuous range throughout tropical Africa. Eight nuclear microsatellites (nSSRs) and two sequences and one microsatellite from chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) showed a deep divide between samples from Benin and those from Lower Guinea. This suggests that these populations were isolated in separate geographical regions, probably for several glacial cycles of the Pleistocene, and that the nuclear gene pools were not homogenized despite M. excelsa's wind-pollination syndrome. The divide could also be related to seed dispersal patterns, which should be largely determined by the migration behaviour of M. excelsa's main seed disperser, the frugivorous bat Eidolon helvum. Within Lower Guinea, a north-south divide, observed with both marker types despite weak genetic structure (nSSRs: FST = 0.035, cpDNA: GST = 0.506), suggested the existence of separate Pleistocene refugia in Cameroon and the Gabon/Congo region. We inferred a pollen-to-seed dispersal distance ratio of c. 1.8, consistent with wide-ranging gene dispersal by both wind and bats. Simulations in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework suggested low nSSR and cpDNA mutation rates, but imprecise estimates of other demographic parameters, probably due to a substantial gene flow between the Lower Guinean gene pools. The decline of genetic diversity detected in some Gabonese populations could be a consequence of the relatively recent establishment of a closed canopy forest, which could negatively affect M. excelsa's reproductive system. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Approximate Bayesian Computation; CpDNA; Forest refugia; Milicia excelsa; NDNA; Spatial genetic structure; Tropical Africa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649308571

An understanding of the initiation and execution of senescence is therefore needed to reduce postproduction shrinkage within the floriculture industry. While most studies of senescence have focused on gene changes, there is increasing evidence that senescence is also regulated post-transcriptionally. We have therefore used a proteomic approach to profile the protein changes during flower petal senescence. A large number of the proteins found to be upregulated during petal senescence fall into the biological function category of proteolysis. Protein degradation catalyzed by proteases is a key feature of senescence, which allows the plant to systematically dismantle cellular proteins and remobilize nutrients to developing tissues. The ability to manipulate these pathways may lead to delays in the senescence program. Most of the proteases identified during the pollination-induced senescence of Petunia × hybrida corollas were cysteine or serine proteases. Increased protease activity correlated well with these increases and senescence related activity was due to either cysteine and/or serine proteases. Four proteins that encode components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were also identified and suggest that the targeted degradation of proteins via the proteasome may regulate senescence.

Fifteen nuclear and three universal chloroplast microsatellites markers were used to type 247 individuals localized in three contiguous areas with differing past logging intensity. These three areas were within a natural forest block of approximately 2886km2 in Gabon. Expected heterozygosity and chloroplast diversity were He nuc=0.570 and Hcp=0.761, respectively. FIS was only significant in one area (FIS=0.076, P&lt;0.01) and could be attributed to selfing. For nuclear loci, Bayesian clustering did not detect discrete gene pools within and between the three areas and global differentiation (FSTnuc=0.007, P&gt;0.05) was not significant, suggesting that they are one population. At the level of the whole forest, both nuclear and chloroplast markers revealed a weak correlation between genetic relatedness and spatial distance between individuals: Spnuc=0.003 and Spcp=0.015, respectively. The extent of gene flow (?) was partitioned into global gene flow (?g) from 6.6 to 9.9km, seed dispersal (?s) from 4.0 to 6.3km and pollen dispersal (?p) from 9.8 to 10.8km. These uncommonly high dispersal distances indicate that low-density canopy trees in African rainforests could be connected by extensive gene flow, although, given the current threats facing many seed disperser species in Central Africa, this may no longer be the case. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Baillonella toxisperma; Central Africa; gene flow; genes dispersal; genetic diversity; low density; Moabi; rainforest tree,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449304057

Genetic studies provide insights into population structure that are crucial for conservation management but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among populations was detected; multilocus FST was up to 0.53, and and Dest were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C.floralis populations are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight the need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline of this and potentially other rare solitary bees. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",conservation; dispersal; landscape genetics; management unit; mining bee; population structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449311559

Concerns have been raised about how GMHR sugar beet cultivation might impair the agro-environment. European legislation for GM plants requires, prior to their commercial import and/or cultivation, a stepwise reduction of the containment and a gradual increase in the scale of release. Experimental results gained during this procedure enter an environmental risk assessment; after the GM plant approval, a systematic monitoring of potential adverse environmental effects is required. We collected information on sugar beet biology and cultivation and the HR technology. We categorised the literature findings, evaluated the evidence of agro-environmental effects and indicated adverse effects. The impacts are directly and indirectly linked to sugar beet biology and/or to the HR technology. Most likely are a) adverse herbicide effects on field organisms, aquatic communities and soil microbial communities, b) persistence of the GM plant triggered by a potential selective advantage and/or genetic drift after hybridisation of GMHR cultivated, feral and weed beet with neighbouring beets and wild relatives, c) the increase of HR in weeds and subsequent increase and/or change in the herbicide application regime after several years of glyphosate application, and d) decline in agrobiodiversity (weed communities, herbivores, pollinators and beneficial species). Our study reveals a lack of experimental data on potential agro-environmental effects. This suggests that the principle of a stepwise scale increase of release is inadequately applied to the GMHR sugar beet approval process. The adverse effects identified should prompt further research experiments to gain information for the ERA and/or specific monitoring activities at the respective identified spatial scale levels.",Genetically modified herbicide resistance; Monitoring; Risk assessment; Spatial scales; Sugar beet,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449307742

A current challenge in population and conservation genetics is to disentangle the relative effects of these processes, as a first step in predicting population response to future environmental change. In this investigation, we compare the influence of contemporary population decline, contemporary ecological marginality and postglacial range shifts. Using classical model comparison procedures and Bayesian methods, we have identified postglacial range shift as the clear determinant of genetic diversity, differentiation and bottlenecks in 29 populations of butternut, Juglans cinerea L., a North American outcrossing forest tree. Although butternut has experienced dramatic 20th century decline because of an introduced fungal pathogen, our analysis indicates that recent population decline has had less genetic impact than postglacial recolonization history. Location within the range edge vs. the range core also failed to account for the observed patterns of diversity and differentiation. Our results suggest that the genetic impact of large-scale recent population losses in forest trees should be considered in the light of Pleistocene-era large-scale range shifts that may have had long-term genetic consequences. The data also suggest that the population dynamics and life history of wind-pollinated forest trees may provide a buffer against steep population declines of short duration, a result having important implications for habitat management efforts, ex situ conservation sampling and population viability analysis. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",bottlenecks; butternut; climate change; genetic diversity; range shifts,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449283620

However, this relationship is not always clear. Objectives: To analyze the correlation between grass pollen grain and aeroallergen concentrations in Ciudad Real, Spain, during the year 2004 and establish their association with symptoms in patients with allergic asthma, rhinitis, or both. Methods: Two different samplers were used to assess allergen exposure: a Burkard spore trap to collect pollen grains and a high-volume air sampler to collect airborne particles. Individual fi lters were extracted daily in phosphate-buffered serum and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on serum containing high titers of specifi c immunoglobulin (Ig) E to grasses. The study population comprised 27 grass-allergic patients whose symptoms and medication were recorded daily. Results: Grass pollens were detected between April 28 and July 18. There was a positive correlation between pollen grain counts and symptoms (r=0.62; P&gt;.001). Grass aeroallergens were detected not only during the grass pollination period, but also before and after this period. There was also a very signifi cant correlation between aeroallergen levels and symptoms (r=0.76; P&lt;.0001). The threshold level for grass pollen was 35 grains/m3. Conclusions: Grass-related allergenic activity is present throughout the year, demonstrating the existence of aeroallergens outside the pollen season. Symptoms in allergic patients may be related to airborne particle concentrations. This fact should be taken into account in the clinical follow-up and management of allergic patients. © 2010 Esmon Publicidad.",Aeroallergen; Allergen quantification; Asthma; Grass; Grass threshold; Pollen count; Rhinitis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049450268

While synchronous flowering is normally observed within the same species, different species also flower in synchrony. A well-known example of interspecific synchrony is general flowering in tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia. Environmental factors, such as low temperature and drought, have been considered as major trigger of general flowering. However, environmental cues are not enough to explain general flowering because some trees do not flower even when they encounter favorable environmental cues. We propose alternative explanation of general flowering; pollinator coupling. When species flower synchronously, the elevated pollen and nectar resource may attract increased numbers of generalist pollinators, with a concomitant enhancement of pollination success (facilitation). However, under these circumstances, plants of different species may compete with one another for limited pollinator services, resulting in declines in pollination success for individual species (competition). Here, we present a model describing resource dynamics of individual trees serviced by generalist pollinators. We analyze combinations of conditions under which plants reproduce intermittently with synchronization within species, and/or (sometimes) between different species. We show that plants synchronize flowering when the number of pollinators attracted to an area increases at an accelerating rate with increasing numbers of flowers. In this case, facilitation of flowering by different species exceeds the negative influence of interspecific plant competition. We demonstrate mathematically that co-flowering of different species occurs under a much narrower range of circumstances than intraspecific co-flowering. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",General flowering; Masting; Pollen coupling; Resource budget model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956246462

The experiment was set up as Randomized Complete Block Design with a split-plot arrangement with three replications. Wheat cultivars were main plots, the nitrogen application times were subplots. Bread wheat cultivars (Gün-91, Gerek-79 and Altay-2000) were used. Nitrogen was applied as conventional N (two equal amounts at the time of seed sowing and tillering stage) and late-season N application (one-third of was applied during sowing, one-third at the tillering stage and the rest was applied as foliar at post-pollination growth stage). Effects of late-season foliar N application on grain yield, nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen uptake efficiency, nitrogen utilization efficiency and grain protein content of wheat were observed. Grain yield, nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen uptake efficiency, nitrogen utilization efficiency and grain protein content of wheat in both years of the study were significantly affected by N application time.

In this study we focused on figs and their associated fig-wasps found in the Ryukyu and Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, Japan, because it has been suggested that breakdown in the specificity may occur in islands or at edge of a species' distribution. We collected 136 samples of 15 native fig species and 95 samples of 13 associated fig-wasps from all major islands in the Ryukyu Islands, including two fig species and one fig-wasp species endemic to the Bonin Islands. We performed molecular phylogenetic analyses using plastid DNA and nuclear ITS sequences for the figs and nuclear 28S rRNA and mitochondrial COI genes for the fig-wasps to investigate the interspecific phylogenies and intraspecific variation within the mutualism. Our phylogenetic analyses using multiple samples per species show the single clade of each fig (except the Bonin endemic species) and fig-pollinating wasp species. Fig species belonging to the same subgenera formed well-supported clades in both plastid and ITS trees, except for the subgenus Urostigma. Likewise, fig wasps emerging from host fig species belonging to the same subgenera formed mostly well supported clades in both 28S and COI trees. Host specificity between the figs and fig-wasps functions strictly in these islands. There was very little sequence variation within species, and that no major geographic structure was found.

The donor and the receptor species are strictly reproductively separated, and PgiC2 occurs in a polymorphic state within F. ovina. The active gene copy is normally closely linked to a very similar pseudogene. Methodology/Principal Findings: By genome walking we have obtained the up- and downstream sequences of PgiC2 and of corresponding genes in the donor and recipient species. Comparisons of these sequences show that the complete upstream region necessary for the gene's expression is included in the transferred segment. About 1 kb upstream of PgiC2 a fragment with transposition associated properties has been found (TAF). It is present in P. palustris and its polyploidy relatives, though not at the homologous position, and is absent from many other grasses, including non-transgenic F. ovina plants. It is possible that it is a part of a transposing element involved in getting the gene into a transferring agent and/or into the recipient chromosome. Conclusions/Significance: The close similarity of the up- and downstream regions with the corresponding regions in P. palustris excludes all suggestions that PgiC2 is not a HGT but the result of a duplication within the F. ovina lineage. The small size of the genetic material transferred, the complex nature of the PgiC2 locus, and the associated fragment with transposition associated properties suggest that the horizontal transfer occurred via a vector and not via illegitimate pollination. © 2010 Vallenback et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149463524

This colour change results from degradation of chlorophyll and to a lesser degree carotenoids, resulting in the unmasking of yellow colour. Chlorophyll levels were restored upon regreening. Degreening coincided with the complete dismantling of the thylakoid system, while keeping the outer plastid envelope intact. Regreening resulted from the complete redifferentiation of these gerontoplast-like plastids into functional chloroplasts. The colour change was directly linked to the development of the inflorescence. Complete removal of the inflorescence before flowering prevented the colour change while removal at full bloom, when involucral leaves were yellow, resulted in significantly faster regreening. This designates the inflorescence or florets as the possible origin of the colour change trigger and suggests that the colour change is involved with attraction of pollinators. Degreening and regreening also took place in a growth chamber under continuous high light intensity. Therefore neither pollination nor the presence of roots is required for regreening. It appears that colour change in Leucadendron results from a well-regulated degradation and subsequent synthesis of photosynthetic pigments. © 2010 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149343874

As a result, honey bees (Apis mellifera and A. cerana) selectively visited either of two lines, while syrphid flies (various flies belonging to Syrphidae) tended to visit both lines. Despite the few observations of pollinator movements between the two lines, all flowers had received cross-pollen grains a few days after flowering.

The percentage of pod set and the number of seeds per pod varied among the three stages of the flowering. These variations might be caused by shifts in the mount of crosspollen grains deposited on the stigmas due to the pollinators' selective visitation behaviors.

Adjustment between reproductive phenology and environment is expected to be higher in arctic and alpine habitats because the growing season is considerably short. As early- and late-flowering species reproduce under very different environmental conditions, selective pressures on flowering phenology and potential effects of climate change are likely to differ between them. However, there is no agreement on the magnitude of the benefits and costs of early- vs. late-flowering species under a global warming scenario. In spite of its relevance, phenotypic selection on flowering phenology has rarely been explored in alpine plants and never in Mediterranean high mountain species, where selective pressures are very different due to the summer drought imposed over the short growth season. We hypothesized that late-flowering plants in Mediterranean mountains should present stronger selective pressures towards early onset of reproduction than early-flowering species, because less water is available in the soil as growing season progresses. We performed selection analyses on flowering onset and duration in two high mountain species of contrasting phenology. Since phenotypic selection can be highly context-dependent, we studied several populations of each species for 2 years, covering their local altitudinal ranges and their different microhabitats. Surrogates of biotic selective agents, like fruitset for pollinators and flower and fruit loss for flower and seed predators, were included in the analysis. Differences between the early- and the late-flowering species were less than expected. A consistent negative correlational selection of flowering onset and duration was found affecting plant fitness, i.e., plants that bloomed earlier flowered for longer periods improving plant fitness. Nevertheless, the late-flowering species may experience higher risks under climate warming because in extremely warm and dry years the earlier season does not bring about a longer flowering duration due to summer drought. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",Alpine plants; Altitudinal gradients; Flowering phenology; Phenotypic selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862532835

Aquilegia species are closely related and their distribution covers highly diverse habitats. These provide rich resources to better understand the genetic basis of adaptation to different pollinators and habitats that in turn leads to rapid speciation. To gain insights into the genome structure and facilitate gene identification, comparative genomics and whole-genome shotgun sequencing assembly, BAC-based genomics resources are of crucial importance.Results: BAC-based genomic resources, including two BAC libraries, a physical map with anchored markers and BAC end sequences, were established from A. formosa. The physical map was composed of a total of 50,155 BAC clones in 832 contigs and 3939 singletons, covering 21X genome equivalents. These contigs spanned a physical length of 689.8 Mb (~2.3X of the genome) suggesting the complex heterozygosity of the genome. A set of 197 markers was developed from ESTs induced by drought-stress, or involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis or floral development, and was integrated into the physical map. Among these were 87 genetically mapped markers that anchored 54 contigs, spanning 76.4 Mb (25.5%) across the genome. Analysis of a selection of 12,086 BAC end sequences (BESs) from the minimal tiling path (MTP) allowed a preview of the Aquilegia genome organization, including identification of transposable elements, simple sequence repeats and gene content. Common repetitive elements previously reported in both monocots and core eudicots were identified in Aquilegia suggesting the value of this genome in connecting the two major plant clades. Comparison with sequenced plant genomes indicated a higher similarity to grapevine (Vitis vinifera) than to rice and Arabidopsis in the transcriptomes.Conclusions: The A. formosa BAC-based genomic resources provide valuable tools to study Aquilegia genome. Further integration of other existing genomics resources, such as ESTs, into the physical map should enable better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive radiation and elaboration of floral morphology. © 2010 Fang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049460463

In Solanaceae, a multiallelic gene, S-locus F-box (SLF), was previously shown to encode the pollen determinant in self-incompatibility. It was postulated that an SLF allelic product specifically detoxifies its non-self S-ribonucleases (S-RNases), allelic products of the pistil determinant, inside pollen tubes via the ubiquitin - 26S-proteasome system, thereby allowing compatible pollinations. However, it remained puzzling how SLF, with much lower allelic sequence diversity than S-RNase, might have the capacity to recognize a large repertoire of non-self S-RNases. We used in vivo functional assays and protein interaction assays to show that in Petunia, at least three types of divergent SLF proteins function as the pollen determinant, each recognizing a subset of non-self S-RNases.

The production area in this part of the country is over 20,000 ha. The importance of the crop keeps increasing due to its favorable nutritional properties. Apart from the hybrids suitable for husking produced on large scale, the cultivation area of the traditional open pollinated confectionery varieties is extending too. Kisvárda, an open pollinated variety, is the most widely produced. The abiotic and biotic stress resistance of this variety is excellent; however, it is susceptible to sunflower moth attack. The development of phytomelanin layer that would result in a decrease of susceptibility cannot be implemented without a change of the husk color, which in its turn is highly important on the market. The experiments carried out between 2006 and 2008 had three objectives: first, it included a comparative study of two varieties belonging to the cultivar Kisvárda and two standard hybrids (one confectionary and one oil type) regarding their resistance to moth infestation; second, we wished to determine the effect of sowing time on the extent of moth contamination; and third, we searched for differences, if detectable, between the varieties with respect to the above mentioned aspects.

Five wild populations collected in different environments and with different phenotype expression were evaluated as a genetic resource in a common garden study. The populations showed normal meiosis and produced a good seed set when their plants pollinated the male-sterile inbred line A09 (cms PET1). The wild populations restored more than 80% fertility of the HA89 (cms PET1) and A10 (cms PET1) inbred lines in the F1 generation. The fertility of one male sterile source from Mendoza was restored (>95%) by the maintainer line B10. The fatty acid composition differentiated a population from Entre Ríos with a high saturated fatty acid content (>107 g kg-1). Another population from La Pampa showed a high level (>50%) of resistance to the Sunflower Chlorotic Mottle Virus (SuCMoV). No wild populations showed tolerance to imazaphyr sprayed at 2× doses (×=80 g i.a. ha-1). A population collected in the coolest environment showed high tolerance to low temperature (15/5°C, neutral day) in the initial grow stages (<3 expanded leaves). A population collected in a dry and hot habitat showed the highest germination (>80%) under water stress (-0.4 MPa) imposed by polyethylene glycol 6000. This population and a second one from southern Buenos Aires showed the lowest leaf temperature increase (<10%) and the highest foliar specific density under artificial drought during the R4 to R6 reproductive stages.

This technique allows the production of fertile plants from immature embryos by reducing the breeding cycle. Ten days after pollination immature embryos were dissected from seeds grown in field plants (SGFP) and were transferred to MS medium allowing shoot and root development for 5-10 days. Young plantlets were transferred to soil, developed to maturity, and were then self pollinated and set seed. The first cycle of immature embryo-raised plants (ERP) was obtained. When these plants were at the flowering stage, 10-day-old embryos were dissected and the 2nd cycle of ERP was obtained. The plants at the flowering stage for obtaining the 3rd cycle are in the growth chamber at the moment. The majority of cultured embryos developed into vigorous plantlets with 3-6 leaves.

In contrast to diploid-tetraploid complexes, hybridization between diploid and hexaploid individuals may lead to viable fertile tetraploid offspring, and thus the interactions between these ploidy levels can be more complex. We investigated the breeding barriers operating between diploid and hexaploid individuals of Aster amellus at a contact zone in Central Europe to understand the absence of hybrids (i.e., tetraploids) and mixed populations. Phenological segregation, assortative mating mediated by pollinators and crossing ability were assessed under natural and controlled conditions in diploid and hexaploid populations growing in close proximity. The results revealed low levels of reproductive isolation (RI) due to flowering phenology (RI = 11-45%) and pollinator behavior (RI = 17%), so that pollen transfer between diploids and hexaploids is possible. In contrast, almost complete reproductive isolation was observed due to a series of postpollination barriers that significantly reduced the production of offspring from inter-cytotype crosses (RI = 99.9%), even though some tetraploids were detected in seeds and seedlings. We conclude that the absence of tetraploids at the contact zone is probably due to a combination of several factors, including spatial segregation, strong post-pollination barriers (such as gametic isolation, low viability of tetraploid seeds and/or inability of tetraploid plants to reach the flowering stage), and to a lesser extent, temporal and behavioral segregation. Future studies should explore the fitness of tetraploids and the effect of different traits on the reproductive success and fitness of each cytotype. This will enable a fuller understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms acting in contact zones. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",Flow cytometry; Phenology; Pollination experiment; Pollinator behavior; Polyploid aggregate; Tetraploids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894899019

They mostly occur as small, isolated fragments of varying sizes (0.5 to ?10. ha) and are considered as endangered forests types in peninsular India. Although plant diversity is well documented in these forests, there is a paucity of ecological studies vital for conservation and for planning restoration activities. We studied reproductive biology of 13 woody species: four trees, six shrubs, and three lianas in fragments of TDEF in southern India. The phenology of reproduction, floral biology, anthesis and sexual system of each species were recorded. The pollination mode was assessed through observations of the visitation frequency of pollinators and from the floral characters. The breeding system was determined by hand-augmented self- and cross-pollination experiments. The plants flowered during the dry season from January to July. Plants of nine species had both flowers and fruits at the same time. Twelve species were hermaphrodites and one was polygamo-dioecious. Flowers of 11 species opened at dawn and two at dusk. Four species were self-incompatible and six were self-compatible. Natural fruit set ranged from 10% to 56%, self-incompatible species having low fruit set. Cross-pollen augmentation increased fruit set, suggesting presence of outcrossing in all species. The majority of plants species (85%) had a generalized pollination system, receiving visits from diverse insects, such as social bees, solitary bees, wasps, moths and flies. However, only few of them were functionally important for the species. Two species namely: Capparis brevispina and C. zeylanica had butterflies and birds, respectively, as their main pollinators. Our data reveal that there is a predominance of outcrossing in plant species and a generalized pollination system in these forests. We suggest that restoration of TDEFs is crucial as habitats, not only for wild plants but also for pollinating insects. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",Breeding system; Dry forest; Habitat fragments; Pollination mode; Reproductive phenology; Sexual system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049428280

As statements on floral anthesis of this species are contradictory, this study also intended to elucidate both its beginning and duration. A pollinator exclusion study of a total of 162 flowers from 12 plants was conducted at one of the two study sites. Fruit and seed production as well as seed viability were documented to evaluate pollinator efficiencies. Anthesis proved to be nocturnal and diurnal, its duration and beginning was inversely proportional to maximum day temperatures. The experiment revealed that nocturnal and diurnal pollinator guilds both contributed to fruit set and that nocturnal pollination was more efficient. Yet, the efficiency of each of the members of the three pollinator guilds was limited for different reasons such as scarcity, unpredictability or specific pollination behaviors.Although E. chiloensis has nocturnal flowers, various floral traits where found to differ from the classical hawkmoth pollination syndrome, suggesting a shift from the specialized nocturnal to a more open pollination syndrome, thus adding to fruit set when hawkmoths are locally or temporarily scarce. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",Chile; Columnar cacti; Floral anthesis; Hawkmoths; Pollination biology; Pollinator exclusion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049439710

Our analysis of 1010 males from 27 species of euglossine bees sampled across the Neotropics at 2-11 polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed only five diploid males at an overall frequency of 0.005 (95% CIs 0.002-0.010); errors through genetic nondetection of diploid males were likely small. In contrast to allozyme-based studies, we detected very weak or insignificant population genetic structure, even for a pair of populations >500 km apart, possibly accounting for low diploid male frequencies. Technical flaws in previous allozyme-based analyses have probably led to considerable overestimation of diploid male production in orchid bees.

Various pollinator species can be affected by landscape factors and/or act at different spatial scales. We investigated whether different landscape factors at different spatial scales are correlated with pollinator abundances and pollination success. We examined common buckwheat, which is a self-incompatible crop species, pollinated by managed honeybees, native honeybees, and wild non-honeybee insects. To determine the effects of landscape factors at different spatial scales, we sampled flower-visiting insects and recorded seed sets. Results from the sampled flower visitors indicated that the abundances of managed honeybees, native honeybees, and wild non-honeybee insects were significantly related to the distance of managed hives, the area of forest cover within a 3-km radius, and the area of forest and grassland cover within a 100-m radius, respectively. Additionally, the latter two influential factors of the landscape, but not the distance of managed hives, showed significant positive correlations with the seed set. These results suggest that considering landscape factors at different spatial scales associated with the characteristics of managed and wild pollinators would help to ensure crop yields. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Apis cerana; Apis mellifera; Buckwheat; Crop pollination service; Distylous; Fagopyrum esculentum; Landscape; Polygonaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649443067

How these traits might influence the distributions of plant species in interaction with pollinators has rarely been investigated. We sampled 870 vegetation plots in the western Swiss Alps and classified the plant species into seven blossom types according to their floral morphology (wind, disk, funnel, tube, bilabiate, head or brush). We investigated the environmental features of plots with functional diversity (FD) lower than expected by chance alone to detect potential pollination filtering and related the proportions of the seven blossom types to a combination of environmental descriptors. From these results, we inferred the potential effect of the pollinator on the spatial distribution of plant species. The vegetation plots with significantly lower FD of blossom types than expected by chance were found at higher altitudes, and the proportions of blossom types were strongly patterned along the same gradient. These results support a biotic filtering effect on plant species assemblages through pollination: disk blossoms became dominant at higher altitudes, resulting in a lower FD. In harsh conditions at high altitudes, pollinators usually decrease in activity, and the openness of the disk blossom grants access to any available pollinator. Inversely, bilabiate blossoms, which are mostly pollinated by bees, were more abundant at lower elevations, which are characterised by greater abundance and diversity of bees. Generalisation through openness of the blossom could be advantageous at high elevations, while specialisation could be a successful alternative strategy at lower elevations. The approach used in this study is purely correlative, and further investigations should be conducted to infer the nature of the causal relationship between plant and pollinator distributions. © 2010 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958457976

This study investigates the contribution of geographic modes of speciation such as dispersal, vicariance, and isolation by distance. We sampled haplotypes of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I from Ceratosolen pollinators of six geographically widespread Australasian fig (Moraceae: Ficus) species, including four species spanning Wallacea. Phylogenetic analysis investigated the extent of host conservatism and host switching accompanying divergence in Ceratosolen. Geographically widespread Ceratosolen showed deep intraspecific divergence exceeding or comparable to divergence between named sister species. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses supported species monophyly in five of six cases, whereas results for a sixth species were equivocal. Bayesian divergence time estimation suggested dispersal across Wallacea during the Miocene epoch, after the collision of Australian and Asian continental plates. Cryptic species were evident in all six focal taxa. Because the deep mitochondrial divergence within these taxa is regionally distributed, allopatric divergence provides a simple explanation for the existence of these cryptic lineages pollinating widespread fig species. We found little evidence of divergence accompanied by host switching. The ancient origin of cryptic and geographically isolated species suggests that long-distance dispersal may be rare in Ceratosolen and that host associations are generally conserved during range expansion. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",mitochondrial DNA; phylogeography; Wallacea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649263317

The study was carried out in a canola field, in Southern Brazil. The anthesis stages were morphologically characterised and then related to stigma receptivity and pollen grain viability. Similarly, the behaviour of A. mellifera individuals on flowers was followed, considering the number of flowers visited per plant, the amount of time spent on the flowers, touched structures, and collected resources. Floral fidelity was inferred by analysing the pollen load of bees collected on flowers. The bees visited from 1-7 flowers/plant (x = 2.02; sd = 1.16), the time spent on the flowers varied between 1-43 seconds (x = 3.29; sd = 2.36) and, when seeking nectar and pollen, they invariably touched anthers and stigmas. The pollen load presented 100% of B. napus pollen.

We compared phenotypic selection on flowers of supplemental hand- versus open-pollinated plants to infer whether pollinators were an agent of selection on color. We compared attacked and unattacked plants to infer whether the seed predator was an agent of selection on color. Selection on brightness, but not chroma or hue, differed significantly between both pollination treatments and predation categories. Both pollinators and the seed predator exerted selection for less bright flowers, suggesting that they do not cause conflicting selection on flower color. However, we also detected phenotypic selection for brighter flowers that was not caused by pollinators or by the seed predator. Consequently, pollinators and herbivores are not sufficient to generate conflicting selection that could contribute to the maintenance of flower color variation in L. siphilitica. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Agent of selection; Flower color; Herbivory; Lobelia siphilitica; Phenotypic selection; Pollination; Seed predation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650085538

In the present study, we focused on five related Mediterranean orchid genera (Anacamptis, Orchis, Dactylorhiza, Ophrys and Serapias) that are characterized by different types of deceptive pollination. Methods: The in vitro germination ability of increasingly aged pollinaria of eight food-, seven sexually and two shelter-deceptive species was evaluated. Pollination experiments on two food-, one sexually and one shelter-deceptive species were also performed and the percentage of embryonate seeds derived from the increasingly aged pollinaria was checked. Key Results: All of the examined species showed long-term viabilities (= 50 & pollen tube growth) that ranged from 8 to 35 d. Species with the same deceptive pollination strategies exhibited the same pollen viability trends. Interestingly, pollen viabilities of species groups with different deception types have shown significant differences, with sexually and shelter- deceptive species exhibiting a shorter life span than food-deceptive species. Conclusions: This study confirms the prolonged germination and fertilization capacities of orchid pollinaria, and to our knowledge is the first report demonstrating a clear relationship between pollen viability and pollination system. It is proposed that this relationship is attributed to the different types of reproductive barriers, pre- or post-zygotic, that characterixe Ophrys and Serapias and the food-deceptive species, respectively. © 2010 The Author.

However, Indonesia has many teak plantation forests and 40%-50% of seeds for reforestation come from seed orchards and the remainder from plantations. In both, flower and fruit abortion results in low fruit set and thus seed production. We investigated flower and fruit development in a clonal seed orchard in East Java in 1999 and 2001 using cross- and open-pollinated trees. The rates of abortion using cross-pollinations showed a similar pattern but were lower than for open-pollinations. The highest rate of abortion in cross- and open-pollinations was during pollination and fertilization, ranging 11%-23% and 31%-32%/day, respectively, less during fruit initiation (5%-6% and 6%-8%/ day) and the lowest was during fruit maturation (<0.5%/day). Cross-pollinations increased fruit production by 10-fold compared with open-pollinations. About 30% of flowers were pollinated with an average of five pollen grains per stigma in open-pollinations. Pollen viability varied among clones and time of day but was not affected by position of flowers in an inflorescence.

Plants in specialized pollination systems might be especially vulnerable to changes in plant population size and density resulting from land-use changes. Representing such a system, we chose the globeflower Trollius europaeus L. with its pollinating fly Chiastocheta, which also acts as a seed predator at its larval stage, to investigate the effects of small plant population size on reproductive success and pollinator abundance. Reproductive output of T. europaeus declined with increasing plant population size, while Chiastocheta abundance within T. europaeus flowers was independent of plant population size. However, at the local level, Chiastocheta numbers within flowers were inversely correlated to local T. europaeus flower density. We further found that increasing floral densities increased plant reproductive success at the population level. Chiastocheta abundance was the main driver of reproductive output of T. europaeus through its dual role as an obligate pollinator and seed predator: at least some Chiastocheta flies were needed to secure pollination, but a continued increase in Chiastocheta flies within a flower incurred seed predation costs that greatly reduced reproductive success. Thus, high local flower density contributed positively to per capita reproductive output by diluting Chiastocheta abundance within flowers independently of overall population size. Synthesis. Our findings highlight that plant population size is not always the main determinant of reproductive success for populations, but that other factors such as plant density and the specific ecology of a pollinator and its interplay with other population parameters can be more important in determining the fate of a population. Furthermore, the effects of plant population size and floral density on pollinator visitation in T. europaeus vary across scales, with implications for plant fitness. It is therefore important not to focus solely on pure plant population size in determining population viability.

Sexual deception is currently known only from the Orchidaceae and almost always involves pollination by male hymenoptera. An outstanding problem has been to identify the selective factors in plants that favor exploitation of mating versus feeding behaviors in pollinators. Here we show that the insectlike petal ornaments on inflorescences of the daisy Gorteria diffusa elicit copulation attempts from male bombyliid flies and that the intensity of the mating response varies across geographical floral morphotypes suggesting a continuum in reliance on feeding through mating responses for pollination. Using pollen analogues applied to a morphotype with prominent insectlike petal ornaments we demonstrate that mate-seeking male flies are severalfold more active and export significantly more pollen than females. These results suggest that selection for traits that exploit insectmating behavior can occur through the male component of plant fitness and conclusively demonstrates pollination by sexual deception in Gorteria making this the first confirmed report of sexual deception outside of the Orchidaceae. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.,Gorteria diffusa; Male function; Pollination; Pseudocopulation; Sensory bias; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78349282612

We documented selection through female function on floral traits in two populations of the rewarding orchid Gymnadenia conopsea in two years and quantified pollinator-mediated selection (??poll) by subtracting estimates of selection gradients for plants receiving supplemental hand pollination from estimates obtained for open-pollinated control plants. There was directional selection for taller plants, more flowers, larger corollas, and longer spurs in the study populations. Pollinator-mediated selection ranged from weak to moderately strong (??poll, range -0.01-0.21, median 0.08). All observed selection on spur length could be attributed to interactions with pollinators, while the proportion of observed selection on plant height (0%-77%), number of flowers (13%-42%), and corolla size (13%-97%) caused by pollinators varied among populations and years. Our results demonstrate that pollinators can mediate selection on both traits likely to be involved in pollinator attraction and traits affecting pollination efficiency. They further show that spatiotemporal variation in the strength of pollinator-mediated selection can contribute substantially to differences in selection between years and populations. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Female fitness; Natural selection; Plant-animal interactions; Pollen limitation; Selection gradients; Spatiotemporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650162152

Here we report the results of a field study of physiological and fitness-related traits in geographically proximate sister taxa in the annual wildflower genus Clarkia (Onagraceae) and interpret the differences between them in light of their ecological and reproductive differences. Within two pairs of taxa, the predominantly autogamous (self-fertilizing) taxon flowers and completes its life cycle before its pollinatordependent (predominantly outcrossing) counterpart growing in sympatry or at similar elevations in the southern Sierra Nevada. Selfers generally exhibited higher rates of photosynthesis and transpiration than their outcrossing sister taxa, and, except for the earliest-flowering (autogamous) taxon, both photosynthetic and transpiration rates tended to decline as the season progressed. Within taxa, high photosynthetic rates were positively correlated with lifetime fruit production, and selfers had lifetime fruit production equivalent to or higher than that of outcrossers, despite the fact that the latter had higher aboveground stem biomass. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that natural selection has favored higher gas exchange rates in selfers to allow them to achieve their faster life cycles and so escape seasonal late-spring drought. An alternative explanation is that the differences in gas exchange rates represent environmentally induced plastic responses to the cooler temperatures and higher soil moisture content in early spring. Further experimental work is necessary to distinguish between these hypotheses. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Clarkia; Comparative physiology; Life-history evolution; Mating system; Photosynthesis; Transpiration; Water use efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650119339

These two hypotheses were tested in an aquatic monocot Butomus umbellatus (Butomaceae) with a pink or white gynoecium in the field population. Methods: Pollinator visitation was compared in experimental arrays of equivalent flowering cymes from both colour morphs. Seed set was compared between inter- and intramorph pollination under different water levels to test the effect of fluctuating environment on seed fertility. Key Results: Overall, the major pollinator groups did not discriminate between colour morphs. Compared with the white morph, seed production in the pink morph under intermorph, intramorph and open pollination treatments was significantly higher when the water level was low but not when it was high. Precipitation in July was correlated with yearly seed production in the pink morph but not in the white morph. Conclusions: The results indicated that the two colour morphs differed in their tolerance to water level. Our study on this aquatic plant provides additional evidence to support the hypothesis that flower colour polymorphism can be preserved by environmental heterogeneity. © 2010 The Author.

South American Myrtaceae (Myrteae) were chosen to evaluate hypotheses on how abiotic and biotic factors, morphology and phylogeny influence plant reproductive phenology. We examined whether Myrteae reproductive patterns are seasonal and related to climate; whether aggregated or segregated flowering and fruiting occur among species sharing pollinators or seed dispersers; the relationship between phenological and morphological traits, time of reproduction and Myrteae phylogenetic history; and the shared influence of ecological (environmental) and phylogenetic factors on Myrteae reproductive patterns. We observed flowering and fruiting of 34 Myrteae species during 30 months in an Atlantic rain forest (south-eastern Brazil). We employed circular statistics to test for seasonality and multiple regressions to relate climate and phenology. Competition and facilitation hypotheses were tested using null models. We quantified the phylogenetic signal on phenology and morphology of Myrteae species using phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) analyses, and used PVR and partial regressions to quantify the influences of ecology and phylogeny on phenology. Myrteae flowered seasonally, whereas fruiting was not seasonal. Environmental factors (day-length and temperature) and associations with biotic vectors through facilitation hypothesis explained the aggregated blossom. Fruit maturation time affected the species' flowering sequence. Plants with longer fruit maturation times flowered at the end of the appropriate season, explaining the continuous fruit availability despite the seasonal flowering. The random fruiting pattern explained the regular presence of seed dispersers. Myrteae phenology was phylogenetically structured, even when phenophases were not seasonal, i.e., closer related species fruited under more similar environmental conditions, suggesting that the reproductive phenological niche was inherited along the course of evolution. We detected a shared influence of ecology and phylogeny on Myrteae phenological responses, and the ecological component explained better phenological variation than phylogeny. Synthesis. We provided a new perspective on plant phenology based on phylogeny and ecology and demonstrated the importance of considering their shared influence in phenological studies. Our analyses can be employed for the most representative families of highly diverse ecosystems to improve our understanding of evolutionary patterns and general trends in phenology. © 2010 The Authors.

We examined the factors that can contribute to maintain high genetic diversity under this condition. We examined levels of allozyme variation and fine-scale genetic structure of Pilosocereus tillianus, a columnar cactus endemic to the Venezuelan Andes. Genetic diversity was considerably high compared to other species previously examined (species level: Ps = 100%, APs = 2.783, Hs = 0.352; population level: Pp = 97.8%, APp = 2.645, Hp = 0.350) levels. We propose three explanations for the levels of genetic variability detected: (1) poliploidy, (2) gene dispersal predominantly driven by bat and bird mediated pollination and seed dispersal, and (3) a vicariant speciation scenario, in which the current reduced geographic distribution of P. tillianus represents a relict of a former widespread species. High genetic variability in spatially restricted columnar cacti is emerging as a common condition between members of this family. Under the current scenario of habitat fragmentation in dry ecosystems in the Neotropics, cactus species with this trait can be more resilient to genetic erosion than expected according to their limited geographic distribution. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Clonal reproduction; Columnar cacti; Endemism; Genetic structure; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956227621

Second-year height growth of 10 geographically marginal populations of Patagonian cypress (Austrocedrus chilensis (D. Don) Pic. Ser. et Bizzarri) (Cupressaceae) was characterized under greenhouse conditions. Variation among and within an average of 15 open-pollinated families (comprising 21 seedlings per family) for each population was analysed for six size and timing traits obtained from fitted Boltzmann growth curves. The among-family and among-population variances were 4.03% and 2.74% of the total phenotypic variation, while the residual variance was 84.57% on average. Genetic differentiation among populations was low, except for the maximum growth rate (QST = 0.35) and for growth initiation (QST = 1). For most traits, genetic variation and heritability were variable across populations, except for growth initiation, which showed in general null intra-population levels of genetic variance. Although no direct associations were found between the additive genetic variation and latitude or altitude, the north range of the distribution was more variable for the pool of the analysed traits. Although most extreme-marginal populations of A. chilensis would be very limited in their ability to evolve if climate in north-west Patagonia turns drier and warmer, their long-term persistence could largely rely on a phenotypic diversification strategy. © 2010 The Authors.

Here, we use molecular genetic methods in an ecological context to demonstrate that endemic Hawaiian Hylaeus bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) selectively collect pollen from native plant species in Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes National Parks. We identified pollen DNA from the crops (internal storage organs) of 21 Hylaeus specimens stored in ethanol for up to 3 years. Genetic analyses reveal high fidelity in pollen foraging despite the availability of pollen from multiple plant species present at each study site. At high elevations in Haleakala, pollen was available from more than 12 species of flowering plants, but Hawaiian silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) comprised 86% of all pollen samples removed from bee crops. At lower elevations in both parks, we only detected pukiawe (Leptecophylla (Styphelia) tameiameiae) pollen in Hylaeus crops despite the presence of other plant species in flower during our study. Furthermore, 100% of Hylaeus crops from which we successfully identified pollen contained native plant pollen. The molecular approaches developed in this study provide species-level information about floral visitation of Hawaiian Hylaeus that does not require specialized palynological expertise needed for high-throughput visual pollen identification. Building upon this approach, future studies can thus develop appropriate and customized criteria for assessing mixed pollen loads from a broader range of sources and from other global regions. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",floral fidelity; foraging ecology; Hylaeus; native pollinators; pollination; silversword,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149428035

We suggest some questions of interest in plants in the genus Silene, where the evolution of unisexuals has occurred multiple times and related species suitable for use as outgroups in such comparisons are available. In the dioecious species Silene latifolia, the evolution of separate sexes raises many questions about selection, including the possibility of recent selective sweeps on the Y or other chromosomes. If recent selective sweeps have not occurred on the Y chromosome, one might be able to conclude that the low sequence diversity that is observed for Y-linked genes may be due to processes involved in genetic degeneration of Y chromosomes. In a dioecious species, it is also interesting to test whether sexual selection occurs (a question that has been difficult to study in plants and which could affect the effective population sizes of genes on the X and Y chromosomes and on the autosomes, which must be taken into account when testing for selection), and also whether selection occurs during pollination. Silene latifolia is also useful for testing selection in other Silene species, and we outline tests for long-term balancing selection in the mitochondrial genome associated with the presence of females in the gynodioecious species Silene vulgaris.

Understanding the networks that form the systems is of growing importance, e.g. to understand how species will respond to climate change, or to predict potential knock-on effects of a biological control agent. In recent years, a variety of summary statistics for characterising the global and local properties of such networks have been derived, which provide a measure for gauging the accuracy of a mathematical model for network formation processes. However, the critical underlying assumption is that the true network is known. This is not a straightforward task to accomplish, and typically requires minute observations and detailed field work. More importantly, knowledge about species interactions is restricted to specific kinds of interactions. For instance, while the interactions between pollinators and their host plants are amenable to direct observation, other types of species interactions, like those mentioned above, are not, and might not even be clearly defined from the outset. To discover information about complex ecological systems efficiently, new tools for inferring the structure of networks from field data are needed. In the present study, we investigate the viability of various statistical and machine learning methods recently applied in molecular systems biology: graphical Gaussian models, L1-regularised regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), sparse Bayesian regression and Bayesian networks. We have assessed the performance of these methods on data simulated from food webs of known structure, where we combined a niche model with a stochastic population model in a 2-dimensional lattice. We assessed the network reconstruction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which was typically in the range between 0.75 and 0.9, corresponding to the recovery of about 60% of the true species interactions at a false prediction rate of 5%. We also applied the models to presence/absence data for 39 European warblers, and found that the inferred species interactions showed a weak yet significant correlation with phylogenetic similarity scores, which tended to weakly increase when including bio-climate covariates and allowing for spatial autocorrelation. Our findings demonstrate that relevant patterns in ecological networks can be identified from large-scale spatial data sets with machine learning methods, and that these methods have the potential to contribute novel important tools for gaining deeper insight into the structure and stability of ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Bio-climate envelope; Biotic interaction; Network reconstruction; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957669092

The effects of extreme climatic conditions, such as increased inter-annual variability of rainfall and reduced rainfall, can be the limiting factors for pollen production and pollination patterns. We explore the effect that seasonal and inter-annual variation in climatic patterns (emphasizing the alteration of rainfall regimes) exert on pollination pattern in six anemophilous taxa located in the semi-arid area of Almería (SE Spain), which is considered to be one of the areas with the highest aridity index in Europe. The sampling in a temporal series of 8 years (1998-2005) showed the pulsed and discrete rainfall events interspersed with drought periods are closely related to the alteration of the pollination in certain species. This is manifested in: (i) delayed onset of flowering until reaching the minimum threshold of soil water, in the case of some annual plants (Plantago, Rumex, and Poaceae), or (ii) scant variability both in the flowering period in plants with drought tolerance (Chenopodiaceae and Artemisia) or plants often linked to soil-moisture availability (Urticaceae). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Airborne pollen; Herbaceous/shrub taxa; Pollen production; Pollination period; Semi-arid Mediterranean habitats; Water stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956227528

In addition, pollinator visitation rates and fruit set were determined in intact inflorescences and those with sterile flowers removed. The results indicate that sterile and fertile flowers were developmentally similar during early developmental stages, and that development of the flower types diverged about 15days before flowering. In addition, pollinator visitation rates, number of pollen grains on stigmas and fruit set were significantly higher in inflorescences with sterile flowers than those without sterile flowers. The results suggest that sterile flowers of this species evolved from fertile flowers under long-term selective pressure, and play a crucial role in enhancing reproductive success through effectively attracting pollinators to the plant and thus enhancing fruit set. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Fruit set; Pollinator attraction; Reproductive success; Sterile flowers; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952199843

The data revealed that, 13 genera belonging to nine trees (8 families) and four shrubs (4 families) provided the nesting platform to A. florea. The density, abundance, and frequency of nesting plants varied considerably. While Pongamia pinnata was selected frequently among the trees, Bouganvillea sp. was preferred among the shrubs for nesting. There was a significant variation (X2 = 18.25; P&lt;0.05) among the tree and shrub species selected for nesting by A. florea in different habitats. Further, thin to medium (2-4 inch dia.) sized limbs, often interspersed thickly at different elevations in trees and shrubby plants were found suitable for the construction of colonies. The combs were found at the peripheral and middle regions of thickly interspersed canopy in trees and shrubs respectively, possibly to ensure withstanding the comb weight, protecting the comb from wind blow, and avoiding predation and hunting. Thus, it appears that A. florea adopts elite strategy to safeguard its colonies from certain ecological and biological impediments in the wild by choosing plants with thick interspersed limbs covered with thick canopy. In view of its role as an important pollinating agent of many crops, the preservation of the commonly chosen nesting plants becomes all the more important for conservation of A. florea. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",A. florea; India; nesting trees; tropical conditions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649363856

However the data on how gene-flow changes following habitat fragmentation is contradictory. If there is significant gene-flow between spatially isolated populations then limited conservation resources could be directed away from projects to 'establish genetic connectivity' and used to address other consequences of habitat fragmentation.This research focused on an endangered tree species Gomortega keule (Gomortegaceae) in a fragmented landscape in the Central Chile Biodiversity Hotspot and addressed three questions: (1) How far does pollen move between pollen donors and seed trees and what is the shape of the dispersal curve? (2) Do insect pollinators travel outside of forest patches? (3) Do small populations and single trees contribute to genetic connectivity across the landscape?Paternity analysis results show that G. keule's insect pollinators travel outside of forest patches, over distances of 6. km, beyond the scale of population fragmentation or genetic structure. Pollen moved from small sites and single trees into large sites, as well as in the other direction, indicating these sites play a key role as functioning elements of the wider population and as stepping stones between sites. Fragmentation at the scale investigated has not led to genetic isolation, thus genetic connectivity per se is not a conservation priority. Other consequences of land-use change, specifically continuing habitat loss and population reduction, still threaten the survival of the species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Fragmentation; Gomortega.; Isolation; Landscape connectivity; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956877679

This variation can have strong fitness consequences, with reproductive success being associated with specific corolla shapes. Corolla shape seems to act in E. mediohispanicum as an honest signal, since it is associated with reward (nectar and pollen) and determines the preference pattern of important pollinators. Finally, since pollinator fauna varies geographically in this generalist plant species, we have detected a geographic mosaic of selection on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape in southeastern Spain that has resulted in a pattern of local adaptation.We hope that this review will encourage other evolutionary biologists to explore corolla shape microevolution, helping to unravel Darwin's ""abominable mystery"". © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Corolla shape; Erysimum mediohispanicum; Geographic mosaic of selection; Local adaptation; Pollinator-mediated selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650165972

We investigated whether populations from locations that differ in moisture availability, known to vary for whole-plant development rate, also varied in the timing of autonomous selfing. This timing is of interest because the modes of selfing (prior, competing, and delayed) have different fitness consequences. Methods: We measured timing of anther dehiscence, stigma receptivity, and herkogamy under pollinator-free conditions for plants from three populations of Collinsia parvifl ora that differed in annual precipitation, flower size, and time to sexual maturity. Using a manipulative experiment, we determined potential seed production via prior, competing, and delayed autonomous selfing for each population. Key results: Stigma receptivity, anther dehiscence, and selfing ability covaried with whole-plant development and climate. Plants from the driest site, which reached sexual maturity earliest, had receptive stigmas and dehiscent anthers in bud. Most seeds were produced via prior selfing. The population from the wettest site with slowest development was not receptive until after flowers opened. Although competing selfing was possible, all selfing was delayed. The intermediate population was between these extremes, with significant contributions from both competing and delayed selfing. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that within-species variation in the timing of selfing occurs and is related to both environmental conditions and whole-plant development rates. We suggest that, if these results can be generalized to other species, mating systems may evolve in response to ongoing climatic change. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Climate; Collinsia parviflora; Delayed selfing; Flower morphology; Phenology; Plantaginaceae; Prior selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249253018

However, the success of microbiological control agents (MCAs) largely depends on efficient dissemination into the crop. The pollinator-and-vector technology employs pollinating insects like bees for a better dissemination. In this study, a new dispenser for bumblebee workers of Bombus terrestris L. was developed. Binab-T-vector and Prestop-Mix were used as two typical MCA products for dissemination.RESULTS: In a first series of experiments in the laboratory for optimisation, the newly developed dispenser was a two-way type dispenser, 20 cm long, with two rectangular compartments and different entrance and exit holes. In addition, the amounts of MCA loaded on the workers were 10 times higher with the new dispenser as compared with the side-by-side passageway (SSP) dispenser. Typically, the highest amounts were recovered from the thorax and legs of the workers. In a second series of experiments under greenhouse conditions with the use of queen-right B. terrestris hives, successful dissemination in strawberry flowers was obtained at different distances from the hive (0-8 m, 8-18 m and 18-21 m), and the workers inoculated the first, second and third flowers that were consecutively visited. In addition, the new dispenser caused no adverse effects on worker foraging intensity, whereas a dramatic reduction was scored with an SSP dispenser. Finally, the data suggested that it is necessary to refill the newly developed dispenser at 3 day intervals.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, with the use of the newly developed dispenser, bumblebee workers carried high amounts of MCA, and this resulted in a successful dissemination of MCA into strawberry flowers. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.",Biological control; Botrytis cinerea; Bumblebees; Dispenser; Microbiological control agents; Pollinator-and-vector; Strawberry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958449107

The goal of our study was to assess potential effects of CCRI41 cotton pollen on visual and olfactory learning by honey bees. After a 7-day oral chronic exposure to honey mixed with either CCRI41 pollen, imidaclopridtreated conventional pollen (used as positive sublethal control) or conventional pollen (control), learning performance was evaluated by the classical proboscis extension reflex (PER) procedure as well as a T-tube maze test.

However, exposure to imidacloprid resulted in reduced visual learning capacities in T-tube maze evaluation and decreased olfactory learning performances measured with PER.

However, in crosses between wheat and distantly related species such as maize (Zea mays) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), non-wheat chromosomes are often eliminated from the hybrid during embryogenesis. In this study, we used pearl millet pollen to pollinate the pistils of a range of plants in the tribe Triticeae, as well as oat. Seven days after pollination, the dynamics of the pearl millet chromosomes in the embryos were observed using in situ hybridization, probing both the pearl millet genomic DNA and its centromere-specific repeats. In embryos from the crosses with oat, all seven of the pearl millet chromosomes were retained. However, in hybrids with the Triticeae species, chromosome elimination occurred during embryogenesis. Pearl millet chromosome showed chromosome rearrangements and non-disjunction together with micronuclei.

However, selection is typically measured for the female component only, and when selection through male function is measured, it is usually done only in terms of pollen removal from flowers. We tested whether selection on floral spur length might differ between genders in the orchid Satyrium longicauda by measuring the effect of spur length manipulations on pollen receipt and export of color-labeled pollen to conspecific stigmas. This was done in two populations with different pollinator faunas to determine whether pollinator context influenced the relationship between spur length and gender-specific fitness components. In one population, spur length manipulation had opposite effects on sex functions, while in the other, both pollen export and receipt were reduced by spur shortening. Furthermore, measures of male function through pollen removal and pollen export did not always correspond. These results suggest that selection on floral spur length can differ between genders and that this gender bias may be affected by the pollinator context. Furthermore, interpretation of selection through male function based only on pollen removal can lead to erroneous conclusions. The context dependence of gender differences in selection could be an important factor generating geographically structured divergence in floral traits and, ultimately, speciation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Gender-specific selection; Nectar spur; Pollination ecotype; Satyrium; Sexual selection; South Africa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650107191

Gene flow is expected to alleviate the burden of deleterious mutations in such populations. The beneficial effects of outcrossing may, however, depend on life history characteristics such as the species' breeding system. Frequent selfing is expected to purge (sub)lethal alleles and mitigate inbreeding depression, at least if the load of mildly deleterious mutations has not accumulated through genetic drift in populations with a small effective size. Gene-inflow from distant source populations can cause outbreeding depression due to genomic incompatibilities. We tested these predictions using highly fragmented populations of the self-compatible forest herb Geum urbanum. Assessment of mating system parameters using microsatellite markers inferred high selfing rates (92.5%), confirming the predominantly self-fertilizing character of the study species. We conducted experimental pollinations with self and outcross pollen collected from populations at different distances from the target populations. There were no significant signs of inbreeding depression, even in very small target populations. Except for a minor negative effect on the germination rate for the long-distance crosses, we found no effects of outbreeding on fitness estimates. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Autogamy; Forest herb; Fragmentation; Inbreeding; Outbreeding; Population size; Self-pollinating; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650026022

Floral guides - conspicuous colour markings, or structural features of flower corollas - have been shown to be important in the inspecting behaviour of many insects, particularly in diurnal species. For the nocturnal hawkmoth Manduca sexta tactile input has an important role in flower inspection, but there is no knowledge about the use of visual floral guides in this behaviour. I carried out a series of experiments to first, evaluate the putative role of floral guides during flower inspection and second, to explore how simultaneous tactile and visual guides could influence this behaviour. Results show that visual floral guides affect flower inspection by M. sexta. Moths confine proboscis placement to areas of higher light reflectance regardless of their chromaticity, but do not appear to show movements in any particular direction within these areas. I also recorded inspection times, finding that moths can learn to inspect flowers more efficiently when visual floral guides are available. Additionally, I found that some visual floral guides can affect the body orientation that moths adopt while hovering in front of horizontal models. Finally, when presented with flower models offering both visual and tactile guides, the former influenced proboscis placement, whereas the latter controlled proboscis movements. Results show that innate inspection behaviour is under multimodal sensory control, consistent with other components of the foraging task. Fine scale inspection movements (elicited by diverse floral traits) and the tight adjustment between the morphology of pollinators and flowers appear to be adaptively integrated, facilitating reward assessment and effective pollen transfer. © 2010 The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Flower handling; Lepidoptera; Mechanoreception; Nectar guides; Pollinator; Sensory ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149336349

In addition, figs are parasitized by a suite of non-mutualistic wasps whose basic ecology is largely undescribed. Sycophilomorpha (subfamily Epichrysomallinae) fig wasps are ovule gallers and the genus contains only 1 described species. An undescribed Sycophilomorpha species parasitized Ficus altissima at Xishuangbana, Southwestern China. The wasp was observed ovipositing on the tiny immature figs that were still concealed beneath the involucral bracts. A Sycophilomorpha wasp oviposited on more than 1 fig and spent long time-periods to lay large clutches on a single fig. The wasps naturally occurred on all 7 sampled trees, but the occurrence of wasps was significantly different among trees, crops and months. These wasps were able to prevent unpollinated figs from being aborted, and their offspring were able to develop in the figs that otherwise had no pollinator wasps or seeds. The Sycophilomorpha wasp had a detrimental effect on the fig-fig wasp mutualism. Figs in which Sycophilomorpha wasps were present, produced significantly fewer seeds, pollinators and cheaters. However, the abundance of Sycophilomorpha in a fig was only significantly negatively correlated with pollinator production and not seed or cheater production. Our study illustrates a previously unknown fig wasp niche and expands our understanding of factors that can affect the fig-fig wasp interaction. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",coevolution; galler; mutualisim; parasitism; syconia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650620550

In japanese plum (Prunus salicina), some genetic crosses made by emasculation have resulted in very low or lack of fruit set, but the causes leading to this situation are not clear. In this work, the influence of flower emasculation on fruit set was evaluated in four japanese plum-type cultivars by comparing cross-pollinations performed with and without emasculation. Fruit set and fruit drop in the crosses were characterized until harvest. To ascertain which factors in the reproductive process could be related to the lack of fruit set, compatibility was determined for each cross by the observation of pollen tube growth under the microscope and by polymerase chain reaction. Likewise, the stage of ovule development was observed under the microscope in emasculated and non-emasculated flowers. An analysis of the different pollination treatments and the study of the compatibility relationships helped to dismiss factors that intervene in the reproductive process and to identify flower emasculation as the cause of premature degeneration of ovules and its implication in determining subsequent fruit set.",Cross-incompatibility; Ovule degeneration; Pollen tube growth; Pollination; Prunus salicina; S-RNase alleles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649585843

This three-way interaction raises the possibility of conflict between pollinators and seed dispersers over fig resources. The conflict might be mediated in dioecious figs by the segregation of inflorescences with specialized male and female sexual functions, termed gall figs and seed figs, on separate trees. In dioecious figs, pollinators are intimately associated with gall figs, whereas vertebrate frugivores prefer seed figs and disperse the seeds they contain. Optimal foraging theory predicts that frugivore preference for ripe seed figs is associated with superior nutritional quality when compared to gall figs. We tested this prediction comparing nutrient and mineral properties of ripe figs in 12 functionally dioecious and two monoecious species from New Guinea. Analyses of variance indicated that gall figs contain more fiber and minerals, whereas seed figs contain significantly more carbohydrates and fat. Fruit bats, the primary dispersers of dioecious figs in New Guinea, prefer carbohydrate-rich diets, and from this perspective, seed figs offer a greater nutritional reward than gall figs. More nondigestible fiber in gall figs than seed figs would appear to discourage frugivory. Parallel differences between ripe gall figs and seed figs occur in each independent dioecious lineage whereas nutritional content in monoecious figs is more similar to seed figs. This suggests that sexual dimorphism in nutritional quality might be adaptive and associated with the maintenance of functional dioecy in figs. © 2010 The Author(s).

According to the dynamics of the resource reserve of individuals, reproductive investment is the proportion of investment in flowers with coefficient k. If k evolves to sufficiently large values, trees show a large between-year fluctuation in the seed crop even in a constant environment (masting). Our assumptions are: the forest consists of many sites, each occupied by a single canopy tree. After a canopy tree falls, the vacant site (gap) becomes available for recruitment. Masting never evolves if all vacant sites are filled by individuals from seeds produced in the same year, despite the fact that trees reproducing intermittently enjoy a higher pollination success than trees reproducing annually. Masting can evolve if some seedlings survive for several years, forming a seedling bank on the forest floor, where seeds produced in different years compete for gap acquisition. In this case, the disadvantage of intermittent reproduction is compensated for by seedlings and the benefit of pollen limitation dominates. We also study the effect of specialist seed predators. In the complete absence of seed bank or seeding bank, masting never evolves even in the presence of seed predators. If some seedlings survive for multiple years, seed predators can promote the evolution of masting. Synthesis. Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of masting. However, the presence of seed predators can work only when some seedlings can survive more than 1 year. The regeneration process of forests must be considered when the evolution of the reproduction of plants is discussed. © 2010 The Authors.

However, no information is available on whether it can also shape the functioning of mycorrhizal symbiosis. Methods: The mycorrhizal growth response was assessed for three angiosperms with intraspecifi c ploidy variation. Different cytotypes of Aster amellus, Campanula gentilis, and Pimpinella saxifraga were either left uninoculated or were inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a pot experiment. After 3 mo of cultivation in a greenhouse, plant growth, phosphorus concentration in the shoot biomass, and development of the AM symbiosis were evaluated. Key results: No signifi cant ploidy-specifi c differences in AM development were recorded. The inoculation led to consistently greater phosphorus uptake; however, the effect on plant growth differed considerably among plant species, populations, ploidy levels, and AM species. A salient ploidy-specifi c response was observed in A. amellus. Whereas diploid plants benefi ted from AM inoculation, the hexaploids consistently showed negative or no-growth responses (depending on the AM species). In contrast to A. amellus, no interactions between inoculation and ploidy were observed in C gentilis and P. saxifraga. Conclusions: The fi rst evidence is provided of a ploidy-specifi c response of a mycotrophic plant to AM fungi. Our results demonstrate the complexity of interaction between plants and associated AM fungi, with the ploidy level of the host plant being one component that may modulate the functioning of the symbiosis.",Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis; Genome multiplication; Mycorrhizal growth response; Phosphorus uptake; Polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249289397

Vriesea gigantea is a bromeliad from southeastern Brazil which is self-compatible and pollinator dependent for fruit set. Its populations are fertile in terms of the production of flowers, pollen, fruits and seeds. To assess the importance of seed supply for gene flow, colonization and distribution of adult individuals, the seed dispersal and population structure of V. gigantea were studied. Seeds are dispersed over short distances; most seeds land close to the mother plant. This pattern coincides with the reported aggregate distribution of bromeliad seedlings. Population structure results showed high seedling recruitment, because 51.3% developed into adults, although few juveniles reached this stage. This result is different from that for other bromeliad species from different habitat conditions. Seed dispersal and population structural patterns are consistent with previous molecular studies, revealing that V. gigantea populations are genetically structured, with low gene flow and a moderate outcrossing rate. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2010, 164, 317-325.",Bromeliaceae; Conservation; Epiphytes; Gene flow; Genetic structure; Mating system; Seed recruitment; Tillandsioideae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049465745

The X-FAs comprised oleic acid (O) as well as unusual FAs, viz. hexadecenoic (H), palmitolinoleic (Pl), and cis-vaccenic acid (V). During mesocarp growth, the number of X-TAG species decreased dramatically as a result of their metabolism, but their proportion in the total TAGs remained constant. H-TAGs predominating in the oil were similar to total TAGs in their composition and the pattern of their dynamics during maturation. As regards minor Pl-TAGs, there was a tendency for an increase in the level of species including palmitolinoleic acid in the middle (sn-2) position of their molecules. Throughout the entire process of fruit maturation, oleic acid was by 98.0-98.8% concentrated in the sn-2 position of O-TAGs. At the same time, cis-vaccenic acid, a ?11-positional isomer of oleic acid, was predominantly incorporated in the side positions of V-TAGs, and its 98.1% concentration in these positions was achieved only by the 105th DAP. A virtually absolute selectivity of the distribution of oleic and cis-vaccenic acids in TAGs was found here for the first time. Discussed are the possible physicochemical and biochemical factors of a highly selective incorporation of these FAs in the sea buckthorn TAGs, the pathways of enzymatic biosynthesis of O- and V-TAGs, the metabolic role of discrimination of incorporation of some FA species in the glycerol residue of glycerolipids, and the causes for the disappearance of some TAG species during maturation. © 2010 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",Hippophaë rhamnoides; maturation; mesocarp; pathways of biosynthesis; triacylglycerols; unusual fatty acids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149474836

The female gametophyte not only regulates these steps but also controls the subsequent initiation of seed development. Previously, we reported that loss of LORELEI, which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, in the female reproductive tissues causes a delay in initiation of seed development. From these studies, however, it was unclear if embryos derived from fertilization of lre-5 gametophytes continued to lag behind wild type during seed development. Additionally, it was not determined if the delay in initiation of seed development had any lingering effects during seed germination. Finally, it was not known if loss of LORELEI function affects seedling development given that LORELEI is expressed in eight-day-old seedlings. Here, we showed that despite a delay in initiation, lre-5/lre-5 embryos recover, becoming equivalent to the developing wild-type embryos beginning at 72 hours after pollination.

Sixteen seeds were harvested from triploid plants and two seedlings were confirmed to be hexaploids with 54 chromosomes. Pollen viability increased from 13% in triploids to a maximum of 49% in hexaploids. Petal length increased from 1.3 cm (triploid) to 1.9 cm and 1.8 cm in the two hexaploids and longest stamen length increased from 0.9 cm (triploid) to 1.1 cm in the hexaploids.

Phylogenetic approaches to locating the most appropriate speciation models have been constrained by the low levels of molecular divergence between recently diverged species, which are typical of recent, rapid radiations. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Rymer et al. (2010) used coalescence analyses of sequence data and genome scans of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) loci to demonstrate that in a species complex in the irid genus Gladiolus, a member of the hyper diverse Cape flora of southern Africa, speciation is a gradual process. Older divergences are genetically more differentiated, and show a greater difference in flowering time and floral morphology, than taxa that diverged more recently. There is no evidence of any abrupt events. Gene flow is limited by shifts in flowering time and floral morphology; thus, by pre-zygotic rather than by post-zygotic mechanisms, these evolved together with the occupation of somewhat different habitats. This research gives the first critical insight into how the remarkable diversity in a diversity hotspot could have arisen. More importantly, it demonstrates that the speciation process in recent, rapid radiations is tractable and can be investigated with suitable genetic tools. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",macroevolution; population ecology; speciation; systematics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149420548

The prevalence of allergy to Platanus is currently moderate, although the percentage of monosensitized patients is low. This hinders accurate interpretation of the relationship between the amount of pollen inhaled and the patient's symptoms. Objective: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the atmospheric concentration pattern of Pla a 1 aeroallergen and the Platanus pollen. Methods: The pollen sampling was carried out using a Hirst-type volumetric trap (Burkard©) for pollen grains and a Burkard Cyclone sampler (Burkard©) for Pla a 1 allergen. Serums-pecific IgE levels to Acer sp., Artemisia vulgaris, Betula alba, Chenopodium album, Cupressus arizonica, Cynodon dactylon, Fraxinus excelsior, Lolium perenne, Pinus sp., Plantago lanceolata, Platanus acerifolia, Populus sp., Quercus ilex and Taraxacum officinale allergens were determined using the EAST System (Hytec specific IgE EIA kit; Hycor Biomedical, Kassel, Germany). Results: The aerobiological dynamics of Platanus pollen grains and Pla a 1 differed considerably, particularly during the Platanus pollination period. Of the 118 subjects tested, sera from 34 contained specific IgE to Platanus pollen and all of them had specific IgE to other pollen types. Conclusions: The presence of the aeroallergen Pla a 1 in the atmosphere appears to be independent of Platanus pollen counts over the same period, which may be contributing to allergic symptoms and sensitization. The number of polysensitized patients displaying allergy to Platanus suggested that allergic symptoms were caused by co-sensitization or cross-reactivity involving a number of allergenic particles. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Aeroallergens; Pla a 1; Plane; Pollen; Pollinosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649422088

Data collected were silking date, ear moisture at four 7-d intervals starting 45 d after pollination, harvest moisture, test weight, and grain yield. Results showed significant genotype × environment interaction for most traits including AUDDC. However, AUDDC had the largest broad-sense heritability (H) among traits (0.84), suggesting it can be effectively utilized to identify faster drier inbred lines and hybrids. Strong correlations were found between AUDDC and silking date, AUD and moisture content at physiological maturity, and AUDDC and harvest moisture.

Patterns of negative covariation among species are typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species in a particular site. However, the outcome of species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site. We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregation and aggregation. We next screened each algorithm-index combination with the random and structured matrices to determine which tests had low Type I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached. Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregation and aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted data sets. More than 80% of the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant-pollinator data sets). These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Abundance matrix; Biogeography; Co-occurrence; Covariation; Null model; Passive sampling; Statistical test,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249245126

More specifically, floral morphological evolution is interpreted in a molecular phylogenetic context, the biogeographic history of the family is investigated, and the possibility of character displacement to have been operating in this family is assessed. Parsimony and Bayesian methods are used to estimate phylogeny and divergence times among Rafflesiaceae species based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data from Barkman et al. (2008) as well as new sequence data from additional samples and an additional genetic marker, the plastid 16S. Ancestral areas are inferred using dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) as well a more recently developed parametric likelihood method (LAGRANGE), now including an update that allows for estimation over the posterior distribution of dated trees. Our extended molecular phylogeny of Rafflesiaceae implies a general lack of morphological synapomorphies as well as a high level of morphological homoplasy. In particular, a high level of floral morphological homoplasy is detected among Rafflesia species suggestive of similar patterns of pollinator-based selection in different geographic areas, and multiple instances of divergent floral size evolution is consistent with a model of character displacement. Initial diversification of Rafflesiaceae during the Late Cretaceous was followed by a long period of no-net diversification, likely due to extinctions caused by a Late Eocene to Miocene dramatic reduction in rainforest cover. A Late Miocene to Early Pliocene rise in sea-level probably caused the vicariant diversification observed between areas of endemism. The most recent species divergences are concordant with Pleistocene changes in climate and sea-levels, but apparently with no successful inter-area migrations, supportive of savannah, rather than rainforest, covered landbridges. An explosive increase in net diversification rate, most pronounced in Rafflesia, may be explained by Mid-Miocene to Pliocene rainforest-favorable conditions as well as natural selection promoting character displacement for Rafflesia flower size. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",16S; Atp6; Bayesian inference; BEAST; Biogeographic history; Character displacement; DIVA; Homoplasy; ITS; LAGRANGE C++; MatR; Nad1 B-C intron; Philippines; Phylogeny; Rafflesia; Rafflesiaceae; Rhizanthes; Sapria; Southeast Asia; Sundaland,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049388980

A pollen-pistil compatibility system different from the previously described systems, Ga1-s and Tcb1-s, was identified among maize lines introgressed with chromosome segments from 2 teosinte populations. The pistil barrier is dominant, and pollen competence is determined by genotype of the individual pollen grain. A major gene governing this incompatibility behaves as a strong allele of ga2, a locus identified previously among maize genetic stocks on the basis of transmission ratio distortion. Additionally, pollen simultaneously carrying both ga2 and Ga2 was functional on Ga2 silks, which have the pistil barrier, indicating that Ga2 conditions acceptance of the pollen grain rather than ga2 conditioning rejection of the pollen grain by Ga2 silks. The strong allele (Ga2-s), a weaker one such as reported among maize genetic stocks (Ga2-w), and an allele having only pollen competence (Ga2-m), or some combination of these, was found in all 13 of the teosinte populations sampled. Sympatric and parapatric maize landraces carried Ga2-m or the presumed null allele ga2, but Ga2-s or Ga2-w was not found. The combination of exclusively Ga2-s teosinte with ga2 maize, which could provide strong reproductive isolation, was not characteristic of the 5, paired populations tested. © 2010 The American Genetic Association.

UI pollen rejection often follows the SI × SC rule, i.e. pistils of SI species reject the pollen of SC (self-compatible) species but not vice versa, suggesting that the SI and UI pollen rejection mechanisms may overlap. In order to address this question, pollen tube growth was measured after inter-specific crosses using wild tomato species as the female parents and pollen from cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Two modes of UI pollen rejection, early and late, were observed, and both differed from SI pollen rejection. The structure and expression of known stylar SI genes were evaluated. We found that S-RNase expression is not required for either the early or late mode of UI pollen rejection. However, two HT family genes, HT-A and HT-B, map to a UI QTL. Surprisingly, we found that a gene previously implicated in SI, HT-B, is mutated in both SI and SC S.habrochaites accessions, and no HT-B protein could be detected. HT-A genes were detected and expressed in all species examined, and may therefore function in both SI and UI. We conclude that there are significant differences between SI and UI in the tomato clade, in that pollen tube growth differs between these two rejection systems, and some stylar SI factors, including S-RNase and HT-B, are not required for UI. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",HT protein; Inter-specific; S-RNase; Self-incompatibility; Solanum; Unilateral incongruity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149431449

AGO9 preferentially interacts with 24 nucleotide (nt) small RNAs (sRNAs) derived from transposable elements (TEs), and its sporophytic activity is required to silence TEs in the female gametophyte. Here we show that AGO9 can bind in vitro to 24 nt sRNAs corresponding to Athila retrotransposons expressed in the ovule prior to pollination. We also show that AGO9 is necessary to inactivate a significant proportion of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) in the ovule, and that its predominant TE targets are located in the pericentromeric regions of all 5 chromosomes, suggesting a link between the AGO9-dependent sRNA pathway and heterochromatin formation.

Early vegetable breeders developed landrace cultivars by selection of favorable variations in horticultural traits, yield and resistance to diseases and other problems. Later new breeding methods were developed, including hybridization techniques, culminating with the use of recently developed molecular tools, all leading to our modern improved vegetable cultivars. Great emphasis on protection of cultivars by seed companies, including development of F1 hybrids, plant cultivar protection and patenting have been done. There were 392 vegetable crops cultivated worldwide but only slightly over one half of the total number of them have attracted commercial breeding attention. In recent times, there have been challenges and new trends in the breeding domain. These include an unrelenting movement away from well supported public breeding institutions to a breeding world dominated by private entities, and an increase in size of the companies in the private sector, with emphasis on the major vegetable crops. Almost half of the world vegetable farmers are poor and cannot afford to buy hybrid seed every growing season. Their economics and logistics make them difficult to buy expensive improved or hybrid cultivars since the lack of capital by subsistence farmers denies them the opportunity to invest in vegetable production inputs. If credit facilities and other input facilities are offered, improved or hybrid cultivars can have also a great impact on subsistence vegetable farmers overcoming their poverty and food insecurity. In last 50 years vegetable genetic resources are being lost, on a global scale at the rate of 1-2% per year. The multinational seed companies concentration in huge corporations have merged or canceled some vegetable breeding programs to reduce costs. Then there will be fewer vegetable breeders in the future and the growers will be dependent on a narrower genetic background, that could contribute in a near future, for food insecurity. Smaller seed companies, which are usually specialize in few vegetable crops, must be supported, possibly through autonomous affiliation with the larger companies. There is a need of investment in research breeding and cultivar development in traditionally open-pollinated cultivars and in the minor and so-called ""forgotten"" vegetables. More investments in this area will mean cheaper cultivars for growers to choose from and more preservation of vegetable biodiversity. In recent years, private plant breeding programs have increased in size and number. Financial investment also increased, as well as interest in intellectual property protection. Protective measures, especially patenting, must be moderated to eliminate coverage so broad that it stifles innovation. The intellectual property protection laws for plants must be made less restrictive to encourage research and free flow of materials and information. Public sector breeding must remains vigorous, especially in areas where the private sector does not function. This will often require benevolent public/private partnerships as well as government support. Intellectual property rights laws for plants must be made less restrictive to encourage freer flow of materials. Active and positive connections between the private and public breeding sectors and large-scale gene banks are required to avoid a possible conflict involving breeders' rights, gene preservation and erosion. Improved and hybrid vegetable cultivars are, and will continue to be, the most effective, environmentally safe, and sustainable way to ensure global food security in the future. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Breeding; Diversity; Horticulture; Hybrids; Malnutrition; Patenting; Poverty reduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049345442

CpTI cotton (CCRI41) is increasingly planted throughout China. However, negative effects of this cultivar on the honey bee Apis mellifera L., the most important pollinator for cultivated ecosystem, remained poorly investigated. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential side effects of transgenic Cry1Ac ? CpTI pollen from cotton on young adult honey bees A. mellifera L. Two points emphasized the significance of our study: (1) A higher expression level of insecticidal protein Cry1Ac in pollen tissues was detected (when compared with previous reports). In particular, Cry1Ac protein was detected at 300 ± 4.52 ng g -1 [part per billion (ppb)] in pollen collected in July, (2) Effects on chronic mortality and feeding behaviour in honey bees were evaluated using a no-choice dietary feeding protocol with treated pollen, which guarantee the highest exposure level to bees potentially occurring in natural conditions (worst case scenario). Tests were also conducted using imidacloprid-treated pollen at a concentration of 48 ppb as positive control for sublethal effect on feeding behaviour. Our results suggested that Cry1Ac ? CpTI pollen carried no lethal risk for honey bees. However, during a 7-day oral exposure to the various treatments (transgenic, imidacloprid- treated and control), honey bee feeding behaviour was disturbed and bees consumed significantly less CCRI41 cotton pollen than in the control group in which bees were exposed to conventional cotton pollen. It may indicate an antifeedant effect of CCRI41 pollen on honey bees and thus bees may be at risk because of large areas are planted with transgenic Bt cotton in China. This is the first report suggesting a potential sublethal effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of risk assessment for bees as well as for directions of future work involving risk assessment of CCRI41 cotton. © The Author(s) 2010.",ELISA; Feeding behaviour; Honey bees; Risk assessment; Transgenic cotton pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952279063

Through the development of a conceptual framework that examines how global environmental and inter-organizational conditions influence learning capabilities, the study investigates how relationship learning influences relationship value for both supplying and buying firms. Using a survey of 126 cross-border dyads in the industrial chemical, packaging, consumer durable, and apparel industries, the authors show how relationship learning is valued by both buyers and suppliers, and how it is critical when viewing the ""supplier as a customer."" The results indicate the strategic nature of relationship learning in maintaining cross-border business-to-business relationships.

Intimate synorganisation of many floral organs without fusion, as present in Geranium robertianum, is poorly known and needs to be studied. Obdiplostemony, the seemingly reversed position of two stamen whorls, widely distributed in core eudicots, has been the subject of much attention, but there is confusion in the literature. Obdiplostemony occurs in Geranium and whether and how it is involved in this synorganisation is explored here. Methods: Floral development and architecture were studied with light microscopy based on microtome section series and with scanning electron microscopy. Key Results: Intimate synorganisation of floral organs is effected by the formation of five separate nectar canals for the proboscis of pollinators. Each nectar canal is formed by six adjacent organs from four organ whorls. In addition, the sepals are hooked together by the formation of longitudinal ribs and grooves, and provide a firm scaffold for the canals. Obdiplostemony provides a guide rail within each canal formed by the flanks of the antepetalous stamen filaments. Conclusions: Intimate synorganisation in flowers can be realized without any fusion, and obdiplostemony may play a role in this synorganisation. © 2010 The Author.

We studied the effect of density on total and mature fruit set and pre-dispersal predation rates within individual tree canopies in a common canopy tree species, Jacaranda copaia in a 50-ha forest census plot in central Panama. We sampled all reproductive sized trees in the plot (n = 188) across three years and estimated fruit set and predation rates. Population-wide pre-dispersal seed predation averaged between 6-37% across years. Using linear mixed effects models, we found that increased density and fecundity of conspecific neighbours increased focal tree fruit set, but also the rate of pre-dispersal predation. An interaction between individual and neighbourhood fruit production predicted lower predation rates at high individual and neighbourhood fecundities, which suggests predator satiation at high fruit abundance levels. However, the rate at which fruit set increased with conspecific neighbour fruit production was greater than the rate at which fruit were lost to predation, resulting in an overall positive effect of neighbour density on mature fruit production in focal trees. Our results run counter to the expectation of a uniformly negative effect of density across all life stages in tropical trees and suggest further exploration of the role of spatial clumping, pollen dispersal limitation, and predation at pre-dispersal adult stages in maintenance of species diversity in plant communities. © 2010 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958476104

We conducted a nondestructive examination of the dynamics of silk emergence of tropical sweet maize (Zea mays L.); flint-type grains were the visual markers. The silks were pollinated on consecutive days with pollen of sweet maize (recessive allele) on 6 d and with pollen of flint-type maize (dominant allele) on 1 d (one pollination treatment for each of the seven possible days). The resulting hard kernels could be distinguished from the shriveled sweet kernels. The time of pollination had a strong effect on kernel set. The highest percentage of daily kernel set was observed on the first day of silking (Day 1). It accounted for 31 (2007) and 42% (2008) of the total kernels per ear. The distribution of these kernels followed a bell-shaped curve with a peak at around the position of the tenth kernel from the bottom of the ear. On the following days, kernel set followed a double bell-shaped curve with the peak shifting to the tip of the ear followed by a steady decrease. The minor peak, at the bottom of the ears, almost disappeared by Day 4 of silking. More than 90% of the final number of kernels was set within five (2007) or three (2008) days. The visual marker system successfully traced the dynamics of silk emergence and its impact on kernel set as well as its dependence on environmental conditions during flowering. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650116440

After transfer of the pollen with short tubes to a bursting solution containing 8% mannitol, many tubes burst and released two sperm cells. Hundreds of living egg cells were also isolated from blooming flowers, and living zygotes were isolated from flowers at 6 h after anthesis using dissection or enzymatic maceration combined with micromanipulation.

The present study was undertaken to establish the genetic compatibility of these three accession classes. Seventeen accessions, comprising eight cultivated Bali accessions, one var. macrosperma accession and eight wild accessions from Africa and Austronesia, were grown in large pots in shade house facilities in Townsville, Australia. Not all hybrid combinations were attempted because for some accession combinations, suitable matching flowers were not available at the same time. The main aim was to attempt enough crosses between accessions from the respective classes to establish whether the classes were genetically compatible. Hybridisation was conducted by hand pollination in the morning, using newly-open flowers that had been emasculated before sunset on the day before. Pods and viable hybrid seed were obtained from the BaliBali, var. macrospermawild and wild Africanwild Austronesian combinations. However, difficulty was encountered in obtaining viable and/or self-fertile hybrids between the Bali accessions and the other two classes. Depending on the particular combination of parental accessions, different genetic breakdown mechanisms were observed with the Balivar. macrosperma and Baliwild combinations. In some instances, flowers failed to set pods and/or the young pods abscised before maturity; pods set but seed were shrivelled and/or non-viable; viable seeds were set but the hybrid seedling plants were short-lived; or, in a few instances (Jimbaran Baliwild Austronesian), vigorous hybrid plants were obtained but were self-sterile. Mitotic chromosome counts showed there was no difference in chromosome number between the Bali accessions, the Austronesian accessions and those hybrids that were viable but infertile. All exhibited 2n?22. Pollen viability analyses using Alexander's stain indicated that the numbers of pollen grains per flower and the percentages of pollen grain that were viable were substantially lower in the hybrids than in both the cultivated Bali and wild parental accessions. Consistent with this observation, small numbers of viable seeds were obtained when viable pollen from the respective parents was backcrossed onto the self-sterile hybrids. The results suggested that the cultivated Bali accessions do not belong to the same primary gene pool as the other cultivated and wild V. vexillata accessions and that it would be difficult to use the Bali accessions and var. macrosperma concurrently to breed seed crop varieties. A taxonomic review of V. vexillata is also warranted.© 2010 CSIRO.",hybrid breakdown; hybridisation; plant breeding; varietal development.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958480168

Altogether, the viability of 656,363 pollen grains was analysed using Alexander's staining (1185 flowers from 301 plants from 67 field populations of 13 pure species and 1693 flowers from 345 plants from 96 field populations of 16 natural hybrids). The particular characters potentially related with pollen viability were estimated using following methods: natural hybrid frequency and species interfertility (by herbarium data), genetic distance (by AFLP), sympatricity (in local scale based on herbaria and literature data; on a global scale using the similarity between digitized maps of natural ranges). The strengths of pre-or postzygotic isolation were estimated for hybridizing species pairs using geographical data and pollen viability analyses. All hermaphrodite plants of the Cirsium hybrids had viable pollen, generally at lower levels than those foundin pure species. The pollen viability of a hybrid generally decreased with increasing genetic distance between the parents and when the parental species had lower pollen viability. The pollen viability was decreased in frequently hybridizing species where occasionally individuals of pure species morphology may show decreased pollen viability. In some instances these might represent some unrecognized hybrid backcrosses. In populations of gynodioecious species where females co-occurred, pollen viability (in hermaphrodites) was also lower, indicating some degree of inbreeding depression. Hybrids between sympatric species exhibited higher post-pollination isolation (decrease of pollen viability), which suggests that the reproductive isolation had been increased by natural selection (effect similar to the Wallace effect). The strength of the postzygotic barrier (based on pollen viability) was generally stronger than that of the prezygotic barrier (based on distribution overlap) in studied hybridizing species pairs.",AFLP; Genetic distance; Gynodioecy; Homoploid hybrids; Inbreeding depression; Introgression; Postzygotic barrier; Prezygotic barrier; Reinforcement; Reproductive isolation; Species promiscuity; Wallace effect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958457971

A prerequisite for the evolutionary stability in such systems is that the plants manage to generate a perfect sensory impression of a desirable object in the insect nervous system [1]. The study of these plants can provide important insights into sensory preference of their visiting insects. Here, we present the first description of a deceptive pollination system that specifically targets drosophilid flies. We show that the examined plant (Arum palaestinum) accomplishes its deception through olfactory mimicry of fermentation, a strategy that represents a novel pollination syndrome. The lily odor is composed of volatiles characteristic of yeast, and produces in Drosophila melanogaster an antennal detection pattern similar to that elicited by a range of fermentation products. By functional imaging, we show that the lily odors target a specific subset of odorant receptors (ORs), which include the most conserved OR genes in the drosophilid olfactome. Furthermore, seven of eight visiting drosophilid species show a congruent olfactory response pattern to the lily, in spite of comprising species pairs separated by ?40 million years [2], showing that the lily targets a basal function of the fly nose, shared by species with similar ecological preference. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Values of density and MOE diverged between the clonal extremes from age 3 to age 12. After diverging markedly up to age 6, differences in MFA between clonal extremes remained relatively constant to age 12. At age 12, values for density, MFA, and MOE varied between clonal extremes by, respectively, 194 kg·m-3 (465-659 kg·m-3), 11.38° (9.6-20.98°), and 11.2 GPa (10.4-21.6 GPa).

Little is known, however, about geographic variation in other biotic factors such as herbivores and its consequence for differential selection on flowering phenology among populations. Here, we examine selection by floral herbivores on the flowering phenology of Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera using two adjacent populations with contrasting herbivory regimes. Intensive floral herbivory by the leaf beetle Phaedon brassicae occurs in one population, while the beetle is absent in another population. We tested the hypothesis that the two populations experience differential selection on flowering time that is attributable to the presence or absence of floral herbivory. A two-year field study showed that early flowering was favoured in the population under intensive floral herbivory, whereas selection for early flowering was not found in one year in the population where floral herbivory was absent. Selection for early flowering disappeared when the abundance of floral herbivores was artificially decreased in a field experiment. Thus, the heterogeneous distribution of P. brassicae was a major agent for differential selection on flowering time. However, flowering time did not differ between the two populations when plants were grown in the laboratory. The lack of genetic differentiation in flowering time may be explained by ongoing gene flow or recent invasion of P. brassicae. This study illustrates that the role of floral herbivory in shaping geographic variation in selection on flowering phenology may be more important than previously thought. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Divergent selection; Florivory; Flowering time; Phaedon brassicae; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958018976

Yet wind-pollinated species may invest relatively heavily in male reproduction, and various compensatory mechanisms can offset incurred costs, therefore the apparent growth of genders might be similar over a longer period of time. Any cost-related disparities are expected to be most pronounced in mast flowering years, when female reproductive resource demand is highest. Aims: We aimed to investigate gender-related response in relation to the cost of reproduction, and as a function of climate. Methods: Using dendrochronology techniques and analysing growth parameters at the branch level, we compared long-term and seasonal growth of male and female Fraxinus excelsior trees. Results: There was no observed decline in trunk growth of either of the genders over a 55-year period, but male and female trees had distinguishable annual growth patterns. The tree-ring widths of both genders were smaller in masting years than in other years. The difference between genders could be explained by their response to different climatic variables: females are more sensitive to spring frost and drought in early summer, while male growth depends more on late summer conditions. Conclusions: Vegetative development and flowering create a feedback system that minimises the cost of reproduction and assures that expenses are covered. Hence, growth differences between genders may be related to their phenological and physiological disparities rather than reproductive cost differences per se. © 2010 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.",Fraxinus excelsior; Masting; Secondary sexual characters; Trade-offs; Tree rings; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958018187

However, a decline in the average cell wall digestibility of maize hybrids has been observed during the 1980-2000 period. This trend has now ceased with the breeding of specialized silage varieties. The cell wall degradability of the best current hybrids does not yet equal that of better old types of the 1960s era such as Inra258, mostly because the germplasm currently used in maize breeding corresponds to progenies of resources initially chosen for grain maize breeding. Nearly 110 new lines were thus derived by self-pollination in old or unused landraces and accessions in order to test the interest of this kind of genetic resources in maize breeding for cell wall degradability traits. Based on per se and topcross experiments, several lines representative of different and new germplasm displayed high or medium high cell wall digestibility. F7103 (Argentina-BBC143), F7104 (Argentina-BBC325), F7106 (Gelderland-VC150), F7114 (Zakarpatskaja-Zeltaja-Zubovidnaja), and F7121 (Comptons-Early) are likely among the more promising new resource lines for improvement of cell wall digestibility in elite dent or flint germplasm. These lines covered a large genetic diversity as F7103 and F7104 are mostly lowland tropical, F7106 and F7121 mostly northern flint, F7114 mostly Oh43/Minnesota13 related. Two other lines of medium-high cell wall digestibility, F7101 (St Engrace) and F7112 (Mecklenburger), were shown to be significantly related to lowland tropical germplasm. Several landraces or old varieties also gave lines of low cell wall digestibility such as F7124 (Curaco-de-Velez) or F7126 (Baanbreker), both related to the northern flint group. Average yield of top-crossed lines was nearly 7 t/ha lower than the average value of the three control hybrids and only one hybrid (F7104 x UH002) had yield and earliness equal to those of control hybrids. These low values were related to the fact that investigated lines were derived from old resources that did not get the last 60 years genetic improvements, and also to the only use of a flint male for top-crosses that did not optimize the genetic distance with all top-crossed lines. Allele sequencing and association genetics should give markers for targeted introgression of new alleles of interest originating from this specific set of lines in elite lines.",Biofuel; Cell wall; Degradability; Digestibility; Genetic resources; Lignin; Maize; Silage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958002255

Nicotiana longiflora and N. plumbaginifolia are self-compatible, sister species, with contrasting floral morphology and can be found in allopatry and sympatry in North Argentina. In two sympatric and 10 nearby allopatric populations we studied their natural interpopulational variability and sympatry effects on corolla length and anther-stigma distance. We also estimated seed set by selfing and via pollinators using pollination treatments. Both corolla length and anther-stigma distance varied significantly among N. longiflora, but not among N. plumbaginifolia populations. We did not detect an effect of sympatry in either species for any of the floral traits studied. Pollination treatments suggest that N. longiflora is mainly an outcrosser, although selfing occurs at some extent. Seed set attributed to pollinators was significantly higher in N. longiflora whereas most seeds in N. plumbaginifolia were sired through self-pollination. In N. plumbaginifolia, selfing seems to assure reproduction in sympatric populations, where floral visitors have a strong preference for N. longiflora. Corolla length was significantly negatively correlated with an increase in the percentage of self-seeds estimated by pollination treatments. Within N. longiflora, anther-stigma distance showed a positive correlation with selfing. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Floral traits associated with mating system; Interpopulational variability; Mating system evolution; Nicotiana longiflora; Nicotiana plumbaginifolia; Sympatry effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957909753

Proposed traits for maintenance of high fertility in rice under conditions of high temperature were: (1) long dehiscence formed at the basal part of the anther at the time of the flowering; (2) early time flowering; and (3) decreased panicle temperature. The objective of this study was to clarify whether or not these three possible traits are effective on the seed set of rice under free-air hot condition in this region. These traits were examined in a miniature paddy field in 2005-2006 with six cultivars that had shown variation in seed set rates in the Yangtze Valley in 2003. The effects of the cultivars on these three traits were significant as revealed by the analysis of variance. Percentage seed set was significantly correlated with the length of basal dehiscence (r=0.682, n=12, p=0.015) across cultivars under normal high temperature, but not with the other traits. Analysis of covariance showed that year (fixed variable), length of basal dehiscence (covariant variable) and daily maximum temperature (covariant variable) explained 82.1% of variance in seed set rate across the cultivars. Moreover, the percentage of sufficiently pollinated florets was correlated with both the length of basal dehiscence and seed set percentage. From these results, we conclude that long basal dehiscence is an effective trait in maintaining seed set under high atmospheric temperatures in the paddy fields in this region and that the long basal dehiscence enables high seed set rate through the stable pollination. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Anther dehiscence; Early time flowering; Free-air condition; Heat-induced floret sterility; Panicle temperature; Pollination; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957364199

Several laboratory and field studies indicate that raising flower temperature above ambient can be an advantage in attracting pollinators. Here we demonstrate that this preference for warmer flowers is, in fact, contextdependent. Using an Australian native bee as a model, we demonstrate for the first time a significant shift in behaviour when the ambient temperature reaches 34°C, at which point bees prefer ambient temperature nectar over warmer nectar. We then use thermal imaging techniques to show warmer nectar maintains the flight temperature of bees during the period of rest on flowers at lower ambient temperatures but the behavioural switch is associated with the body temperature rising above that maintained during flight. These findings suggest that flower-pollinator interactions are dependent upon ambient temperature and may therefore alter in different thermal environments. © 2010 Norgate et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957809537

Their phylogenetic position, in the early-diverging eudicots, makes them especially suitable for exploring the evolution of floral traits and the fate of gene paralogs that may have shaped the radiation of the eudicots. A current limitation in evolution of plant development studies is the lack of genetic tools for conducting functional assays in key taxa spanning the angiosperm phylogeny. We first show that virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of a PHYTOENE DESATURASE ortholog (TdPDS) can be achieved in Thalictrum dioicum with an efficiency of 42% and a survival rate of 97%, using tobacco rattle virus (TRV) vectors. The photobleached leaf phenotype of silenced plants significantly correlates with the down-regulation of endogenous TdPDS (P<0.05), as compared to controls. Floral silencing of PDS was achieved in the faster flowering spring ephemeral T. thalictroides. In its close relative, T. clavatum, silencing of the floral MADS box gene AGAMOUS (AG) resulted in strong homeotic conversions of floral organs. In conclusion, we set forth our optimized protocol for VIGS by vacuum-infiltration of Thalictrum seedlings or dormant tubers as a reference for the research community.

The objective was to study the genotypic responses, phenotypic plasticity and genotype by environment interactions, with regards to growth and to different levels of soil water content. The aim was to increase the knowledge on the genetic and adaptive potential of Q. robur to grow under different water stress conditions. Knowledge on genetic and adaptive potential can be used for practical seed zone management. Differences in growth between provenances were strongly related to latitude. Provenances of southernmost origin reacted vigorously to irrigation compared with Scandinavian provenances. For growth, the rank of provenances was the same at high and medium soil water treatments. Increased growth correlated with a higher number of secondary shoots and a prolonged growing season. Low soil water content initiated early growth cessation in all provenances. Root biomass was affected by soil water treatment and the highest root biomass was observed with medium and high soil water treatments. The results demonstrated a large evolutionary potential in relation to water treatment. The southernmost genotypes responded more strongly in growth to increased soil water level, but the local material showed a large variation and was less prone to early frost damage. The growth of Danish provenances of Q. robur was not reduced with high soil water treatment, in contrast to a study using Danish Fagus sylvatica provenances, indicating that Q. robur is well adapted to high soil water conditions. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Climatic adaptation; Drought stress; Progenies; Provenance testing; Water stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957775896

From 1990 to 1995, I measured the consistency across years of snowmelt patterns and flowering times along a permanent transect. In most years since 1993, I have monitored fruit set in temporal cohorts (early-to late-flowering groups of plants) at one site. To assess 'pollination limitation', I have also conducted supplemental hand-pollination experiments at various times through the blooming season. The onset of blooming is determined by snowmelt, with the earliest years starting a month before the latest years owing to variation in winter snowpack accumulation. Fruit set is diminished or prevented entirely by killing frosts in some years, most frequently but not exclusively for the earlier cohorts. When frosts do not limit fruit set, pollination limitation is frequent, especially in the earlier cohorts. Pollination limitation is strongest for middle cohorts: it tends to be negated by frost in early cohorts and ameliorated by continuing emergence of bumble-bee queens in later cohorts. This lily appears to be poorly synchronized with its pollinators. Across the years of the study, pollination limitation appears to be increasing, perhaps because the synchronization is getting worse. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Bombus; Climate change; Erythronium; Frost; Phenological synchrony; Pollinator decline,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958066608

Understanding how foraging decisions take place at the local scale is relevant because they may directly affect the fitness of individual plants. However, little is known about how local diversity and density affect the foraging behaviour of most pollinator groups. 2. By introducing two potted plant species (Salvia farinacae and Tagetes bonanza) into two populations of Taraxacum officinale, we investigated how plant identity, the mixtures of these plant species, and total plant density affected the attraction to and the foraging within a patch for six pollinator groups. 3. The foraging behaviour was mainly driven by the availability of the preferred plant species, and secondly by patch diversity and density. In general, dense patches and those containing the three-species mixture were preferred by all insect groups for arrival, although muscoid and hover flies responded less to local floral composition than bees. Local diversity and density had, however, a weaker effect on foraging behaviour within patches. Site dependence in response to floral treatments could be attributable to differences between sites in pollinator assemblage and Taraxacum density. 4.

It has been suggested that these flies are attracted by floral scent. However, the scent that is emitted from Ceropegia flowers has not been studied using headspace and gas chromatography mass spectrometry methods. It has also been unclear whether or not the flowers are mimics of particular models that attract flies. In the present study, we determined the composition as well as the spatial and temporal patterns of floral scent emitted by C. dolichophylla. Furthermore, we determined the pollinators in the native (China) and non-native (Germany) range of this species, and tested the capability of the floral scent to attract flies in the non-native range. Our data demonstrate that the floral scent, which is emitted from morning until evening, primarily from the tips of the corolla lobes, consists mainly of spiroacetals and aliphatic compounds. Milichiid flies were common visitors/pollinators in the native as well as non-native range, and were attracted by floral scent in bioassays performed in the non-native range. The compounds emitted by C. dolichophylla are unusual for flowers, but are well known from insect pheromones and occur in the glandular secretions of insects. The milichiid flies that visit and pollinate the flowers are kleptoparasites that feed on the prey (haemolymph or other secretions) of predatory arthropods, e.g. spiders, to which they are attracted by scent. Our data thus suggest that the floral scent of C. dolichophylla mimics the feeding sites of kleptoparasitic flies. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Bioassay; Floral scent; Fly-pollination; Headspace GC-MS; Kleptoparasites; Milichiidae; Spiroacetals,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049246980

Conventional wisdom is that long racemes in insectivorous plants have evolved to provide spatial separation between flowers and traps, which consequently prevents pollinators from being captured. However, it is also possible that long racemes evolved for better seed dispersal or to make flowers more visible to pollinators. Methods: Two sympatric insectivorous plants with identical pollinators were studied: Drosera cistiflora, with an upright growth form but a short raceme; and Drosera pauciflora, with a basal rosette of traps and a very long raceme. If long racemes evolved to protect their pollinators then D. cistiflora should capture more pollinators than D. pauciflora. However, if long racemes evolved to attract pollinators then taller flowers should receive more pollination visits than shorter flowers. Key Results: Examination of D. pauciflora and D. cistiflora traps revealed that no pollinators were captured by either species, suggesting that long racemes did not evolve to protect pollinators from being captured. Experimental manipulations of flower height in D. cistiflora showed that experimentally shortened plants received significantly fewer pollination visits than plants which were taller in stature. Conclusions: Long scapes in Drosera and non-insectivorous plants probably evolved due to similar selective pressures such as pollinator attraction. © The Author 2010.

If pollinators are strongly dependent on floral diversity due to mutual specialization, declines in plant diversity, e.g. caused by land use intensification, may be associated with linked extinctions of pollinators. However, the general extent of pollinator specialization is still poorly known. To explore the dependence of local bee and hoverfly communities on flower diversity, we recorded flower supply and flower-visiting insects on 27 meadows with varying flower diversity in southern Germany and analyzed (a) whether the diversity of flower visitors is correlated with flower diversity, (b) whether the degree of dietary specialization of flower visitors changes with flower diversity and (c) whether flower preferences of individual flower visitor species are constant or variable between different communities. Flower-visitor interaction webs were compiled during a single day on each meadow. This approach prevents relating pollinator species to flowers they never encounter because of non-overlapping phenology or spatial segregation. (a) Flower diversity and flower visitor diversity were positively correlated. (b) Flower visitor assemblies were significantly specialized at a relatively high level, contrasting to the opinion that plant-pollinator webs are highly generalized, and providing a possible explanation for the positive diversity correlation. However, the level of specialization did not change significantly across the gradient of flower diversity, suggesting that pollinators are partitioned to a similar extent in each meadow. (c) In the analysis of ten common flower visitor species previously categorized as generalists, strong evidence was found for both, consistent preferences and preferences that differ between sites. These results indicate a flexibility in flower preferences and a dynamic resource partitioning among pollinators.

Here we document a notable exception: Disa fragrans subsp. fragrans, a taxon from the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa, which is pollinated by insects belonging to at least four orders (flies, beetles, bees, and moths). Pollinaria of D. fragrans are attached to the feet of these visitors and pollination thus occurs in a rather haphazard fashion. Nevertheless, its pollination success and pollen transfer efficiency are comparable to those of its close relative, Disa sankeyi, which is pollinated by a single genus of wasps. D. fragrans has an exceptionally strong floral scent: volatile emission is 19-86?g per inflorescence per hour, which is up to 100 fold greater than in D. sankeyi. The scent bouquet is comprised of at least 46 compounds, mostly benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, which are known to be general attractants to a wide range of insects. In contrast to D. sankeyi, the flowers of D. fragrans have a high level of spectral purity (chroma) as is typical of many generalist insect-pollinated plants. At a site where D. fragrans co-occurs with D. sankeyi we found a plant with intermediate characteristics that may be a hybrid between the two taxa. The novel case of generalist pollination in D. fragrans documented here serves as an example of how floral advertising traits might evolve during an evolutionary shift from specialized to generalized pollination. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Floral syndrome; Fragrance; GC-MS; Hybrid; Nectar; Pollen transfer efficiency; Pollination success; Thermal desorption,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049235944

A multivariate analysis was used to estimate selection on correlated floral traits based on maternal and paternal fitness. Mating patterns among floral morphs were density dependent, resulting in assortative mating at low plant densities, and random mating among morphs at high densities. Weak disruptive selection on tube length was detected in one season for maternal fitness. Plant height was under opposing directional selection for maternal (+) and paternal (-) fitness functions. These results indicate that G. longicollis morphs will introgress rather than diverge towards speciation. The lack of strong assortative mating, particularly at high densities, is predicted to result in the loss of rare morphs within populations, and indicates that spatial and temporal co-occurrences of floral morphs are evolutionarily unstable. © The Authors (2010).

This phenomenon of ""sapromyiophily"" is also evident in the sporophytes of some mosses and fruiting bodies of ""stinkhorn"" fungi, both of which use flies as agents of spore dispersal. We studied the scent chemistry of a stinkhorn fungus (Clathrus archeri) and seven fly-pollinated plant species with foetid odours to determine the degree to which these organisms mimic the scent of carrion and faeces (reference scent samples were collected from rotting meat, a rat carcass and horse and dog faeces), as well as the degree of convergent evolution between the fungus and angiosperm flowers. We found that scents of both the fungus and angiosperms tended to contain compounds typical of carrion, such as oligosulphides, and of faeces, such as phenol, indole and p-cresol. This study provides compelling new evidence for mimicry of carrion and faeces, as well as a striking pattern of convergence in the putrid scents of the fungus and the angiosperms, relative to those of confamilial species. The syndrome of sapromyiophily thus encompasses at least two kingdoms (Plantae and Fungi) and provides an effective means of exploiting flies as agents of pollen and spore dispersal. © 2010 SAAB.",Brood-site mimicry; Calliphoridae; Clathrus archeri; Diptera; Flower scent; GC-MS; Intraspecific variation; Sapromyiophilous; Stapeliads,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049270267

Seed set is often pollen-limited, but species with late-acting self-incompatibility (SI) may be particularly vulnerable, if self-pollen deposition results in ovule discounting. Pollination is examined and the occurrence of late-acting SI and ovule discounting assessed in Cyrtanthus breviflorus. Methods: The pollination system was characterized by observing floral visitors and assessing nectar production and spectral reflectance of flowers. To assess late-acting SI and ovule discounting, growth of self- and cross-pollen tubes, and seed set following open pollination or hand pollination with varying proportions of self- and cross-pollen, were examined. Key Results: Native honeybees Apis mellifera scutellata pollinated flowers as they actively collected pollen. Most flowers (?70 ) did not contain nectar, while the rest produced minute volumes of dilute nectar. The flowers which are yellow to humans are visually conspicuous to bees with a strong contrast between UV-reflecting tepals and UV-absorbing anthers and pollen. Plants were self-incompatible, but self-rejection was late-acting and both self- and cross-pollen tubes penetrated ovules. Seed set of open-pollinated flowers was pollen-limited, despite pollen deposition exceeding ovule number by 6-fold. Open-pollinated seed set was similar to that of the cross + self-pollen treatment, but was less than that of the cross-pollen-only treatment. Conclusions: Flowers of C. breviflorus are pollinated primarily by pollen-collecting bees and possess a late-acting SI system, previously unknown in this clade of the Amaryllidaceae. Pollinators of C. breviflorus deposit mixtures of cross- and self-pollen and, because SI is late-acting, self-pollen disables ovules, reducing female fertility. This study thus contributes to growing evidence that seed production in plants with late-acting SI systems is frequently limited by pollen quality, even when pollinators are abundant. © The Author 2010.

Ovules that received saccate pollen, nonsaccate pollen or a mixture of both all showed larger amounts and higher proportions of saccate pollen inside ovules after drop secretion.These results demonstrate that flotation is an effective mechanism of pollen capture and transport in gymnosperms, and suggest that the prevalence of saccate grains and downward-facing ovules in the evolutionary history of seed plants is a result of the widespread use of this mechanism. © The Author (2010).

Pollinators are potentially at risk being exposed to pesticides and the main route of exposure is direct contact, in some cases ingestion, of contaminated materials such as pollen, nectar, flowers and foliage. To date there are no suitable methods for predicting pesticide exposure for pollinators, therefore official procedures to assess pesticide risk are based on a Hazard Quotient. Here we develop a procedure to assess exposure and risk for pollinators based on the foraging behaviour of honeybees (Apis mellifera) and using this species as indicator representative of pollinating insects. The method was applied in 13 European field sites with different climatic, landscape and land use characteristics. The level of risk during the crop growing season was evaluated as a function of the active ingredients used and application regime. Risk levels were primarily determined by the agronomic practices employed (i.e. crop type, pest control method, pesticide use), and there was a clear temporal partitioning of risks through time. Generally the risk was higher in sites cultivated with permanent crops, such as vineyard and olive, than in annual crops, such as cereals and oil seed rape. The greatest level of risk is generally found at the beginning of the growing season for annual crops and later in June-July for permanent crops. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Pesticide; Pollinators; Procedure; Risk assessment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149466797

As plants colonize the area that is freed from ice they should be accompanied by their pollinators to successfully reproduce and spread. However, little is known about the assembly of plant-pollinator networks. We therefore used quantitative network analysis to study the structure of plant-pollinator interactions at seven sites representing a chronosequence from 8 to 130 years since deglaciation on the foreland of the Morteratsch glacier (southeastern Switzerland). At these sites, individual visits of plant flowers by insects were recorded throughout the flowering season. Species richness of insect-pollinated plants and plant-pollinating insects, together with measures of interaction diversity and evenness, increased along the chronosequence at least for the first 80 years after deglaciation. Bees were the most frequent flower visitors at the two youngest sites, whereas flies dominated in mature communities. Pollinator generalization (the number of visited plant species weighted by interaction strength), but not plant generalization, strongly increased during the primary succession. This was reflected in a pronounced decline in network level specialization (measured as Blüthgen's H2') and interaction strength asymmetry during the first 60 years along the chronosequence, while nestedness increased along the chronosequence. Thus, our findings contradict niche-theoretical predictions of increasing specialization of pollination systems during succession, but are in agreement with expectations from optimal foraging theory, predicting an increase in pollinator generalization with higher plant diversity but similar flower abundance, and an increase in diet breadth at higher pollinator densities during primary succession. © 2010 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956622711

Several genera in the Proteaceae contain beetle-pollinated species. However, there is no information on the floral scent chemistry of beetle-pollinated members of the family. In this paper we report on the spatial variation and differences between developmental stages in emission of inflorescence (flowerhead) volatiles of four South African Protea species (P. caffra, P. dracomontana, P. simplex, and P. welwitschii) that are pollinated by cetoniine beetles. The scents from different inflorescence parts (bracts, perianth, styles, and nectar) and from successive anthesis stages of whole inflorescences were sampled using dynamic headspace collection and identified using GC-MS. Although the four species shared many scent compounds, possibly reflecting their close phylogenetic relationships and common pollinators, they showed significant differences in overall scent composition due to various species-specific compounds, such as the unique tiglate esters found in the scent of P. welwitschii. The strongest emissions and largest number of volatiles, especially monoterpenes, were from inflorescences at full pollen dehiscence. Senescing inflorescences of two species and nectars of all species emitted proportionally high amounts of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) and aromatic alcohols, typical fermentation products. As a consequence, the scent composition of nectar was much more similar among species than was the scent composition of other parts of the inflorescence. These results illustrate how the blends of compounds that make up the overall floral scent are a dynamic consequence of emissions from various plant parts. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Anthesis; Beetle pollination; Fermentation volatiles; Flower scents; GC-MS; Scented nectar,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049265749

In South African grasslands, chafer beetles (Scarabaeidae: Cetoniinae), particularly Atrichelaphinis tigrina, Cyrtothyrea marginalis and Leucoscelis spp., are common floral visitors and specialized pollination by these beetles has recently been established in several asclepiad, orchid and protea species. Chafer beetles are known to be attracted by a variety of floral volatile compounds and scent has been suggested to be an important signal in these chafer-operated pollination systems. In this study, we used dynamic headspace extraction methods and coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to examine the chemical composition of the floral scents of seven putatively chafer-pollinated asclepiad species in the genera Asclepias, Pachycarpus and Xysmalobium. We identified 15-57 compounds in the scents of these species, of which seven were common to all species examined. The scent profiles of each species separate into discrete clusters in two dimensional space based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), indicating clear distinctions between species and suggesting that plants may use different combinations of volatiles to attract beetles. Two plants suspected to be intergeneric hybrids were also examined. Data on pollination systems, morphology and scent chemistry are consistent with the hypothesis that these plants are hybrids between the chafer-pollinated species Asclepias woodii and Pachycarpus concolor. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the role of chafer beetles as generalist pollinators of specialized asclepiads. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Apocynaceae; Asclepiadoideae; Cantharophily; Floral volatiles; Introgression; Pollination guild,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049315287

We investigated the associations between floral traits and pollination systems in Schizochilus, a southern African orchid genus with small nectar-producing flowers that has not been studied previously with respect to pollination biology. Field observations indicated the presence of distinct pollination systems in the four species which occur in the Drakensberg, including pollination by muscid flies in Schizochilus angustifolius, tachinid flies in Schizochilus zeyheri, various small flies in Schizochilus bulbinella and bees and wasps in Schizochilus flexuosus. Pollination success and pollen transfer efficiency clearly differed among the four species but were not correlated with the quantity of nectar rewards. Multivariate analysis of floral morphology and floral scent chemistry based on GC-MS data revealed significant differences among species as well as populations within species. The floral scent of S. angustifolius was dominated by the benzenoid compounds benzaldehyde and phenylacetaldehyde. Samples of one population of S. bulbinella were relatively similar to S. angustifolius but samples of another population were very distinct due to the occurrence of the nitrogen-containing compounds 3-methyl-butyl aldoxime (syn/anti) and the higher amounts of aliphatic esters, alcohols and acids. In contrast, the floral scent of S. flexuosus and S. zeyheri was characterized by high relative amounts of methyl benzoate. We conclude that Schizochilus has distinct, specialized pollination systems associated with subtle but significant variation in floral morphology and scent chemistry. We also caution that sampling of several populations may be required to characterize floral scent composition at the species-level in plants. © 2010 SAAB.",Diptera; Floral scent; GC-MS; Grassland; Intraspecific variation; Morphology; Multivariate analysis; Nectar spur; Orchidaceae; Pollination,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049250814

We observed and identified floral visitors and performed array experiments. Our results show that similar suites of pollinators visit both plant taxa, which implies no fixed preference on the part of the pollinator species. However, when individual insects visit mixed arrays, they tend to restrict their visits to either the white or purple flowered taxon, likely resulting in assortative pollen transfer even in areas of fine-scale sympatry. The assortative visitation observed is noteworthy given that A. subcordatum and A. vexillo-calyculatum are best interpreted as incipient species. Thus, assortative mating caused by the specialization of individual pollinators towards a single flower color may be crucial for allowing the continued divergence of these lineages.

This Neotropical vine, endemic to the Yucatán Peninsula, rewards bees by secreting fully visible, deep-blue resin from a gland subtended by two conspicuous petaloid bracts that may play the role of advertisement. We used contextual analysis to build a fitness function for four morphological traits of individual blossoms: the amount of the reward as measured by gland area; the size of the advertisement trait as measured by bract length; the flower-pollinator fit as measured by the shortest distance between reward and stigma; and the potential for self-pollination as measured by the shortest distance between anthers and stigma. Larger gland area and increased potential for self-pollination directly increased the seed production of individual blossoms. However, bract size or flower-pollinator fit did not influence the number of seeds produced by blossoms. Therefore, in this Dalechampia species, pollinators seem to select directly on the reward of individual blossoms but not on the advertising bracts. © The Authors (2010).

The dwarf honey bee Apis florea L. was the most abundant flower visitor, and comprised more than 94% of the total visitors. Commencement of flight activity occurred when a minimum threshold of environmental variables was exceeded, while the cessation was governed mainly by decline in light intensity and radiation. The foraging population correlated significantly and positively with air temperature, light intensity, solar radiation and nectar-sugar concentration and negatively with relative humidity. Path coefficient analysis, revealed, however, that the direct effect of temperature was large and positive followed by light intensity and solar radiation while the direct effect of relative humidity was small and negative. The direct effect of nectar-sugar concentration was positive and negligible. Path coefficient analysis thus gave a clearer picture of the effects than did a simple correlation analysis.

This note reports the results of experiments assessing the fecundity effects of marcescent corollas in two southern Spanish insect-pollinated plants, Lavandula latifolia (Lamiaceae) and Viola cazorlensis (Violaceae). Methods: The effect of marcescent corollas on seed production was evaluated experimentally on wild-growing plants. Newly open flowers were randomly assigned to either control or treatment groups in experimental plants. After anthesis, withered corollas of treatment flowers were removed and those in control flowers were left in place. Fruits produced by treatment and control flowers were collected shortly before dehiscence and the number of seeds counted. Key Results: In V. cazorlensis, removal of withered corollas had no effect on percentage of fruit set, but mean seeds per fruit increased from 9·5 to 11·4. In L. latifolia, corolla removal had no effect on the number of seeds per fruit, but reduced the proportion of flowers ripening fruit from 60 to 40 . The detrimental effect of corolla removal on L. latifolia fecundity resulted from the drastic increase in fruit infestation by seed-predatory cecidomyiid larvae, which occurred in 4 and 34 of control and treatment fruits, respectively. Conclusions: Because of their potential effects on plant fecundity, marcescent corollas should not be dismissed a priori as biologically irrelevant leftovers from past floral functions. The simplicity of the experimental layout required to test for short-term fecundity effects of corolla marcescence should help to achieve a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary correlates of this widespread but poorly understood trait. © The Author 2010.

What seems to be lacking, however, is determination of allelic variation in SI gene (S) and the genotypes of self-incompatible and semi self-incompatible cultivare. In previous studies, S genotypes of several Citrus cultivare were estimated on the basis of segregation distortion for Got-3 gene in F1 progenies between these cultivars. In this study, S1 seedlings were produced from selfpollinated 'Hirado Buntan' pummelo, and homozygous S1 seedlings for the S gene were determined by the pollination with 'Hirado Buntan'. Then, the homozygous S1 seedlings were pollinated with the homozygous S1 seedling (SaSa) each other and classified them into two genotype groups of SaSa and SbSb. The ten cultivars, whose S genotypes were predicted on the basis of joint segregation analysis with Got-3 gene in their progenies, were pollinated with the homozygous S1 seedlings (SaS a or SbSb). Pollen tube behavior in the style of the ten Citrus cultivars after pollination with the Sa or S b pollen led to the conclusion that 'Hirado Buntan' has S9 and S10 alleles. Furthermore, pollen tube arrest in the style of self-compatible 'Kabusu' sour orange pollinated with S9 pollen suggested that the genotype of 'Kabusu' is SjS9. Inscrutably, neither S9 nor S10 alleles were found in a group belonging to the Hirado pummelo line, which started from seeds sown by the 11th feudal load Terasu Matsura of the domain of Hirado. This fact supported the two origins of Hirado pummelo plants described in the literature, and indicated the association of multiple seed and/or pollen parents with different S alleles to the original seed production.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78549255198

However, our knowledge on the chemistry of floral volatiles in this plant family is relatively limited although it has been suspected that floral scent plays a key function for pollinator attraction. This is the third paper in a series of papers reporting on the floral odours of Asclepiadoideae. Floral odours of eleven species from seven genera (Cibirhiza, Fockea, Gymnema, Hoya, Marsdenia, Stephanotis and Telosma) of early diverging taxa of Apocynaceae-Asclepiadoideae, and two species of Secamone (Apocynaceae-Secamonoideae) were collected using headspace sampling and then analyzed via GC-MS. We detected 151 compounds, of which 103 were identified. The vast majority of chemicals identified are common components in flower odour bouquets of angiosperms. However, striking was the high relative amount of acetoin (97.6%) in the flower scent of Cibirhiza albersiana. This compound has rarely been reported as a flower scent component and is more commonly found in fermentation odours. Bray-Curtis similarities and Nonmetric-Multidiminsional Scaling (NMDS) analyses showed that each of the species has a distinct odour pattern. This is mostly due to only twelve compounds which singly or in different combinations dominated the scent of the species: the benzenoids benzyl acetate, benzaldehyde, methyl benzoate, and 2-phenylethyl alcohol; the monoterpenoids (E)-ocimene, (Z)-ocimene, linalool, and eucalyptol; and the aliphatic compounds acetoin, and (E,.

Hydrophily is abiotic and typically associated with unisexual flowers, factors that predictably would promote xenogamy and outcrossing. Yet, there have been few reports of hybridization involving waterpollinated plants (hydrophiles), with no firm evidence of natural interspecific hybridization. The genus Najas comprises about 40 species of submersed aquatic plants, all characterized by subsurface hydrophily. Hybridization in this genus has been suspected, but verified previously only among infraspecific taxa. In this study we document the first instance of interspecific hybridization in Najas using genetic evidence from three populations that were identifiable as N. guadalupensis but yielded polymorphic DNA sequence profiles. To facilitate our analysis we first conducted a phylogenetic survey of New World Najas taxa using nuclear and chloroplast markers. Alleles cloned from a biparentally-inherited locus (ITS) in these aberrant populations associated with two distinct but phylogenetically sister species (N. guadalupensis subsp. olivacea and N. flexilis) thus confirming their hybrid origin. In all cases the chloroplast markers associated with N. guadalupensis subsp. olivacea, implicating it as the maternal parent. The hybrid Najas plants occur at the edge of the sympatric range of the parental species. They possess no readily distinctive morphological features and require genetic analysis for confident detection. One population grows aggressively, raising concerns that at least some hybrid Najas plants represent a potential conservation threat. The possible hybrid ancestry of the endemic N. guadalupensis subsp. muenscheri also was assessed, but could not be confirmed or refuted by the data evaluated. © Copyright 2010 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.",ITS; matK/trnK; phylogenetics; rbcL; water nymph; water pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650330366

These interactions appear to be mediated by cone volatiles, and, in some species, by patterns of thermogenesis. We investigated the chemical composition of volatile emissions and patterns of thermogenesis in cones of the South African cycad Encephalartos natalensis, using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and miniature temperature data loggers (ibuttons), respectively. This was done during various developmental stages (before and during receptivity and pollen release) for both female and male cones. A total of 31 compounds were identified in headspace samples; 17 of which were common to both sexes, 12 found only in male cones, and two found only in female cones. The major volatiles in pollen and female cones are (3. E)-1,3-octadiene (averaging 54.25% and 15.82% of total emissions), (3. E,5. Z)-1,3,5-octatriene (averaging 13.37% and 47.66%), and ?-pinene (averaging 16.29% and 12.24%). Female cones were not thermogenic before and during receptivity whereas pollen cones were thermogenic during pollen shedding. Thermogenesis of male cones occurred between 1400. h and 1530. h on successive afternoons, reaching an average of c. 10.5°C above ambient temperature. Volatile emissions and thermogenesis occurred in association with insect activity on the cones suggesting that they both play a role in regulating insect behaviour. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",African cycads; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Insect visitors; KwaZulu-Natal; Pollination; Thermogenesis; Volatile emissions; Zamiaceae,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049255723

In this work, this point was addressed by quantitatively measuring the fluorescence quantum yield (?f) for flowers of Bellis perennis (white, yellow, pink, and purple), Ornithogalum thyrsoides (petals and ovaries), Limonium sinuatum (white and yellow), Lampranthus productus (yellow), Petunia nyctaginiflora (white), Bougainvillea spectabilis (white and yellow), Antirrhinum majus (white and yellow), Eustoma grandiflorum (white and blue), Citrus aurantium (petals and stigma), and Portulaca grandiflora (yellow). The highest values were obtained for the ovaries of O. thyrsoides (?f=0.030) and for Citrus aurantium petals (?f=0.014) and stigma (?f=0.013). Emitted photons as fluorescence were compared with reflected photons. It was concluded that the fluorescence emission is negligible compared to the reflected light, even for the most fluorescent samples, and it may not be considered as an optical signal in biocommunication.

The balance followed controlled pollination of female flowers on grafted copies of plus trees growing in clonal achives with a polymix (PO) of selected pollens. It was necessary to adjust for the selected nature of the PO pollens during analysis.The breeding objective was to maximize gain for stem diameter and stem form while avoiding a fall in wood density.

These transitions involve the spread of male and female sterility mutations resulting in modifications to the gender of ancestral hermaphrodites. Despite sustained interest in the gender strategies of plants, the structural and developmental bases for transitions in sexual systems are poorly understood. Methods: Here, floral morphology, patterns of fertility, pollen-tube growth and floral development are investigated in two populations of the scandent shrub Mussaenda pubescens (Rubiaceae), native to southern China, by means of experimental and open-pollinations, light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with paraffin sectioning. Key Results Mussaenda pubescens: has perfect (hermaphroditic) flowers and populations with two style-length morphs but only weak differentiation in anther position (stigma-height dimorphism). Experimental pollinations demonstrated that despite morphological hermaphroditism, the species is functionally dioecious. The long-styled (L) morph possesses sterile pollen and functions as a female, whereas the short-styled (S) morph is female sterile and functions as a male. Self- and intra-morph pollinations of the S-morph were consistent with those expected from dimorphic incompatibility. The two populations investigated were both S-morph (male) biased. Investigations of early stages of floral development indicated patterns typical of hermaphroditic flowers, with no significant differences in organ growth between the floral morphs. Meiosis of microspore mother cells was of the simultaneous type with tetrads isobilateral in shape. The tapetal cells in anther walls of the L-morph became vacuolized during meiosis I, ahead of the uninucleate microspore stage in the S-morph. In the L-morph, the microspore nucleus degenerated at the tetrad stage resulting in male sterility. Microsporogenesis and male gametophyte development was normal in the S-morph. Failure in the formation of megaspore mother cells and/or the development of megagametophytes resulted in female sterility in the S-morph, compared with normal megasporogenesis in the L-morph. Conclusions In M. pubescens: cryptic dioecy has evolved from stigma-height dimorphism as a result of morph-specific sterility mutations. © The Author 2010.

This raises the question of the risk of dissemination of genetically modified (GM) pollen to non-GM crops by visiting insects. We inventoried the flower-visiting insects in Bt and non-Bt cotton fields of the South African Highveld region and investigated their role in pollen dispersal. Their diversity and abundance varied slightly among sites, with Astylus atromaculatus as the predominant insect on both Bt and non-Bt cotton flowers. The other major flower-visiting species were Apis mellifera and solitary Apidae. No differences were found in the abundance of each taxum between Bt and non-Bt cotton except for Scoliidae and Nitidulidae, which were scarce overall (<0.5%) but more abundant on the non-Bt flowers in the central area of the field at one site. The pollen load on A. atromaculatus was as high as on Apis mellifera. Cage tests showed that A. atromaculatus can pollinate female cotton plants by transferring pollen from male donor plants. In the field, the flight range of this insect was generally short (25 m), but it can occasionally reach up to 200 m or even more. This study therefore highlights that A. atromaculatus, commonly regarded as a pest, could be an unexpected but efficient pollinator. Because its population density can be high, this species could mediate unwanted cotton pollen flow when distances between coexiting fields are not sufficient. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",Apis mellifera; Astylus atromaculatus; Bt cotton; gene flow; insect population,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957792675

In addition, we quantified the effect of phylogenetic uncertainty in the observed patterns of correlated evolution by comparing trees in which polytomous branches were randomly resolved. Heteranthery is reported from 12 angiosperm orders and is phylogenetically associated with the absence of floral nectaries, buzz-pollination and enantiostyly (mirror-image flowers). These associations are robust to particularities of the underlying phylogenetic hypothesis. Heteranthery has probably evolved as a result of pollinator-mediated selection and appears to function to reduce the conflict of relying on pollen both as food to attract pollinators and as the agent of male gamete transfer.

Until recently, however, the ties between ecology and speciation in plants have received relatively little attention. This paper reviews some exciting new insights into the role of ecology in speciation, focusing on the angiosperms. I consider five main topics, including (1) the determinants of the spatial scale of genetic differentiation within species; (2) the role and limits of adaptive radiation in increasing net rates of plant diversification; (3) the potential role of ecological speciation; (4) the contributions of hybridization to speciation, adaptive radiation, and the ecological breadth of clades; and (5) the ecological determinants of net diversification rate for individual lineages, and of the species richness for regional floras. Limited dispersal, especially of seeds, favors genetic differentiation at small spatial scales and is likely to foster rapid speciation and narrow endemism. Meta-analyses show that the minimum area required for in situ speciation on islands increases with the spatial scale of gene flow in various organisms. In angiosperms, fleshy fruits dispersed by vertebrates often increase the distance over which seeds are dispersed, but can decrease it in forest understories. Nutrient-poor soils should work against the evolution of fleshy fruits and promote speciation and narrow endemism. Selection for adaptation to different conditions drives adaptive radiation, the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and attendant adaptations within a lineage. On islands, adaptive radiation often leads to woodiness, monocarpy, developmental heterophylly, and sexual dimorphism, as well as differences in habitat, growth form, and floral morphology. Adaptive radiation appears to accelerate speciation in only some plant clades. Extensive radiation in some lineages has been ascribed to early colonization, large amounts of heritable genetic variation, ""genetic lines of least resistance"" upon which selection could act, absence of potential competitors, and possession of ""key innovations"" that provide access to novel resources. To these should be added large island area, organismal abundance, saturation of ecological space, and the synergism action of limited dispersal and divergent selection producing parallel radiations in isolated regions. Data for Hawaiian lobeliads suggest that within-island species richness of Cyanea-involving divergence in elevation and flower tube length-saturates within 0.6 and 1.5 Ma. Adaptive radiation in pollinators is an important mechanism of ecological speciation: adaptation to different pollinators leads to pollinator partitioning and reproductive isolation. Selection for longer nectar spurs and pollinator mouth parts led to increased speciation in Aquilegia and other groups. A similar process may work once tubular flowers evolve from cup-shaped blossoms. Selection for floral divergence may be limited in forest understories illuminated by dim, greenish light, which may account for the predominance of small, visually inconspicuous flowers in temperate and tropical understory species. Hybridization can stimulate speciation by forming transgressive phenotypes that exceed the range seen in parental taxa, and by introgressing adaptive gene combinations. The likelihood of transgressive phenotypes increases with the genetic divergence between parental taxa, so speciation via transgressive hybridization may be most likely among taxa with intermediate amounts of divergence. Several large adaptive radiations appear to have occurred after hybridization, suggesting a special role for the extensive amount of genetic variation that can be supplied and refreshed by syngameons. Rates of net species diversification are greater in herbs (especially annuals) vs. woody plants; in animal- vs. wind-pollinated species; in plants with poorly dispersed seeds; in families with a greater diversity of growth forms, pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms, and species distributions; in families at lower latitudes; in families with higher rates of genetic evolution; in hermaphroditic or monoecious vs. dioecious clades; in earlier-maturing woody plants; in plants with bilateral vs. radial flowers; in plants with hummingbird-pollinated flowers; in epiphytic vs. terrestrial bromeliads and orchids; in bromeliads differentiating along geographically extensive cordilleras; and in young vs. old clades. Evidence for the last pattern may, however, be an artifact of (auto)regressing (ln N) / t vs. t. High rates of diversification in epiphytic orchids are tied to small effective population sizes, suggesting a role for intermittent genetic drift alternating with strong selection on floral traits. Across angiosperms, a massive increase in diversification rates was preceded by a major increase in leaf vein density and hydraulic conductance between 140 and 110 Ma ago, leading to higher photosynthetic rates than coexisting ferns and gymnosperms. Based on the economic theory of plant defense, this should have led to lower allocation to anti-herbivore defenses, selecting for low-cost qualitative toxins rather than all-purpose but highly expensive qualitative defenses, triggering an arms' race between angiosperm and their herbivores. Finally, regional plant species richness increases with regional area and proxies for latitude, rainfall, topographic heterogeneity, and vegetation stratification. The Cape Floristic Province has roughly twice as many species as expected from its area and environmental conditions, most likely reflecting the predominance of short-distance dispersal associated with poor soils and myrmecochory in the Cape Province, as well as low rates of regeneration and competitive exclusion following fire.",Adaptive radiation; Diversity; Genetic structure; Seed dispersal; Transgressive hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149245210

Species of Kohautia can easily be distinguished from other Spermacoceae by their monomorphic short-styled flowers in which anthers and stigma are included in the corolla tube, with the stigma always positioned below the anthers. Mainly because of this unique floral morphology, Kohautia was considered to be a distinct genus. Molecular data (atpB-rbcL, petD, rps16, trnLtrnF, ETS, ITS) confirm that the genus is biphyletic. Two distantly related clades correspond to the subgenera Kohautia and Pachystigma Bremek. A similar type of floral organisation thus seems to have evolved twice independently, resulting in similar, but distantly related lineages. In order to translate the biphyletic nature of Kohautia into a formal classification, the two subgenera are recognized at generic level. A substitute name, Cordylostigma Groeninckx & Dessein is proposed for K. subg. Pachystigma because of the existence of Pachystigma Hochst. in the Rubiaceae tribe Vanguerieae. Floral, pollen and seed characters were studied to morphologically characterize Kohautia s.str. and Cordylostigma. By optimizing pollination syndromes and pollen characters onto the molecular phylogeny, we investigated pollination shifts and pollen evolution within the two genera. Detailed floral morphological studies show that the nectar guides in the psychophilous species of Kohautia s.str. and Cordylostigma evolved in different ways but result in the same visual effect.",Cordylostigma; Kohautia; Molecular phylogeny; Morphology; Pachystigma; Pollination syndromes; Rubiaceae; Spermacoceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149256259

We found that both S. wetlandicus and S. brevispinus are predominantly outcrossed and are essentially self-incompatible. A third presumptive taxon (undescribed; here called S. wetlandicus-var1) is fully self-compatible but cannot produce seeds unless the flowers are visited by pollinators. We found tentative evidence for pollinator limitation of fruit set in S. brevispinus but not in the other taxa. Pollinators are largely species of native ground-nesting bees in the subfamily Halictinae. These bees are indiscriminate collectors of pollen and nectar from Sclerocactus flowers and other plant species. The well-being of Sclerocactus populations requires that land managers ensure the preservation of halictid bee habitat, which includes both nesting sites and a diversity of floral resources. These bees are also undoubtedly the pollen vectors responsible for the production of hybrids in areas where S. wetlandicus and S. brevispinus meet. We experimentally confirmed that reciprocal crosses between S. wetlandicus and S. brevispinus are indistinguishable from each other or from pure crosses in fruits/flower, seeds/fruit and seed weights. We suggest that hybridization preceded energy development, that it attests to the ongoing process of evolution in the Sclerocactus group, and that it should not be suppressed by anthropogenic activity. © 2010 Western North American Naturalist.",breeding system; Cactaceae; conservation; hybridization; native bees; pollination; Sclerocactus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149336366

This has prompted calls for the conservation of network structure, but precisely which attributes of webs should be conserved remains unclear. Further, the extent to which network metrics characterise the spatiotemporally-variable dynamic structure of interacting communities is unknown. Here, we summarise the attributes of web structure that are predicted to confer stability or increased function to a system, as these may be of greatest interest to conservation biologists. However, empirical evaluation of these effects is lacking in most cases, and we discuss whether stability is even desirable in all contexts. The incorporation of web attributes into conservation monitoring requires that changes in these attributes can be recorded (sampled) with relative ease. We contrast the sensitivity of metrics to sampling effort, and highlight those (such as nestedness and connectance) that could easily be incorporated into conservation monitoring. Despite our growing understanding of the characteristics of food webs that confer stability and function, numerous practical challenges need to be overcome before the goal of conserving species interaction networks can be achieved. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Climate change; Food web; Global change; Global warming; Invasion; Land use change; Mutualism; Parasitoid; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955919303

We explored the adaptive significance of the change in floral orientation, from pendulous flowers to erect fruits that have a persistent calyx, in Anisodus luridus, a perennial native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Methods: We examined the effect of flower orientation on pollinator visitation rates, pollen deposition efficiency, pollen quan tity, and pollen viability to estimate whether pendulous flowers have improved male fitness. We then measured seed production and seed germination rate to assess whether erect fruits have enhanced female fitness. Key results: Pendulous flowers did not have any preferred pollinators or increased pollen deposition. In artificially erected flowers, the number of pollen grains greatly decreased after rainwash. Pollen germination experiments indicated that pollen damage by water and exposure to solar radiation is serious. In the persistent calyx that holds water within it, the temperature inside the calyx changed slower than in the calyx that had the water removed. After supplemental pollination, the seed number, seed set, and seed mass of fruits that had water removed from the calyx were reduced greatly in both years. Conclusions: We conclude that the change in floral orientation could enhance male and female fitness of A. luridus and is effectively adaptive to the alpine environments, indicating a strong selection by the combined pressure from various abiotic nonpollinator agents in shaping the floral traits of this alpine plant. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Anisodus luridus; Male/female fitness; Persistent calyx; Pollen viability; Qinghai-tibet plateau; Rain; Solanaceae; Solar radiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049269540

This transport may affect pollen viability in maize pollen which has been linked to its moisture content. The objective of this study was to examine how predictions of pollen viability may differ when considering the effects of boundary layer transport rather than only considering the conditions at the pollen source. We used Large-Eddy Simulation to simulate pollen dispersion and predict pollen viability upon deposition. We compared the predicted viability that was diagnosed using the atmospheric conditions at the pollen source when a pollen grain was released to viability diagnosed using the atmospheric conditions following the pollen grain's trajectory as it moved through the atmospheric boundary layer. Using surface values provided a reasonable prediction of viability for pollen grains that traveled less than a kilometer from the source field, but underpredicted pollen viability by as much as 20% for pollen that traveled several kilometers. The difference is attributed to the tendency for longer range transport to require lofting of pollen grains into the upper part of the atmospheric boundary layer, where cooler temperature and higher relative humidity are conducive to increased viability. Our results suggest that pollen grains traveling many kilometers are more likely to pollinate a receptive silk than would be expected based on the atmospheric conditions at the pollen source. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Large-Eddy Simulation; Pollen dispersion; Pollen viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955920711

It is highly unlikely that he made this comment, which was even mentioned in a Lancet article on honey bees. However, the current vanishing of the bees can have serious consequences for human health, because 35% of the human diet is thought to benefit from pollination. Colony collapse disorder (CCD) in honey bees is characterized by the rapid decline of the adult bee population, leaving the brood and the queen poorly or completely unattended, with no dead bodies in or around the hive. A large study found no evidence that the presence or amount of any individual pesticide or infectious agent occurred more frequently or abundantly in CCD-affected colonies. The growing consensus is that honey bees are suffering from comprised immune systems, which allow various infectious pathogens to invade. The question remains, what causes immunosuppression in many colonies of Apis mellifera in North America and Europe? Telomeres are protective DNA structures located at eukaryotic chromosome tips that shorten in the somatic tissues of animals with age. Lifelong tissue regeneration takes place in Apis mellifera, and worker bees have been shown to senesce. In humans, a vast amount of literature has accumulated on exhausted telomere reserves causing impaired tissue regeneration and age-associated diseases, specifically cancer and immunosuppression. Therefore, we propose a new causative mechanism for the vanishing of the bees: critically short telomeres in long-lived winter bees. We term this the telomere premature aging syndrome. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955567110

In particular, growing global demands for food, biofuel and other commodities are driving the rapid expansion of oil palm and paper-and-pulp industries at the expense of lowland dipterocarp forests, further jeopardizing Southeast Asian forest biotas. We synthesize recent findings on the effects of land-use changes on plants, invertebrates, vertebrates and ecosystem functioning/services in Southeast Asia. We find that species richness and abundance/density of forest-dependent taxa generally declined in disturbed compared to mature forests. Species with restricted ranges and those with habitat and foraging specialization were particularly vulnerable. Forest loss also disrupted vital ecosystem services (e.g. crop pollination). Long-term studies are needed to understand biotic sustainability in regenerating and degraded forests, particularly in the context of the synergistic or additive effects of multiple agents of biodiversity loss (e.g. invasive species and climate change). The preservation of large tracts of mature forests should remain the principal conservation strategy in the tropics. In addition, reforestation and reintroductions of native species, as well as improved connectivity among forest patches could enhance the conservation value of forest remnants in human-dominated landscapes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Agriculture; Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystem functioning; Logging; Urbanization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955921040

Integrated pest management strategies for control of this pest include the judicious use of insecticides. To monitor field populations of Varroa mite for insecticide resistance, a glass vial bioassay procedure was developed to use in the development of a resistance management strategy. Diagnostic concentrations needed to separate susceptible genotypes from resistant individuals were determined for Cypermethrin (0.1 ?g per vial), fluvalinate (5.0 ?g per vial), malathion (0.01 ?g per vial), coumaphos (10.0 ?g per vial), diazinon (5.0 ?g per vial), methomyl (0.5 ?g per vial), propoxur (0.1 ?g per vial), and endosulfan (2.5 ?g per vial). Resistance to organophosphorus insecticides (malathion, coumaphos) and pyrethroids (cypermetrhrin, fluvalinate) was widespread in both La Media Ranch, TX, and Wewahitchka, FL, from 2007 to 2009.

In the former location, the frequency of resistance to all insecticides tested decreased significantly from 2007 to 2009, whereas it increased in the latter location. Resistance levels were unstable, suggesting that resistance could be successfully managed.

Due to the high summer rainfall in Ireland (compared to all other European apple growing areas) and the severe susceptibility of the apple cultivar Bramley's Seedling to scab (Venturia inaequalis), neither clean orchards in the autumn nor sanitation practices were sufficient to eliminate the requirement for full fungicide protection programmes at the start of the following growing season. Post harvest applications of urea proved difficult due to late harvesting of pollinator fruit for the juice market and wet weather. Total removal of leaf litter from plots prior to the commencement of growth did not significantly reduce disease incidence.

The effects of ?0.1 × FAR of aminopyralid, cloransulam, glyphosate, primisulfuron, or sulfometuron applied 14 d after emergence (DAE), were evaluated for B. rapa grown in mineral soil in pots under greenhouse conditions. Effects were expressed as the effective concentration of the herbicide producing a 25%reduction in a response (EC25) based on nonlinear regression. Brassica rapa seed dry weight was reduced by sulfometuron at an EC25 of 0.00014 × a field application rate (FAR) of 53 g active ingredient (a.i.) ha-1, primisulfuron at 0.008 (experiment 1) or 0.0050 (experiment 2) × FAR of 40 g a.i. ha-1, cloransulam at 0.022 × FAR of 18 g a.i. ha-1, glyphosate at 0.0399 × FAR of 834 g a.i. ha-1, and by aminopyralid at 0.005 × FAR of 123 g a.i. ha-1, but only for 1 of 2 experiments. Reduced seed production occurred at less than the FAR that reduced shoot dry weight with sulfometuron and primisulfuron, whereas neither aminopyralid, cloransulam, nor glyphosate affected shoot dry weight.

It reproduces asexually and sexually. In asexual mode, bulbils arise as offshoots of the stem and produce new branches or new plants. In sexual mode, a small number of plants participate in the coning event during March-May. The plant sex ratio is strongly male-biased. The plant is typically anemophilous and effective for optimal seed set. The cones of both sexes show strong thermogenesis and odour production during the maturation process; these two processes attract Derelomus weevils which use male cones for feeding and breeding during which they get covered with pollen. These weevils in search of other male cones also visit female cones and effect pollination accidentally. The female cones only offer warmth to the weevils during night. The weevils diapause on male plants until the next coning season. Spotted deer (Axis axis), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) and rainwater disperse seeds. Seeds are not dormant. Natural regeneration through sexual and asexual means is poor, which could be due to seed predation, inability of the germinating seeds and growing seedlings to compete well with the seasonal plants and grasses for the available nutrients in the soil and litter, and erratic rainfall or dry spells within the rainy season. Further, the traditional uses of this plant also contribute to the restricted population size.

The result has been numerous new insights into the genomic and genetic consequences of polyploidy. The plethora of new discoveries has dramatically reshaped traditional views and concomitantly revealed that polyploidy is a highly dynamic and ubiquitous process. These recent advances in our understanding of polyploidy have stimulated numerous reviews, most focused on the various genetic, epigenetic, and genomic consequences of polyploid evolution. Whereas genetic and genomic attributes of polyploidization have received considerable attention, other crucial areas of polyploid evolution have received much less (e.g., ecology, pollination biology, physiology). The focus of this paper is not to review again recent discoveries, but to emphasize what we do not yet know about polyploidy, which despite all that has been learned about genome doubling is still an enormous amount. Our list is not meant to be comprehensive, but includes a range of topics that we have placed in several general categories, including mode of formation, ecological and physiological consequences, and genomic rules. Questions include: What is (are) the most frequent mechanism(s) of polyploidization? What factors promote/facilitate polyploidization? What factors favor autopolyploid vs. allopolyploid formation? Do multiple origins result in lineages with differing evolutionary trajectories and/or cryptic species?

Transcripts were assembled for 6 disparate Hymenopteran taxa with additional sequences added from public databases for a final dataset of 24 genes for 16 taxa and over 10. kb of sequence data. The concatenated dataset recovered a robust and well-supported topology demonstrating the monophyly of Holometabola, Hymenoptera, Apocrita, Aculeata, Ichneumonoidea, and a sister relationship between the two most closely related proctotrupomorphs in the dataset (Cynipoidea. +. Proctotrupoidea). The data strongly supported a sister relationship between Aculeata and Proctotrupomorpha, contrary to previously proposed hypotheses. Additionally there was strong evidence indicating Ichneumonoidea as sister to Aculeata. +. Proctotrupomorpha. These relationships were robust to missing data, nucleotide composition biases, low taxonomic sampling, and conflicting signal across gene trees.

One hypothesis proposed to explain this concerns the difficulty for birds of drinking nectar of high viscosity. We examined the effects of viscosity, separately from those of sugar concentration, on feeding by captive whitebellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala). Viscosities of artificial nectar (sucrose solutions ranging in concentration from 0.25 to 1.5 mol/l) were altered with Tylose, an inert polysaccharide. Food consumption was measured over 3 h, and lick frequency and duration were recorded using photodetection devices on feeding apertures too small for the bill but large enough for the extended tongue. Volumetric intake rates (ml/s) were inversely proportional to nectar viscosity, and were similar over the range of sucrose concentrations when viscosity was held constant. Sucrose intake rates (mg/s) remained the same on pure sucrose solutions, but they decreased with increasing viscosity at a constant sucrose concentration. Lick frequencies and tongue loads were reduced at high viscosities, and lick duration increased, which confirms that sunbirds take longer to ingest viscous solutions. Licking behavior was remarkably similar in birds feeding on different sucrose concentrations if viscosity was held constant. Nectar ingestion rate is determined by viscosity; however, total food intake is mainly modulated by sugar concentration. Similar effects of food viscosity have been observed in insects that suck nectar.

We examined the outcrossing rate, biparental inbreeding, and inbreeding depression in two closely related species of Aquilegia, A. formosa and A. pubescens, that differ in their major floral visitors (hummingbird and hawkmoth, respectively). Population-level estimates of the outcrossing rate were generally high, ranging from 0.42 to 0.89 and averaging 0.79 for A. formosa and 0.69 for A. pubescens; however, the two rates did not differ significantly. The similarities in the outcrossing rates of the two species suggest that both hummingbird and hawkmoth pollination systems provide pollen movement patterns that promote a high degree of outcrossing. However, we also found that a substantial amount of outcrossing (13%-46%) was due to mating between relatives (biparental inbreeding). Using Ritland's genetic marker-based approach to estimate inbreeding depression, we found complete selection against inbred progeny (inbreeding depression 1). We estimated when inbreeding depression is expressed by comparing the inbreeding coefficient across various life-history stages. We found that inbreeding depression is generally strong between seed germination and establishment and also occurs between seedling establishment and reproductive maturity. Our findings indicate that inbreeding depression likely removes selfed and biparentally inbred progenies from populations before flowering. This intense inbreeding depression will thus cause strong selection for any trait that increases the level of outcrossing with nonrelatives. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

We expected to find a reduction in fitness in V. album populations growing in fragmented habitats resulting from a loss of genetic diversity through increased inbreeding. Methods - We studied seed germination as a measure of fitness among sixteen Belgian V. album populations varying in size and degree of isolation to investigate the fitness consequences of habitat fragmentation. Populations were sampled from two landscapes differing in their degree of habitat fragmentation and V. album population characteristics. We also compared germination percentages of three populations at three different temperatures (5, 20, 30°C) to examine the potential effects of climate change on V. album regeneration in northern Europe. Key results - Germination percentages (at 20°C) were high (69-100%) and we found no evidence of relationships between germination and population size, density, or area. There was no direct relationship between germination percentage and population isolation within study regions, but connectivity among populations appears to be important. Samples from the more fragmented habitat showed a negative correlation between germination percentage and the proportion of females, suggesting reduced mate availability and pollination resulting from increased isolation of populations. There was no significant difference in mean germination percentages among the three temperature treatments, but the high temperature samples (30°C) exhibited the highest variation in germination success. Conclusion - Our results suggest that V. album has evolved high germination success to compensate for limited success in establishing on a host plant. Successful germination under a wide range of environmental conditions is expected to increase the likelihood of establishing on host plants, possibly helping V. album respond to changes in climate. © 2010 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Germination percentage; Habitat fragmentation; Inbreeding; Mistletoe,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957171360

Flowers on H. curassavicum are white, with yellow centers that turn purple as flowers age, and absorb ultraviolet light. I found cymes supporting fewer yellow-centered flowers which contained greater masses of sugar. I compared attractions of H. gracielae adults to inflorescence models displaying the plant's floral colors. Skippers more-frequently approached or landed-on purple models compared with yellow models, and white models elicited fewer approaches than yellow or purple models. Attraction of sootywings to purple and yellow corresponded with numbers of purple- and yellow-centered flowers on inflorescences but not with masses of sugar in individual flowers. Models displaying yellow and purple together, or both colors plus white, elicited fewer approaches but equivalent landings compared with single-color models.

Comparative research on plants has demonstrated the lability of self-incompatibility, but there is little information about the transition on a within-species level from self-incompatibility to predominant selfing. We studied variation in mating system among 18 populations of Arabidopsis lyrata within a phylogenetic context to shed light on the evolution of selfing. Realized and potential mating systems were assessed by genetic analysis with microsatellite markers and hand-self-pollinations on 30 plants from each population. The fraction of self-incompatible plants in a population was highly correlated with the outcrossing rate, showing that the spread of self-compatibility is accompanied by or soon followed by an increase in the rate of selfing. The four predominantly selfing populations (outcrossing rates < 0.25) fell into more than one phylogenetic cluster, suggesting that the transition to selfing occurred more than once independently. Hence, A. lyrata offers an opportunity for the comparative analysis of outcrossing as a predominant mode of reproduction in plants and of the causes of the shift to selfing. © 2010 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",Brassicaceae; Outcrossing rate; Population genetic structure; Realized plant mating system; Self-compatibility; Self-fertilization; Self-incompatibility system; Selfing; SSI,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956593588

The study included (1) direct measurement of dispersal in a controlled environment, and (2) analyses of SGS and estimation of the ratio of pollen to seed flow in three natural populations sampled in linear transects at fixed increasing inter-plant distances. Analysis of SGS with 10 nuclear SSRs showed in all three populations a significant autocorrelation for the distance classes of 1 or 2 m and a negative linear relationship between kinship coefficients, calculated for pairs of individuals, and logarithm of geographical distance between members of the pairs. Major seed dispersal (95%) was found to be within 1.2 m from the mother plant. Pollen flow, estimated from the comparison of nuclear and chloroplast variation, was spatially limited as much as was seed dispersal, and tended to be overestimated when measured at spatial scales exceeding that of SGS. We conclude that combined effects of selfing, occasional outcrossing, localized seed dispersal and high plant density create an equilibrium between drift and gene flow in this species resulting in SGS at a very fine spatial scale. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",gene flow; neighborhood size; pollen flow; spatial genetic structure; wild barley,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956990686

Classifications based on morphology differ from those based on phylogenetic studies, and all treatments include highly heterogeneous assemblages of genera that seem to represent a cross section of the family.

Treatments with the highest pollen density showed a significantly increased fruit growth rate and larger fruit at harvest. High pollen density increased germination rate and gave a faster pollen tube growth, both in vivo and in vitro. Endogenous gibberellin (GA) concentrations increased in pollen tubes soon after germination and the concentration of two growth-active GAs, GA 3, and GA4, was positively correlated to final fruit size, cell numbers in the mesocarp, and pollen tube growth rate.

We sampled surface soil at four Chesapeake Bay brackish tidal wetlands dominated by the non-native (European) haplotype M of Phragmites and used the seedling emergence method to quantity species of seedlings emerging under flooded and non-flooded soil conditions. Within each subestuary, one site was dominated by Phragmites that produced viable seeds (high viability) and the other by Phragmites that did not (low viability). We also described standing vegetation in plots, measured soil salinity, analyzed soil characteristics, and described surrounding land cover. Based on number of emerging seedlings, we found that 284 and 698 Phragmites seedsm-2 occurred at the two high-viability sites, which was significantly higher than seed densities at the low-viability sites (10seedsm-2), and greater than densities reported elsewhere. We also found that emergence of Phragmites seedlings from soil samples was prevented by continuous flooding of 3.5cm of standing water, suggesting that colonization of deep water areas is due to vegetative clonal expansion from Phragmites in adjacent higher elevations. The density of Phragmites seeds was not related to soil salinity or abundance of other species in the seed bank or vegetation, but instead was positively related to greater wave energy disturbance (much longer fetch and more open water) and lower area of wetlands nearby. The seed bank was more species-rich (15-22 species observed) than standing vegetation (3-15 species) at all sites, meaning that the dominance of Phragmites in vegetation does not prevent the development of a diverse seed bank and implying that a species-rich community may establish rapidly following control efforts. Based on these results and our findings in related studies, we postulate that wave energy disturbance generates repeated opportunities for seedling recruitment by Phragmites, which creates stands of Phragmites with higher genotypic diversity. In turn, genetically diverse stands favor greater cross-pollination and production of viable seed. These findings suggest that, in North America, targeting control efforts on non-native Phragmites patches in areas of higher exposure to wave energy may be more effective in reducing source populations than efforts in more protected locations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Chesapeake Bay; Common reed; Genetic diversity; Non-native haplotype; Phragmites australis; Seed banks; Seed viability; Seedling recruitment; Tidal wetlands; Wave disturbance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955841240

Of the seven populations, only a few individuals in three populations flowered and produced seeds. Vegetative individuals predominated the populations. This skewed distribution of vegetative and reproductive individuals within populations was largely due to herbivory by rodents and cattle that prevented flowering. The surveyed populations showed variability in plant height (38.82±4.39 to 95.37±6.73 cm, p = 0.0001), rhizome length (11.8±0.66 to 27.56±3.74 cm, p = 0.007), number and dimensions of basal and upper leaves, the number ofreproductive individuals (0.15 to 2.88 ind. m-2, p = 0.0001) and flower number (16.6±0.67 to 29.12±2.708, p = 0.0001). Breeding experiments confirmed the out-breeding nature of the species and only one insect species foraged and pollinated its flowers.

To examine the match of the airborne pollen composition with the flowering duration of their contributing plants, the phenology of native and non-native plants in various habitats near the pollen-trapping site was undertaken between August 2008 and July 2009. The pollen load was found to have a strong seasonal component associated with the start of spring in September. This is incongruent with the peak flowering season of the total taxa in October. In most taxa, atmospheric pollen signatures appeared before flowering was observed in the field. The presence of most pollen types in the atmosphere also exceeded the observed flowering duration of potential pollen-source taxa. Reasons for this may be related to the sampling effort of phenological monitoring, pollen blown in from earlier flowering populations outside of the sampling area, the ability of pollen to be reworked, and the large pollen production of some wind-pollinated taxa. In 20072008, 15 pollen types dominated the atmosphere, accounting for 90% of the airborne pollen load. The top six pollen types belonged to Betula, Cupressaceae, Myrtaceae, Salix, Poaceae and Ulmus. Comparatively, the annual pollen load of Hobart is lower than in most other Australian cities; however, the pollen signal of Betula is inordinately high. Native plants play a minor role as pollen contributors, despite the proximity of native habitats to the pollen-sampling location.

If long-distance movements are habitual, rare plants in widely scattered locations may benefit from euglossine pollination services. Here we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track the movement of an insect pollinator in a complex and forested environment. Our results indicate that individual male orchid bees (Exaerete frontalis) habitually use large rainforest areas (at least 42-115 ha) on a daily basis. Aerial telemetry located individuals up to 5 km away from their core areas, and bees were often stationary, for variable periods, between flights to successive localities. These data suggest a higher degree of site fidelity than what may be expected in a free living male bee, and has implications for our understanding of biological activity patterns and the evolution of forest pollinators. © 2010 Wikelski et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956512490

However, whether colour morphs differed in other traits has received little attention in previous studies. Here, we report the case of a tropical deceptive orchid in Reunion Island that exhibits three different colour varieties. We investigated patterns of trait variation among colour varieties and found significant differences in floral and inflorescence morphology. Interestingly, we found that most populations included only individuals of a single variety, and that strong differences exist among varieties in spatial distribution and flowering phenology. This situation differs from previously reported cases of floral polymorphism in deceptive orchids where colour morphs co-occur and flower in the same populations. The spatio-temporal variation in flowering suggests that colour varieties have independent reproductive ecologies and are adapted to local conditions. We propose that potential variations in pollinator species abundance or diversity and the co-occurrence of nectar-producing species in the community may have driven the adaptation of each variety to its current pollination niche. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Calanthe sylvatica; Colour polymorphism; Macroglossum milvus; Orchid pollination; Reunion Island; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957787497

How new forms arise in nature has engaged evolutionary biologists since Darwin's seminal treatise on the origin of species. Transposable elements (TEs) may be among the most important internal sources for intraspecific variability. Thus, we aimed to explore the temporal dynamics of several TEs in individual genotypes from a small, marginal population of Aegilops speltoides. A diploid cross-pollinated grass species, it is a wild relative of the various wheat species known for their large genome sizes contributed by an extraordinary number of TEs, particularly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. The population is characterized by high heteromorphy and possesses a wide spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities including supernumerary chromosomes, heterozygosity for translocations, and variability in the chromosomal position or number of 45S and 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sites. We propose that variability on the morphological and chromosomal levels may be linked to variability at the molecular level and particularly in TE proliferation. Results. Significant temporal fluctuation in the copy number of TEs was detected when processes that take place in small, marginal populations were simulated. It is known that under critical external conditions, outcrossing plants very often transit to self-pollination. Thus, three morphologically different genotypes with chromosomal aberrations were taken from a wild population of Ae. speltoides, and the dynamics of the TE complex traced through three rounds of selfing. It was discovered that: (i) various families of TEs vary tremendously in copy number between individuals from the same population and the selfed progenies; (ii) the fluctuations in copy number are TE-family specific; (iii) there is a great difference in TE copy number expansion or contraction between gametophytes and sporophytes; and (iv) a small percentage of TEs that increase in copy number can actually insert at novel locations and could serve as a bona fide mutagen. Conclusions. We hypothesize that TE dynamics could promote or intensify morphological and karyotypical changes, some of which may be potentially important for the process of microevolution, and allow species with plastic genomes to survive as new forms or even species in times of rapid climatic change. © 2010 Belyayev et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956369865

Magnolia ovata (A.St.-Hil.) Spreng. produces ?56g, bisexual, protogynous and scented flowers. Two distinct episodes of thermogenesis occur during anthesis: one beginning at about sunset and lasting ?3h in the female phase and another that occurs synchronously 24h later and lasting 4h in the male phase. Female stage flowers produce up to 0.36W to reach 27.3C, which is 3.9C above ambient air. In the male stage, corresponding values are 0.79W, 29.7C and 5.4C, respectively. Most heat is generated in the petals in both phases (74 and 65%). Maximum, mass-specific rate of respiration is 23nmols-1g-1 in the petals and 100nmols-1g -1 in the anthers. The flowers are apparently not thermoregulatory, because respiration rate decreases, rather than increases, with decreasing ambient temperature. Scarab beetles, Cyclocephala literata, enter the floral chamber created by the petals in the female phase, mate, consume floral parts (mainly petals) and then depart in the male phase. Temperatures maintained in the floral chamber are sufficient to provide beetles with significant energy savings during their activities in both phases. Thermogenesis is, therefore, consistent with volatilisation of floral fragrances and energy rewards to beetle visitors. © 2010 CSIRO.",calorimetry; heat production; Magnoliaceae; respiratory rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955237260

As shown in preliminary observations, the Mutisia speciosa florets had long style branches (7 mm), bifurcate only at the apex (about 1.5 mm) and juxtaposed along the remaining length. The objective was to locate the stigmatic areas in M. speciosa. For this purpose, neutral red, 3% hydrogen peroxide and hand pollinations were used. For the pollinations, florets with cut apical portion of the branches (about 2 mm) and florets with intact branches were used. In the first group of florets, the pollen was deposited along the margins of the juxtaposed branches (about 5 mm), and in the second, the pollen was ventrally deposited on the bifurcated apical portion. Some of these florets were left on the plant until fruiting and others were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope to check pollen tube growth. The neutral red test defined two ventro-marginal bands fused at the apex of each style branch, consisting of papillose cells. Intense bubbling in the hydrogen peroxide test showed that only the bands are receptive. The pollinations resulted in fruit sets and growth of pollen tubes, confirming that the bands are receptive along their entire length.

In two localities, we studied the species' breeding system and associations with flower-visiting insects, along with an analysis of its floral scent composition. The fruit set of self-incompatible P. acutatum was high, more than 90%, and inflorescences were exclusively pollinated by one species of scarab beetle, Cyclocephala celata (Scarabaeidae, Dynastinae). Pollinators are drawn toward the inflorescences at dusk by strong floral fragrances given off during the female phase of anthesis, along with endogenous heating of the spadix, whose temperatures were recorded at more than 11°C above ambient air. Two other species of flower-visiting Cyclocephala were also consistently recovered in blacklight trappings during the flowering period of P. acutatum. The fact that only C. celata was found in association with P. acutatum suggests a local reproductive dependence of the plant to this scarab beetle species. Dihydro-?-ionone and 2-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-hexanone, a rare volatile molecule so far unreported as a floral compound, together accounted for more than 97% of the unique scent composition of P. acutatum and might be involved in specific attraction of C. celata. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Cyclocephala; Floral volatiles; Pollination specificity; Reproductive success; Thermogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956042375

This situation has impeded evaluation of the extent to which selection acts on attraction or specialized key floral traits involved in the plant-pollinator phenotypic interphase. We studied pollinator-mediated selection in four populations of Nierembergia linariifolia, a self-incompatible and oil-secreting plant pollinated exclusively by oil-collecting bees. We evaluated whether floral traits experience variable selection among populations and whether attraction and fit traits are heterogeneously selected across populations. Populations differed in every flower trait and selection was consistently observed for corolla size and flower shape, two traits involved in the first steps of the pollination process. However, we found no selection acting on mechanical-fit traits. The observation that selection occurred upon attraction rather than mechanical-fit traits, suggests that plants are not currently evolving fine-tuned morphological adaptations to local pollinators and that phenotypic matching is not necessarily an expected outcome in this specialized pollination system. © 2010 The Authors.

At higher latitudes, pod set at low temperatures is one of the most important processes for efficient soybean production. The present study was carried out to determine which flower developmental stage was most sensitive to low temperature and how low temperature interrupts the pod setting process. Soybean flowers at various developmental stages were subjected to low temperatures, and the percentage elongation of pods was subsequently measured. Two low temperature-sensitive stages were found. The first was an early developmental stage approximately 12.5 days before the anthesis of individual flowers. The second stage occurred 3-4 days before anthesis. An investigation of the pollen grain number on stigma suggests that insufficient pollination causes low pod set under low temperature stress at both temperature-sensitive stages. Tetrad-shaped abnormal pollen grains were observed when flowers were subjected to low temperature at the first sensitive stage; thus, this stage might be the tetrad stage or the stage prior to tetrad formation. Furthermore, at the first sensitive stage, pollen development deficiency was one of the causes of poor pod set under low temperature conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated whether floral longevity favours pollen removal from the anthers over fecundity (seed set) in an ornithophilous species that does not undergo pollen limitation.MethodsField investigations were conducted on floral longevity, nectar production, pollinator behaviour, and variations in fruit set (FS), mean number of seeds per fruit (MSF) and pollen removal by hummingbirds (PR) during the anthesis of Salvia sellowiana in south-east Brazil.Key ResultsAnthesis of flowers exposed to pollinators lasted 4 d, as well as on flowers with pollen removed from the anthers or deposited on the stigma. The longevity of bagged flowers was significantly higher (approx. 9 d). FS and PR reached 87·2 and 90 , respectively, in natural conditions. PR increased gradually over the period of anthesis; however, FS and MSF reached their maxima in the first hours of anthesis. Nectar production was continuous, but the secretion rate was reduced after pollination. The removal of nectar from non-pollinated flowers stimulated its production.ConclusionsThe longevity of anthesis in S. sellowiana seems to be related to the mechanism of gradual dispensing of pollen, resulting in greater male reproductive success. This is in agreement with the pollen-donation hypothesis. The small number of ovules (four) of S. sellowiana and the high frequency and the foraging mode of its pollinators may favour the selection for floral longevity driven by male fitness in this system. © The Author 2010.",Atlantic Forest; breeding system; female reproductive success; Lamiaceae; male reproductive success; microevolution; phenotypic selection; pollen presentation; pollination biology; traplining,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956015355

Pollen limitation may be a consequence of changes in pollinator abundance, diversity and identity. However, no empirical evidence exists concerning the consequences that the spatial variation in pollinator fauna has on pollen limitation intensity and plant reproduction. In this study, we test the effect that changes in flower-visitor abundance, diversity and identity exert on the occurrence and strength of pollen limitation by experimentally quantifying pollen limitation in eight populations of Erysimum mediohispanicum, a pollination-generalist plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. 2. Pollen limitation was accounted for by using a comprehensive estimator, the net reproductive rate (R0). Nevertheless, we also determined which components of plant reproduction, from ovule fertilization to seedling survival, were more intensely pollen-limited. Finally, we explored whether the spatial variation in pollen limitation intensity was related to among-population changes in flower-visitor abundance, diversity and identity. 3. The whole reproductive cycle of E. mediohispanicum was pollen-limited, although pollen limitation occurred more strongly during the ovule fertilization and seed-production phases than during fruit ripening or seedling emergence and establishment. 4. There was a significant among-population difference in pollen limitation intensity. Pollen limitation strength was associated with variations in flower-visitor diversity, and identity. Populations with lower flower-visitor diversity and with many low-efficiency pollinators (i.e. beetles) showed stronger pollen limitation. 5. Synthesis. Our study shows that the intensity of pollen limitation at the population level may depend on several characteristics of the assemblage of flower-visiting insects, such as their abundance, diversity and identity. Our results suggest that any impoverishment of pollinator diversity or any alteration in the specific composition of the pollinator assemblage may exacerbate pollen limitation. © 2010 The Authors.

Interaction networks provide a framework that has proven useful in ecological research. However, they are considered time consuming and too expensive for conservation purposes. We investigate whether it is possible to sample interaction networks cost-efficiently and whether a compromise exists between data quality and amount of resources required to sample the data by using a highly resolved mutualistic plant-pollinator network sampled over two years in Norway. The dataset was resampled with decreasing sampling intensity to simulate decreasing monitoring costs and we investigated the cost-efficiency of these monitoring regimes. The success in monitoring community structure varied largely with sampling intensity and the descriptor investigated. One major result was that a large proportion of the functionally most important species in the community, both plants and insects, could be identified with relatively little sampling. For example, monitoring only in ""peak-season"" , which costs ca. 20% relative to full monitoring, resulted in recording of 70% (in 2003) or 85% (in 2004) of the top 20 most functionally important pollinator species. Also, peak-season monitoring resulted in relatively precise estimates of several network descriptors. We present a first estimation of the full cost (travel time, sampling time and taxonomic services) of constructing pollination networks with different sampling effort. We recommend monitoring plant-pollinator networks in temperate regions during peak-season to cost-efficiently collect data for practical habitat management of ecosystem functioning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost efficiency; Habitat management; Mutualism; Network; Plant-pollinator interaction; Sampling effort,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955092807

We expand this framework to address changes in the number of links and species in pollination webs from 12 isolated hills, ranging in area from tens to thousands of hectares, immersed in the agriculture matrix of the Argentine Pampas. We also studied whether total interaction frequency is partitioned more evenly among individual links in richer webs. Our results reveal a direct effect of area on the number of links and species present in each pollination web. However, link richness increased twofold faster than species richness with area. These area effects were not confounded by sampling effort or correlated incidence of exotic species, despite widespread habitat disturbance. Habitat proximity, an inverse measure of isolation, had a marginally significant influence on link but not on species richness. Increased link number was associated with decreasing dominance by any particular interaction and increasing interaction evenness. Despite the strong area effect, a rich pollination web sampled from a small, protected sierra suggests that simple conservation measures, such as reduced grazing and fire suppression, may effectively preserve much local interaction diversity. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Area effect; Argentina; Dominance; Evenness; Habitat island; Interaction diversity; Island biogeography; Isolation; Link diversity; Pampas; Pollination webs; Species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956427720

Growth of pollen tubes from artificial self- and cross-pollination was also examined. Field investigations were conducted on insect flower visitation during the blooming period of R. dumulosa. Relationships among mating system, insect flower visitation frequency and environmental factors were assessed.Important FindingsThe results showed that (i) R. dumulosa has a mixed-mating system: it is self-compatible and primarily outbreeding, with the multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) ranging from 0.589 ± 0.078 (± standard deviation) to 0.846 ± 0.077; inbreeding coefficients of maternal parents (F) were zero, indicating that inbreeding depression was intense. (ii) Light intensity and temperature impacted the visitation of the principal pollinators, the syrphid Eristalis tenax and the bumblebee Bombus pyrosoma. (iii) Population size plays an important role in the mating system and pollination. Populations received more frequent visits by the principal pollinators usually had higher outcrossing rates. Pollination to some extent affects the mating system of R. dumulosa and it is important to maintain large populations to prevent further inbreeding and to maintain pollinators to facilitate outcrossing. © The Author 2010.",Allozyme; Mating system; Pollen tube growth; Pollination; Rhodiola dumulosa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956029868

In Walkerella sp.2, the overall sex ratio increased with the proportion of figs parasitized in a crop, but this was not the case for Walkerella sp.1.

Few detailed studies, however, have assessed the contribution of African parrots to forest ecology by quantifying the potential net benefit of seed and flower predation by parrots for most tree species in their diet. Due to the incidence of pollen on the heads of Meyer's Parrots when feeding on Leguminosae flowers and the dispersal of viable seeds to the ground during seed predation, we compared destruction rates, when feeding on pods, fruits and flowers, with dispersal rates of viable seeds to the ground and frequency of head contact with reproductive apparatus to estimate net benefit from Meyer's Parrot feeding activity. Meyer's Parrots were not implicated in endo- or epizoochory, but they dropped uneaten fruit pulp and seeds to the ground during feeding bouts, thus providing ripe, undamaged seeds to secondary seed dispersers. This link with forest recruitment was weak, as all tree species utilized by Meyer's Parrots either had more significant primary dispersal agents or were primarily wind-dispersed. In most cases, the negative effect of seed predation outweighed any positive effects in terms of dispersal, whereby almost three times more seeds were consumed or destroyed than were dispersed to the ground. Significantly, only Sclerocarya birrea caffra recorded marginal net dispersal benefit from utilization by Meyer's Parrots. Due to low relative resource abundance and high destruction rate, feeding activity on Berchemia discolor may be significant enough to influence its spatial distribution and abundance. Utilization of flowers of Kigelia africana and Adansonia digitata by parrots likely had a significant negative impact on pollination. Feeding on Acacia nigrescens flowers, however, was potentially advantageous to their pollination. We conclude that Poicephalus parrots are net consumers of ripe, undamaged seeds and flowers, thus having an overall negative impact on forest recruitment in subtropical Africa. © 2009 The Authors.

To gain insight into the mechanism underlying this growth response, the relationships among silk elongation kinetics, cell wall biophysical properties, pollen tube growth, and expansin protein abundance were investigated. The inhibition of silk elongation became apparent beyond 12h after pollination. Pollinated walls were less responsive in assays of extension induced by pollen ?-expansin. Expansin protein abundance and endogenous expansin activity were not considerably reduced after pollination. Silk wall plastic compliance was significantly reduced 6h post-pollination and beyond, suggesting that the wall undergoes structural modifications leading to its rigidification in response to pollination. The reduction in the plastic compliance occurred locally and progressively, shortly after pollen tubes traversed through a region of silk. Though numerous pollen grains germinated and initiated pollen tubes at the silk tip, the density of pollen tubes gradually declined along the length of the silk and only 1-2 reached the ovary even 24h after pollination.

Two methods used to restore threatened ecosystems are: (1) unassisted forest regeneration, which promotes the establishment of plants and fauna arriving from surrounding habitats and (2) assisted restoration, which involves the reconstruction of forests by planting native or exotic trees. Functional attributes, such as plant-pollinator interactions, are essential for ecosystem recovery. Unfortunately, information regarding the effect of restoration on pollination systems is limited. Forty years ago, a tropical cloud forest in Colombia was restored through unassisted forest regeneration, as well as by establishing monospecific plantations of the exotic Chinese ash Fraxinus chinensis. The understories of both restoration strategies were colonized by the beetle-pollinated aroid Xanthosoma daguense. Using isolation-by-distance and multi-strata mark-recapture models, I estimated in each restoration strategy two fundamental pollination processes: (1) the magnitude of X. daguense pollination neighborhood and (2) the directionality of pollen flow among plants colonizing both restoration strategies. In addition, I recorded pollinator visits and fruit production for X. daguense in each restored habitats. The pollination neighborhood of X. daguense in the ash plantation is two times larger than its pollination neighborhood in natural regeneration. Inflorescences in the ash plantation donated 10 times more pollen to inflorescences in natural regeneration. Plants in natural regeneration produced two times more infructescences and more fruits than plants in ash plantation. Results show that the selection of different restoration strategies can alter two major components of plant-pollinator interactions in plants colonizing restored habitats, pollination neighborhoods, and pollen flow within the population. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",Colombia; Cyclocephala spp; Isolation-by-distance model; Multi-strata mark-recapture models,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956502126

We focus on three services, namely the provision of timber, the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the supporting service of bee pollination for coffee production. Possible trade-offs between the different ecosystem services might result in a reduced attractiveness of afforestation projects when taking pollination services into account. We found that economic losses due to a limited reduction of tree density of a Cordia alliodora plantation can be overcompensated by generating pollination services to adjacent coffee agroforestry systems. Thus, for moderate silvicultural interventions such trade-offs do not necessarily occur. Including additional ecosystem services such as biological pest control or seed dispersal, which are also associated with the enhanced functional biodiversity in less dense tree plantations, might further emphasize the hump-shaped relationship between tree density and forest revenues. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Agroforestry; Coffee; Ecosystem Services; Reforestation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955364287

The females result from a genetic mutation which impairs pollen production in hermaphrodite plants. Most previous models for the evolution of gynodioecy do not take into account any spatial detail, which might be expected to play an important role in populations with short range interactions caused by poor or no locomotion. In this article we present a generalised mean-field analysis (which ignores any spatial detail), together with stochastic spatial simulations, to investigate the spatial effect on the evolution of gynodioecy. We show that, in a population of hermaphrodites where male sterility is caused by a dominant allele in a nuclear gene, mean-field calculations greatly underestimate the reproductive advantage females require to become viable under spatial constraints. This suggests that gynodioecy is less likely to evolve in plants with more localised pollination and seed setting. This may have implications for the evolution of dioecy, a breeding system in plants where the population consists of males and females, as gynodioecy is thought to be a route to dioecy. Our results also demonstrate that a lower frequency of females should be expected for gynodioecious populations when interactions are local. This is relevant when comparing the results of breeding experiments with observations of female frequency in the wild. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Gynodioecy; Lattice; Sexual reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954559132

Herbicide resistance was used as a marker for gene flow to organic populations, which are not under herbicide selective pressure. Organic fields contained on average 74.5% herbicide-resistant plants (80.1% in conventional fields). Identical resistance alleles were found in neighbouring organic and conventional fields. AFLP analysis revealed that populations from organic and conventional fields had similar neutral genetic diversity. Massive pollen flow from conventional fields is likely chiefly responsible for the genetic makeup of A. myosuroides populations from organic fields. Using a demo-genetic model, we propose that demographic collapses of populations due to effective weed control enhance gene flow towards these populations. Fields with a low weed density could act as 'genetic sinks' that would facilitate the diffusion of genes from neighbouring, dense weed populations. Populations of allogamous wind-pollinated weed species like A. myosuroides occurring in neighbouring fields are therefore clearly not independent units.

Because Erythronium grandiflorum is an early-season bloomer, alterations in its phenology may have serious implications for many North American Rocky Mountain communities, including changes in resource availability for pollinators and herbivores. Methods: We investigated whether changes in the snowmelt date, summer temperature, and summer precipitation have altered the timing and abundance of flowering in E. grandiflorum by collecting long-term data on floral abundance from 1975-2008 in a series of 2 × 2 m plots at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) in Gothic, Colorado in the United States. Key results: Snowmelt date and mean summer temperature were negatively correlated. Over the 30-yr study, the snowmelt date advanced by 4.14 d/decade, and mean summer temperature increased by 0.38°C/decade. Summer precipitation was variable, showing no change. The first, peak, and last flowering dates of E. grandiflorum advanced an average of 3.2 d/decade. Further-more, earlier snowmelt and greater summer precipitation in the previous year led to earlier flowering in E. grandiflorum. There was no change in flowering abundance in this species, indicating it may be controlled by a complex set of abiotic and biotic variables. Conclusions: Our study indicates that snowmelt is arriving earlier at the RMBL, which has caused earlier flowering in E. grandiflorum. Because alterations in phenology can disrupt important ecological interactions, information on potential phenological shifts in species that interact with E. grandiflorum is essential in determining the net effect of climate-driven alterations in phenology. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Climate change; Erythronium; Flowering phenology; Glacier lily; Liliaceae; Precipitation; Rocky mountain biological laboratory; Snowmelt date,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049309956

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Spiranthes spiralis is a long-lived orchid species that is widely distributed in the southern part of the British Isles, southern Europe and the Mediterranean. It is native to Britain. Its most characteristic habitats are unimproved, well-grazed grasslands on dry calcareous soils, particularly chalk and limestone, cliff-tops and grassy coastal dunes. It can also be found in garden lawns and, less frequently, in slightly acidic heathland habitat. It occurs on both dry and wet soils, but it does not tolerate heavy shading. 3. Spiranthes spiralis is a non-bulbous geophyte regenerating by sexual reproduction and by vegetative spread, although the latter is limited. Vegetative reproduction involves the growth of a lateral bud on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tubers, and eventually the connection between the mother plant and the vegetatively produced daughter plant withers away. 4. The main perennating organ is a tuberous root. In most years, the tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and at the end of every year of the plant's life, the tuber is completely replaced. In some cases, however, only part of the reserves is exhausted in flowering and, when this happens, a tuber may survive for several years. Vegetative adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed. It most commonly lasts for only 1 year, but sometimes plants can remain dormant for several years. 5. The species is not autogamous and pollinators - mainly bumblebees and bees - are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Natural levels of fruit set are usually <50%. Hand-pollination increases fruit set to c. 75%, indicating that reproduction is to some extent pollen-limited. Sexual reproduction comes at a cost, and few individuals flower for two or more consecutive years. Within fruits many very small seeds are produced, but most are dispersed to a distance of less than a few dm from maternal plants, leading to strongly aggregated distribution patterns and significant spatial genetic structuring within natural populations. 6. Spiranthes spiralis has suffered significant declines in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, populations were lost from many sites before 1930, when many pastures were re-sown or converted to arable land. Losses of populations due to agricultural intensification (ploughing of old fields and fertilization) still occur and are the major causes of the decline of the species. Conservation of remnant populations primarily requires the maintenance of a short turf by grazing, most often by sheep. Ideally, grazing should be suspended during flowering and seed set, allowing new recruits to become established and adult plants to flower profusely and to produce seeds. © 2010 The Authors.

Two hybrid and one open-pollinated B. napus varieties with three consecutive generations produced from each variety were grown at varying densities in a wheat stand over 5 site-years. Yield loss depended on the density of B. napus in relation to total plant density. Generational differences in B. napus seedlings resulted in differences in wheat yield losses. Brassica napus densities at maturity provided a more robust model of wheat yield loss, as there were differences in wheat yield losses due to the interaction of generation and variety of B. napus. Commercial seed generations were the most competitive plants, while volunteer generations were less competitive. The amount of yield loss caused by volunteer B. napus was highly variable. The availability of low-priced herbicides, and the competitive ability of volunteer B. napus may allow for economic thresholds concerning weed control to be surpassed at low densities of volunteer B. napus populations.",Competition; Feral; Hybrid; Mature density; Open-pollinated; Seedling density; Seedling mortality; Volunteer weed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956918698

By combining season-long pesticide applications of various insecticides and fungicides into a metric based on the International Organization for Biological and Integrated Control (IOBC) toxicity ratings, we evaluate season-long pesticide impacts on communities of indigenous and exotic arthropods across 61 vineyards assessed for an entire growing season. The composition of arthropod communities, identified mostly at the family level, but in some cases at the species level, was altered depending on season-long pesticide use. Numbers of mostly indigenous parasitoids, predatory mites, and coccinellids in the canopy, as well as carabid/tenebrionid beetles and some spider families on the ground, were decreased at higher cumulative pesticide metric scores. In contrast, numbers of one invasive millipede species (Ommatoiulus moreletti Lucas, Julida: Julidae) increased under higher cumulative pesticide metric scores. These changing community patterns were detected despite the absence of broad-spectrum insecticide applications in the vineyards. Pesticide effects were mostly due to indoxacarb and sulphur, applied as a fungicide. The reduction of beneficial arthropods and increase in an invasive herbivorous millipede under high cumulative pesticide metric scores highlights the need to manage nontarget season-long pesticide impacts in vineyards. A cumulative pesticide metric, based on IOBC toxicity ratings, provides a way of assessing overall toxicity effects, giving managers a means to estimate and consider potential negative season-long pesticide impacts on ecosystem services provided through arthropod communities. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Beneficial insect; Chemical impact; Community response; International organization for biological and integrated control (IOBC); Invasive; Invertebrate; Ommatoiulus moreletti; Pesticide; South australia; Vineyard,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956443972

This review discusses the identities and attributes of genes that contribute to reproductive isolation (RI) in plants, compares them with animal speciation genes and investigates what these genes can tell us about speciation.ScopeForty-one candidate speciation genes were identified in the plant literature. Of these, seven contributed to pre-pollination RI, one to post-pollination, prezygotic RI, eight to hybrid inviability, and 25 to hybrid sterility. Genes, gene families and genetic pathways that were frequently found to underlie the evolution of RI in different plant groups include the anthocyanin pathway and its regulators (pollinator isolation), S RNase-SI genes (unilateral incompatibility), disease resistance genes (hybrid necrosis), chimeric mitochondrial genes (cytoplasmic male sterility), and pentatricopeptide repeat family genes (cytoplasmic male sterility).ConclusionsThe most surprising conclusion from this review is that identities of genes underlying both prezygotic and postzygotic RI are often predictable in a broad sense from the phenotype of the reproductive barrier. Regulatory changes (both cis and trans) dominate the evolution of pre-pollination RI in plants, whereas a mix of regulatory mutations and changes in protein-coding genes underlie intrinsic postzygotic barriers. Also, loss-of-function mutations and copy number variation frequently contribute to RI. Although direct evidence of positive selection on speciation genes is surprisingly scarce in plants, analyses of gene family evolution, along with theoretical considerations, imply an important role for diversifying selection and genetic conflict in the evolution of RI. Unlike in animals, however, most candidate speciation genes in plants exhibit intraspecific polymorphism, consistent with an important role for stochastic forces and/or balancing selection in development of RI in plants. © The Author 2010.",cytoplasmic male sterility; ecological isolation; hybrid breakdown; hybrid inviability; hybrid necrosis; hybrid sterility; mating system isolation; pollinator isolation; reproductive isolation; restoration; Speciation; unilateral incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956013849

However, few comparative studies on plant distribution have assessed these traits simultaneously. Pollinator richness and frequency of visits, autonomous self-pollination ability, reproductive output (i.e., reproductive traits), seed bank strategy and seedling density (i.e., regenerative traits) were compared between the narrowly distributed Ipomoea rubriflora O'Donnell (Convolvulaceae) and its widespread congener Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth. The narrowly distributed species showed higher ecological specialization to pollinators and lower autonomous self-pollination ability. Frequency of visits, natural seed/ovule ratio and fruit set, and total fruit production did not differ between species. However, the number of seeds produced per fruit was lower in the narrowly distributed species, translating into lower total seed production per plant. Indeed, I. rubriflora formed smaller transient and persistent seed banks and showed lower seedling density than the widespread I. purpurea. These reproductive and regenerative trait results suggest that the narrowly distributed species may have lower colonization and persistence ability than its widespread congener. They further suggest that the negative effects of lower fecundity in the narrowly distributed species might persist in time through the long-lasting effects of total seed production on seed bank size, reducing the species' ability to buffered environmental stochasticity. However, other regenerative traits, such as seed size, and processes such as pre- and post-dispersal seed predation, might modulate the effects of plant fecundity on plant colonization and persistence ability and thus range size. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Autonomous self-pollination ability; Ecological specialization to pollinators; Rarity/commonness; Seed bank; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956470877

We investigated the reproductive ecology of two subspecies of the tufted evening primrose, Oenothera cespitosa, which occupy geographically and edaphically distinct habitats in western North America: O. cespitosa subsp. navajoensis inhabits sandstone soils on open sites or rocky slopes in the Colorado Plateau and O. cespitosa subsp. cespitosa grows in clay soils on talus slopes and exposed rocky ridges in the western Great Plains and northern Rocky Mountains of the United States. Methods: Pollen augmentation and selfing experiments, floral visitor observations, and single-visit effectiveness experiments were conducted over 4 years to examine the breeding system and spatiotemporal variation in pollinator behavior, assemblage, and abundance at different populations for each subspecies. Key results: Both subspecies of O. cespitosa were self-incompatible and pollen-limited, suggesting that the relative abundance, effectiveness, and movement patterns of different insects as pollinators influenced the quality and quantity of seed production in these plants. Medium-sized vespertine hawkmoths (Hyles lineata, Sphinx vashti) were effective pollinators when present, as were large matinal bees (Anthophora affabilis, A. dammersi, Xylocopa tabaniformis androleuca), whereas small oligolectic Lasioglossum bees primarily functioned as pollen thieves in the evening and morning. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of variability of pollinator composition and abundance in the evolution of plant breeding systems and reproductive success at varying spatial and temporal scales. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Bees; Breeding system; Hawkmoths; Oenothera cespitosa; Onagraceae; Plant reproductive success; Pollination; Spatiotemporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049248055

They are highly conserved from prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms. However, their precise roles in plant physiology and development remain to be clarified. Here we report that the mutation in the gene SLOW WALKER3 (SWA3) results in the slow and retarded progression of mitosis during megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis. SWA3 is a putative RNA helicase of the DEAD-box subfamily. Mutant megagametophyte development is arrested at four- or eight-nucleate stages, furthermore, one of the synergids in about half of the mutant embryo sacs displays abnormal polarity, with its nucleus locating at the chalazal end, instead of the micropylar end in the wild-type. Transmission of the mutation through female gametophytes is severely reduced in swa3. However, a small portion of mutant embryo sacs are able to develop into mature and functional female gametophytes when pollination was postponed. The SWA3 in Arabidopsis is a homolog of Dbp8 in yeast. Dbp8 interacts with Efs2 and is essential for biogenesis of 18S rRNA in yeast. Our data suggest that SWA3 may form a complex with AtEfs2 and take roles in ribosomal biogenesis as RNA helicase during megagametogenesis in Arabidopsis. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955967219

Sucrose fed to the plants can reverse the effects. To test whether the reversal acts generally by replacing the losses from photosynthesis, sucrose was fed to the stems of shaded maize plants (Zea mays) during reproductive development.MethodsShading was adjusted to mimic the inhibition of photosynthesis around the time of pollination in water-limited plants. Glucose and starch were imaged and quantified in the female florets. Sucrose was infused into the stems to vary the sugar flux to the ovaries.Key ResultsOvaries normally grew rapidly and contained large amounts of glucose and starch, with a glucose gradient favouring glucose movement into the developing ovary. Shade inhibited photosynthesis and diminished ovary and kernel size, weight, and glucose and starch contents compared with controls. The glucose gradient became small. Sucrose fed to the stem reversed these losses, and kernels were as large as the controls.ConclusionsDespite similar inhibition of photosynthesis, the depletion of ovary glucose and starch was not as severe in shade as during a comparable water deficit. Ovary abortion prevalent during water deficits did not occur in the shade. It is suggested that this difference may have been caused by more translocation in shade than during the water deficit, which prevented low sugar contents necessary to trigger an up-regulation of senescence genes known to be involved in abortion. Nevertheless, sucrose feeding reversed kernel size losses and it is concluded that feeding acted generally to replace diminished photosynthetic activity. © The Author 2010.",Abortion; glucose; ovary development; pedicel; photosynthesis; pollination; shade; starch; sucrose; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956047386

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), is widely used in western North America to enhance pollination of alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., grown for seed production. Feral populations have been documented but have been little-studied, We used trap-nests of a wide range of diameters (39 mm) to study a feral population at a wildflower seed farm in Montana. Adult females accepted all hole sizes but tended to provision nest tunnels of smaller diameters (34 mm) than those provided in managed populations (57 mm). Progeny, especially females, from intermediate- and large-diameter nests averaged larger body size that those in the two smallest nest-diameter classes. Offspring were often larger in nests with greater numbers of offspring, indicating that there was no trade-off between offspring size and number within nests. Individual nests tended to contain a relatively small range of progeny sizes and those sizes tended to vary among nests of the same diameter. Previous studies of M. rotundata indicate that heritability of body size is low, most offspring within nests are full siblings, and variation in offspring size is due to variation in the amount of provision provided by mothers. Thus, the fact that body size varied among families probably related to variation in provisioning capabilities among females. We also found evidence that offspring size varied spatially but that seasonal trends in offspring size were weak. Sex ratio varied among different nest sizes, but only the smallest and largest nests produced biased ratios. Sex ratios were less male-biased than in commercially managed populations of M. rotundata. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",body size; Megachile rotundata; trap-nest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956164913

In field observations, it was noted that the putative hybrids between R. delavayi Franch. and R. cyanocarpum (Franch.) Franch. ex W.W. Sm. had intermediate morphologies. On the basis of morphology, chloroplast DNA (trnL-rpl32) and nuclear DNA (waxy), hybrids and parental species were identified. Hybridization occurred in both directions, but was asymmetrical, with R. delavayi as the major maternal parent. Reciprocal hand pollination treatments showed that either species, as pollen donor or pollen receiver, could produce fruits. It was noted that fruit set varied among treatments. The same pollinators (bumblebees) were shared in both parental species. From these results, we conclude that individuals with intermediate morphologies are indeed of hybrid origin from natural hybridization between R. cyanocarpum and R. delavayi.

We investigated responses of insect visitors to experimental manipulations of flower color in the New Zealand alpine. Native syrphid flies (Allograpta and Platycheirus) and solitary bees (Hylaeus and Leioproctus) showed distinct preferences for visiting certain flower species. These responses were determined, in part, by flower color, as insects also responded to experimental manipulations of visible petal color in 7 out of 11 tests with different combinations of flower species and insect type. When preferences were detected, syrphid flies chose yellow over white petals regardless of flower species, whereas Hylaeus chose white over yellow Ourisia glandulosa. In some cases, the strength and direction of color preference depended on the context of other floral traits, in which case the response usually favored the familiar, normal combination of traits. Syrphid flies also visited in response to floral morphological traits but did not show preference based on UV reflectance. The unusually high preponderance of white flowers in the New Zealand alpine is not explained by complete generalization of flower color choice. Instead, the insect visitors show preferences based on color, including colors other than white, along with other floral traits. Furthermore, they can respond in complex ways to combinations of floral cues, suggesting that traits may act in nonadditive ways in determining pollinator visitation. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Alpine plants; Bee; Brachyglottis; Brachyscome; Flower color; New zealand; Ourisia; Pollinator preference; Syrphid fly; UV,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956609768

However, in most species, if ovules are not fertilized around anthesis the pistil irreversibly loses its growth capacity. We used physiological, molecular, and transcriptomic tools to characterize the postanthesis development of the unfertilized Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) pistil. Surprisingly, developmental processes that have been previously described in developing Arabidopsis fruits, such as the collapse of the adaxial epidermis, differentiation of a sclerenchyma layer in the adaxial subepidermis and the dehiscence zone, and valve dehiscence, were also observed in the unfertilized pistil. We determined that senescence is first established in the transmitting tract, stigma, and ovules immediately after anthesis, and that the timing of senescence in the stigma and ovules correlates with the loss of fruit-set responsiveness of the pistil to pollen and the hormone gibberellin (GA), respectively. Moreover, we showed that mutants with altered ovule development have impaired fruit-set response to the GA gibberellic acid, which further indicates that the presence of viable ovules is required for fruit-set responsiveness to GAs in the unfertilized pistil. Our data suggest that a fertilizationindependent developmental program controls many of the processes during post-anthesis development, both in unfertilized pistils and seeded fruits, and point to a key role of the ovule in the capacity of pistils to undergo fruit set in response to GA. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956684683

However, phylogenetic relationships within the order are poorly resolved, prompting the need for a reevaluation of pollen and tapetum characters, which have proved useful in other monocot groups, such as lilioids. Development of monosulcate pollen in Aponogeton (Aponogetonaceae) and Butomus (Butomaceae) and of pantoporate pollen in Echinodorus (Alismataceae) is examined here. Phylogenetic mapping of pollen and tapetum characters, based on both original observations and an extensive literature search, demonstrates that Alismatales are characterized by a potential synapomorphy: a plasmodial tapetum. Microsporogenesis is successive, a character shared with Acorus and probably other potential outgroups. Linked character syndromes, involving thin-walled or exineless, inaperturate (omniaperturate) pollen with a smooth or reticulate surface, have evolved iteratively within the order, probably related to the aquatic or semiaquatic habit of many alismatids. Extremely long (up to 1500 ?m) filamentous pollen, associated with hydrophilous pollination, occurs in three closely related families (Cymodoceaceae, Posidoniaceae, and Zosteraceae). Pantoporate spiny pollen is a potential synapomorphy for Alismataceae (including Limnocharitaceae). Alismatales share some characters (plasmodial tapetum and reniform pollen) with Pandanales, although further work is required to investigate whether this apparent homoplasy is of systematic significance. Tofieldiaceae possess two interesting apomorphies (simultaneous microsporogenesis and a secretory tapetum) that are also found in Petrosaviales and some Dioscoreales. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Alismatales; Development; Monocotyledons; Phylogeny; Pollen; Tapetum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956015413

Despite earlier suggestions that in plants the evolution or cosexuality vs. dioecy, as well as sex allocation among cosexuals, is affected by seed and pollen dispersal, no formal model has explicitly used dispersal distances to address this problem. Here, we present a game-theory model as well as a simulation study that fills in this gap. Our model predicts that dioecy should evolve if seeds and pollen disperse widely and that sex allocation among cosexuals should be biased towards whichever sex function produces more widely dispersing units. Dispersal limitations stabilize cosexuality by reinforcing competition between spatially clumped dispersal units from the same source, leading to saturating fitness returns that render sexual specialization unprofitable. However, limited pollen dispersal can also increase the risk of selfing, thus potentially selecting for dioecy as an outbreeding mechanism. Finally, we refute a recent claim that cosexuals should always invest equally in both sex functions. © 2010 The Authors.

In plants, several genes have also been identified to encode the proteins that share homology with the vertebrate SiaTs. However, very little is known about their functions in plants. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel Arabidopsis gene, MALE GAMETOPHYTE DEFECTIVE 2 (MGP2) that encodes a sialyltransferase-like protein. MGP2 was expressed in all tissues including pollen grains and pollen tubes. The MGP2 protein was targeted to Golgi apparatus. Knockout of MGP2 significantly inhibited the pollen germination and retarded pollen tube growth in vitro and in vivo, but did not affect female gametophytic functions.

After pollination has finished, the male rows are eliminated, causing an empty space in the production field. To increase the yield and utilization of the area by female plants, in 2008, an experiment was conducted to study a compact planting technique involving planting male inbreds between female rows at the Nakhon Sawan Field Crops Research Center. The experiment used a split-plot design with three replications, with the main plot consisting of two plantings of parent material: 1) planting female and male inbreds on the same day; and 2) planting female inbreds two days later. Sub-plots consisted of four male planting methods: 1) compact planting between 65 cm female rows; 2) compact planting between 75 cm female rows; 3) compact planting between 85 cm female rows; and 4) planting female to male rows in the ratio of 4:1. The results showed that all compact plantings tended to increase yield by 12-28% compared with that of a female to male row planting ratio of 4:1. Compact planting between 75 cm female rows produced the highest yield of 2,381 kg ha -1. Compact planting between female rows at 85 cm, 65 cm and planting female to male rows at a ratio of 4:1 produced a yield of 2,288, 2,081 and 1,856 kg ha -1, respectively.

To reveal how plants responded to the Quaternary climatic oscillations in the QTP, the phylogeographical histories of a few subalpine and alpine plants have been investigated, but nearly all studies used only uniparentally inherited cytoplasmic DNA markers, and only a couple of them included sampling from the Himalaya. In this study, range-wide genetic variation of the Himalayan hemlock (Tsuga dumosa), an important forest species in the HHM, was surveyed using DNA markers from three genomes. All markers revealed genetic depauperation in the Himalaya and richness in the Hengduan Mountains populations. Surprisingly, population differentiation of this wind-pollinated conifer is very high in all three genomes, with few common and many private nuclear gene alleles. These results, together with fossil evidence, clearly indicate that T. dumosa recolonized the Himalaya from the Hengduan Mountains before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), accompanied with strong founder effects, and the influence of the earlier glaciations on demographic histories of the QTP plants could be much stronger than that of the LGM. The strong population differentiation in T. dumosa could be attributed to restricted gene flow caused by the complicated topography in the HHM that formed during the uplift of the QTP, and thus sheds lights on the importance of geographical isolation in the development of high plant species diversity in this biodiversity hotspot. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",DNA haplotype; LEAFY; Phylogeography; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Quaternary glaciation; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954425825

The use of such a narrow boundary can lead to misleading results and perverse decisions. This paper introduces the idea of designing networks of technological systems along with their supporting ecological systems. Such networks of technological and ecological systems exploit the synergy between them and can help in closing material loops and minimize exergy loss, leading to truly self-sustaining systems. Methods for designing such technological-ecological synergy (TES) networks could be developed by extending existing process synthesis and design approaches to include ecological models. Such an approach would integrate industrial ecology with ecological engineering and require collaboration between engineers and ecologists. It presents many new challenges and opportunities for process systems engineering to contribute to the sustainability of engineered systems. The idea of TES networks is illustrated via several practical case studies, with focus on the life cycle of corn ethanol and a typical American residential system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Design; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Networks; Sustainability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954533812

Effects of the exotic germplasm on physical, compositional, and wet-milling properties as well as the proximate composition of recovered fractions need to be determined before these materials are of value to the corn processing industry. Ten lines from the Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) project with exotic germplasm introgressed from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Cuba, and Florida were crossed to three adapted inbred lines (testers) and grain from the resulting 30 hybrids were evaluated for physical, compositional, and wetmilling characteristics and the expression of heterosis in these variables.The B73×Mo17 adapted publichybrid was used as control. Grain obtained by self-pollination of the hybrid plants was analyzed using nearinfrared transmittance (NIT) technology and a 100-g wet-milling procedure. There was great variation among physical, compositional, and wetmilling characteristics,and some of the experimental hybrids with exotic origin had better starch yield and starch recovery than B73×Mo17, which suggeststhat wet-milling characteristics of U.S. hybrids can be improved bybreeding with exotic germplasm. In particular, GEM breeding crossesAR16035:S19, CH05015:N15, CUBA117:S1520, and FS8B(T):N1802 could bevaluable germplasm sources to produce inbreds with good milling properties. Testers varied in ability to produce hybrids with good milling properties, indicating that choice of tester is an importan factorwhen evaluating this end use.

In the present communication, results of a comparative study of the wild type distributed locally in Anand, Gujarat and the superior variety, Jawahar Ashwagandha (JA-20), are presented. Results revealed conspicuous differences between the cultivated and wild-type plants in most of the characters studied. One of the major differences between cultivated and wild-type plants is that the former are annual, whereas the latter are perennial. Photosynthetic rate was higher in the wild type, which was reflected in its higher biomass production. Another distinguishing character was the floral structure which favours self-pollination in the cultivated plants because of short stigma covered with anther lobes, which is in contrast to the wild type having long, projected stigma inviting cross-pollination. The cultivated plants were in full bloom during December-February; however, in the wild type flowering was a continuous process throughout its lifespan.

Our primary aim was to describe seed development in Sicyos angulatus from pollination to seed maturity and to compare it with the development of water-impermeable seeds in other families reported in the literature. Full seed stage (highest moisture content [MC]) occurred 4-6 days after pollination (DAP) and physiological maturity occurred 20 DAP. Seeds became water impermeable 32 DAP, with 14.6% MC. The hilum was the site of water loss during the final stage of maturation drying. Excised embryos could germinate from 20 DAP to 36 DAP, whereas no intact seeds germinated during any stage of seed development. Mechanical scarification did not promote germination of seeds after the seed coat became water impermeable at 32-36 DAP. Based on a previous study of seed dormancy and germination in S. angulatus, we suggest that germination in these scarified seeds may have been prevented by resistance of inner membrane and fruit-seed coat to embryo expansion. The MC when seeds became impermeable (14.6%) is in the range of that reported for seeds of species in five other families with PY.

To increase the resistance of seeds to oxidative stress, At2S3 promoter from Arabidopsis was used to achieve overexpression of the antioxidants in a seed-specific manner. This promoter was shown to be capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of expression in seed-related organs, including siliques, mature seeds, and early seedlings, thus making its molecular farming applications in plants possible. Subsequently, genes encoding Mn-superoxide dismutase (MSD1), catalase (CAT1), and homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT1, responsible for the first committed reaction in the tocopherol biosynthesis pathway) were overexpressed in Arabidopsis under the control of the At2S3 promoter. Double overexpressers co-expressing two enzymes and triple overexpressers were produced by cross pollination. Mn-SOD and total CAT activities, as well as ?-tocopherol content, significantly increased in the corresponding overproduction lines. Moreover, single MSD1-transgene, double, and triple overexpressers displayed remarkably enhanced oxidative stress tolerance compared to wild type during seed germination and early seedling growth. Interestingly, an increase in the total CAT activity was also observed in the single MSD1-transgenic lines as a result of MSD1 overexpression. Together, the combined increase in Mn-SOD and CAT activities in seeds plays an essential role in the improvement of antioxidant capacity at early developmental stage in Arabidopsis. © 2010 The Authors.

It is not enough to prove that transfer from the first to the second language is possible and can evolve into substrate influence on the emergent vernacularstransfer is not ineluctable and varies from one learner to another. Additionally, how and why particular features of some speakers spread to a whole population (or to parts thereof), whereas others do not, must be accounted for. Consistent with colonial socioeconomic history, the gradual emergence of creoles suggests a complex evolution that cannot be accounted for with simplistic invocations of either interlanguage or relexification.

Sex ratios in unisexual bryophytes are most often female biased, whereas male-biased sex ratios predominate in unisexual seed plants. This 'bryophyte paradox', i.e. that sex ratios are biased in favour of the sex associated with the highest reproductive costs, has remained unexplained. 2. Analysis of sex-ratio patterns via the influence of sex distribution on population growth rates (?) has not previously been carried out for bryophytes. We used this method to model how variation in sex ratio and sporophyte frequency influences ? in the clonal bryophyte Hylocomium splendens. We obtained ? by matrix modelling of synthetic experimental populations derived from demographic field data, using a linear two-sex model. 3. In our set of experimental populations ? varied between 1.13 and 1.27 in response to variation in sex ratio and sporophyte frequency, with the highest ? obtained for the combination of a very low sporophyte frequency and a slightly female-biased sex ratio. 4. Our results explain the female-biased sex ratio of H. splendens by the slightly lower survival of and production of vegetative offspring by males than by non-sporophytic females. 5. Synthesis. According to our models, female dominance is the predicted outcome of low to moderate fertilization success and male performance intermediate between that of sporophytic and of non-sporophytic females. Our results therefore explain how a female-biased sex ratio can be maintained despite higher costs of reproduction in females than in males. In dioecious bryophytes, males and females must grow in close contact for fertilization to take place. Better performance of male ramets than of the female ramets they fertilize also explains how male clones can expand into female clones. A similar performance hierarchy of males and females may occur in unisexual clonal seed plants, but more efficient fertilization systems by pollination prevents the selective advantage of unfertilized females from being realized. This explains why vascular plant populations tend to be male biased. We hypothesise difference in fertilization distance range between sperm and pollen as a simple explanation why ramet level sex ratios are in general male dominated in clonal seed plants and female dominated in clonal bryophytes. © 2010 The Authors.

We established the level of nonfunctional pollen formation in 39 samples belonging to 10 species, using lactophenol cotton blue staining. Aborted pollen grains were found to be significantly smaller than normal ones. The results revealed differences in the percentage of normal grains among different species and tribes studied: Atripliceae (56.1 ± 27.1%), Salicornieae (80.36 ± 16.52%), Suaedeae (54.7 ± 31.2%) and Salsoleae (32.5 ± 25.7%). In some species there were significant differences among the populations studied, but in species of Saliconieae we found no differences either between different positions in the dicasia or in the anther. In the tribes Suaedeae and Salsoleae, we postulate the existence of a system that maintains different levels of partial male sterility among individuals in the populations, which would reduce the autogamous fruit set rate and favor the cross-pollination rates of sterile male individuals. We base this on high intrapopulation variability at those levels, on the constancy with which they are presented in the different populations studied, and on the lack of interannual differences. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Chenopodiaceae; Gynodioecy; Pollen sterility; Salt-marsh vegetation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049435439

Obligate orchid mycorrhizae are predicted to determine orchid distributions, and highly specific relationships between orchids and fungi may drive orchid diversification. In this study, mycorrhizal diversity was examined in the terrestrial, photosynthetic orchid genus Chiloglottis to test the hypothesis of mycorrhizal-mediated diversification in the genus Chiloglottis. This orchid genus secures pollination by sexual deception, an obligate and highly specific pollination strategy. Here we asked whether the obligate orchid-fungal interactions are also specific. Methods: Two sequenced loci, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and mitochondrial large subunit (mtLSU), were used to identify fungal isolates and assess fungal species diversity. Symbiotic germination of two species Chiloglottis aff. jeanesii and C. valida were used to assess germination potential of isolates and confirm mycorrhizal association. Key results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed that six representative Chiloglottis species spanning a broad survey of the genus were all associated with a narrow group of monophyletic Tulasnella fungal lineages. Conclusions: The Chiloglottis-Tulasnella interaction appears to be the first known case of such a narrow symbiont association across a broadly surveyed orchid genus. It appears that the specific pollination system of Chiloglottis, rather than specific orchid-fungal interactions has been the key driving force in the diversification of the genus. These findings also indicate that plant groups with highly specific mycorrhizal partners can have a widespread distribution. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Chiloglottis; Ectomycorrhizae; ITS; Molecular phylogeny; mtLSU; Orchid mycorrhizal fungi; Orchidaceae; Tulasnellaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954856372

A pollen chase experiment was used to estimate the magnitude of embryonic inbreeding depression in Costa Rican Witheringia solanacea, a species polymorphic for self-incompatibility (SI). In a pollen chase experiment, bud self-pollinations are followed after anthesis by outcross pollinations, with a comparable pair of outcross pollinations used as a control. Lowered seed set for the self-precedence treatment indicates embryonic inbreeding depression. Methods: Embryonic inbreeding depression was assayed for self-compatible (SC) individuals and for SI plants from two populations that differ quantitatively in the onset and enzymatic activity of their SI response. Microsatellite markers were used to assay the selfi ng rate of a sample of surviving progeny from the prior self-pollination treatment. Key results: SC individuals showed no evidence of embryonic inbreeding depression. In SI plants, prior self-pollination reduced seed number by 28-70%, depending on population. Microsatellite genotyping revealed that embryonic inbreeding depression was even more severe than estimated by the phenotypic data: for mature fruits resulting from self-pollination precedence, the majority of the progeny were the result of outcross fertilization. Conclusions: Lineage-specifi c purging of recessive lethals has accompanied the evolution of SC in this species. SI populations show contrasting levels of embryonic inbreeding depression, with nearly complete embryonic lethality upon selfi ng in the Monteverde population. In the face of high embryonic inbreeding depression, an increase in selfi ng rate can evidently occur only under severe pollen limitation. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Costa rica; Embryonic inbreeding depression; Evolution; Mating system; Self-compatibility; Self-incompatibility; Solanaceae; Witheringia solanacea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956000811

Here, we simultaneously investigated both interactions in the mediterranean food-deceptive Orchis simia, O. anthropophora, and their hybrid (O.× bergonii) and tested a possible reakdown of coevolution using a multidisciplinary approach.& Methods: We compared leaf growth, seed viability, emitted scent, and mycorrhizal fungi (species and rate of nfection) among these three taxa.& Key results: We show that leaf surface is greater in adult hybrids than in the parental species, suggesting a heterosis effect for vegetative growth. We demonstrate that fl owers of the two parental species emit well-differentiated bouquets of volatile organic compounds, while hybrids emit larger quantities, ccumulating most compounds of the two parental species. However, hybrids fail to attract pollinators and have a 10 times lower fruit set. We determined that closely related ulasnellales are mycorrhizal in the three taxa, suggesting that the mycorrhizal partner does not impair hybrid survival. We propose an interpretative model for O. × bergonii compared with its parents.& Conclusions: In hybrids, carbon resources normally devoted to reproduction may be reallocated to the mycorrhizal symbiosis as a result of the disruption of the pollination interaction in hybrids. Higher mycorrhizal infection may in turn enhance vegetative growth and scent emission.

Lasioglossum (D.) mitchelli is proposed as a replacement name for L. atlanticum (Mitchell) due to secondary homonymy with Halictus interruptus atlanticus Cockerell, a junior subjective synonym of L. interruptum (Panzer).The following forty-three new synonymies are proposed: L.

Names have often been misapplied in past usage sometimesuming multiple species. In some cases, even paratypes do not correspond to the same species as the name bearing type. The following three species are resurrected from synonymy: L. (D.) leucocomum (Lovell) new combinaton, L. (D.) oceanicum (Cockerell) new combination, and L. (D.) planatum. The species L.

Fruit set is, however, consistently low (8-36% range). The pollination efficiency of male and female blueberry bees was studied using: 1. comparison of pollen loads on foraging male and female bees; 2. calculation of pollen loads on fresh stigmas of flowers exposed to a single visit by a female bee; and 3. an experimental test of fruit and seed set following exposure to one to eight visits by both male and female bees. Females had larger pollen loads in four of five body regions, but male bees consistently carried pollen in quantities sufficient for fertilization. A single visit from a female bee resulted in mixed pollen deposition of 76 pollen grains, 20 of which were from Gelsemium and 56 from Vaccinium. There was no significant relationship of either fruit or seed set with number of visits from either males or females. Whilst both male and female bees are effective as pollen delivery agents of G. sempervirens, much of the pollen they deliver may be from the same floral morph, leading to rejection in this self-incompatible distylous species.

Cultivation of the plant in Ghana has reduced over the last two decades, so it now mostly grows in the wild. A survey was conducted in coastal Ghana to provide baseline information about pollinators of the plant, to inform decisions on the conservation of it and its pollinators. Apis mellifera, three species of Xylocopa and two of Amegilla were identified among the flower visitors as likely pollinators. Preliminary measures of the efficiency of these visitors as pollinators were made and the relationship between visitor behaviour and the phenology of the plant was studied. Flowers were open for about 10 h, and over 80% of female flowers received pollen within the first 3 h of opening. Out of 120 female flowers observed, A. mellifera visited 49.2%, Xylocopa spp visited 35.8% and Amegilla spp visited 15%. Xylocopa spp visited flowers early in the day, were most active during the period that most flowers received pollen, and deposited pollen on stigmas of all female flowers they visited. Whilst a single visit by Xylocopa spp or Amegilla spp. could leave enough pollen for fertilization and fruit formation, multiple visits by A. mellifera might be required for successful pollination to occur. These results suggest that Xylocopa and Amegilla are more efficient pollinators of L. aegyptiaca than A. mellifera.

The annual/therophyte species with a tendency to seed dispersed by wind, preferring a light and dry habitat, and having the RC (competitive - ruderal) life strategy were mainly found along the motorways. It means that road verges along motorways are quite insolated and constitute the dry habitats, probably suitable for ruderal, weedy, non-native, and invasive species. On the contrary, species with a tendency to vegetative reproduction and the C (competitive) strategy occur mainly along the secondary roads.

We found consistent declines in colony numbers in central European countries and some increases in Mediterranean countries. Beekeeper numbers have declined in all of the European countries examined. Our data support the view that honey bees are in decline at least in some regions, which is probably closely linked to the decreasing number of beekeepers. Our data on colony numbers and beekeepers must, however, be interpreted with caution due to different approaches and socioeconomic factors in the various countries, thereby limiting their comparability. We therefore make specific recommendations for standardized methodologies to be adopted at the national and global level to assist in the future monitoring of honey bees. © IBRA 2010.",Apis mellifera; Beekeeping; Colonies; Colony losses; Honey bee declines; Pollinator decline,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953832863

However, the influence of different types of links, such as cheating links, on network organization remains unexplored. We studied two flower-visitation networks (Malpighiaceae and Bignoniaceae and their flower visitors), and divide the types of link into cheaters (i.e. robbers and thieves of flower rewards) and effective pollinators. We investigated if there were topological differences among networks with and without cheaters, especially with respect to nestedness and modularity. The Malpighiaceae network was nested, but not modular, and it was dominated by pollinators and had much fewer cheater species than Bignoniaceae network (28% versus 75%). The Bignoniaceae network was mainly a plant- cheater network, being modular because of the presence of pollen robbers and showing no nestedness. In the Malpighiaceae network, removal of cheaters had no major consequences for topology. In contrast, removal of cheaters broke down the modularity of the Bignoniaceae network. As cheaters are ubiquitous in all mutualisms, the results presented here show that they have a strong impact upon network topology. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Cheaters; Modularity; Nestedness; Network topology; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956370665

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between protein nutrition and immunity in insects. Here, we tested in honeybees (Apis mellifera) whether dietary protein quantity (monofloral pollen) and diet diversity (polyfloral pollen) can shape baseline immunocompetence (IC) by measuring parameters of individual immunity (haemocyte concentration, fat body content and phenoloxidase activity) and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity, which enables bees to sterilize colony and brood food, as a parameter of social immunity. Protein feeding modified both individual and social IC but increases in dietary protein quantity did not enhance IC. However, diet diversity increased IC levels. In particular, polyfloral diets induced higher GOX activity compared with monofloral diets, including protein-richer diets. These results suggest a link between protein nutrition and immunity in honeybees and underscore the critical role of resource availability on pollinator health. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Diet; Honeybee; Immunocompetence; Pollen; Social immunity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953855403

These processes, however, frequently have one direction or are asymmetric, when one of hybridising species is a donor and other recipient of pollen. The asymmetric hybridisation may be also an important manner of migration by pollen. According to the theory of asymmetric hybridisation in mixed oak populations of European white oaks (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) the number of hybrid saplings should be higher under a canopy of Q. robur than under Q. petraea trees. The aim of this study was to determine, which of the two species in the mixed populations has a greater degree of success in regeneration and colonization, measured by the proportion and density of saplings and young individuals higher than 0.3 m. The taxonomie composition of saplings under the crown ranges of trees was analyzed on the basis of morphological characters of leaves in two distantly located mixed oak stands in Poland, in Jamy and Legnica Forests, where young generation to about 17-18 years old was observed under canopy of 125-140 years old mother trees. The first population is located about 100 km of Q. petraea geographic range and covers area of 6 km, the second about 500 km of Q. petraea range and covers more than 10 hectares. The density of 60 and 134 adult trees per hectare, were found in analysed populations, respectively. A significantly higher proportions of Q. petraea than Q. robur saplings were found in both compared stands. A hybrid saplings proportion were higher than hybrid adult trees. The hybrid saplings were observed more frequently under canopy of Q. robur only in the stand closer to the range of Q. petrea. Gene flow from Q. petraea to Q. robur by cross-pollination was found to be likely. The number of hybrid saplings found under crown projections of Q. petraea trees in both populations suggested also reverse gene flow, at least in the stand located close to the north-eastern limit of the Q. petraea range.

In this study, we report the involvement of the Arabidopsis thaliana MIDASIN1 (AtMDN1) gene during female gametogenesis through the phenotypic characterization of plants heterozygous for an insertional mdn1 mutant allele. The MDN1 yeast ortholog has previously been shown to encode a non-ribosomal protein involved in the maturation and assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Heterozygous MDN1/mdn1 plants were semisterile and mdn1 allele transmission through the female gametophyte was severely affected. Development of mdn1 female gametophyte was considerably delayed compared to their wild-type siblings. However, delayed mdn1 female gametophytes were able to reach maturity and a delayed pollination experiment showed that a small proportion of the female gametophytes were functional. We also report that the Arabidopsis NOTCHLESS (AtNLE) gene is also required for female gametogenesis. The NLE protein has been previously shown to interact with MDN1 and to be also involved in 60S subunit biogenesis. The introduction of an AtNLE-RNA interference construct in Arabidopsis led to semisterility defects. Defective female gametophytes were mostly arrested at the one-nucleate (FG1) developmental stage. These data suggest that the activity of both AtMDN1 and AtNLE is essential for female gametogenesis progression. © 2010 Prof. H.S.

A review of the literature shows how these experiments diversified during the 1920s and 1930s with an array of different research questions, ranging from pollination biology to hay fever studies. Quaternary palynologists gained renewed interest with the possibility of radiocarbon dating late Quaternary sediments and obtaining accumulation rates. Also, the comprehensive model of pollen deposition and the pollen budget studies by H. Tauber encouraged researchers to conduct similar experiments using the same type of pollen trap, which became the main trapping device for Quaternary palynologists. The high precipitation in the tropics inspired the development of alternative designs. The equipment used to assess the pollen content in the air has evolved from simple gravity devices to different types of apparatus using a vacuum pump or revolving rods that collect the pollen on impact. Silicone impregnated filters exposed perpendicularly to the wind can also yield a volumetric assessment and have proven useful in areas with a low content of pollen in the air. The literature review is followed by a brief account of the developments which established the basis for the formation of a group of scientists monitoring the pollen deposition at a network of sites using standard pollen traps, the Pollen Monitoring Programme (PMP). Over the last 15 years the network has collected a large dataset, which is now available to answer a number of research questions. A summary of selected regions and environments, for which pollen monitoring results are available, is provided to serve as a complement to the investigations mentioned above and to provide an overview that may stimulate new research. © 2010 The Author(s).",Airborne pollen; History of pollen trapping; Pollen accumulation rates; Pollen dispersal; Pollen influx; Pollen monitoring,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955566662

The expression of two inherited alleles is sometimes biased by the effects known as dominant/recessive relationships, which determine the final phenotype of the organism. To explore the mechanisms underlying these relationships, we have examined the monoallelic expression of S-locus protein 11 genes (SP11), which encode the male determinants of self-incompatibility in Brassica. We previously reported that SP11 expression was monoallelic in some S heterozygotes, and that the promoter regions of recessive SP11 alleles were specifically methylated in the anther tapetum. Here we show that this methylation is controlled by trans-acting small non-coding RNA (sRNA). We identified inverted genomic sequences that were similar to the recessive SP11 promoters in the flanking regions of dominant SP11 alleles. These sequences were specifically expressed in the anther tapetum and processed into 24-nucleotide sRNA, named SP11 methylation inducer (Smi). Introduction of the Smi genomic region into the recessive S homozygotes triggered the methylation of the promoter of recessive SP11 alleles and repressed their transcription. This is an example showing sRNA encoded in the flanking region of a dominant allele acts in trans to induce transcriptional silencing of the recessive allele. Our finding may provide new insights into the widespread monoallelic gene expression systems. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955867562

The study regions are situated in the lowlands of northern Poland, the uplands of SE Poland, the Czech Krkonoe Mts, the Czech umava Mts, the Swiss Jura Mts, the Swiss Alps, the Bulgarian Rila Mts and the Bulgarian Strandzha Mts. Most time series are 10 or 11 years long, some are 5-16 years long. Inter-annual fluctuations in Fagus PAR were analyzed and compared with seed mast years. Years with high Fagus PAR and others with low Fagus PAR occurred most frequently in parallel within each region and often in two neighbouring regions. 2006 was exceptional as it had a very high Fagus sylvatica pollen deposition in all study regions and it was also a mast year. In Bulgaria, the trend in the 5 years of Fagus orientalis PAR in the Strandzha Mts differed from that of F. sylvatica PAR in the Rila Mts. Aiming at establishing the relationship between average Fagus PAR and tree cover, differences in Fagus PAR (averaged per pollen trap) were related in each region to the proportion of beech trees in the vegetation within 2 km of the pollen traps, the distance to the nearest pollinating Fagus tree, regional or local presence of beech forests, the degree of landscape openness, and the size of forest opening in which a trap is situated. Average Fagus PAR was found to track the regional abundance of beech trees in the vegetation, not the distance of the nearest Fagus tree. Regional occurrence of beech-dominated forests was reflected by a Fagus PAR of ca. 1,400 grains cm-2 year-1, local abundance very close to pollen traps by ca. 2,400 grains, small patches of forest with admixture of Fagus by ca. 170-220 grains, and scarcity or absence of Fagus by ca. 40 grains or less. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Europe; Fagus; Pollen accumulation rates; Pollen monitoring; Pollen-vegetation relationship; Tauber traps; Tree cover,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955572772

For the parthenogenetic induction, 300 Gray gamma irradiation were applied to the pollens and pollinations were conducted on the day after irradiation. Three different methods were used to extract seeds from the 3 to 4 weeks old fruits. The three methods: extracting the seeds one by one (M1), sowing the seeds in petri dishes (M2) and inspecting the seeds on the light box (M3) were compared. The pollination with the irradiated pollens resulted up to 94% fruit set. From the 204 fruits harvested, 280 haploid, 44 diploid and 8 mixoploid embryos were obtained. Germination rate of haploid was 96%. When the M1, M2 and M3 were compared, the required time for opening a fruit was found to be 162, 125 and 49 min, respectively.

Since land management affects pollinator numbers, it is also likely to affect the resultant pollination of plants growing in these habitats. We hypothesised that the seed or fruit set of two plant species, typically pollinated by bumblebees and/or honeybees might respond in one of two ways: 1) pollination success could be reduced when growing in a floriferous environment, via competition for pollinators, or 2) pollination success could be enhanced because of increased pollinator abundance in the vicinity. Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the pollination success of experimental plants of Glechoma hederacea L. and Lotus corniculatus L growing in gardens and arable farmland. On the farms, the plants were placed either next to a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L. or field beans, Vicia faba L.) or next to a cereal crop (wheat, Triticum spp.). Seed set of G. hederacea and fruit set of L corniculatus were significantly higher in gardens compared to arable farmland. There was no significant difference in pollination success of G. hederacea when grown next to different crops, but for L corniculatus, fruit set was higher in the plants growing next to oilseed rape when the crop was in flower. Conclusions/Significance: The results show that pollination services can limit fruit set of wild plants in arable farmland, but there is some evidence that the presence of a flowering crop can facilitate their pollination (depending on species and season). We have also demonstrated that gardens are not only beneficial to pollinators, but also to the process of pollination. © 2010 Cussans et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955407566

We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks.

Our aims were to: 1) identify genes expressed in a tissue-specific and temporal-specific manner; 2) define clusters of genes showing similar patterns of spatial and temporal expression; and 3) identify stage-specific or transition-specific candidate genes for further functional genomic analyses.Results: We analyzed gene expression during S. chacoense embryogenesis in a series of experiments with probes derived from ovules isolated before and after fertilization (from 0 to 22 days after pollination), and from leaves, anthers, and styles. From the 6374 unigenes present in our array, 1024 genes were differentially expressed (? ± 2 fold change, p value ? 0.01) in fertilized ovules compared to unfertilized ovules and only limited expression overlap was observed between these genes and the genes expressed in the other tissues tested, with the vast majority of the fertilization-regulated genes specifically or predominantly expressed in ovules (955 genes). During embryogenesis three major expression profiles corresponding to early, middle and late stages of embryo development were identified. From the early and middle stages, a large number of genes corresponding to cell cycle, DNA processing, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation were found. Defense and stress response-related genes were found in all stages of embryo development. Protein biosynthesis genes, genes coding for ribosomal proteins and other components of the translation machinery were highly expressed in embryos during the early stage. Genes for protein degradation were overrepresented later in the middle and late stages of embryo development. As expected, storage protein transcripts accumulated predominantly in the late stage of embryo development.Conclusion: Our analysis provides the first study in a solanaceous species of the transcriptional program that takes place during the early phases of plant reproductive development, including all embryogenesis steps during a comprehensive time-course. Our comparative expression profiling strategy between fertilized and unfertilized ovules identified a subset of genes specifically or predominantly expressed in ovules while a closer analysis between each consecutive time point allowed the identification of a subset of stage-specific and transition-specific genes. © 2010 Tebbji et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955350102

Because the floral scent is probably important in mediating this interaction, we investigated the floral volatiles that might attract M. sexta for feeding and oviposition. We found that flower volatiles increase oviposition and include small amounts of both enantiomers of linalool, a common component of the scent of hawkmoth-pollinated flowers. Because (+)-linalool is processed in a female-specific glomerulus in the primary olfactory centre of M. sexta, we hypothesized that the enantiomers of linalool differentially modulate feeding and oviposition. Using a synthetic mixture that mimics the D. wrightii floral scent, we found that the presence of linalool was not necessary to evoke feeding and that mixtures containing (+)-and/or (-)-linalool were equally effective in mediating this behaviour. By contrast, females oviposited more on plants emitting (+)-linalool (alone or in mixtures) over control plants, while plants emitting (-)-linalool (alone or in mixtures) were less preferred than control plants. Together with our previous investigations, these results show that linalool has differential effects in feeding and oviposition through two neural pathways: one that is sexually isomorphic and non-enantioselective, and another that is female-specific and enantioselective.

Because the floral scent is probably important in mediating this interaction, we investigated the floral volatiles that might attract M. sexta for feeding and oviposition. We found that flower volatiles increase oviposition and include small amounts of both enantiomers of linalool, a common component of the scent of hawkmoth-pollinated flowers. Because (+)-linalool is processed in a female-specific glomerulus in the primary olfactory centre of M. sexta, we hypothesized that the enantiomers of linalool differentially modulate feeding and oviposition. Using a synthetic mixture that mimics the D. wrightii floral scent, we found that the presence of linalool was not necessary to evoke feeding and that mixtures containing (+)- and/or (-)-linalool were equally effective in mediating this behaviour. By contrast, females oviposited more on plants emitting (+)-linalool (alone or in mixtures) over control plants, while plants emitting (-)-linalool (alone or in mixtures) were less preferred than control plants. Together with our previous investigations, these results show that linalool has differential effects in feeding and oviposition through two neural pathways: one that is sexually isomorphic and non-enantioselective, and another that is female-specific and enantioselective.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923617816

Six-year-old trees received a supplemental pollination treatment using pollen produced in a first-generation seed orchard. The resulting seeds were characterized (size, mass, germination under artificial conditions), and seedlings were produced in a nursery. Results showed that flowers produced by these somatic clones exhibited a normal period of receptivity. Their position in the crown was comparable to that observed on seedlings in seed orchards. A similar pattern was observed for seed characteristics, which were comparable to those of seeds originating from seed orchard trees, and for the development of the resulting seedlings.

The observed variations were found to be due to independent contributions of patterns corresponding to different groups of species within the family of grasses. Three pollen concentrations peaks were recognized. Peak A, at around 10:00 h, of great importance in April and May, although maintained until July; peak B, at around 15:00 h, important in April, May and June; and peak C, towards the end of the day, dominant in July. Differences with respect to the pollen sources responsible for these peaks are suggested by the influence of the meteorological parameters before and during flowering. The results are directly applicable to the epidemiology of allergies in the zone, since the thresholds of grass pollen concentrations capable of triggering allergic processes shift from the central hours of the day in April and May to the night hours in July.

Research was conducted to determine normal flower and seed production and the impact of seed predation, and to ascertain whether clipping surrounding vegetation and/or fertilizing with nitrogen stimulates flower and seed production in S. sericeum. Only 41% of all stems observed produced capitula, and less than 40% of the seeds in each capitulum were filled. Flower production was negatively correlated with percentage vascular plant cover and positively correlated with percentage cryptogamic cover. The main seed predator was a weevil (Anthonomus sp.) that destroyed about one-third of all capitula produced. None of the treatments applied (e.g. clipped, fertilized and clipped × fertilized) significantly increased stem height, the percentage of flowering stems or seed production over the control; clipping actually decreased stem height. Fertilizing was the only treatment that showed some promise as it increased the number of capitula per flowering stem. Flower and seed production in S. sericeum may be facilitated by the presence of other species that modify the microenvironment. Low flower and seed production of plants in Canada is likely due to limited soil resources and pollen, and seed predation. © Inter-Research 2010.",Competition; Conservation; Endangered species; Life history traits; Population ecology; Predation; Production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955108893

The present study aims to investigate the polyembryony in these species by means of histological analysis of ovule/seed development in unpollinated, selfed, and crossed pistils/fruits (in H. chrysotrichus only) as well as seed germination experiments. Experimental pollinations were carried out to evaluate breeding systems in the studied populations, and the results indicated self-fertility in both species. Adventitious embryo precursor cells (AEPs) were formed in the ovules of unpollinated, selfed, and crossed pistils. However, unfertilized ovules never develop into seeds, and fertilization/endosperm initiation clearly stimulates the formation of AEPs in pollinated pistils. The inability of AEP-bearing unfertilized ovules to initiate endospermogenesis clearly shows that fertilization is needed for adventitious embryo development. Consequently, formation of AEPs is required but is not sufficient for apomictic reproduction in H. chrysotrichus. Analysis of the positions of multiple embryos in the endosperm indicated that fertilized ovules are able to develop into seeds even in the absence of a zygotic embryo. The development of AEPs in ovules of H. chrysotrichus foregoes the stage in which activation of selfed pistil rejection takes place in H. impetiginosus, a species with late-acting self-incompatibility. Our study supports the hypothesis that the self-fertility in H. chrysotrichus (and perhaps also in H. ochraceus) resulted from the emergence of pseudogamous apomixis, favored by the physiological peculiarities of the late-acting self-incompatibility and possibly related to polyploidy. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Adventitious embryony; Apomixis; Handroanthus; Polyembryony; Pseudogamy; Self-fertility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955123229

Pollen-tube numbers in the style, following controlled pollinations, increased from Day 1 to Day 6, then declining rapidly. The stigma was most receptive during Days 3-6, and still receptive at low levels as early as shortly after anthesis and as late as 10 days after pollination. The present study found that individuals of M. alternifolia differed in their degree of expression of self-incompatibility. Artificial self-pollination, with emasculation, in several families resulted in complete self-incompatibility, with no capsule retention. The microscopic observation of pollen-tube development revealed a mechanism of self-incompatibility in M. alternifolia. A self-incompatibility system operates in the style, although a few self-pollen grains are capable of germinating and producing pollen tubes. It also appears that late-acting self-incompatibility mechanisms discriminate against self-pollen tubes when they descend to the ovary. Artificial cross-pollination of selected parents produced seed with greater germination capacity and seedlings that grew faster than the corresponding open-pollinated seed and seedlings from the same parent. Freeze-dried pollen stored at -18C maintained viability (22%) over 1 year of storage. This finding will allow greater flexibility in undertaking controlled pollinations, because stored pollen can be substituted for fresh pollen when insufficient quantities are available from new-season flowers. A wide variety of insects was observed visiting the flowers of M. alternifolia, and capsule set was high even in bags that excluded flower visitors greater than 2mm. Thrips species seem likely to be important pollinators of this species because they are small and were abundant inside and outside of exclusion bags, although several other insect species such as bees, flies and wasps were also identified as frequent floral visitors. © 2010 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955062853

The line was characterized by a broad variety of mutations, which were identified in consecutive generations obtained from one initial regenerant via self-pollination. The mutations caused male sterility (male sterility, generation R1), a low plant height (dwarfness, R2), a reduced awn length (awnless, R3), yellow leaves in seedlings (xantha, R6), leaf variegation (leaf variegation, R6), leaf bleaching (virescence, R6), etc. In some cases, segregation in families suggested a monogenic recessive inheritance for the induced mutations. Male sterility was due to a range of defects that affected microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis and were probably caused by mutations of several genes. Leaf variegation was due to the appearance of green sectors in originally albino seedling leaves; the reversion occurred only in somatic tissues without affecting male and female gametes. In male-sterile and variegated mutants, sequence-specific amplified polymorphism analysis with primers to the Isaak transposon revealed new DNA fragments, which were absent from the original line.

We assessed the breeding systems in a sympatric assemblage of bromeliad species and compiled literature available for the family to compare our experiments with available information. We performed controlled experiments of autonomous selfing, self- and cross-pollination in 40 species of 11 genera of two subfamilies that, in general, overlap their blooming period and share the same pollination vectors. We also tested for differences between self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species with regard to ecological factors such as abundance, co-flowering and co-occurrence. Most species experimentally tested and surveyed in the literature (75%) were SC. Species from the subfamily Tillandsioideae were predominantly SC, while Bromelioideae showed greater variation in breeding systems. About 43% of the species studied set fruits spontaneously in the absence of pollinator vectors. We found that SC species were the more abundant, were more frequently associated with other relatives and overlapped their blooming period with other species more than SI species. Thus, our results suggest that self-compatibility is common for Bromeliaceae and do not support the traditional hypothesis of reproductive assurance used to explain the evolution of selfing. We discuss self-compatibility as a reproductive isolating mechanism in the presence of pollen flow among sympatric congener species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Mating systems; Reproductive assurance; Reproductive isolation; Self-incompatibility; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956721383

Compared with pollination using a vibration wand, pollination by buzz pollinating bees results in improved seed set and consequently, higher fruit weight. We investigated whether there are further chemical and sensory differences between bee- and wand-pollinated cherry tomatoes, Solanum lycopersicum variety Conchita. The pollination method did not result in significant differences in concentration of soluble solids and titratable acidity. However, the concentration of soluble solids was significantly positively correlated with seed number. We suggest that an increase in the amount of soluble solids in the locular area, due to increased seed numbers, is counteracted by the effects of seed numbers on the growth of the walls, which occurs through cell elongation. In the sensory part of this study, a large, untrained panel significantly preferred bee-pollinated over wand-pollinated tomatoes and classified bee-pollinated tomatoes as having more depth of flavor than wand-pollinated tomatoes. Thus, bee-pollinated tomatoes taste better than wand-pollinated tomatoes, and it is likely that the sensory differences between the two groups of tomatoes are mediated through effects of pollination treatment on seed numbers. Future chemical and sensory studies of fresh tomatoes should take into account the effects of seed numbers and their possible effect on the distribution of chemical compounds within tomatoes. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",Amegilla; flavor; horticulture; pollination; seeds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955332757

However, comparing pollinator performance across studies is difficult because of the diversity of concepts and disparate methods in use. Our review of the literature shows many unresolved ambiguities. Two different assessment concepts predominate: the first estimates stigmatic pollen deposition and the underlying pollinator behaviour parameters, while the second estimates the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success, for example in terms of seed set. Both concepts include a number of parameters combined in diverse ways and named under a diversity of synonyms and homonyms. However, these concepts are overlapping because pollen deposition success is the most frequently used proxy for assessing the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success. We analyse the diverse concepts and methods in the context of a new proposed conceptual framework with a modular approach based on pollen deposition, visit frequency, and contribution to seed set relative to the plant's maximum female reproductive potential. A system of equations is proposed to optimize the balance between idealised theoretical concepts and practical operational methods. Our framework permits comparisons over a range of floral phenotypes, and spatial and temporal scales, because scaling up is based on the same fundamental unit of analysis, the single visit. © 2009 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",pollen deposition; pollen quality; pollination efficiency; pollinator effectiveness; pollinator performance; seed set; visit frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954616487

However, few studies have directly assessed the scaling of these traits at the species level. Using two similar-sized pollinator species (the hawkmoth Macroglossum trochilus and the fly Moegistorhynchus longirostrus), we compare intraspecific scaling relationships of resting metabolic rate (RMR), foraging rate (FR) and wing loading (WL) to address this paucity of data. Scaling of RMR was similar for both taxa although the intercepts for the relationships differed. However, these two species showed variation in WL scaling relationships and fundamentally different FR scaling. For M. longirostrus, FR scaling was positive but non-significantly related to body mass while for M. trochilus FR scaling was negative.

We combined these assessments to calculate the contribution of bees to crop production in this system. Wild bees were the dominant pollinators in small fields, comprising 58% of flower-visiting bees, whereas 97% of bees in large fields were honey bees. Large fields had four times as many bees visiting flowers than small fields, but only one-tenth as many bumble bees as small fields. Levels of fruit set exceeded 85% in all fields and were similar between field sizes. Berry weight increased with flower exposure to pollinators and was positively correlated with bee abundance. Berry weights from open-pollinated flowers were twice as high in large fields compared with small fields. By combining berry weight increases attributable to honey bees and wild bees in blueberry fields with measurements of the bee community adjusted for pollinator efficiency, we calculated the relative contributions of honey bees and wild bees to pollination of Michigan blueberries. We estimate that wild bees provide 82% of the pollination in small fields but only 12% of the total pollination services across this system, mostly through their secondary role in large fields. Synthesis and applications. Wild bees are the primary pollinators of small blueberry fields, but these insects are at low abundance in large fields, perhaps due to a lack of nesting resources or competition for resources with honey bees. Our findings highlight the dependence of commercial fruit producers on honey bees and suggest that increasing the pollination contribution of other bees, particularly bumble bees, in large fields will require that growers adopt wild bee conservation strategies or stock their fields with managed colonies. Quantifying the contributions of managed and wild pollinating bees across the range of crop production scenarios will help to direct development of integrated crop pollination strategies to minimize the risk of pollination deficits affecting food production. © 2010 The Authors.

However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower visitation and fruit production patterns.3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on production (42% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be important. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of pollinator-friendly areas. By highlighting the economic gains of adopting pollinator-friendly practices in agriculture, this work contributes to a growing body of studies that reveal that making farmland more suitable for pollinators benefits both agriculture and nature conservation. © 2010 The Authors.

To preserve a crop's varietal purity or to restrict ingress into conventional varieties of genetically modified (GM) genes, a quantitative understanding of gene flow is useful. Previous measurements of gene flow in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), a crop with GM varieties, were made in plots of less than 1. ha. Here, I evaluate a mathematical model of field-to-field gene flow due to insect pollination using parameter values appropriate to a large agricultural field of safflower. The model was solved based on laboratory pollination experiments and observations made on a large (40. ha) safflower field in Lethbridge, Canada that was pollinated by honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumble bees (Bombus spp.). The model estimated the maximum feasible level of bee-mediated, field-to-field gene flow to range between 0.05% and 0.005% of seed set (95% upper confidence intervals of 0.23% and 0.023%), depending on the composition of the bee fauna. These relatively low values emerged for two reasons: safflower has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization; and bees undertook long foraging bouts in the field, which made between-field pollinations relatively rare. A strategy for minimizing GM gene flow should utilize a conventional safflower variety that has a high capacity for automatic self-fertilization and should allow the conventional plants to grow in large stands to encourage long foraging bouts by bees. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Apis mellifera; Bombus; Bumble bees; Carthamus tinctorius; Cross-pollination; GM crops; Honey bees; PMF; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955427719

To understand the extent to which traits truly evolved as part of establishing the mutualistic relationship, rather than being pre-adaptations, we used an expanded phylogenetic estimate with improved sampling of deeply-diverged groups to perform the first formal reconstruction of trait evolution in pollinating yucca moths and their nonpollinating relatives. Our analysis demonstrates that key life-history traits of yucca moths, including larval feeding in the floral ovary and the associated specialized cutting ovipositor, as well as colonization of woody monocots in xeric habitats, may have been established before the obligate mutualism with yuccas. Given these pre-existing traits, novel traits in the mutualist moths are limited to the active pollination behaviours and the tentacular appendages that facilitate pollen collection and deposition. These results suggest that a highly specialized obligate mutualism was built on the foundation of pre-existing interactions between early Prodoxidae and their host plants, and arose with minimal trait evolution. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Ancestral trait estimation; Pre-adaptation; Prodoxidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954697854

This study extends research done immediately before and after logging, to consider its longer term effects. We censused bumble bee and flower communities 8-9 years after experimental variable retention logging. Harvest treatments left 0%, 10-20%, 50-75%, or 100% of the original trees after logging. Total bumble bee and floral abundances were increased by all forms of logging; however the floral community in retention cuts (i.e., 10-20% and 50-75% of trees remaining) was more similar to undisturbed controls than was the community in clearcuts. Bumble bees in low-retention treatments (i.e. 10-20%) were in an ideal free distribution (IFD) with their floral resources, which allows for equal per-flower rate of visitation, regardless of local flower density. In clearcuts (i.e. 0%) and high-retention areas (i.e. 50-75%) bees were at an IFD with respect to the density of their floral resources, but undermatched (in 50-75% treatments) or were resource-independent (in 0% treatments) with respect to the energetic value of their floral resources. Bees in unlogged forest controls (i.e., 100%) deviated from an IFD by undermatching. Overall, low-retention logging (10-20%) was an improvement over clearcutting, because there was less change to the floral community, while still allowing for the achievement of an ideal free distribution. However, unlogged forest appeared to be negatively affected (in the lack of an IFD) by the presence of adjacent logged forests: numerical responses of bees to flowers were altered, with implications for bee foraging success and plant pollination service. Forest reserves should therefore incorporate buffer zones when adjacent to logged forest, to preserve the inter-relationships in their bee-influenced pollination community. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Boreal forest; Bumble bees; Floral abundance; Ideal free distribution; Nectar production rate; Variable retention logging,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955508776

It is also silviculturally managed and cultivated, people selecting plants with higher fruit production. We compared phenology, pollination biology, and breeding systems of wild and managed populations to determine whether humans have influenced changes in these aspects. Flower production was markedly higher in cultivated populations. Flowering peak of all managed populations occurred in December whereas in the wild it occurred in February. Anthesis was diurnal, with Plebeia mexicana being the most frequent flower visitor in the wild, Apis mellifera and Tabanus sp. in silvicultural populations, and Xylocopa mexicanorum in cultivated populations. Natural pollination was more successful in cultivated than in wild and silvicultural populations (83.3%, 40%, 26.66% fruits, respectively). Out-crossing was the most successful breeding system in all populations. Self-pollination was higher in cultivated (23.3% successful fruits) than in other populations (3.3% successful fruits in wild, and 10.0% in silviculture populations). Differences in flower production influenced by artificial selection and pollinator type explain different fruit production in managed and wild populations, whereas environmental heterogeneity influences differences in reproductive patterns, limiting pollen flow and contributing to maintaining phenotypic divergence among populations of M. schenckii. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Under natural selection for sexual success, the reproductive organs of plants should evolve to become highly effective pollen receptors. Among wind-pollinated plants, larger reproductive structures appear counter-adapted to accumulate pollen by impaction on their windward surfaces, because airborne particles are less able to penetrate the thicker boundary layer of larger targets. Therefore, it has been proposed that wind-pollinated plants with pollen receptors on relatively large structures, like some grasses (family Poaceae), are architecturally adapted to create downstream vortices in which airborne pollen recirculates before accumulating on leeward surfaces. From this basis, the striking diversity among the grasses in the architecture of their flowering stems has been attributed in part to the existence of these contrasting mechanisms for effecting pollen receipt, namely impact collection and recirculatory collection. 2. We investigated the relative importance of impact and recirculatory collection in grasses by analysing a model system in silico using Computational Fluid Dynamics and by conducting in vivo experiments, both in a wind tunnel and outdoors, using two grass species with compact inflorescences, Alopecurus pratensis and Anthoxanthum odoratum. 3. Irrespective of the experimental approach, we found that although pollen recirculated in the leeward eddies of inflorescences, over 95% of the accumulated pollen was collected by windward surfaces. 4. In A. pratensis, the collection efficiency (proportion of oncoming pollen collected) was between 5% and 20%, depending on wind speed in the range 0.5-1.9 m s-1 and these levels conform to those predicted by a mechanistic model of impact collection. 5. Our results demonstrate that grass species with larger inflorescences are, like those with smaller inflorescences, primarily impact collectors of airborne pollen, which suggests that dissimilar reproductive morphology among species cannot be attributed to differentiation in the mode of pollen capture and, instead, requires reference to other factors, such as the need to produce, protect and disperse seeds of different sizes in different environments. © 2010 The Authors.

Less still is known about the impacts on pollination, comprising the ecosystem service that pollinators provide to wildflowers and crops. The present study measured flower visitation and pollination in an agricultural landscape, by placing potted flowering plants (Petunia sp.) in vine fields sprayed with a highly toxic insecticide (fenitrothion). During two sampling rounds, insect visitors to the petunias were observed and measures of pollination were recorded by counting and weighing seeds. In the earlier sampling round, a lower species richness of insect visitors was observed in fields that had received an early application of insecticide. No negative impacts were found from later applications. The results obtained suggest a greater potential harm to insect pollinators and flower visitation as a result of insecticide application early in the season. No reduction in pollination was found in fields that received an early insecticide application. Pollination was greater with two insecticide applications between sampling rounds rather than one application. In the present study system, insecticide application had a negative effect on pollinators but a possible positive effect on pollination services. In some cases, it may be that actions for conserving biodiversity will not benefit pollination services to all plants. © 2010 The Authors.

In an intensively farmed area of Northeast Italy we investigated whether isolated organic farms, in a conventionally farmed landscape, provided local benefits for insect pollinators and pollination services. We quantified the relative effects of local management (i.e. the farm system), landscape management (proportion of surrounding uncultivated land) and interactions between them. We compared six organic and six conventional vine fields. The proportion of surrounding uncultivated land was calculated for each site at radii of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000. m. The organic fields did not differ from the conventional in their floral resources or proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. Data were collected on pollinator abundance and species richness, visitation rates to, and pollination of experimental potted plants. None of these factors were significantly affected by the farming system. The abundance of visits to the potted plants in the conventional fields tended to be negatively affected by the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. The proportion fruit set, weight of seeds per plant and seed weight in conventional and organic fields were all negatively affected by the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. In vine fields the impact of the surrounding landscape was stronger than the local management. Enhancement of biodiversity through organic farming should not be assumed to be ubiquitous, as potential benefits may be offset by the crop type, organic-management practices and the specific habitat requirements in the surrounding landscape. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Agriculture; Bee; Biodiversity; Ecosystem service; Insecticide; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954814719

This paper evaluates experimentally whether direct and indirect effects of herbivory on male and female flower size and pollination success of the monoecious tropical shrub Cnidoscolus aconitifolius (Euphorbiaceae) remain consistent at three distant regions in Yucatan (southeastern Mexico). Plants were subjected to different levels of leaf defoliation, and treatment effects on floral traits (corolla area, corolla tube length, pollen production), and male and female components of pollination success (percent pollen removal, number of pollen tubes) were subsequently measured to evaluate the indirect effect of herbivory on plant reproductive success via pollination. Defoliation had significant direct effects on floral traits, but its indirect effects differed between the male and female components of pollination success. Moreover, the relationships between defoliation, floral traits and male and female pollination success varied spatially (i.e. between regions), although they were frequently more spatially-consistent for male success than for female success. Results from this study stress the importance of explicitly testing for spatial variation in direct and indirect effects arising from plant-animal interactions. © 2009 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955158997

In this study we assessed whether the density of feral honeybees, hoverflies (probably 2 species) and native bees (multiple species) in temperate Australian Brassica oilseed crops was related to the composition of the landscape. The density of pollinators was measured at multiple points in six different Brassica oilseed paddocks (20-80. ha) at least 1.75. km apart. Landscape composition at multiple scales (radii 100-2000. m) was determined from GIS layers of Brassica paddocks, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation, and a derived layer expected to reflect the condition of woody vegetation remnants (the 'Link' score). Densities of feral honeybees were higher near the edges of Brassica fields than towards the middle. Densities of feral honeybees were strongly positively associated with the summed 'Link' score within 300. m and with the amount of woody vegetation. Densities of native bees and hoverflies were not strongly associated with woody vegetation or with woody vegetation with a high 'Link' score.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis has been shown to enhance some plant traits to which pollinators are known to respond. Moreover, in gynodioecious species pollinators prefer hermaphrodite flowers over female ones, but the role of fungal symbiosis in sex-specific pollinator attraction is unknown. 2. We examined how plant gender dimorphism and AM symbiosis affect floral visitors and reproductive output in the gynodioecious plant Geranium sylvaticum. Floral visitors were monitored in a common garden experiment using mycorrhizal plants inoculated with either Glomus claroideum or Glomus hoi and in non-mycorrhizal condition. 3. We hypothesized that because of the larger flower display and pollen presence in hermaphrodites, (i) hermaphrodites receive more floral visitors than females. However, as females produce higher numbers of seeds than hermaphrodites, we predicted that (ii) effective pollinators visit both sexes equally and that (iii) AM symbiosis, although affecting floral characteristics and insect behaviour in general, should not have sex-specific effects on insects that transport pollen. 4. Our results confirm the hypotheses as hermaphrodites received 1Æ5 times as many floral visitors than females. However, the most important pollinator group, the bumblebees, did not prefer either sex, which may be important for the maintenance of both sexes in gynodioecious populations. We further corroborated that AM symbiosis, although affecting flower size and the amount of pollen, did not affect bumblebee behaviour, whereas other hymenopterans showed a deterrence for G. hoi inoculated plants. 5. This work reports the impact of AM symbiosis on the behaviour of floral visitors in a sexually dimorphic plant species. Positive interactions between plants, floral visitors and AM have been documented previously. However, potential negative tritrophic interactions between plants, floral visitors and AM may also occur. Our results suggest that plant sex and the mycorrhizal status of the plant also influence floral visitor groups that are unlikely to carry out pollination. This may benefit the plants if these floral visitors carry fungal diseases and consume pollen and nectar without effectively vectoring pollen. © 2010 The Authors.

Variable proportions, differential growth and the formation of secondary structures result in a diversity of morphologies. The hooded staminodes can be grouped into ten distinct types. These morphological types are in accordance with the accepted clades of the family indicating their phylogenetic significance.

The transfer of this knowledge to weed control management has not been fully explored. In part, this may be because it is difficult to quantify the economic impact of environmental weeds. This diminishes the prospects for expensive research and development required for integrated weed management. In this study, we examine the reproductive ecology of Phyla canescens, a species native to South America that is an aggressive agricultural and environmental weed in many parts of the world. We found that P. canescens is self-compatible, but not capable of automatic self-pollination. A vector is required to effect seed set. Field studies showed that 45% of seeds produced through open pollination are viable. Using exclosure cages, we showed that non-native Apis mellifera L. (honeybee) was the primary floral visitor and pollinator. Honeybee abundance was positively correlated with P. canescens abundance. Within the study site of 0.51 ha, almost 500 000 seeds ha-1 would be produced annually, as a result of honeybee pollination. This study shows that a shared evolutionary history is not required for honeybees to be successful pollinators.

This can be advantageous against environmental stresses such as leaf herbivory. However, studies showing effects of herbivory on male and female functions and on the interaction with the plant's pollinators are limited, particularly in tropical plants. Here, the effects of experimental defoliation were examined in the monoecious shrub Croton suberosus (Euphorbiaceae), a wasp-pollinated species from a Mexican tropical dry forest. Methods Three defoliation treatments were applied: 0% (control), 25% (low) or 75% (high) of plant leaf area removed. Vegetative (production of new leaves) and reproductive (pistillate and staminate flower production, pollen viability, nectar production, fruit set, and seed set) performance variables, and the abundance and activity of floral visitors were examined. Key ResultsDefoliated plants overcompensated for tissue loss by producing more new leaves than control plants. Production of staminate flowers gradually decreased with increasing defoliation and the floral sex ratio (staminate: pistillate flowers) was drastically reduced in high-defoliation plants. In contrast, female reproductive performance (pistillate flower production, fruit set and seed set) and pollinator visitation and abundance were not impacted by defoliation.Conclusions The asymmetrical effects of defoliation on male and female traits of C. suberosus may be due to the temporal and spatial flexibility in the allocation of resources deployed by monoecious plants. We posit that this helps to maintain the plant's pollination success in the face of leaf herbivory stress. © The Author 2010.

Such multispecies interactions can give rise to trait-mediated indirect effects that are likely to be common in nature but which are also inherently difficult to predict. Understanding multispecies interactions is also important in the use of biological control agents to control invasive plants because modern approaches to biocontrol rely on releasing multiple agents for each target weed. Centaurea solstitialis is one of the most problematic invasive weeds in California, USA, and the weevil Eustenopus villosus is its dominant biological control agent. We conducted a field experiment to quantitatively assess the direct effect of the recently approved biocontrol pathogen Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis on plant performance and any indirect effects that might arise by altering the plant's interactions with Eustenopus or its pollinators (principally the nonnative Apis mellifera). We documented both synergy and interference between the two biocontrol agents depending on the life stage of the weevil. Puccinia infection increased the impact of bud-feeding by the adult weevils but reduced the impact of seed-feeding by larval weevils. Neither infection nor Eustenopus attack had an effect on pollinator visitation. The net effect was that attack by both the pathogen and the weevil did not reduce plant fitness relative to plants attacked only by the weevil. Because the consequence to the plant of interacting with one species may depend on the presence or absence of other interacting species, a careful consideration of multispecies interactions may be necessary for the selection of biocontrol agents that act in a complementary manner to reduce plant fitness. Likewise, relatively tractable weed-biocontrol systems allow us to examine multispecies interactions that can be difficult to study experimentally in native systems that are composed of numerous species with well-established populations. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biological control; California, USA; Centaurea solstitialis; Cumulative stress; Eustenopus villosus; Indirect interactions; Interference; Puccinia jaceae f.s. solstitialis; Synergy; Yellow starthistle",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955455079

This polymorphism is widely distributed among the angiosperms, but detailed studies are limited to few taxonomic groups. Although a small representation, evolutionary meaningful variations of the heterostylous syndrome have been reported when precise measurements of the sexual whorls were taken. A thorough exploration of groups where heterostyly has been reported should offer new opportunities to further testing the evolutionary hypotheses explaining heterostyly. Here, the traits defining heterostyly were explored in half of the species in Nivenia, the only genus of Iridiaceae where heterostyly has been reported. Methods Detailed morphometric analysis of the flower sexual whorls and some traits considered as ancillary are supplied to determine for each population (a) the kind of stylar polymorphism, (b) the morph ratio and (c) the degree of reciprocity between sexual whorls. Also the rates of assortative (within morph) versus disassortative (between morphs) pollen transfer were estimated by analysing pollen loads on stigmas. The association between floral phenotypic integration and the reciprocity between sexual whorls was estimated; both characteristics have been quoted as dependent on the accuracy of the fit between pollinators and flowers and therefore related to the efficiency of pollen transfer. Key ResultsDifferent types of polymorphism, differing in their degree of reciprocity, were found in Nivenia. Effective disassortative mating appears to be common, since (a) all dimorphic populations show equal morph-ratios (isoplethy), and (b) the pollen placed on the stigmas of each morph is likely to be coming from the other (complementary) morph. The most reciprocal populations of the heterostylous species have also the highest values of phenotypical integration.Conclusions Stigma height dimorphism, as opposed to distyly, is proven for the first time in Nivenia. The presence of different types of polymorphism within the genus is consistent with hypotheses of the evolution of heterostyly. The role of the pollinators as the leading force of the transition seems to be apparent, since floral integration is related to reciprocity. © The Author 2010.

Primary ears were inoculated with a fresh spore suspension (mixture of five A. flavus isolates from Northern Italy), by spraying silks, as a modification of the non-wounding silk channel inoculation technique (SCIA); controls were both non-inoculated and sterile water-inoculated ears. Ear secondary traits, such as silk channel length measured at pollination and husk coverage at maturity, were recorded for each hybrid. The severity of ear A. flavus attack was estimated using rating scales based on the percentage of kernels with visible symptoms of infection. The aflatoxin concentration in the inoculated ears resulted, during both years, higher than in the controls; this indication confirmed that the A. flavus isolates used for the inoculum procedure were successful in accumulating mycotoxin in grains. Variability was found among the hybrids under study: aflatoxin accumulation, after artificial inoculation, ranged from 0.13 to 705.25 ng/g. The data herein presented supported the implication of two ear secondary traits in determining aflatoxin accumulation. Silk channel length recorded at pollination was negatively correlated (r = -0.54; P<0.05) with aflatoxin accumulation; on the contrary, a positive correlation (r = 0.48; P<0.05) between husk coverage rating at maturity and aflatoxin concentration suggested that a looser husk coverage is associated with higher aflatoxin accumulation. The correlation between the two mentioned ear-related traits was negative (r = -0.73; P<0.05); this indicated that hybrids showing a good coverage at pollination stage, are favoured in keeping the ear tip covered until maturity, reducing the risk of aflatoxin accumulation. © 2010 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",Aflatoxin; Artificial inoculation; Aspergillus flavus; Commercial hybrids; Zea mays L,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955671344

Previous attempts to correlate these cycles with variation in meteorological factors have had little success. In Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) and other species which produce aeroallergenic pollen, these cycles also present a major burden to public health. In a large field dominated by A. artemisiifolia, we collected measurements of low-atmosphere pollen concentration and pollen release from individual A. artemisiifolia flowers. We then constructed a relatively simple model that relates early morning variations in relative humidity to the probability distribution of anther dehiscence initiation timing and incorporates quantitative data on the progression of diurnal pollen release from individual male flowers. The model successfully predicts normalized pollen concentration above the field. We suggest that the extension of a tiny floral organ unique to this genus and some closely related taxa explains a ubiquitous, but previously overlooked, large-scale feature in patterns of A. artemisiifolia pollen dispersal. Our study shows that pollen release at the flower scale is a physiological characteristic that is intrinsically bimodal, but highly asynchronous anther rupture caused by variations in relative humidity sometimes obscures this effect and determines the overall pattern of pollen release at the scale of the entire field. We suggest that future attempts to predict diurnal pollen dispersal cycles should consider direct observations of species-specific floral development and morphology. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Ambrosia artemisiifolia; Anthesis; Dehiscence; Dispersal; Diurnal; Pistillodium; Pollen; Ragweed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954761296

Prodoxus coloradensis (Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) is a yucca moth, which feeds on the flowering stalks of three Yucca species as larvae, but does not provide pollination service. To test for evidence of host-associated speciation, we examined the genetic structure of P. coloradensis using mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear (elongation factor 1 alpha) DNA sequence data.

In each case, current ideas on the origin, evolution and function are discussed. The information presented in this review enables two main conclusions to be drawn. The first is that changes in the homeotic control of floral organ identity may have had a profound impact on floral structure in several disparate lineages in the family. This is most obvious in Fenerivia, in which a centrifugal shift of floral organ identity has occurred, and in Dasymaschalon, in which a reverse (centripetal) shift has occurred. Other genera that have gained or lost entire perianth whorls are likely to have undergone similar homeotic changes. Attention is also drawn to the extensive functional convergence in Annonaceae flowers, with widespread homoplasy in many characters that have previously been emphasized in higher-level classifications. © 2009 Cambridge Philosophical Society.",androdioecy; Annonaceae; convergence; homeosis; phylogeny; pollination chamber; stamens; staminodes; sympetaly; syncarpy; unisexuality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954584994

Organisms with low mobility, living within ephemeral environments, need to find vehicles that can disperse them reliably to new environments. The requirement for specificity in this passenger-vehicle relationship is enhanced within a tritrophic interaction when the environment of passenger and vehicle is provided by a third organism. Such relationships pose many interesting questions about specificity within a tritrophic framework. 2. Central to understanding how these tritrophic systems have evolved, is knowing how they function now. Determining the proximal cues and sensory modalities used by passengers to find vehicles and to discriminate between reliable and non-reliable vehicles is, therefore, essential to this investigation. 3. The ancient, co-evolved and highly species-specific nursery pollination mutualism between figs and fig wasps is host to species-specific plant-parasitic nematodes which use fig wasps to travel between figs. Since individual globular fig inflorescences, i.e. syconia, serve as incubators for hundreds of developing pollinating and parasitic wasps, a dispersal-stage nematode within such a chemically complex and physically crowded environment is faced with the dilemma of choosing the right vehicle for dispersal into a new fig. Such a system therefore affords excellent opportunities to investigate mechanisms that contribute to the evolution of specificity between the passenger and the vehicle. 4. In this study of fig-wasp-nematode tritrophic interactions in Ficus racemosa within which seven wasp species can breed, we demonstrate using two-choice as well as cafeteria assays that plant-parasitic nematodes (Schistonchus racemosa) do not hitch rides randomly on available eclosing wasps within the fig syconium, but are specifically attracted, at close range, i.e. 3 mm distance, to only that vehicle which can quickly, within a few hours, reliably transfer it to another fig. This vehicleisthe female pollinating wasp. Male wasps and female parasitic wasps are inappropriate vehicles since the former are wingless and die within the fig, while the latter never enter another fig. Nema-todes distinguished between female pollinating wasps and other female parasitic wasps using volatiles and cuticular hydrocarbons. Nematodes could not distinguish between cuticular hydrocarbons of male and female pollinators but used other cues, such as volatiles, at close range, to find female pollinating wasps with which they have probably had along history of chemical adaptation. 5.

Data analysed by parsimony and Bayesian inference methods demonstrate that Agaonidae are monophyletic and that the previous classification is not supported. Agaonidae are partitioned into four groups: (i) Tetrapus, (ii) Ceratosolen + Kradibia, (iii) some Blastophaga + Wiebesia species, and (iv) all genera associated with monoecious figs and a few Blastophaga and Wiebesia. The latter group is subdivided into subgroups: (i) Pleistodontes, (ii) Blastophaga psenes and neocaledonian Dolichoris, (iii) some Blastophaga and Wiebesia species, and (iv) Platyscapa, all afrotropical genera and all genera associated with section Conosycea. Eleven genera were recovered as monophyletic, six were para- or polyphyletic, and two cannot be tested with our data set. Based on our phylogeny we propose a new classification for the Agaonidae. Two new subfamilies are proposed: Tetrapusiinae for the genus Tetrapus, and Kradibiinae for Ceratosolen + Kradibia. Liporrhopalum is synonymized with Kradibia and the subgenus Valisia of Blastophaga is elevated to generic rank. These changes resulted in 36 new combinations.

However, the contribution of intraspecific variation in behaviours, especially between sexes, remains less understood. We explored resource preference and resource use by male and female Manduca sexta hawkmoths, relative to two important nectar resources in southern Arizona, U.S.A. Manduca sexta is the major pollinator of one of these species (Datura wrightii, Solanaceae). Because females must also seek out D. wrightii as an oviposition resource, females were predicted to feed upon it more than would males, which should be free to choose the best nectar resource. Using naïve laboratory-reared moths in flight arena experiments, we found that both sexes preferred Datura wrightii over Agave palmeri (Agavaceae). Exposure to only one species and an odourless paper control, however, revealed sex-specific differences in foraging behaviour, with females feeding longer from A. palmeri and males feeding longer from D. wrightii, leading us to reject our hypothesis. Differences in feeding preferences directly translated into differences in energy intake. Females gained significantly more energy than did males by feeding from A. palmeri. We also examined whether behavioural preferences of moths in the laboratory translated into foraging behaviour in the field. Pollen load analysis of moths caught in 2004 showed that females carried significantly more A. palmeri pollen than did males, whereas males carried more D. wrightii pollen than did females. Whereas most studies examine pollination associations at the species level, our results highlight the potential importance of between-sex variation in floral visits. © 2010.",Agave palmeri; Datura wrightii; Hawkmoth foraging behaviour; Manduca sexta; Pollen load analysis; Pollination; Sex-specific behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954761751

Using the Honeybee Apis mellifera as a case study, and information derived from highly experienced commercial apiarists, we determined that 32 exotic plants are important pollen sources. Most species offered high to very high quality pollen. Pollen quality varied temporally, spatially and infraspecifically. Fifteen species were considered more beneficial to A. mellifera than others; only seven species were considered less beneficial.

We explored how much plasticity occurs in both vegetative and floral traits of Tolumnia variegata (Oncidiinae, Orchidaceae) across two different light environments in Puerto Rico using data from a reciprocal transplant experiment. We also examined how fruit set, a measure of reproductive success and a surrogate for fitness, is associated with this morphological variation, and whether it changes over time. Tolumnia variegata responded to environmental variables in multiple ways. Vegetative characters were more plastic than those associated with sexual reproduction. Transplant effects accounted for significant variation in flower length, lip length, number of inflorescences, peduncle length, leaf length and the total number of ramets, but responses were not always consistent among years. Phenotypic selection on morphological characters was dependent on plant location. The trends detected were complex, and often inconsistent across years, probably as a result of wetter and drier years than average. Overall fruit set was quite variable among plants, averaging 15%, with no significant differences among sun and shade plants. Although reproductive success was similar among sites, habitat heterogeneity and annual variation had an effect on morphological expression, which sometimes modified the trajectories of phenotypic selection. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Deception pollination; Floral evolution; Morphological variation; Orchidaceae; Phenotypic plasticity; Pollination ecology; Puerto Rico; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955935021

We analyzed mating system and pollen structure in two population fragments and two continuous forest populations of Dieffenbachia seguine (Araceae), an insect-pollinated understory herb in the tropical rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, México, using nine allozyme loci. Mating system analysis indicated almost complete outcrossing but some inbreeding among the adults. Pollen structure analysis indicated highly restricted pollen flow, both within and among populations. We showed that the effective pollination neighborhood was small in all populations, and slightly (though not significantly) smaller in fragments, partially as a consequence of an increase in density of reproductive individuals in those fragments. Using assignment analysis, we showed that all populations were strongly structured, suggesting that pollen and seed flow across the Los Tuxtlas landscape has been spatially restricted, though sufficient to maintain connectedness. Forest fragmentation at Los Tuxtlas has (so far) had limited impact on pollen dynamics, despite the changing ecological context, with reduced pollinator abundance being partially offset by increased flowering density in fragments. Continued outcrossing and limited pollen immigration, coupled with more extensive seed migration, should maintain genetic connectedness in D. seguine, if fragmentation is not further exacerbated by additional deforestation. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Vass. is a rare, central Asian desert species which shows lower fruit set and seed set (<16%) than most hermaphroditic species. We hypothesized that fruit production was limited by pollen and resources. To evaluate potential fruit abortion due to pollen limitation, supplemental hand-pollination was undertaken, the mating system was investigated and the foraging behavior of pollinators was recorded. To investigate possibile resource limitation, flowers and young pods were artificially removed and fertilization were manipulated. The results showed that under natural pollination, the number of pollen deposited on the stigma greatly exceed the number of ovules per ovary. Mating system experiments showed that the species is self-compatible, but depended on pollinators to set seeds. Supplemental outcross pollination increased fruit set significantly. The most frequent effective pollinator Megachile terminate Morawitz, was observed pollinating many flowers of the same individual plant (74.5±1.3%). These results suggested that fruit production is affected by insufficient outcross pollen rather than by pollen quantity. Removal of 2/3 of the flowers and young pods led to significantly higher fruit set, as did addition of fertilizers (N-P-K: 0.025-0.05-0.013 g, N-P-K: 0.05-0.1-0.025 g) showing that reducing resource acceptors and increasing inorganic resources both helps to improve fruit set.

Actinomorphy in Gesneriaceae is rare, with most species exhibiting zygomorphic flowers. The actinomorphic genera have historically been considered ""primitive"" and lumped in the tribe Ramondeae separate from the remaining Old World Gesneriaceae. In this study, we used nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-F) DNA for molecular phylogenetic analysis of these five genera along with representative species across the Cyrtandroideae. Our results show that the actinomorphic genera are scattered over several otherwise zygomorphic clades within Cyrtandroideae, and along with previous data, indicate that Ramondeae is an unnatural group. Floral actinomorphy has evolved convergently in different alliances of Old World Gesneriaceae. Ramonda is sister to Haberlea, Bournea is apparently paraphyletic, Conandron seems rather isolated, and Tengia is close to Petrocodon and sister to a group of Chirita sect. Gibbosaccus together with Calcareoboea. We hypothesize that the evolution from zygomorphy to actinomorphy with novel combinations of characters is possibly due to shifts in pollination strategies, such as a switch from nectar- to pollen-rewards.",Flower actinomorphy; Gesneriaceae; nrDNA ITS; Phylogeny; Polyphyly; trnL-F,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956220072

Determination of S-RNase-allele content in progeny of 'Avri', 'Yehuda', and 'Akko 1', obtained in an open-pollinated, mixed-cultivar orchard, revealed that all of the progeny derived from self-fertilization contained the S6 haplotype, indicating that a mutation in the S6 locus is responsible for the self-fertilization. However, sequencing of most of the S6-RNase gene (from C1 to C5) did not reveal any mutation and the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that it has the expected S-RNase primary and tertiary structural organization. Nonetheless, because it is apparent that the S6-RNase allele is linked to the self-compatibility trait, it could serve as a marker for early selection of self-compatible loquat cultivars.",Crosspollination; Gametophytic self-incompatibility; Progeny analysis; Self-and cross-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958105708

However, it is difficult to disentangle to what extent diversification is really driven by herbivores or by other historical-geographical processes like allopatric isolation. In the cruciferous plant Barbarea vulgaris, some Danish individuals are resistant to herbivory by flea beetles (Phyllotreta nemorum), whereas others are not. The flea beetles are, in parallel, either resistant or susceptible to the plants defenses. To understand the historical-evolutionary framework of these interactions, we tested how genetically divergent resistant and susceptible plants are, using microsatellite markers. To test whether they are reproductively fully compatible, resistant and susceptible plants were grown intermixed in an outdoor experiment, and the paternity of open-pollinated offspring was determined by analysis of molecular markers. Resistant and susceptible Danish plants were genetically strongly differentiated and produced significantly fewer hybrids than expected from random mating or nearest neighbour mating. Our results suggest that the two types belong to different evolutionary lineages that have been (partly) isolated at some time, during which genetic and reproductive divergence evolved. A parsimonious scenario could be that the two plant types were isolated in different refugia during the previous ice age, from which they migrated into and met in Denmark and possibly neighbouring regions. If so, resistance and susceptibility has for unknown reasons become associated with the different evolutionary lineages. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",evolutionary divergence; insect herbivory; paternity; resistance; sexual incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955401743

The objectives were to analyse the potential of 25 germplasm resources of various geographic origin for the rapid improvement of biomass yield compared with 22 and 12 full-sib families selected for forage and grain use, respectively. Population per se and testcross performance with two testers were evaluated for early growth, heading, plant height, dry matter content and dry matter yield across seven environments (location-year combinations) harvested as whole plants at late milk-ripening. Dry matter yield ranged, on an average, from 130 to 141 dt/ha for population per se performance and from 150 to 158 dt/ha for testcross performance (0% water content). Genotypic variances were significant (P = 0.01) throughout, entry-mean heritabilities for biomass yield were moderate to high (0.67-0.91). In both materials, germplasm resources and forage rye had on average the highest biomass yield. The best individual entry was a population hybrid with 'Florida Black' as pollinator (173 dt/ha). Three released hybrid cultivars selected for high grain yield were among the entries with the lowest biomass yield at milk ripening. Germplasm resources showed significant genotypic correlations between dry matter yield and early growth, heading date, dry matter content in the testcrosses.

Despite routine insecticide applications for thrips control, some plum producers report economic losses due to pansy spot damage, pits and holes that render fruit unfit for export. Six commercial plum orchards in two climatic regions in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, were monitored to determine (1) why current management practices based on monitoring and insecticide applications failed to prevent damage in some orchards, and (2) whether WFT is responsible for pitting damage. Western flower thrips was the dominant thrips species in all orchards, though low numbers of Frankliniella schultzei Trybom also occurred. Blue sticky traps were more efficient for monitoring WFT and F. schultzei than yellow traps. Insecticide applications early in bloom and unfavourable weather conditions for thrips flight contributed to very low numbers of WFT on sticky traps during the flowering and fruit set periods. Flower dissections, however, revealed varying levels of oviposition damage to ovaries and fruitlets. Dissections confirmed that WFT enter flowers to lay eggs in the ovaries and other flower parts before petals are fully open. No consistent significant relationship between sticky trap counts and WFT oviposition damage to plums were found, therefore no treatment threshold level could be recommended. Insecticide applications during bloom limited thrips feeding damage, but were too late to prevent oviposition damage. Some oviposition sites developed into typical pansy spots, whilst others formed holes or pits that increased in size as the fruit matured. After insecticide applications ended, and as air temperature increased, WFT populations increased. Weeds and wild vegetation in and around orchards provide a continuous source of potential infestation for as long as the fruit remains attractive and vulnerable to WFT. As oviposition damage by WFT can occur before flowers open, and because of the risk to pollinators when insecticides are applied during flowering, a purely chemical control strategy does not appear to be feasible. A new approach to WFT management is required. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Chemical control; Frankliniella occidentalis; Monitoring; Oviposition damage; Sticky traps; Western flower thrips,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954815096

Development of mango hybrid remains a major focus to boost local industry. Pakistan, being an important mango producing country developed a hybrid 'Faiz Kareem' by making a cross between two commercial mango cultivars i.e., Anwar Ratole X Chaunsa. These studies were carried out to compare the fruit ripening behaviour and quality of this new promising mango hybrid cultivar Faiz Kareem with its parents under ambient (28±2°C; 65-70% RH) conditions. Mature fruits of three cultivars were harvested randomly from a commercial orchard in district Multan, Punjab. During ripening, data on various physico-chemical characteristics including physiological fruit weight loss percentage, fruit softness, visual peel colour, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, sugars, vitamin C, and total carotenoids were recorded daily up to 7 days. Under ambient conditions all the cultivars took 7 days to ripe however, Faiz Kareem expressed better firmness, which indicates its potential for extended shelf life. Highest levels of total sugars (25.88%), total soluble solids (26.75°Brix) and total carotenoids (69.99?g g-1) were observed in Chaunsa while lowest in Faiz Kareem (23.71%, 25.54°Brix and 24.60 ?g g-1, respectively) which can be an advantage for extended storage and for sugar conscious consumers. Taste panel studies also showed clear preference for hybrid cultivar Faiz Kareem followed by Chaunsa and Anwar Ratole. Results of the study will help to understand the potential of Faiz Kareem for domestic and export markets.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958533624

Despite a growing interest in forest canopy biology, very few studies have examined the vertical distribution of forest bees. In this study, bees were sampled using 12 pairs of flight-intercept traps suspended in the canopy (?15 m) and near the ground (0.5 m) in a bottomland hardwood forest in the southeastern United States. 2. In total, 6653 bees from 5 families and 71 species were captured. Augochlora pura (Say) (Halictidae), accounted for over 91% of all bees collected and was over 40 times more abundant on average in the canopy than near the ground. 3. Even after removing A. pura from the dataset, bee abundance, richness and Shannon's diversity were considerably higher in the canopy than near the ground. 4. According to both non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarities, the bee community in the canopy was distinct from that near the ground. Based on indicator species analysis, A. pura, Lasioglossum imitatum (Smith), Lasioglossum versatum sensu Mitch., and Lasioglossum zephyrum (Smith) were significantly associated with the canopy whereas Andrena personata Robertson and Lasioglossum macoupinense (Robertson) were significantly associated with the ground. 5. Augochlora pura was consistently more abundant in the canopy than near the ground throughout the season, but was more so in mid-to-late summer (i.e., June-September), a period coinciding with low floral resource availability. As a group, the remaining bee community exhibited a similar pattern. 6. We suspect that bees frequent the canopy, particularly during times of low nectar and pollen availability, to acquire non-floral resources such as honeydew and sap. © 2010 The Royal Entomological Society.",Arboreal; Arthropods; Biodiversity; Bottomland hardwood forests; Floodplains; Insects; Pollinators; Sweat bees; Vertical stratification; Wetlands; Window traps,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958536403

While it is expected that embryo development will be under maternal control, more controversial hypotheses suggest that the pollen donor and the embryo itself may influence development. These latter possibilities are, however, poorly studied. Characteristics of 10-d-old embryos and seeds of wild radish (Raphanus sativus) were examined to address: (a) the effects of maternal plant and pollen donor on development; (b) the effects of earlier reproductive events (pollen tube growth and fertilization) on embryos and seeds, and the influence of embryo size on mature seed mass; (c) the effect of water stress on embryos and seeds; (d) the effect of stress on correlations of embryo and seed characteristics with earlier and later reproductive events and stages; and (e) changes in maternal and paternal effects on embryo and seed characteristics during development. Methods Eight maternal plants (two each from four families) and four pollen donors were crossed and developing gynoecia were collected at 10 d post-pollination. Half of the maternal plants experienced water stress. Characteristics of embryos and seeds were summarized and also compared with earlier and later developmental stages. Key ResultsIn addition to the expected effects of the maternal plants, all embryo characters differed among pollen donors. Paternal effects varied over time, suggesting that there are windows of opportunity for pollen donors to influence embryo development. Water-stress treatment altered embryo characteristics; embryos were smaller and less developed. In addition, correlations of embryo characteristics with earlier and later stages changed dramatically with water stress.Conclusions The expected maternal effects on embryo development were observed, but there was also evidence for an early paternal role. The relative effects of these controls may change over time. Thus, there may be times in development when selection on the maternal, paternal or embryo contributions to development are more and less likely. © The Author 2010.

To test the hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches, with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge distance index) ranging from 37.5m to 245.8m. We examined the average number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selfing, the amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources (Nep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selfing and immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen, intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest Nep among the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less connectivity than trees within continuous forest. These findings indicate that forest management practices should emphasize the maintenance of an optimal patch size because, despite the fact that tree species show the potential for long distance pollen movement, the number of local trees strongly influences the mating patterns. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",AIC; Fragmentation; General linear model; Paternity analysis; Pinus tabulaeformis; Urban landscape,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955516446

These include fruit set after self-pollination and bagging, pollen tube growth, and the more recent Sf allele identification by molecular markers and gene sequencing. However, none of these methods have given fully reliable results because they all show advantages and limitations. Pollen contamination may distort pollination results as well as inaccuracies during fruit setting operations. Factors other than self-compatibility such as inbreeding may affect fruit set and pollen tube growth. Detection of S alleles by RNase activity and polymerase chain reaction analysis by consensus primers has not always been conclusive. The differential phenotypic expression of the Sfa and the Sfi alleles has revealed that the presence of the Sf allele is not the only requirement for selfcompatibility expression in almond. As a consequence, the coding region of the Sf allele may not be the sole factor involved in that expression, which may be caused by modifier genes outside this region. Missequencing of alleles has also created confusion for allele identification. Thus, self-compatibility evaluation in almond must involve a better knowledge of the plant material as a whole, and not only of its genotype. All factors involved in setting a commercial crop in conditions of solid plantings of a single cultivar must be put together to evaluate almond self-compatibility. This approach is fundamental for the understanding of self-compatibility in almond and for the evaluation of the new selections in a breeding program.",Allele identification; Breeding; Gene sequencing; Modifier genes; Prunus amygdalus batsch; Sf allele,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958105361

However, situations may arise when the management of focal species places non-target species at risk. In the Willamette Valley of western Oregon, USA, eradication of a naturally hybridizing Grindelia integrifolia × Grindelia nana (Asteraceae) population from a wildlife refuge to preserve genetically ""pure"" populations of endemic G. integrifolia populations to the North, eliminated a dominant, late-summer, flowering plant from the plant community. While this decision undoubtedly arose from good intentions, the hybrid Grindelia was the sole pollen resource for the last known population (numbered in 100s prior to Grindelia removal) of an endemic solitary bee, Melissodes pullatella (Anthophoridae), a rare wetland butterfly, Lycaena xanthoides (Lycaenidae), and very likely additional pollinators. Approximately 15 years after the removal of Grindelia from the wildlife refuge, we found several small populations of M. pullatella (<20 individuals sighted) about 70 km to the south of the refuge in hybrid Grindelia-dominated remnant and restored wetlands. We present this case study to highlight the loss of local biodiversity that can accompany single species driven ecosystem management.

This rich secretion needs mechanisms to inhibit microbial growth. In Nicotiana spp. nectar, anti-microbial activity is due to the production of hydrogen peroxide. In a close relative, Petunia hybrida, limited production of hydrogen peroxide was found; yet petunia nectar still has anti-bacterial properties, suggesting that a different mechanism may exist for this inhibition. The nectar proteins of petunia plants were compared with those of ornamental tobacco and significant differences were found in protein profiles and function between these two closely related species. Among those proteins, RNase activities unique to petunia nectar were identified. The genes corresponding to four RNase T2 proteins from Petunia hybrida that show unique expression patterns in different plant tissues were cloned. Two of these enzymes, RNase Phy3 and RNase Phy4 are unique among the T2 family and contain characteristics similar to both S- and S-like RNases.

Batsch] is one of the most economically important fruit crops that, due to its genetic and biological characteristics (small genome size, taxonomic proximity to other important species and short juvenile period), has become a model plant in genomic studies of fruit trees. Our aim was an in-depth study of the extent, distribution and structure of peach genetic variation in North American and European commercial varieties as well as old Spanish varieties and several founders used in the early USA peach breeding programmes. For this we genotyped 224 peach cultivars using 50 SSRs evenly distributed along the 8 linkage groups of the Prunus reference map.Results: Genetic distance analysis based on SSRs divided the peach cultivars in three main groups based mainly on their fruit characteristics: melting flesh peaches, melting flesh nectarines and non-melting varieties. Whereas non-melting flesh peaches had a higher number of alleles than melting peaches and nectarines, they were more homozygous. With some exceptions ('Admiral Dewey', 'Early Crawford' and 'Chinese Cling'), the founder US cultivars clustered together with the commercial melting peaches, indicating that their germplasm is well represented in modern cultivars. Population structure analysis showed a similar subdivision of the sample into subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis in three unstructured, or barely structured, subpopulations revealed a high level of LD conservation in peach extending up to 13-15 cM.Conclusions: Using a much larger set of SSRs, our results confirm previous observations on peach variability and population structure and provide additional tools for breeding and breeders' rights enforcement. SSR data are also used for the estimation of marker mutation rates and allow pedigree inferences, particularly with founder genotypes of the currently grown cultivars, which are useful to understand the evolution of peach as a crop. Results on LD conservation can be explained by the self-pollinating nature of peach cultivated germplasm and by a bottleneck that occurred at the beginning of modern breeding practices. High LD suggests that the development of whole-genome scanning approaches is suitable for genetic studies of agronomically important traits in peach. © 2010 Aranzana et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954685941

In the southern Italian mountains they grow at altitudes above 1500 m a.s.l. in wide grazed clearings or over the timberline, and are characteristic of xeric communities, rich in flora and fauna. Nowadays, the conservation of these species is threatened because of the dynamism in the patterns of vegetation and the extremely scarce natural regeneration. This paper presents the initial results of ongoing nursery and laboratory experiments carried out on seed germination and vegetative propagation of autochthonous dwarf junipers (Juniperus hemisphaerica Presl, Juniperus nana Willd.) of the highmountain areas of Pollino National Park (southern Italy) to promote ex situ conservation.

A fragment of BoiDAD1F was amplified from this specie using primers designed against the conserved DAD1F fragment of DAD1 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa. The BoiDAD1F sequence was 88 and 99% similar to the homologous genes in Arabidopsis and B. rapa, respectively. The antisense BoiDAD1F was then cloned onto pBI 121 vector to make the transformation construct, pBI-antiBoiDAD1F. Cotyledons with petiole were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring the pBI-antiBoiDAD1F plasmid. Positive transformation was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blots. Twenty individual transformants were obtained, of which 15 showed suppressed DAD1 mRNA level. Pollens produced by the male sterile transgenic plants germinated poorly (? 10%). No seeds were produced on the flowering transgenic plants, and the siliquae were empty, or the few shrinked seeds, which failed to germinate. When pollinated with wild type plant pollen, the siliquas of the transgenic plants enlarged to produce normal seeds. No morphological differences were observed between the transgenic and wild type plants, except a few abnormal flowers on transgenic ones. To restore the fertility, exogenous JA were applied by dipping the floral buds into an aqueous solution containing 500 ?M MeJA and 0.05% Tween 20 after removal of the opened flowers on the inflorescence. The treated flower produced normal pollens which germinated on the medium, and were fertile. T1 population consisted of fertile and sterile plants in the ratio of 3:1. The T2 population comprised of both complete fertile and sterile lines.

However, there are few field-scale studies that could aid in predicting the potential risks to rice yield and developing countermeasures against yield losses. The aim of this study was to elucidate the factors that induce floret sterility under high temperature conditions during the flowering season in the field condition in China. Studies were conducted in irrigated paddy fields with the regional hybrid-rice cultivars grown in Jianghan Basin where air temperature is not so high during the flowering season but HIFS frequently occurs. The microclimate, panicle temperature, floret sterility, pollination, and size of dehiscence formed at the base of anthers were investigated. Signifi cant losses in seed set were observed under the high temperature condition. Although the maximum atmospheric temperature was approximately 35oC, the relative humidity was very high (around 70% at the time of maximum temperature), with low wind speeds, occasionally below 1 m s-1. Under such conditions sunlit panicle temperature exceeded atmospheric temperature by as much as 4oC. Moreover, the anthers of some cultivars exhibited short basal dehiscence, and the dehiscence length was positively correlated with the percentage of suffi ciently pollinated florets (r=0.859, P&lt;0.05, n=7) and with seed set (r=0.827, P&lt;0.05, n=7) across the cultivars. The results suggest that the combination of hot, humid, and windless climatic conditions with short basal dehiscence of anthers induces HIFS in hybrid rice grown in this region.",Anther dehiscence; Heat-induced floret sterility; Humidity; Panicle temperature; Pollination stability; Rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954465984

Fifty dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) and positive intradermal skin test (IDST) reactions to other environmental allergens were included in this study along with 30 dogs without clinical signs of CAD. Both groups were tested intradermally with Ambrosia artemisiifolia extract in concentration of 1000 PNU/mL (provided by ""Institute of virology, vaccines and sera - Torlak""). We have found that Ambrosia extract was second most common allergen to yield positive intradermal test reactions just after house dust mites. The positive reaction of IDST was observed in 66% of the atopic dogs and in 10% of clinically healthy dogs.

In particular, flowers pollinated by generalist avian nectarivores tend to have very dilute nectar dominated by hexose sugars. To establish whether pollinator-mediated selection can explain these traits, we tested nectar sugar preferences and digestive capabilities of the village weaver (Ploceus cucullatus), a common generalist passerine nectarivore in South Africa. When offered pairwise choices of equicaloric hexose and sucrose solutions, village weavers preferred hexose solutions at 5% and 10% sucrose equivalents (SE) but did not show significant preference for either type of sugar when higher concentrations were offered (15%, 20% and 25% SE). Birds were less efficient at absorbing sucrose than hexose sugars, as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of excreta sugar content. This was true at both concentrations tested (8.22% and 25%), although apparent sucrose assimilation rates were still relatively high (89.6±2.9% at low concentrations and 93.6±1.7% at high concentrations). Transit times indicated that sucrose also passes through the digestive tract faster than hexose sugars, particularly when consumed at high concentrations. This may limit the rate at which sucrose can be hydrolyzed before absorption. These results indicate that hexose preferences in generalist avian nectarivores may help explain the low sucrose content in flowers pollinated by these birds. Moreover, the preference for hexose sugars in weavers was most evident at the low concentrations (ca. 9% sugar by mass) that are typical of nectar in flowers pollinated by generalist avian nectarivores. © 2010.

The diploid seedless fruits were almost similar to normal fruits in development from pollination to maturity. The number of empty seeds in the diploid seedless fruits varied among the cultivars used. Seedless watermelon cultivars revealed a significant increase in total sugar and carotenoids (lycopene and gb-carotene) contents. The pollen tubes of the pollen subjected to ?-radiation penetrated normally into the synergid, and sperm cells were discharged. Subsequently, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus became attached to each other in the egg cell and a globular embryo was formed. However, the embryo failed to differentiate the tissues and degenerated. It is suggested that seedless watermelon fruits induced by ?-rays are characterized by increasing yield and better quality due to higher carotenoid and total sugar contents and fruit weight.

Gelatinization of the native starches showed a major thermal transition with peak temperature at 76.6-81.0 °C. An additional peak (?97.1 °C) first appeared 20 days after pollination and then developed into a significant peak on later dates. After removal of lipids from the starch, this peak disappeared, but the conclusion gelatinization temperature remained the same. The proportion of the enthalpy change of the thermal transition above 95 0C, calculated from the thermogram of the defatted starch, increased with kernel maturation and was significantly correlated with the RS content of the starch (r=0.98).

One diploid plant was chosen among the various F1 progenies and developed into an F2 population via self-pollination. Compared with the control variety Shanyou 63, this F2 population had a stable agronomical performance in field trials, as confirmed by the F-test. The stability of the F2 population was further substantiated by molecular analysis with simple sequence repeat markers. Specifically, of 160 markers assayed, 37 (covering all 12 chromosomes) were polymorphic between the parental lines. Testing the F1 hybrid individually with these markers showed that each PCR product had only a single band instead of two bands from each parent. The bands were identical to either maternal (23 markers) or paternal (eight markers) bands or distinct from both parents (six markers). The amplified bands of all 60 randomly selected F2 plants were uniform and identical to those of the F1 hybrid.

There are few predictions about the directionality or extent of morphological trait (mis)matches between interacting organisms. We review and analyse studies on morphological trait complementarity (e.g. floral tube length versus insect mouthpart length) at the population and species level. Results. Plants have consistently more exaggerated morphological traits than insects at high trait magnitudes and in some cases less exaggerated traits than insects at smaller trait magnitudes. This result held at the population level, as well as for phylogenetically adjusted analyses at the species-level and for both pollination and host-parasite interactions, perhaps suggesting a general pattern. Across communities, the degree of trait mismatch between one specialist plant and its more generalized pollinator was related to the level of pollinator specialization at each site; the observed pattern supports the ""life-dinner principle"" of selection acting more strongly on species with more at stake in the interaction. Similarly, plant mating system also affected the degree of trait correspondence because selfing reduces the reliance on pollinators and is analogous to pollination generalization. Conclusions. Our analyses suggest that there are predictable ""winners"" and ""losers"" of evolutionary arms races and the results of this study highlight the fact that breeding system and the degree of specialization can influence the outcome. © 2010 Anderson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954281014

Less well appreciated is the possibility that climate change could cause extinction by changing the ecological interactions between species. If ecologists, land managers and policy makers are to manage farmland biodiversity sustainably under global climate change, they need to understand the ways in which species interact with each other as this will affect the way they respond to climate change. Here, we consider the ability of nectar flower mixtures used in field margins to provide sufficient forage for bumble-bees under future climate change. We simulated the effect of global warming on the network of plant-pollinator interactions in two types of field margin: a four-species pollen and nectar mix and a six-species wildflower mix. While periods without flowering resources and periods with no food were rare, curtailment of the field season was very common for the bumble-bees in both mixtures. The effect of this, however, could be ameliorated by adding extra species at the start and end of the flowering season. The plant species that could be used to future-proof margins against global warming are discussed. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Bumble-bee; Climate change; Field margin,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954716677

This relationship is still poorly documented for many functionally important taxa, and at larger continental scales. With data from five replicated field studies from three countries, we examined how species richness of wild bees varies with habitat patch size. We hypothesized that the form of this relationship is affected by body size, degree of host plant specialization and sociality. Across all species, we found a positive species-area slope (z = 0.19), and species traits modified this relationship. Large-bodied generalists had a lower z value than small generalists. Contrary to predictions, small specialists had similar or slightly lower z value compared with large specialists, and small generalists also tended to be more strongly affected by habitat loss as compared with small specialists. Social bees were negatively affected by habitat loss (0 = 0.11) irrespective of body size. We conclude that habitat loss leads to clear shifts in the species composition of wild bee communities. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Body size; Bombus; Habitat fragmentation; Pollinator; Resource specialisation; Sociality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955095333

There isn't a certain chemical management against fire blight, although plant activators have been used, at present. It's very important to improve resistant varieties in terms of an integrated management of bacterial diseases. With this purpose, different crosses have been made between resistant cultigens and P. communis varieties that have good fruit characteristics. Besides, self-pollination and open pollination treatments have been carried out in parental plants. Pollen viability and germination ratio, fruit set ratio, total and mean seed number, seed germination ratio, the ratio of hybrid losses by root rot at early stage and the ratio of hybrid losses by natural fire blight infection were determined. The highest values of the properties such as pollen viability and germination ratio, fruit set ratio, mean and total seed number were obtained from the crosses with 'Kaiser Alexandre', 'Ankara', 'Akça', 'Conference' and 'Santa Maria' cultivars, in general. As a result of natural fire blight infection in Izmir-Turkey conditions, the resistance level of the hybrids from various combinations differed through the cultivars used for cross pollination, and it is very important to evaluate these hybrid pear populations through their response to fireblight disease in terms of obtaining new resistant cultivars and using these populations as disease resistant genetic resources in the future.",Breeding; Fruit set; Germination; Pear; Resistance; Seed number,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954152907

This view has been challenged by new molecular data in recent years, but surprisingly little is known about local and spatial genetic structuring of agaonid wasp populations. Using microsatellite markers, we analysed genetic structuring of Ceratosolen fusciceps, the fig wasp pollinating Ficus racemosa, a fig tree species widely distributed from India to Australia. In sampling stretching from the south of China to the south of Thailand we found evidence for only a single pollinating wasp species in continental South-East Asian mainland. We found no evidence for the co-occurrence of cryptic species within our subcontinent sampling zone. We observed no spatial genetic structure within sites and only limited structuring over the whole sampling zone, suggesting that F. racemosa is pollinated by a single population of a single agaonid wasp species all over continental South-East Asia. An additional sample of wasps collected on F. racemosa in Australia showed clear-cut genetic differentiation from the Asian continent, suggesting allopatric divergence into subspecies or species. We propose that the frequent local co-occurrence of sister species found in the literature mainly stems from contact zones between biogeographic regions, and that a single pollinator species over wide areas might be the more common situation everywhere else. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",allopatric speciation; cryptic species; fig pollinating wasp; genetic structuring; mutualism; specificity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954255646

We study whether airborne grass pollen trends have increased or decreased in a coastal city of the Mediterranean Basin, analysing not only annual and spring amounts but also phenological trends. We look to climatic change as the possible cause of any of these tendencies, without forgetting possible changes in land use in recent years. Since 1970s, Malaga has seen its annual mean temperature rise by 0.06°C/year. Some meteorologists have observed certain tendencies in the rainfall of the western Mediterranean area. As regards winds (barely studied), the frequency of calm has decreased and "" levant winds"" blowing off the sea have become more frequent, while SW winds have decreased in spring. The object of this contribution, then, is to analyse and individually explain the relation between (and possible influence of) each significant climatic trend and each significant atmospheric pollen trend. We have considered as significant the trends (regression lines) whose fitted points, determined by R2, provided a p value of ?0.05. We have obtained important results that allow us to explain the influence of certain climatic factors on the growth and pollination of these plants. During the springs of 1992-2007 there was a significant tendency for airborne grass pollen levels to increase, the number of days with high atmospheric concentrations (&gt;100grains/m3 air) also increasing, which would explain the increase in allergenic illnesses (pollinosis) recorded in the population of Malaga. This increased amount of spring pollen is associated with higher than usual rainfall and minimum temperatures during early spring (March and April), which would favour seed germination and vegetative growth in these plants. The increased rainfall of early spring is also associated with the tendency for pollination to start later. Lastly, the end of pollination was brought forward significantly, with the consequent shortening of the overall pollination season by 1week/year. This fact is significantly associated with the frequency of spring winds (more wind from directions unfavourable for pollen registration and fewer winds from favourable directions) and also with the tendency for the springs to be warmer, leading to plant wilting and parching. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Aerobiology; Allergy; Climatic change; Meteorology; Poaceae; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954819156

However, currently the studies are clumped both taxonomically (mainly Pachycereeae species) and geographically (mainly in the Tehuacan Valley and the Sonoran Desert). This clumping limits the possibility of generalising the pattern to other regions or cactus tribes. Only four of the 36 chiropterophilous cacti in Pilosocereus have been studied. Despite the tropical distribution of two Pilosocereus species, bees account for 40-100% of their fruit set. We examined how specialised is the pollination system of P. leucocephalus in eastern Mexico. As we studied tropical populations, we expected a bat-specialised pollination system. However, previous studies of Pilosocereus suggest that a generalised pollination system is also possible. We found that this cactus is mainly bat-pollinated (bats account for 33-65% of fruit set); although to a lesser degree, diurnal visitors also caused some fruit set (7-15%). Diurnal visitors were more effective in populations containing honeybee hives. P. leucocephalus is partially self-compatible (14-18% of fructification) but unable to set fruit without visitors. Despite the variation in pollination system, P. leucocephalus shows more affinity with other columnar cacti from tropical regions than with those from extratropical regions. Although we report here that a new species of tropical Pilosocereus is relatively bat-specialised, this Cereeae genus is more flexible in its pollination system than the Pachycereeae genera. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Columnar cactus; Nectar-feeding bats; Pilosocereus leucocephalus; Pollination system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955955681

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point. Methods: Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes. Key results: The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats. Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Ancestral state reconstruction; Bat pollination; Bee pollination; Calycophysum; Cionosicys; Cucurbitaceae; Longdistance dispersal; Molecular clock; Selysia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954651001

Flowers in these families produce heat metabolically and are adapted to beetles or flies as pollinators. Here, we focus on the Schisan- draceae, an American/Asian plant family known to exhibit flower heating in some species, but not others, raising the question of the adaptive function of heat production. Methods: We used field observations, experiments, and ancestral trait reconstruction on a molecular phylogeny for Schisan- draceae that includes the investigated species. Key results: At least two Chinese species of Illicium are exclusively pollinated by gall midges that use the flowers as brood sites (not for pollen feeding). Continuous monitoring of flower temperatures revealed that the highest temperatures were attained after the flowers' sexual functions were over, and experiments showed that post-anthetic warming benefited larval develop- ment, not fruit development. Midge larvae in flowers with trimmed tepals (and hence a lower temperature) died, but fruit set ratios remained unchanged. Based on the DNA phylogeny, gall midge pollination evolved from general fly/beetle pollination several times in Schisandraceae, with some species adapted to flower-breeding midges, others to pollen-feeding midges. Conclusions: Flower heating may be an ancestral trait in Schisandraceae that became co-opted in species pollinated by flower- breeding midges requiring long-persistent warm chambers for larval development. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Ancestral state reconstruction; Brood chamber; Gall midges; Pollination; Post-anthetic flower heating; Schisan- draceae; Thermogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954639426

Stainability of pollen with MTT was considered as an indicator of pollen viability. The half-life of pollen longevity was calculated using exponential decay regression. Overall, pollen viability decreased relatively rapidly with time. Pollen grains of obligate anemophilic species had lower initial viability and shorter half-lives than those of facultative anemophilic species. Pollen in these latter species may take more time to reach the stigma. The pollen of Potamogeton may be categorized as partially hydrated pollen owing to its generally spherical shape and lack of furrows, rapid loss of viability, and fast pollen tube initiation. The half-life is positively correlated with pollen size. Smaller-sized grains are at greater risk of desiccation than larger grains. In contrast with the situation observed in most terrestrial angiosperms, contact with water increases pollen longevity in Potamogeton species. In our present study the half-lives of pollen longevity of Potamogeton species in which the pollen had come into contact with water (mean of 10.65 h) were markedly higher than those under aerial conditions (mean of 5.79 h, t = 2.622, P = 0.039). The results of our study contradict a widely held belief that water is detrimental to pollen viability in angiosperms and furthermore indicate that close proximity to water results in selection for wettability. The transition to a hydrated status together with its morphology, make Potamogeton pollen more adapted to the aquatic environment and thus serves to ensure reproductive process. Results of our present study may have direct implications for understanding the evolution of the sexual reproductive system in aquatic angiosperms. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Half-life; Pollen longevity; Pondweed; Potamogeton; Selective pressure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953871286

In many cases, shifts to similar pollinators are associated with similar flower-color transitions. The extent to which this parallelism at the phenotypic level results from parallel changes at the biochemical, developmental, and genetic levels, however, remains an open question. There have been few attempts to determine whether parallelism at these lower levels results from mutation bias or fixation bias of different classes of mutation. We address these issues by examining the biochemical, developmental, and genetic changes that have occurred in red-flowering species of the Mina lineage of morning glories (Ipomoea) and compare these to the changes reported for I. horsfalliae, which has independently evolved red flowers. Using transgenic techniques, we demonstrate that the transition from blue to red flowers in Mina species is due primarily to down-regulation of the enzyme flavonol-3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) in flowers but not in vegetative tissues, and that this down-regulation is at least partly due to cis-regulatory change in the gene for F3'H. These changes are similar to those exhibited by I. horsfalliae, indicating parallelism at the biochemical and developmental levels, and possibly at the genetic level. © 2010 The Author(s).

Parthenocarpy might be useful in breeding tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) to be adapted to a wide range of temperatures normally unfavorable for fruit setting. The expression of parthenocarpy in tomato, cv. Oregon Pride, was facultative with seedless, few seeded (1-20 seed(s)/fruit), and normal seeded fruit being produced on the same plant in the same growing season. The greatest degree of parthenocarpy, leading to seedlessness, occurred above a daily mean temperature of 24-25°C. When there was sufficient viable pollen, and an appropriate daily mean temperature of 18-21°C, there was some fertility leading to low numbers of seed produced. Very low fruit set following emasculation compared to open pollination indicated the requirement of pollination stimulus for fruit set and further development. Precocious ovary development due to genetic stimuli combined with aberration of female fertility by interfering with ovule development might account for very low seed content in fruit of facultative parthenocarpic lines. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Environment; Facultative; India; Lycopersicon esculentum; Oregon Pride; Parthenocarpy; Pollination; Tropics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953405137

(Caryocaraceae), using genetic data from ten microsatellite loci. All adult trees (101) within a patch of 8.3 ha were sampled, and from these adults 18 open-pollinated maternal progeny arrays were analyzed (280 seeds from 265 fruits). Most fruits presented only one seed (median equal to 1.000) and mean number of ripened seeds per fruit was 1.053 (SD = 0.828). Our results showed that C. brasiliense presents a mixed-mating system, with 11.4% of self-pollination, multilocus outcrossing rate of tm = 0.891 ± 0.025, and high probability of full-sibship within progeny arrays (rp = 0.135 ± 0.032). Outcrossing rate and self-pollination varied significantly among mother trees. We could detect a maximum pollen dispersal distance of ~500 m and a mean pollen dispersal distance of ~132 m. However, most pollination events (80%) occurred at distances less than 200 m. Our results also indicated that pollen dispersal is restricted to a neighborhood of 5.4 ha with rare events of immigration (~1% Nem = 0.35). C. brasiliense also presents a significant but weak spatial genetic structure (Sp = 0.0116), and extension of pollen dispersal distance was greater than seed dispersal (Nb = 86.20 m). These results are most likely due to the foraging behavior of pollinators that may have limited flight range. The highly within-population synchronous flowering, high population density, and clumped distribution reinforce pollinator behavior and affect residence time leading to a short-distance pollen dispersal. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Caryocar brasiliense; Caryocaraceae; Cerrado; Mating structure; Microsatellites; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954087840

Hence, it should be possible to use winter types for the improvement of spring type B. napus. We investigated the effect of intro-gression of alleles from winter type into open-pollinated Canadian spring B. napus cultivars. Crosses were made between two European winter rapeseed cultivars, Aviso and Tequila, a Canadian spring doubled-haploid (DH) line, A03-3NR, and two DH populations developed from F2 plants. A total of 134 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from 19 linkage groups were evaluated on the three parents, of which 84 markers were polymorphic. Based on these markers, genetic similarity between the two winter parents was estimated to be 0.49, whereas it was only 0.27 between the spring and the two winter parents. Thirty-seven selected polymorphic markers were tested on the two DH populations, which detected a total of 94 alleles. Occurrence of the alleles from the winter parent ranged from 17.0 to 59.9% in DH population of Aviso x A03-3NR, whereas in the population of Tequila x A03-3NR it ranged from 13.8 to 50.0%. Estimates based on unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) genetic similarity and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) clearly depicted a group of DH lines falling close to the winter type. Seed yield in these DH populations was significantly higher than in the spring parent.

However, these negative consequences might be counteracted by gene flow as the latter provides functional connectivity between apparently isolated habitat fragments. Gene flow is itself influenced by landscape structure and composition, and it is therefore important to understand the relationship between gene flow and landscape structure and composition. We used linear LAD regression models to investigate the relationship between contemporary gene flow by pollen in the rare, insect-pollinated forest tree Sorbus domestica and several landscape features. None of the landscape components-which included closed forest, deep valleys, open land and settlements-proved to be an impermeable barrier to gene flow by pollen. We found evidence that settlements, large open areas, and a pronounced topography increased long-distance gene flow in the landscape as compared to a random model including all possible gene flow trajectories. These results are encouraging from a conservation view, as gene flow in species pollinated by generalist insects seems to provide functional connectivity and may help to maintain genetic diversity in rare plant species in fragmented landscapes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Functional connectivity; Insect pollination; LAD regression; Landscape genetics; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; Switzerland,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953538738

In addition, we compared fruit set of emasculated and intact flowers to test whether selfing provides reproductive assurance. We also examined the relationships between autofertility and life forms, between PL and autofertility, and between PL and flower size. We found a low level of PL (mean = 0.28) and a high incidence of autofertility, which was negatively correlated with PL and closely related to life form.

The previous study revealed that red-phase flowers no longer have sexual function and nectar, and bumblebees selectively visit yellow-phase flowers. The present study examined how retaining color-changed flowers can regulate the foraging behavior of bumblebees and pollen transport among flowers within (geitonogamous pollination) and between (outcrossing pollination) plants and how the behavior is influenced by display size (i. e., number of functional flowers) and visitation frequency. The visitation frequencies of bumblebees to plants and successive flower probes within plants were observed in the field using plants whose flower number and composition of the two color-phase flowers had been manipulated. To evaluate pollination efficiency over multiple pollinator visits, a pollen transport model was constructed based on the observed bumblebee behavior. In the simulation, three flowering patterns associated with display size and existence of color-changed flowers were postulated as follows: Type 1, large display (100 functional flowers) and no retention of color-changed flowers; Type 2, small display (50 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (50 old flowers), and; Type 3, large display (100 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (100 old flowers). Color-changed flowers did not contribute to increasing bumblebee attraction at a distance but reduced the number of successive flower probes within plants. Comparisons of pollen transfer between Types 1 and 3 revealed that the retention of color-changed flowers did not influence the total amount of pollen exported when pollinator visits were abundant (>100 visits) but decreased geitonogamous pollination. Comparisons between Types 2 and 3 revealed that the discouragement effect of floral color change on successive probes accelerated in plants with a large display size. Overall, the floral color change strategy contributed to reduce geitonogamous pollination, but its effectiveness was highly sensitive to display size and pollinator frequency. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Floral color change; Geitonogmous pollination; Outcrossing pollination; Pollen discounting; Pollen dynamics; Weigela middendorffiana,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953829997

The effects of the flower mite Proctolaelaps sp. on nectar availability in flowers of a melittophilous bromeliad Neoregelia johannis (Bromeliaceae) was evaluated in a coastal rain forest in south-eastern Brazil. In a randomized block experiment utilizing 18 flower pairs, one per bromeliad ramet, pollinators (Bombus morio) and mites were excluded, and then nectar volume, sugar concentration and sugar mass were quantified over the anthesis period. Mites significantly reduced nectar volume early in the morning (6h00-8h00), but not later (10h00-12h00). Mites decreased total volume of nectar available up to 22%. Sugar concentration in nectar was higher earlier in the morning, and decreased between 10h00-12h00. The pronounced consumption of nectar by mites during the period of higher sugar concentration reduced the total amount of sugar available to pollinators by 31%. This is the first study showing that flower mites decrease nectar rewards in a melittophilous plant.

Methods: In the municipality of Pedra, in the Caatinga of Pernambuco, the breeding system and reproductive success of C. leucocephala, its interaction with flower visitors and inter-and intramorph pollen flow were determined. Key Results: The bee Ceblurgus longipalpis, the unique flower visitor and effective pollinator of self-incompatible Cordia leucocephala, presents morphological features adapted to exploit hidden pollen and nectar in the long and narrow corolla tubes. Pollen of low-level anthers is collected with hairs on prolonged mouthparts and pollen of high-level anthers with clypeus, mandibles, and labrum, showing pollen removal from both levels with the same effectiveness. In both morphs, this results in similar legitimate, i.e. intermorph crosspollen flow. Illegitimate pollen flow to stigmas of pin flowers, however, was much higher than to stigmas of thrum flowers. Moreover, more illegitimate pollen was transported to stigmas of pin and less to those of thrum flowers when compared with legitimate pollen flow. Conclusions: The study reveals a one-to-one reproductive inter-dependence between both partners. Data indicate that this relationship between bee species and plant species is one of the rare cases of monolecty among bees. Monotypic Ceblurgus longipalpis, the only rophitine species of Brazil, evolved prolonged mouthparts rare among short-tongued bees that enable them to access pollen from flowers with short-level anthers hidden for bees of other species, and nectar at the base of the flower tube. © The Author 2010.",Caatinga; Ceblurgus longipalpis; Cordia leucocephala; Cordiaceae; Heterostyly; North-east Brazil; Oligolectic bees; Pollen flow; Pollination; Rophitinae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956352626

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, conservation and management.2.Cirsium arvense, creeping thistle (Californian thistle, Canada thistle), one of the world's most troublesome and persistent weeds, is native to Europe and the east northern hemisphere but introduced to North America and the southern hemisphere. Latitudinal distribution north or south is limited by low winter and summer maximum temperatures and by a long day requirement for flowering.3.Cirsium arvense is believed to have originated in the temperate Middle East and its spread has closely followed human migration and agricultural activity. Colonization of new sites is by seed which establishes best in bare or disturbed ground, mirroring its prehistoric ecology as an opportunist pioneer of bare ground and organic residues. It is now a widespread and scheduled agricultural weed in both arable crops and pastures and also a constituent in over 70 British (National Vegetation Classification) plant communities, occurring mainly on waste neglected land, roadsides, hedgerows and disturbed areas.4. Its presence in crops leads to yield losses and in pastures seriously interferes with utilization due to the deterrent effect of the leaf spines on grazing animals. This has led to a long history of investigation into control measures: mechanical, chemical, biological and integrated, which are summarized. Combination treatments and integrated control have achieved some success but effective control requires follow-up procedures over a number of seasons. Climate change studies suggest C. arvense could grow better and be more difficult to control in future.5. Success and persistence derives from an extensive, far-creeping and deep rooting system which ensures survival and rapid vegetative spread under a wide range of soil and management conditions, and a means of escape from sub-aerial control treatments. New adventitious buds capable of shoot development can arise at any point along the horizontal roots, even when these are cut into pieces or damaged. Root buds remain dormant until released from dormancy through damage or decay of the aerial shoots. Carbohydrate root reserves, stored in swollen cortical tissue, fall to a minimum just before flowering and are then replenished for perennation during the subsequent winter. Strategies for control aim to treat the plant when root carbohydrate reserves are at a minimum, to exhaust these reserves and to prevent replenishment for further perennation.6. Balanced against its difficulty as a weed, C. arvense has significant conservation value as a host to numerous insects, many attracted by copious and accessible nectar and strong flower fragrance. It is however a strong competitor to low-growing plants in natural communities.7.Cirsium arvense is dioecious and for flowering has a 14-16 h day length requirement. Seed set is successful if male and female plants are no more than 50-90 m apart to allow insect pollination. In spite of the conspicuous wind-borne pappus, this rarely carries a seed which normally falls near the parent plant. The flower heads and other plant parts are regularly attacked by numerous insects and less frequently by diseases.8. Germination of seed is mainly during the high temperatures of early summer in the year following dispersal and establishment is most successful in open areas. Development of the branching root system and vegetative spread follow rapidly.9. A combination of dioecy and vegetative reproduction has resulted in the maintenance of genotypic and genetic diversities within populations allowing efficient colonization and persistence, contributing greatly to success in the species. © 2010 The Author.

Species in biodiversity hotspots may thus be more at risk of limited reproduction and subsequent population decline. Should these species have restricted ranges (i.e. be endemics to a certain region), pollen limitation within highly diverse regions may pose an important threat to global plant biodiversity. We further dissect the global pattern by exploring whether pollen limitation of range-restricted (endemic) species is distinctive and/or relates differently to species diversity than that of widespread (non-endemic) species. To provide a preliminary test of this prediction we conducted both cross-species and comparative phylogenetic meta-analyses to determine the effect of endemism on the magnitude of pollen limitation and its relationship with regional species richness. Our data set included 287 plant species belonging to 78 families distributed world-wide. Our results revealed that endemism and self-compatibility contribute to the global association between pollen limitation and species richness. Self-incompatible species were more pollen limited than self-compatible ones, and the PICs analysis indicated that transitions to endemism were associated with transitions to self-compatibility. The relationship between pollen limitation and species richness was significant only for the self-incompatible species, and was monotonically increasing in non-endemic species but accelerating in the endemic species. Thus, self-incompatible endemic species from biodiversity hotspots are at the greatest risk of pollination failure, a previously unknown aspect suggesting this group of species as a top priority for future development of conservation strategies. In contrast, reproduction of self-compatible species appears to be unrelated to plant diversity, although we caution that current data do not account for the reproductive limitation due to the quality of pollen received. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these patterns requires further investigation into plant-plant pollinator mediated interactions and the dynamics of pollen transfer in communities differing in species diversity. © 2009 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954572956

The indicator is based on strictly standardised sampling procedures and the identification of parataxonomic units (morphospecies) instead of species identification. The collection of arthropods was optimized with regard to trap types, time and length of collecting period, selection of four out of seven weekly samples, and choice of counted taxa and trophic guilds. By measuring arthropod activity, RBA is an indicator for functional diversity. Over a period of 8 years, average yearly numbers of morphospecies were assessed in Switzerland in 15 agricultural habitats, 15 managed forests, and in 12 unmanaged habitats ranging from protected lowland wetlands to Alpine meadows. The yearly RBA-trend in unmanaged habitats is used for assessing the influence of climate and weather on biodiversity, and as a reference for measuring the relative influences of recent management changes in agriculture and forestry.

In addition, as social haplodiploids, inbred bees may be vulnerable to the extra genetic load represented by the production of sterile diploid males. Using microsatellite markers, we investigated the genetic structure of populations of the Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) in the UK, where this species has undergone a precipitous decline. By means of a mixture of analytical methods and simulation, we also extended - and then applied - genetic methods for estimating foraging distance and nest density in wild bees. B. distinguendus populations were characterized by low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness, inbreeding coefficients not significantly different from zero, absence of detected diploid males, absence of substantial demographic bottlenecking, and population substructuring at large (c. 100+ km) but not small (10s of km) spatial scales. The minimum average effective population size at our sampling sites was low (c. 25). In coastal grassland (machair), the estimated modal foraging distance of workers was 391 m, with 95% of foraging activity occurring within 955 m of the nest, and estimated nest density was 19.3 nests km-2. These findings show that B. distinguendus exhibits some genetic features of scarce, declining or fragmented populations. Moreover, B. distinguendus workers appear to forage over above-average distances and nests remain thinly distributed even in current strongholds. These considerations should inform future conservation actions for this and similar species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",declining species; foraging range; microsatellite; pollinator; population biology; social insect,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954291802

The very diverse nature of EU landscapes implies that coexistence measures must be adapted to regional conditions. Rigid rules, such as the requirement of large isolation distances everywhere, may raise the cost of coexistence measures, particularly in densely planted areas, without necessarily meeting the objectives of the European Commission. One of the objectives of the SIGMEA programme (Sustainable Introduction of GM Crops into European Agriculture is a Specific Targeted Research Project in the EC), within which this work was conducted, was to provide tools for the management of coexistence at the landscape level. We compared four contrasting maize production zones (in Alsace and Aragon) using MAPOD®, a spatially-explicit model of gene flow, and randomly allocating GM crops to maize plots. We calculated two indicators of potential interest to different stakeholders (not only farmers and regulators, but also collecting firms and industry): (1) the proportion of the non-GM maize area not complying with a given threshold and (2) the mean cross pollination rate obtained if the harvests of all the conventional plots were to be mixed in a silo. Our results suggest that it is possible to classify the regional landscapes in terms of the level of risk (for different thresholds depending on market standards-e.g. 0.1%; 0.4%; 0.9%) with few structural characteristics easily calculated from GIS and agricultural statistics data (Mean field area; proportion of the Agricultural Used Area (AUA) devoted to maize, GM maize proportion, maize flowering dynamics and wind characteristics). The mean cross pollination rate increases with GM maize proportion in all the landscapes but the effect of this factor is modulated by structural variables of the landscapes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

While renewed interest in specialist avian nectarivore sugar preferences and digestive physiology has helped explain the concentrated sucrose-dominated nectar of plants they feed on, there has been little progress in understanding why generalist or occasional nectar-feeding birds tend to be associated with flowers that have dilute hexose-dominated nectar. We examined sugar preferences and assimilation efficiencies over a range of concentrations, and concentration preferences, in Dark-capped Bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor, one of the more common occasional avian nectarivores in southern Africa. Dark-capped Bulbuls showed significant preference for hexose sugar solutions, irrespective of concentration, when given a choice between hexose and sucrose solutions in equicaloric pair-wise choice tests conducted at five different concentrations (5-25%). This contrasts with results from specialist nectarivore groups which generally show a significant concentration-dependant switch in preference from hexose at low concentrations to sucrose at high concentrations for equicaloric solutions. In addition, Dark-capped Bulbuls showed an unusual lack of preference for solutions of higher sugar concentration when simultaneously offered four solutions varying in concentration from 10 to 25%. Dark-capped bulbuls also showed a unique effect of concentration on sugar assimilation efficiency, assimilating relatively more energy on 5% diets than on 25% diets. Although able to assimilate sucrose effectively, assimilation rates of hexose sugars were marginally higher. These results shed new light on pollination systems involving occasional nectarivores and, in particular, help to explain the prevalence of low concentration hexose-dominated nectars in flowers pollinated by these birds. © 2010 Dt.

Twenty-three acaricides used commercially in the control of phytophagous mites (Acari) were tested in greenhouses and/or the open field. Side effects included acute mortality and also sublethal effects on nest reproduction. The different compounds were administered in the laboratory via three different worst-case field scenario routes of exposure: dermal contact and orally via the drinking of treated sugar water and via treated pollen. The compounds were tested at their respective maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC), and, when strong lethal effects were observed, a dose-response assay with a dilution series of the MFRC was undertaken to calculate LC50 values. RESULTS: From the different acaricide classes, several chemistries caused high levels of acute toxicity in bumblebee workers, especially bifenthrin and abamectin which resulted in 100% mortality by contact. In addition, several acaricides tested were found to have a detrimental effect on drone production. For oral exposures via treated sugar water, the dose-response assay showed the LC50 values for abamectin, bifenazate, bifenthrin and etoxazole to be 1/15 MFRC (1.17 mg AI L-1), 1/10 MFRC (9.6 mg AI L-1), 1/83 MFRC (0.36 mg AI L-1) and 1/13 MFRC (4.4 mg AI L-1) respectively, indicating that their use should be carefully evaluated. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results suggest that most of the acaricides tested are compatible with bumblebees, with the exceptions of abamectin, bifenazate, bifenthrin and etoxazole. However, the risks also depended on the type of treatment. As a result, the sugar water treatment seems to present the worst-case situation of exposure, indicating that this approach is suitable for determining the hazards of pesticides against bumblebees. Finally, it is suggested that future tier testing under more field-related conditions is required for a final decision of their risks. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.",Acaricides; Bombus terrestris; Bumblebees; Ecotoxicology; Reproduction; Toxicity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953974457

Heterostylous species are likely to be particularly sensitive to the contingencies of spatial distribution, as they are reproductively subdivided into distinct mating groups, which usually exhibit self- and intra-morph incompatibility and differ in floral morphology. In this paper, we explore the joint effects of both spatial distribution of potential mates and floral display size on morph-specific pollen deposition rates and seed set patterns in two natural populations of Pulmonaria officinalis, a distylous species with a weak self-incompatibility system. Both total stigmatic pollen load and the proportion of legitimate pollen decreased with increasing spatial isolation. Legitimate (intermorph) pollen transfer was, however, asymmetric and decreased more rapidly with decreasing proximity to a compatible legitimate mating partner in the S-morph than in the L-morph. Total stigmatic pollen loads per flower increased with increasing floral display size, indicating that large plants are disproportionately more visited than smaller individuals. However, because legitimate pollen deposition decreased with increasing floral display size, these results also suggest that larger numbers of flowers increase the degree of geitonogamous pollination. In both the L- and S-morph, seed set significantly decreased with increasing isolation from a legitimate mating partner, but in the L-morph seed set was less dependent on the spatial distribution of the S-morph. In addition, seed set significantly increased with floral display size in the L-morph, but not in the S-morph. These findings indicate that the spatial distribution of potential mates and variation in floral display size may cause morph-specific differences in pollen deposition rates and female reproductive success. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Asymmetric mating; Distyly; Floral display size; Legitimate pollination; Pollen quality; Pollen quantity; Seed set; Sexual polymorphism; Spatial isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955947634

In total, each species was visited by 3-7 euglossine species, and 2-3 euglossine species accounted for at least 80% of all flower visits, with visits being plant species-specific.

There, winter conditions are subject to rapid climate change. The potential loss of a longer-lasting snow cover with implications to other plantrelated climate parameters and overwintering strategies make the temperate zone particularly vulnerable to winter climate change. A formalized literature search in the ISI Web of Science shows that plant related research on the effects of winter climate change is generally underrepresented. Temperate regions in particular are rarely studied in this respect, although the few existing studies imply strong effects of winter climate change on species ranges, species compositions, phenology, or frost injury. The generally positive effect of warming on plant survival and production may be counteracted by effects such as an increased frost injury of roots and shoots, an increased insect pest risk, or a disrupted synchrony between plants and pollinators. Based on the literature study, gaps in current knowledge are discussed. Understanding the relative effects of interacting climate parameters, as well as a stronger consideration of shortterm events and variability of climatic conditions is urgent. With respect to plant response, it would be particularly worthwhile to account for hidden players such as pathogens, pollinators, herbivores, or fungal partners in mycorrhization. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Climate change; Frost; Global warming; Snow; Temperate zone; Winter ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954590419

We examined the contribution of three different habitat types (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and spatial variation of flower-visitation interaction networks in general and in bee species composition in detail across habitats.

We therefore suggest that the species-rich and structurally diverse farmland acts as a "" pollinator rescue"" which supports bee communities in the natural forest.

We proposed two hypotheses: the amount of buried seeds of R. pseudoacacia is proportional to stand biomass rather than stand age, and apicultural utilization influences the size of the soil seed bank. R. pseudoacacia generally produces seeds with various degrees of physical dormancy. In addition, this tree is short-lived, and fecundity declines after 30-40 years in relation to tree vigor. However, R. pseudoacacia is intensively used in apiculture as an important honey source, and supply of honeybees by beekeepers could influence seed crops. We investigated 25 plantations in Hokkaido (Central, Hidaka, and Oshima) and in Nagano, Japan, where many naturally regenerated R. pseudoacacia stands occur. We found great variation in the size of the soil seed bank among stands, ranging from 13,757 to 6.4seedsm-2 per plot. A generalized linear mixed model revealed that both basal area (BARp) and apicultural utilization best explained the size of the soil seed bank. Both the positive effect of BARp and small contribution of stand age to the model implied that the soil seed bank is transitory, and will not persist for very long time. The large contribution of apicultural utilization to the size of the soil seed bank implied pollinator limitation under natural conditions. R. pseudoacacia often has large flower crops, and native pollinators can not keep up with the demand for pollination. Thus, the supply of honeybees by beekeepers should improve the pollination success of R. pseudoacacia. From these results, we conclude that we must consider stand history with respect to apicultural utilization if the land is harvested or a stand declines. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Apiculture; Robinia pseudoacacia; Soil seed bank; Stand age; Stand growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954952016

Previous studies have shown that fragrant upper pitchers of climbing parts of the plant are more effective in trapping flying insects than non-fragrant lower pitchers, which are essentially restricted to an ant diet. We tested the hypotheses that odours are effective cues for prey attraction in this carnivorous plant and that upper pitchers biochemically mimic flowers in their olfactory cues.2. The visitor diversity and the scent composition of each pitcher type were determined for different sites and periods during field studies in Borneo. Olfactometer bioassays were conducted using fruit flies and ants as models for flying flower-visitors and non-flying visitors, respectively.3. Fifty-four volatile compounds were identified and the analysis of their relative quantities in the blends showed significant differences between pitcher types. The blends of lower pitchers contained some aliphatics and terpenoids but were poor in benzenoids. Upper pitchers differed from lower ones in that they attracted a greater quantity and diversity of insects, including a guild of flower-visitors absent from the visitor spectrum of lower pitchers. Upper pitchers also emitted a greater quantity of odours and a larger spectrum of volatiles, including some terpenoids and benzenoids that often characterize the sweet scents classically found in flower blends. Choice bioassays showed that, in absence of any visual cue, the scents of the nectariferous pitcher rim (peristome) were particularly attractive to ants and flies, and those of upper pitchers were more attractive to flies than those of lower pitchers.4. Synthesis. This study demonstrates the use of scent by Nepenthes carnivorous plants to mediate prey attraction. The climbing part of the plant produces pitcher-modified leaves that mimic flower olfactory cues and suggest an evolutionary convergent strategy with that of generalist pollination systems. © 2010 The Authors.

The specificity of the self-incompatible reaction is determined by two genes located in the S-locus. These encode a pistil-expressed ribonuclease (S-RNase) that inhibits self pollen tube growth, and a pollen-expressed F-box protein (SFB) that may be involved in the cytotoxicity of self-S-RNases. Initial genetic and pollination studies in a self-compatible sweet cherry cultivar, 'Cristobalina' (S3S6), showed that self-compatibility was caused by the loss of pollen function of both haplotypes (S3 and S6). In this study, we further characterize self-compatibility in this genotype by molecular analysis of the S-locus. DNA blot analyses using S-RNase and SFB probes show no duplications of 'Cristobalina' S-locus genes or differences in the restriction patterns when compared with self-incompatible cultivars with the same S-genotype. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase-PCR of S-locus genes and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of SFBs revealed no differences at the transcription level when compared with a self-incompatible genotype. The results of this study show that no differences at the S-locus can be correlated with self-compatibility, indicating the possible involvement of non-S-locus modifiers in self-incompatibility breakdown in this cultivar. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Gametophytic self-incompatibility; Pollen part mutant; Prunus avium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953873166

Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities. © 2010 The Authors.

We investigated the contribution of tropical primary forest, cacao agroforestry systems of varying management practices and openland to the temporal and spatial variation of diversity of native bee communities in the herb layer (Apidae, Hymenoptera) in Sulawesi (Indonesia). Local bee density and diversity were highest in openland, followed by agroforestry systems and were lowest in primary forests, revealing the importance of herbaceous food resources in the understorey. In contrast, highest regional bee richness was found in agroforestry systems, because of high community dissimilarity. Multidimensional scaling supported these findings with openland habitats showing more compactly clustered bee species communities than agroforestry habitats. In conclusion, the herb associated bee community profited from the opening of the landscape as a result of agricultural activities, while agroforestry systems increased bee species richness especially on a regional scale due to high management diversity. © 2010 The Author(s).",Additive partitioning; Apidae; Biodiversity; Conservation; Land-use gradient; Pollinator community; Sulawesi,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954018996

Bumblebees are important pollinators in commercial and natural environments. There are clear detrimental effects of C. bombi infections on the fitness of bumblebees. However, little has been known about how the bee's immune system responds to infections with trypanosome parasites. Here, we study the immune response of Bombus terrestris on infection by C. bombi. We measured the expression of four immune-related genes (Hemomucin, MyD88, Relish, and TEP7) using RT-qPCR in adult B. terrestris workers that were either healthy or infected with the trypanosome parasite C. bombi. The potential recognition gene Hemomucin was significantly upregulated in the infected bees.

Infertile, non-invasive cultivars of H. androsaemum with desirable ornamental features would be ecologically beneficial and valuable for the horticultural industry. The male and female fertility of 10 triploid H. androsaemum, developed with a combination of variegation and foliage colors, was investigated under greenhouse (controlled pollination) and field conditions (natural pollination). Male fertility was evaluated based on pollen viability tests (pollen staining and pollen germination). Female fertility was based on fruit set, seed set, germinative capacity of seeds, and number of seedlings produced for each flower. Although values for different measures of fertility varied among triploid clones, pollen germination was significantly reduced for all triploids and nine of the 10 triploids produced no viable seed. These results represent 100% failure of ?171,000 potential fertilization events based on fertility levels of diploid controls. The remaining triploid clone produced two seedlings per flower compared with 260 seedlings per flower for the controls. However, the seedlings produced by the triploid clone died shortly after germination. This research documented that the triploid H. androsaemum tested are highly infertile with no measurable female fertility. These clones will provide ideal alternatives to fertile forms of H. androsaemum where invasiveness is a concern.

Vicinism estimates varied from 0.53 to 15.36%, i.e., the proportion of cross-pollination was relatively high, leading to a biological contamination. As a result of such contamination, genetic collection lines and varieties lose genetic homogeneity and become heterozygous and genetically heterogeneous. The genetic control of the flower type was studied in the Gossipium hirsutum L. × G. barbadense L. interspecific hybrids, and phenotypic segregation of the 3 : 1 and 15 : 1 types with monogenic (3 : 1) and digenic (15 : 1) differences of noncumulative polymerization was observed.

The method utilizes a collection of previously isolated transposon-induced reciprocal translocations with sequence-defined breakpoints. These balanced translocations involve a first common breakpoint at the site of transposon Ac/fAc insertions on chromosome 1S, and a second variable endpoint elsewhere in the genome. Stocks containing translocations with different endpoints on the same chromosome arms were crossed together to generate heterozygous combinations. Subsequent meiotic segregation generates gametes that contain the original balanced translocations, or pairs of translocation chromosomes that are genetically unbalanced; i.e., they contain a duplication or deletion of the affected segment. Self-pollination produces progeny plants that are genetically balanced, or that contain 0 to 4 copies of the affected segment. The chromosome constitution of progeny plants can be determined using PCR primers flanking the translocation breakpoints. In addition, plants segregating genetically unbalanced gametes exhibit significant pollen grain abnormalities and thus can be easily detected in the field. In this way, we constructed 4 different segmental tetrasomic stocks involving genomic regions of approximately 7.8, 18.7, 21, and 42.6 Mb on chromosomes 5S, 5L, 5L, and 4L, respectively. FISH analysis using specific probes located within the affected segments confirms their aneuploid composition. These and similar lines containing precisely defined segmental duplications and deletions may be useful to study the genetic impact of gene dosage. Copyright © 2010 S.

For feeding trials, we chose the bush cricket Metrioptera bicolor, a species that mainly consumes grasses, but also feeds occasionally on flowers. Linalool and ?-caryophyllene (mono-and sesquiterpenoid, respectively) turned out to be effective antifeedants, while other floral scent compounds had no effect. Furthermore, bush crickets completely rejected flowers of Convolvulus arvensis (Convolvulaceae) and Melilotus alba (Fabaceae), while preferring flowers of Echium vulgare (Boraginaceae) over leaves. In addition to feeding experiments, excrement of bush crickets and other orthopterans were searched for pollen. Most individual bush crickets had pollen in their faeces, largely from Poaceae and Gymnosperms, suggesting accidental ingestion of wind-dispersed pollen, rather than targeted consumption of floral pollen.

Most research on this topic focused on the response of pollen viability and pollination constraints, and little is known about the relative response to heat of plant grain yield (PGY) components [kernel number per plant (KNP) and individual kernel weight (KW)] and the physiological determinants of grain yield [light interception efficiency (ei), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and harvest index (HI)]. Field experiments were performed to study the response of physiological traits to contrasting air temperature regimes at ear level [nonheated control (TC) and heated (TH; with air temperature &gt;35°C around noon)]. Heating was performed during periods of approximately 15 d at two growth stages [presilking (GS1) and postsilking (GS2)]. All silked ears received fresh pollen. Heating during GS1 caused (i) a larger delay in silking date than in anthesis date, (ii) an increase in male and female sterility, and (iii) a reduction in plant height and leaf area index, but not in ei. Heating always caused a reduction in (i) plant and ear growth rates (EGR) around silking, (ii) RUE around silking, and (iii) HI and KNP.

Variations in KNP were explained (r2 = 0.71, p &lt; 0.0001) by variations in EGR post-silking (EGRPOST) and not presilking, evidence of long-term effects of heat stress during GS1.

We have surveyed different species of this family to determine in which style curvature occurs, and to determine its possible functional roles. Two distinct types of style curvature occur in 18 species distributed in eight genera of four tribes: Type I, before pollen shedding, occurs in species of the Malvavisceae, Ureneae, and Hibisceae tribes, which have highly receptive stigmas and viable pollen when curvature brings stigmas into contact with anthers; and Type II, after pollen shedding, only appears in the protandrous species of the Malveae tribe. Curvature is often associated with annual and perennial herbs. We conclude that the adaptive significance of style curvature in the Malvaceae includes delayed selfing, promotion of outcrossing, and reduction in intrafloral male-female interference, even if the frequency of two or three of these occurs in one species only. This diversity provides model plants and the opportunity for determining the evolution, relative importance, and harmony mechanism of different adaptive significance, especially when two or three functions occur simultaneously in one floral movement of one species (e.g., Kosteletzkya virginica). © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Delayed selfing; Floral movement; Male-female interference; Outcrossing; Plant traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955088908

The Arabidopsis 35S::AtDOF4.7 lines with constitutive expression of AtDOF4.7 exhibited an ethylene-independent floral organ abscission deficiency. In these lines, anatomical analyses showed that the formation of the abscission zone was normal. However, dissolution of the middle lamella failed to separate between the cell walls. AtDOF4.7 was identified as a nucleus-localized transcription factor. This protein had both in vitro and in vivo binding activity to typical DOF cis-elements in the promoter of an abscission-related polygalacturonase (PG) gene, PGAZAT.

The reconstructed pedigree increased heritabilities in the larger PMX test. Increased heritability resulted from adding the paternities to the pedigree per se, not by correcting the male reproductive bias by specifying the exact pedigree. Removing hypothesized pedigree errors had no effect on quantitative parameters, either because the magnitude of the errors was too small (PMX) or the progeny test was too small to detect variance components reliably (OP). Although there was no advantage in backwards selection, the increased additive variance, heritabilities and accuracy of progeny with assigned paternities in the pedigree, should permit forward selection of offspring with greater genetic gain and complete control of coancestry for future breeding decisions.

For both aspects promoters with expression zones restricted to particular domains of the endosperm would be a valuable tool. The ?-glucuronidase (Gus) reporter gene was fused to upstream fragments of three genes whose expression is limited to specific domains of the endosperm: Vacuolar pyrophosphatase 1 (Vpp1) encoding an H+ translocating vacuolar pyrophosphatase and expressed in the aleurone layer, Embryo surrounding region 6 (Esr6) encoding a defensin-like protein and expressed specifically in the embryo surrounding region (ESR) and Outer cell layer 4 (OCL4) encoding a transcription factor of the homeo domain-leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) family and expressed in the aleurone layer. The sequence analysis of the upstream fragments revealed several putative cis elements conserved either with the rice orthologues or with other maize genes sharing the same expression domain. The phenotypic characterisation of transgenic promoter- Gus lines revealed for Vpp1 a delay in the onset of GUS activity, as compared to in situ data, and a dynamic pattern shifting from the adaxial to the abaxial side of the aleurone layer. The two closely related genes Esr6a and Esr6b discovered during the cloning process diverged strongly in their upstream sequences but showed GUS signals very similar to each other and to the in situ signal: a strong, ESR-specific GUS signal at 8 days after pollination (DAP) and 16 DAP, which disappeared at 22 DAP. While Esr6b was likely the stronger promoter, a point-like signal outside the ESR on the abgerminal side at the junction of the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) and the aleurone layer was only found in prEsr6a- Gus plants. The GUS signal of pr. OCL4- Gus plants only partially reflected the in situ data; whereas OCL4 in situ signal was seen in the epidermis of male and female flowers, embryos and endosperm, prOCL4- GUS signal was only observed in female flowers and endosperm where it confirmed the high specificity for the outer cell layer and exhibited a dynamic pattern similar to Vpp1. While the upstream fragment used likely contained only some but not all the cis elements governing OCL4 expression, the fortuitously obtained truncated promoter may be of greater biotechnological interest than the complete promoter because of its more restricted expression zone that still includes the highly interesting aleurone layer. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Aleurone layer; Endosperm; ESR; Gus reporter gene; Promoter; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954865163

Most of these species are rare, and nearly half are known only from one or two collections. Of the remaining six, two are restricted to single states. One species described as new to science, Ruellia laslobasensis, is distinguished from a close relative by its smaller corollas, calyces, and fruits. Ruellia chilpancingana is placed into synonymy with R. sororia. Ruellia section Urceolata is synonymized with sect. Chiropterophila. Two species previously treated in sect. Chiropterophila, Ruellia petiolaris (as R. palmeri) and R. carmenaemiliae, are excluded from the section. Phylogenetic analyses using three chloroplast markers (trnC-trnR, trnG-trnS, psbA-trnH) and one nuclear marker (ITS + 5.8S) were conducted to test the monophyly of sect. Chiropterophila and to reconstruct relationships among species. Sequences were successfully generated for all species in sect. Chiropterophila; some are known only from old herbarium material. One of these, collected in 1894, is among the oldest known plant herbarium specimens to be successfully sequenced. Analyses reveal that section Chiropterophila is monophyletic but not well supported; an alternative hypothesis of nonmonophyly of the section could not be rejected.

Moench] and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) are now being bred to enhance the quantity and quality of biomass while maintaining or improving biotic and abiotic stress tolerances. Introgression of complementary traits between sorghum and sugarcane may be an important tool for breeders as they work toward these objectives. We show that by using a sorghum line with the iap mutant, intergeneric Sorghum bicolor x Sac-charum spp. hybrids can be readily produced. Using Tx3361 as sorghum seed parent, 14,141 seed were produced from 252 sorghum x Sac-charum spp. crosses. Seed set frequency in the intergeneric crosses was affected by sugarcane pollinators. The best pollinators had an above average pollen rating and favorable genetic and/ or genomic compatibility, implying that breeding and selection of sugarcane pollen parents could further enhance successful hybridization. Avoiding vivipary through premature seed harvest and eliminating a physical barrier by removing the seed coat increased seedling recovery rates from 1.5 to 33%. Using these methods, our programs have grown 1371 sorghum-saccharum intergeneric hybrid plants. Sufficient quantities of seedlings were produced to impose selection criteria with the goal of developing a new intergeneric cultivar with potential to be used for sugar or as a biomass feedstock. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953932612

Wide-based crosses within C. sativus [i.e., C. sativus var. sativus × C. sativus var. hardwickii (R.) Alef.] and interspecific hybridization attempts before 1995 have not substantially increased genetic diversity for plant improvement. However, in1995, anamphidiploid(Cucumis hytivus Chen and Kirkbride) was derived fromaC.sativus × Cucumis hystrix Chakr. mating. A derivative of this amphidiploid was used herein to broaden the genetic base of cucumber through backcross introgression [(C. sativus × C. hytivus) × C. sativus]. Initially, the combining ability of eight genetically diverse lines was investigated for days to anthesis (DA), sex expression (SEX), lateral branch number (LBN), fruit per plant (FP), fruit length:diameter ratio (L:D), and salt-processing ability [i.e., processed fruit color (exterior and interior), shape, and seed cavity characteristics]. Based on the combining ability, inbred backcross lines [IBL (BC2S3)] were developed from an original gynoecious determinate line WI 7023A [C. sativus (recurrent parent)] × monoecious indeterminate line WI 7012A (C. sativus × C. hytivus derived) mating, where 30 of 392 (8%) BC1 progeny were selected based on their diversity at 16 mapped marker loci. These progeny were used to develop BC2 progeny, which were then self-pollinated without further selection to produce 94 IBL. These IBL were genotyped and evaluated in the open field in two plantings in 2008 for DA, SEX, LBN, leaf size, FP, and L:D. The genetic distance (GD) between parental lines was 0.85, and the GD among IBL ranged between 0.16 and 0.75. Multivariate analyses indicated that IBL differed from parental lines and possessed considerable morphological and genotypic diversity that could be used to broaden the genetic base of commercial U.S. processing cucumber.",Combining ability; Cucumis sativus; Marker assisted selection; Morphological traits; Multivariate analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954902952

Our set of functional traits addresses species' reproductive biology, life history, morphology and ecophysiology. To take account of broad-scale heterogeneity across the country we compared the relative frequencies of neophytes and natives with particular trait attributes at the scale of grid cells (c. 130 km2 each). Subsequently, we compared the differences at the grid cell scale to the differences in the corresponding comparisons at the scale of the entire country. Finally, we explored how variation in the trait compositions of the non-indigenous species across the country relates to variation in the trait compositions of the natives. We found remarkable differences in the trait compositions of neophytes and natives at the grid cell scale. Neophytes were over-represented in insect- and self-pollinated species and in species with a later and longer flowering season. Furthermore, the proportions of species with mesomorphic or hygromorphic leaf anatomy, of annual herbs and of trees as well as of non-clonals and polyploids were significantly higher in neophytes than in natives. These differences at the grid cell scale could vary distinctly from the corresponding differences observed at the country scale. This result highlights the complexity of the invasion process and suggests an importance of spatial scale for the comparisons. Correlation analysis indicated, that for traits relating to plant morphology and ecophysiology, the relative frequencies of the non-indigenous species increased with those of the natives. This suggests that favourable environments for natives with particular attributes constitute an increased suitability for neophytes with these attributes as well. Our study provides a step forward towards an integrated understanding of traits in plant invasions across spatial scales and broad-scale heterogeneity and underlines the necessity to understand the role of functional traits in plant invasions with reference to spatial scale and in the context of the environment. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Biological invasions; Broad-scale heterogeneity; Environment; Functional traits; Invasion ecology; Spatial scale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953958316

During primocane flowering, three pollination treatments (undisturbed openpollinated, emasculated selfed, and emasculated cross-pollinated) were used to further test the fertility of the five PF genotypes. Significant differences between cross-pollination treatments and self-pollination were seldom noted with more differences seen in 'Prime-Jim'®than any other genotype. Cross-pollinating primocane flowers on 'Prime-Jim'®resulted in significantly higher fruit set, drupelet set, and average berry weight compared with self-pollination.

Exotic plants often compete with native plants for space and limiting resources, potentially altering community floral dynamics. We used observations and a biomass-removal experiment to explore the effects of an invasive exotic flowering plant, Linaria vulgaris, on community and individual species flowering phenology and abundance in subalpine meadows in Colorado, USA. Invasion by L. vulgaris was associated with a shift in both the timing and abundance of community flowering. Invaded plant communities exhibited depressed flowering by 67% early in the season relative to uninvaded communities, but invaded sites produced 7.6 times more flowers than uninvaded sites once L. vulgaris began flowering. This increase in flowers at the end of the season was driven primarily by prolific flowering of L. vulgaris. We also found lower richness and evenness of resident flowering species in invaded plots during the period of L. vulgaris flowering. At the species level, a common native species (Potentilla pulcherrima) produced 71% fewer flowers in invaded relative to uninvaded plots, and the species had reduced duration of flowering in invaded relative to uninvaded sites. This result suggests that L. vulgaris does not simply alter the flowering of subordinate species but also the flowering of an individual common species in the plant community. We then used observational data to explore the relationship between L. vulgaris density and resident floral production but found only partial evidence that higher densities of L. vulgaris were associated with stronger effects on resident floral production. Taken together, results suggest that a dominant invasive plant can affect community and individual-species flowering. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Flowering; Global environmental change; Invasive species; Linaria vulgaris; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953960331

Males of all species collect fragrances from natural sources, including flowers, decaying vegetation and fungi, and store them in specialized leg pockets to later expose during courtship display. In addition, orchid bees provide pollination services to a diverse array of Neotropical angiosperms when foraging for food and nesting materials. However, despite their ecological importance, little is known about the evolutionary history of orchid bees. Here, we present a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis based on ?4.0 kb of DNA from four loci [cytochrome oxidase (CO1), elongation factor 1-? (EF1-?), arginine kinase (ArgK) and RNA polymerase II (Pol-II)] across the entire tribe Euglossini, including all five genera, eight subgenera and 126 of the approximately 200 known species. We investigated lineage diversification using fossil-calibrated molecular clocks and the evolution of morphological traits using disparity-through-time plots. In addition, we inferred past biogeographical events by implementing model-based likelihood methods. Our dataset supports a new view on generic relationships and indicates that the cleptoparasitic genus Exaerete is sister to the remaining orchid bee genera. Our divergence time estimates indicate that extant orchid bee lineages shared a most recent common ancestor at 27-42 Mya. In addition, our analysis of morphology shows that tongue length and body size experienced rapid disparity bursts that coincide with the origin of diverse genera (Euglossa and Eufriesea). Finally, our analysis of historical biogeography indicates that early diversification episodes shared a history on both sides of Mesoamerica, where orchid bees dispersed across the Caribbean, and through a Panamanian connection, thus reinforcing the hypothesis that recent geological events (e.g. the formation of the isthmus of Panama) contributed to the diversification of the rich Neotropical biota. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Aglae; Amazon; Andes; DTT plots; Eulaema; Miocene; Oligocene; Penalized likelihood; Relaxed molecular clocks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954351834

Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center, Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States","Unilateral incompatibility (UI) is a prezygotic reproductive barrier in plants that prevents fertilization by foreign (interspecific) pollen through the inhibition of pollen tube growth. Incompatibility occurs in one direction only, most often when the female is a self-incompatible species and the male is self-compatible (the ""SI X SC rule""). Pistils of the wild tomato relative Solanum lycopersicoides (SI) reject pollen of cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum, SC), but accept pollen of S. pennellii (SC accession). Expression of pistil-side UI is weakened in S. lycopersicum X S. lycopersicoides hybrids, as pollen tube rejection occurs lower in the style. Two gametophytic factors are sufficient for pollen compatibility on allotriploid hybrids: ui1.1 on chromosome 1 (near the S locus), and ui6.1 on chromosome 6. We report herein a fine-scale map of the ui6.1 region. Recombination around ui6.1 was suppressed in lines containing a short S. pennellii introgression, but less so in lines containing a longer introgression. More recombinants were obtained from female than male meioses. A high-resolution genetic map of this region delineated the location of ui6.1 to ?0.128 MU, or 160 kb. Identification of the underlying gene should elucidate the mechanism of interspecific pollen rejection and its relationship to self-incompatibility.

However, bad application practices may cause the contamination of different environmental compartments and animal species, as a consequence of migration or accumulation of those compounds. Fipronil, imidacloprid and thiametoxam are systemic or systemic-like insecticides widely used in maize crops. Their heavy action in the nervous system of target insects also means a high toxicity to non-target pollinator insects such as honey bees which can get in touch with them through pollen and nectar during foraging activities. These insecticides have even been suspected to cause a significant decrease of honeybee colonies that has been observed in many countries since the past decade. Since September 1st 2008, the European Commission set new MRLs in food and feed of plant and animal origin. The pesticides included in this study have MRLs in honey and pollen between 10 and 50ngg-1. In the present work, an analytical method was developed with the aim of determining residues of fipronil and some of its metabolites (fipronil sulfone, fipronil sulfide, fipronil desulfinyl and fipronil carboxamide), thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in honey and pollen samples. The extraction optimization was performed using a Doehlert experimental design by studying two factors, the mixture and the ratio of solvents used. Prior to the extraction procedure, raw hive samples containing honey, pollen and wax were centrifuged at 4000. rpm. The upper solid material was removed, and 1. g of the lower phase was mixed with 3. mL of the optimized mixture of methanol/water (10/90). The extract was passed through a florisil cartridge and the target compounds were eluted with methanol and analysed by LC-MS/MS in selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The method was validated according to the guidelines included in the SANCO/10684/2009 document and the ISO 11843 standard for the following parameters: decision limit (CC?), detection capability (CC?), recovery, repeatability and reproducibility at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 folds the MRLs. Ion suppression/enhancement effects into the ion source were also assessed. The CC? values were included between 0.83 and 4.83ngg-1, well below the current MRLs. The validated method was applied to the determination of the target pesticides in 91 samples collected in colonies from 73 apiaries of NW Spain (two sampling campaigns during 2008). None of the target insecticides were detected among all the collected samples. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Fipronil; Honey; Insecticide residues; Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry; Method validation; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953738814

We examined genetic variation in adult beetle samples from the United States, Australia, Canada, and Africa by sequencing a 912-base pair region of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and screening 10 informative microsatellite loci. One Canadian introduction of small hive beetles can be traced to Australia, whereas the second introduction seems to have come from the United States. Beetles now resident in Australia were of a different African origin than were beetles in North America. North American beetles did not show covariance between two mitochondrial haplotypes and their microsatellite frequencies, suggesting that these beetles have a shared source despite having initial genetic structure within their introduced range.

We investigated arthropods to analyse biodiversity-habitat associations along five environmental gradients (age, impervious area, management, configuration, composition) in three Swiss cities (96 study sites). We considered total species richness and species richness within different functional groups (zoophagous, phytophagous, pollinator, low mobility, and high mobility species). Information theoretical model selection procedures were applied and predictions were calculated based on weighted models. Urban areas yielded on average 284 arthropod species (range: 169-361), with species richness correlating mostly with heterogeneity indices (configuration and composition). Species richness also increased with age of urban settlement, while enlarged proportions of impervious area and intensified habitat management was negatively correlated. Functional groups showed contrasted, specific responses to environmental variables. Overall, we found surprisingly little variation in species richness along the gradients, which is possibly due to the fine-grained spatial interlinkage of good (heterogeneous) and bad (sealed) habitats. The highly fragmented nature of urban areas may not represent a major obstacle for the arthropods currently existing in cities because they have probably been selected for tolerance to fragmentation and for high colonisation potential. Given that built areas are becoming denser, increasing spatial heterogeneity of the urban green offers potential for counteracting the detrimental effects of densification upon urban biodiversity. By quantifying the expected effects along environmental gradients, this study provides guidance for managers to set priorities when enhancing urban arthropod species richness. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Insects; Morphospecies; Rapid biodiversity assessment; Resilience; Spiders; Switzerland,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953543116

Where the species is abundant, its wind-dispersed pollen is responsible for most cases of allergic rhinitis or ''hayfever'' in August and September. Despite its adverse health effects, there is little information on the actual abundance or distribution of ragweed plants in rural settings. Ragweed surveys were therefore done in July and August (after herbicide application) in corn and soybean fields, field borders and along rural roadsides surrounding two cities in southern Quebec. Based on zero-inflated Poisson regression models, ragweed density averaged 4.1 plants m-2 (Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu area) and 16.1 plants m-2 (Salaberryde-Valleyfield area) along roadsides. Ragweed density in field borders (1.3 plants m-2) and fields was lower than on roadsides. Conventionally tilled fields and fields where tillage was reduced had equivalent densities of ragweed. Ragweed abundance in fields was likely related to the efficacy of herbicides used in transgenic vs. conventional crops. Transgenic herbicide-resistant corn fields had higher ragweed densities than conventional fields (0.44 vs. 0.07 plants m-2), while herbicide-resistant soybean fields had lower densities than conventional fields (0.02 vs. 1.33 plants m -2). Field borders located closer to roadsides had slightly higher ragweed counts, while roadside densities did not depend on the proximity of a field entrance. This suggests that roadsides are currently potential sources of spread into fields more than the opposite.

We evaluated a recovery of interactions between the insect-pollinated shrub Dillwynia sieberi and its pollinator assemblage dominated by exotic honeybee Apis mellifera in 5-year-old revegetated pastures and remnants of endangered Cumberland Plain Woodland (the aim of revegetation) in Sydney, Australia. We examined plant size, plant flower density, flower visitation rates by insects, counts of pollen per stigma and presence/absence of germinated pollen, fruit and seed set ratios and rates of pre-dispersal seed predation. Flower densities on plants in restored areas were significantly higher than in forest remnants. Bees were the most common flower visitors. Plants in revegetated areas attracted significantly more flower visitors with visitor assemblages usually dominated by A. mellifera. Plants in revegetated areas had similar numbers of flowers per inflorescence, while fruit and seed set per inflorescence was significantly higher in forest remnants. There was no significant difference in the rates of pre-dispersal seed predation. Plants in revegetated areas and forest remnants had similar seed output with no apparent negative effect of A. mellifera on seed production. Restoration of native vegetation in an urban context is a challenging long-term process. However, introduction of dominant plant species can foster a rapid return of their pollinators. The interactions between the plants and their native pollinators were resilient to pervasive exotic A. mellifera, and plants in restored ecosystems had an adequate reproductive output. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Apis mellifera; Cumberland plain woodland; Dillwynia sieberi; Ecological functions; Ecological restoration; Native pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953322451

Pollination and embryo growth are strongly influenced by climatic conditions that vary from site to site at different altitudes and across years often being the main cause for the quantity and quality production variability. On the other hand, fertilization and the early embryo development are important stages that influence yield and quality of chestnuts including the polyspermy rate of the nut. In this study, phenological observations were carried out during flowering and nut growth in 2007 for defining the most appropriate dates for performing, in 2008, controlled pollinations and the sampling of inflorescences and young fruitlets. The aim was to study ovule development, fertilization and early embryogenesis in chestnut. The controlled pollinations of 'Judia' were done with pollen from 'Negral' and 'Lada', two compatible pollinator cultivars. Histological observations showed that around mid July ovules were developing and contained the megaspore mother cell. Flowers pollinated with 'Negral' showed mature ovules on the 3rd week of July while flowers pollinated with 'Lada' had mature ovules 5 days earlier.

The objective of this study was to identify a suitable cultivar that could serve as a pollenizer to 'Porotan' by examining the influence of pollen on pellicle removability and nut weight. 'Porotan' was pollinated with pollen from the major cultivated chestnut cultivars in Japan ['Tanzawa', 'Tsukuba' and 'Ishizuchi' (Japanese chestnut) and 'Riheiguri' (a hybrid between Japanese and Chinese chestnuts)] in 2007 and 2008, and the resulting nuts were used in this study. Pellicle removability was estimated by measuring the time necessary to remove the pellicle from the kernels of deep-fried nuts. Peeling time for pellicles ranged from 5.6 s to 6.8 s per nut and no significant difference was observed between pollen donors. In contrast, nut weight ranged from 26.0 g to 30.1 g; nut weight of 'Porotan' trees pollinated by 'Tsukuba' was significantly higher than those pollinated by 'Ishizuchi', and nut weight of 'Porotan' trees pollinated by 'Riheiguri' was significantly larger than those pollinated by 'Tanzawa' and 'Ishizuchi'.

Exotic species often become numerically dominant in plant communities, and the relative abundance of these potential competitors for pollination may be an important determinant of their effects on the pollination and reproductive success of co-occurring native species. Our study experimentally tests whether the presence and abundance of an invasive exotic, Lythrum salicaria L. (Lythraceae), influences reproductive success of a co-flowering native species, Mimulus ringens L. (Phrymaceae). We also examine the mechanisms of competition for pollination and how they may be altered by changes in competitor abundance. We found that the presence of Lythrum salicaria lowered mean seed number in Mimulus ringens fruits. This effect was most pronounced when the invasive competitor was highly abundant, decreasing the number of seeds per fruit by 40% in 2006 and 33% in 2007. Reductions in the number of seeds per fruit were likely due to reduced visit quality resulting from Mimulus pollen loss when bees foraged on neighboring Lythrum plants. This study suggests that visit quality to natives may be influenced by the presence and abundance of invasive flowering plants. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Invasive species; Lythrum salicaria; Mimulus ringens; Pollen loss; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956651796

Theory suggests that, when resource abundance fluctuates, coexistence can be achieved if each species in a competing pair is better at exploiting resources at opposite extremes of a fluctuating resource spectrum. Nonetheless, the proximal mechanisms allowing coexistence remain largely unexplored. In a previous paper, we showed that the coexistence of two Atriplex species was facilitated by their varying demographic response (in survival, growth and recruitment) to fluctuation in water availability. Here we explore the effect of spatial distribution, and pollen and resource limitation on the reproductive success (production of viable seeds) of the same two species. An analysis of their spatial distribution showed that Atriplex acanthocarpa had a clumped distribution, which is thought to increase the effectiveness of pollination in wind-pollinated plants, while Atriplex canescens had a random distribution, a pattern expected to restrict wind-pollination success. A pollen and resource (water and nutrients) addition experiment implemented through a repeated-measures design demonstrated that seed viability of A. canescens was both pollen and resource limited, but that these effects were negligible in A. acanthocarpa. Under natural conditions, pollen limitation restricted seed number in A. canescens to only one-third of that recorded when manual pollination was performed. By decreasing its fecundity (and consequent potential seedling recruitment), pollen limitation reverses the competitive advantage of A. canescens over A. acanthocarpa when the limiting resource (water) is abundant and seedling recruitment takes place. To our knowledge, our study of this congeneric pair in the Chihuahuan Desert is the first to document a link between pollen limitation and species coexistence. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Environmental variability; Mapimí Biosphere Reserve; Mexico; Reproductive biology; Salt-bush,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958013120

It is widely used as a food additive. Fruits of this species are seedless, while wild type barberries produce seeds in the same area. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of seedlessness in seedless barberry by pollen viability test, field pollination experiments and microscopic observation of pollen tube growth in pistil and ovule development. For comparison, we also examined ovule development in wild type barberry (B. crataegina DC). In seedless barberry pollen germination was about 54%. Seedless barberry produced 20% seeded fruits when pollinated with pollen of wild type barberry. There was a sharp decrease in fruit set in emasculated unpollinated flowers of seedless barberry. In seedless barberry, a large number of pollen grains (about 370) were observed on stigma of each flower at 12 h after balloon stage (ABS). Most of them germinated and penetrated intracellular area of stigma surface, but no pollen tube reached ovary. In seedless barberry, many ovules did not have any embryo sac or had a very small incomplete embryo sac. In addition, unfused polar nuclei were clearly recognized in some cases at 14 days after full bloom (AFB). However, in wild type, double fertilization was accompanied by disappearance of polar nuclei. In seeded barberry, the cellularized endosperm became apparent at seven days AFB. At 21 days AFB, all ovules of seedless barberry were degenerated, while at the same time in wild type, one or two ovules of each flower were normal and were developing into complete seeds. Results showed that self-incompatibility has a main role in seedlessness of seedless barberry. However, the high frequency of abnormal ovules and single fertilization can be considered as two other reasons of seedlessness. Due to our results, fruits of seedless barberry were set by stimulative parthenocarpy. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Twelve parental lines including three restorers and eight male-sterile A-lines were crossed according to Iine × tester method to assess the combining ability and magnitude of heterosis in grain sorghum under both of clay and sandy soil. Under clay soil and surface irrigation, female line B11 and male line R-272 were the best general combiner for grain yield/plant and their GCA effects were 14.19 and 11.29, respectively, while under sandy soil and drip irrigation, the female line B93 and male line R-273 were the best general combiner for grain yield/plant and their GCA effects were 7.42 and 5.15, respectively. Heterosis results showed that male line R-273 is the best for developing sorghum hybrids under both of clay and sandy soil as heterosis for grain yield/plant in its hybrids was high under the two types of soils (101.94 and 94,18% under clay and sandy soil, respectively). However, mean heterosis of 143.90% over females line, for grain yield/plant under clay soil was obtained when male line R-272 was used as a pollinator gave the priority for this parent to be used for developing sorghum hbhrids under clay soil condition.

It is therefore important to understand the pollination mechanism of the plant and how this may be affected by plant and population characteristics. This study examined the reproductive biology of a scarce montane willow species, Salix arbuscula, as part of a programme to determine ecological strategies for the conservation of montane willow scrub, an endangered habitat in the UK. The relative importance of insect and wind pollination, and the role of plant characteristics including plant size, catkin length, number of flowers and local density in determining reproductive success (number of fruit set) were investigated in three populations. Insect exclosures were used to determine the pollination mechanism. Our results suggest that S. arbuscula is predominantly insect pollinated. In naturally pollinated plants, catkins with a higher proportion of ripe fruit were longer. Plants with more than two males in the local area and unbrowsed plants had a higher proportion of ripe fruit per catkin. The extent of wind pollination was very low, but differed between populations. The success of wind-only pollination was dependent on the number of males nearby, indicating that local density is more important in this type of pollination. Pollination mechanism and fruit set varied between the three populations observed, demonstrating the importance of multi-site comparisons. The number of males in the surrounding area had a positive effect on fruit set in both types of pollination, suggesting that Allee effects are likely to be operating in this species. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",Plant reproduction; Pollen limitation; Pollination mechanism; Salix; Seed set; Willow scrub,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650704040

Such predators can be costly to their host plant by consuming pollinators. However, sit-and-wait predators are often prey generalists that also consume plant antagonists such as herbivores, nectar robbers and granivores, so may also provide benefits to their host plant. Here we present a simple, but general, model that provides novel predictions about how costs and benefits interact in different ecological circumstances. The model predicts that the ecological conditions in which flower-dwelling predators are found can generate either net benefits to their host plants, net costs to their host plants, or can have no effect on the fitness of their host plants. The net effect is influenced by the relative densities of mutualists and antagonists. The flower-dwelling predator has a strong positive effect on the plant if both the pollinators and the granivores are at high density. Further, the range of density combinations that yield a positive net outcome for the plant increases if the performance of pollinators is negatively density dependent, if the predator is only moderately effective at influencing flower visitor rates by its potential prey, and if pollinators are very effective. If plants of a given species find themselves consistently in conditions where they benefit from the presence of a predator then we predict that natural selection could favour the evolution of plant traits that increase the likelihood of predator recruitment and retention, especially where plants are served by highly effective pollinators. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Ambush predators; Antagonists; Granivory; Pollination; Top-down effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956648300

In this experiment, hundreds of artificial hexaploid plants (ArArBcBcCcCc) involving hundreds of B. carinata/B. rapa combinations were first crossed with elite lines of partial new type B. napus. The pentaploid plants (AABCC) were open-pollinated in isolated conditions, and their offspring were successively self-pollinated and intensively selected for two generations. Thereafter, a population of substantial new type B. napus mainly with a genomic composition of ArArCcCc harbouring genetic diversity from 25 original cultivars of B. rapa and 72 accessions of B. carinata was constructed. The population was cytologically verified to have the correct chromosome constitution of AACC and differed genetically from traditional B. napus, in terms of the genome components of Ar/Cc and Bc as well as the novel genetic variations induced by the interspecific hybridisation process. Synchronously, rich phenotypic variation with plenty of novel valuable traits was observed in the population.

The genus Arum is composed of 28 species, all belonging to the subgenus Arum, except A. pictum, the only species of the subgenus Gymnomesium, which is basal and sister to all other Arum species. The aim of this paper is to document the pollination ecology of the insular Arum pictum, the only Arum species to flower in autumn, on the island of Corsica (France). The anthesis cycle of A. pictum occurs during the day, attracting sphaerocerid flies and staphylinid beetles early in the morning and late in the afternoon of the first day. The pollen is released from the anthers early in the morning of the second day before the departure of the insects. Its thermogenic cycle matches the anthesis cycle with an original and unique, bimodal temperature pattern of the appendix (morning and afternoon), contrary to the unimodal pattern found in all other studied Arum species. Data from reproductive success and seed sets suggest that sexual reproduction in this species is limited by pollen (e. g. attracting lured insects) rather than by resources. The biology of this Western Mediterranean species appears to be different from other Western European Arum and close to some Eastern Mediterranean species. Further studies are needed to establish whether Arum pictum represents some ancestral stage or whether its peculiar biological traits are adapted to its insular distribution. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Floral volatiles; Insect pollination; Ocimene; Reproductive success; Sphaeroceridae; Thermogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954241871

As climatic conditions change, the frequency of certain traits in plant communities is expected to change with increasing altitude. We examined patterns of change for 13 traits in 120 exhaustive inventories of plants along five altitudinal transects (520-3,100 m a.s.l.) in grasslands and in forests in western Switzer- land. The traits selected for study represented the occupation of space, photosynthesis, reproduction and dispersal. For each plot, the mean trait values or the proportions of the trait states were weighted by species cover and examined in relation to the first axis of a PCA based on local climatic conditions. With increasing altitude in grasslands, we observed a decrease in anemophily and an increase in entomophily complemented by possible selfing; a decrease in diaspores with appendages adapted to ectozoochory, linked to a decrease in achenes and an increase in capsules. In lowlands, pollination and dispersal are ensured by wind and animals. However, with increasing altitude, insects are mostly responsible for pollination, and wind becomes the main natural dispersal vector. Some traits showed a particularly marked change in the alpine belt (e.g. the increase of capsules and the decrease of achenes), confirming that this belt concentrates particularly stressful conditions to plant growth and reproduction (e.g. cold, short growing season) that constrain plants to a limited number of strategies. One adaptation to this stress is to limit investment in dispersal by producing capsules with numerous, tiny seeds that have appendages limited to narrow wings. Forests displayed many of the trends observed in grasslands but with a reduced variability that is likely due to a shorter altitudinal gradient. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",Alpine ecology; Biological traits; Environmental gradient; Plant functional type; Reproduction; Switzerland,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650701821

N:P stoichiometry, concerning the balance of these two elements, has recently received great attention. However, little is known about the nature of N:P stoichiometry in obligate mutualism.MethodsN:P stoichiometry of Ficus racemosa and its pollinating wasp Ceratosolen fusciceps, an example of coevolving obligate mutualism, was investigated, and the N:P stoichiometric traits of male versus female wasps were compared.Important FindingsNutrient concentrations in C. fusciceps were much higher than in its host. N enrichment in fig wasp was evidently stronger than phosphorus. N concentrations of male fig wasps were significantly higher than those of females, while P concentrations of female fig wasps were remarkably higher than those of male ones. Therefore, N:P ratios in male fig wasps were significantly greater than in female fig wasps. N:P ratio in fig-pollinating wasp displayed linear functions to fig N contents, suggesting that N limitation in fig wasps may dominate the nutritional relationship between fig pollinator and its host. Fig wasp population size had significant influences on N concentrations in host fig and female wasp per se. Driven by the nutritional stress of pollinating and parasite insects, fig fruit preferred increasing its diameter first but not nutrient richness. Values for N and P contents of fig pollinators showed seasonal differences with greater N:P ratios in dry season than in rainy season. The observations suggest that tropical climate change would result in more severe N limitation to fig-pollinating wasp and may further influence the stability of fig-fig wasp mutualism. © 2010 The Author.",Coevolution; Ficus racemosa; Fig wasp; Human disturbance; Mutualism; N:P stoichiometry; Sex divergence; Tropical rainforest; Xishuangbanna,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952966483

Estimates for mean gene diversity within 15 populations of N. pseudonarcissus of three neighbouring geographical regions were high in comparison to other long-lived perennials (HeN = 0.33). The genetic diversity of the two smallest populations (&lt;200 plants) was significantly reduced, indicating loss of genetic variability due to drift. The analysis of the population genetic structure revealed a significant genetic differentiation both between regions (?ST = 0.06) and between populations within regions (?ST = 0.20).

In order to preserve the overall genetic variation in wild populations of N. pseudonarcissus, management measures should thus aim to protect many populations in each region. The spatial genetic structure within populations of N. pseudonarcissus was in agreement with an isolation by distance model indicating limited gene flow due to pollinator behaviour and restricted seed dispersal. The very restricted spatial extent of clonal growth (&lt;5 cm) and the high level of clonal diversity indicate that clonal growth in N. pseudonarcissus is not an important mode of propagation and that management measures should favour sexual reproduction in order to avoid further reductions in the size and number of populations. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Clonality; Conservation genetics; Narcissus pseudonarcissus; Population genetic structure; RAPD; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954243893

Here we report the development and application of a set of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of L. tulipifera. In total, 176 primer pairs were developed and yielded 132 EST-SSR markers that amplified clear SSR bands with genomic DNA of L. tulipifera. Transferability of these EST-SSR markers to related species and genera was further examined. Twelve highly informative loci screened from 132 EST-SSR markers were applied to explore the effective pollen dispersal patterns and male reproductive success of Liriodendron. A provenance trial population of Liriodendron comprised 12 L. chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg provenances and 5 L. tulipifera provenances. The four maternal trees were randomly sampled as tested maternal trees in the population. Paternities of 220 open-pollination progenies from 4 maternal trees above were potentially identified by means of paternity analysis, of which 138 progenies (accounting for 62.7%) were assigned to 49 male parents at the 95% confidence level. The cumulative exclusion probability of 12 EST-SSR loci was 98.5%. The average effective pollen dispersal distance of pollen donors ranged from 15 to 35 m, with the maximum dispersal distance of 77 m. There were obvious male reproductive success differences among individuals, ranging from 0 to 10.9%. The cumulative male reproductive success of individuals within 35 m radius around the known maternal trees reached 51.4%. Diversiform mating patterns, including selfing, intra-species mating and interspecies mating, coexisted in the occasion of open-pollination in Liriodendron. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",EST-SSR marker; Male reproductive success; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957809158

A fuller understanding of the role of adaptation in speciation requires connecting particular molecular events with selection occurring at individual, population, or community levels. Here I discuss five areas in which we understand the molecular basis of adaptation and isolation sufficiently to begin examining patterns. These examples highlight the importance of understanding both biotic and abiotic factors and the potential overlap between them, and demonstrate that understanding molecular mechanisms aids in interpreting pleiotropy and constraint. For example, mutations affecting anthocyanin production can affect both pollinator visitation and parasite attack, while edaphic adaptation can alter parasite susceptibility and reproductive timing. Adaptation is also implicated in postzygotic incompatibility: Potentially adaptive cytoplasmic divergence can lead to sterility or inviability; hybrid sterility genes may have pleiotropic effects in biotic or abiotic stress; and the plant immune system is implicated in hybrid failure.

Orchids have complex and delicate interactions with their pollinators, which makes them particularly prone to local extinction. Conservation actions should be encouraged for a range of endangered Mediterranean orchid species, but the current taxonomic confusion in several genera and the apparent disagreement among orchid taxonomists make the situation particularly confusing from a conservation perspective. In this review, we document how the different pollination syndromes of Mediterranean orchids (nectar reward, shelter offering, food deception and sexual deception) can have a profound impact on the type of reproductive barriers among species, on floral phenotypic variation as we perceive it, on potentially related processes of species sorting and extinction and, consequently, should have a strong influence on the related conservation management programs. We also highlight that the majority of Mediterranean orchids are pollinated by specialised bees often occupying otherwise narrow ecological niches (e. g. pollen specialisation, brood cell parasites, specific nesting site). This condition makes the orchid-pollinator interactions very fragile and several orchid species prone to local extinction. We illustrate this phenomenon by a selection of case studies that show how the adequate integration of the ecological requirements/traits of the orchids and their associated pollinators into conservation actions could help protect endangered species and ensure the sustainability of the often complex local pollination web. © The New York Botanical Garden 2010.",Conservation Strategies; Mediterranean Orchids; Pollination Syndromes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952552437

We developed an insecticide program risk (IPR) index to quantify the relative risk to wild bees of insecticide programs applied to blueberry fields. This was used to determine the relationship between IPR and the abundance, diversity, and richness of wild bee communities sampled during three successive flowering seasons. In 2 of 3 yr, bee abundance and species richness declined with increasing IPR. Bee diversity declined with IPR in one of 3 yr. These results indicate that wild bee communities are negatively affected by increasingly intensive chemical pest management activities in crop fields and that interyear variability in bee populations has the potential to mask such effects in short-term studies. When several wild bee species were analyzed separately, two of three solitary and one of three social blueberry-foraging species declined with increasing IPR values, suggesting that different life histories and nesting habits may help some bee populations escape the negative effects of insecticides applied after bloom. Pollinator conservation programs aimed strictly at reducing insecticide use may have varying success, depending on the biology of the target bee species. The IPR index provides a standard method to compare pest management programs for their potential effect on wild bee communities, with broad application for use in other agricultural systems. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",Apoidea; Insecticides; Nontarget effects; Vaccinium corymbosum; Wild bee conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953075537

Evolutionary conflicts of interest underlie mutualisms, including plant/pollinator interactions. This is particularly evident in 'nursery pollination', in which the pollinators lay eggs inside the flowers and the offspring of the pollinator consume the developing seeds. Low benefit (pollination service) to cost (seed predation) ratios could destabilize such associations towards parasitism. 2. Although in most of the well-known cases pollen transfer is associated with oviposition, in some systems the males of the seed predator may contribute to pollination, affecting the strength and outcome of the interaction between the plant and their ovipositing pollinators. In addition, in dioecious species male and female plants differ in the direct costs of seed predation and benefits of attracting pollinators, which may lead to sex-specific strategies. 3. We investigated whether pollinator and plant sex affect pollination in the interaction between dioecious plant Silene latifolia and its nursery pollinator, Hadena bicruris (Noctuidae). 4. Data on visitation behaviour and pollination efficiency in experimental plant patches demonstrate that (i) male moths are equally efficient pollinators as female moths, leading to fruit initiation in around 80% of visits and to fertilization of around 45% of the ovules in one visit; (ii) female and male moths do not preferentially visit flowers of one sex; and (iii) feeding behaviour is sufficient to ensure pollen transfer. However, female moths visited significantly more flowers than male moths. 5. Altogether this suggests that both moth sexes provide a pollination benefit to the plant with no differences in pollination efficiency but that female moths, before seed predation costs are accounted for, seem to provide greater benefits owing to their increased activity. That male moths contribute to seed production likely decreases the plant's dependency on ovipositing moths for pollination. © 2009 The Authors.

The absence of rewards depresses both pollinator fidelity and the frequency of pollinator visits to an orchid population even though orchid flowers that lack rewards retain the same interlocking floral structures for precise pollinia removal and deposition found in related species that offer rewards. Using the genus, Cypripedium, as a model lineage of non-rewarding flowers this study also shows that the correlation between low fruit set in a Cypripedium sp. and its specific pollinator(s) is insufficient to predict specific frequencies of low fecundity. Annual rates of fruit set often vary broadly between populations of the same species and within the same population over several seasons. We speculate that fruit-set rates also decline when orchid demography and additional biotic and abiotic factors interrupt rates of pollinator activity (pre-zygotic) and fertilization/fruit maturation (post-zygotic). We suggest that that traditional field studies on pollination ecology and breeding systems be combined with data sets recording genetic variation and orchid flower demography in relation to seasonal variation in climate. We also propose that the same information be collected in regard to genetic variation, demography and phenology of populations of known orchid pollinators and co-blooming angiosperm species native to orchid habitats. © The New York Botanical Garden 2010.",Conservation; Cypripedium; Fruit Set; Pollinator-Limited; Predation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952424570

We studied natural female fertility of morphs, and assessed the role of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators. We also quantified female fertility of the morphs in experimental populations with different morph ratio, exposed to predominately long- or short-tongued pollinators. We found that with LT pollinators, both morphs were successfully pollinated in all morph ratio conditions, suggesting that these insects could be involved in maintenance of the polymorphism, although other factors may also play a role. However, with ST pollinators, S-plants displayed less fertility than L-plants, and mating among L-plants was favoured, implying that the polymorphism is lost. These results underscore the role of pollinators on variations in style polymorphism. © 2010 The Authors.

Mechanistic explanations include selection through pollinators, antagonists, local environments, drift, and pleiotropic effects. We examined the maintenance of inflorescence color polymorphisms in the genus Protea (Proteaceae) of South Africa, in which ~40% of species contain different color morphs. Methods: We studied 10 populations of four bird-pollinated Protea species and compared adult performance, floral and leaf morphology, vegetative pigmentation, germination, and seedling survival between co-occurring pink and white morphs. We also tested for differences in pollination success and pre-dispersal seed predation. Key results: White morphs produced seeds 10% heavier and 3.5 times more likely to germinate, which all else being equal, should fuel positive selection on white. In one studied population per species, however, white morphs were more susceptible to seed predation by endophagous larvae. Pollinators had no morph-specifi c effects on female fecundity, as measured by amount or probability of seed set. Differences in stem color indicated that white morphs produced smaller quantities of pigment and associated compounds throughout, possibly explaining their higher seed palatability. Conclusions: Our fi ndings suggest a mechanism for some white protea polymorphisms: deleterious pleiotropic effects on pink morphs are occasionally offset by reduced losses to seed-eating larvae. Because trends were repeated across species, we suggest that similar processes may also occur in other proteas, placing a new emphasis on seed predators for influencing some of South Africa' s amazing floral diversity. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Anthocyanin; Cape floristic region; Color polymorphism; Flower color; Natural selection; Predispersal seed predation; Proteaceae; South africa; White protea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953498776

In each species, the sexual status of lemmas, the period of stigma receptivity, pollen/ovule ratio, pollen longevity and daily pollen release were examined. The functional sexual systems were determined after performing controlled pollinations and testing seed quality by weight and germination potential. The florets of 35 species are morphologically hermaphroditic. Among the other four species, Chionachne koenigii and Iseilema laxum are monoecious; Chrysopogon aciculatus and Pennisetum pedicellatum are andromonoecious. Examination of the sequential opening of florets and controlled pollinations revealed that C. koenigii and I. laxum are obligate outcrossers with incompatibility to geitonogamous pollen; C. aciculatus and P.pedicellatum have a high level of compatibility to xenopollen. These and another nine species were treated as predominantly outcrossing species. Yet another five species were predominantly self-fertilized, while the remaining 21 species displayed a mixed breeding system. In a majority of the species the P/O ratios are not high and thus do not conform to the expected large P/O ratios in wind-pollinated plants and postulated breeding systems except in a few species. The majority of these grasses shed pollen over a short period spreading from 2 am to 8 am, when usually low turbulent conditions exist, thus allowing short distance transport and restricted pollen shadows with higher concentration of pollen near the source. This appears to be the appropriate strategy for maximization of pollination in view of the short lifespan of pollen that extends mostly over 1-3 h period, and the patchy distribution of the grasses under study. The restricted pollen shadows facilitate the low levels of pollen production in the grass species under study to fertilize most or all the available ovules. © 2010 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955956149

A mating test suggested that the rates of adhering polyads per stigma and germinating polyads per stigma were lower in the self-pollination of soaked spikes than in that of normal spikes. On the other hand, the number of matured pods was not significantly different in the mating between the spikes receiving the soaking treatment (?) and the spikes receiving no treatment (?) compared with the mating between normal spikes.

Fewer bees of all types were observed foraging and fewer pollen foragers returned to colonies during poor weather than during good weather. There were also changes in foraging community composition: honey bees dominated during good weather, whereas bumble bees dominated during poor weather. Berries from flowers exposed only during poor weather had higher fruit set in 1 yr and higher berry weight in the other year compared with enclosed clusters. In both years, clusters exposed only during good weather had >5 times as many mature seeds, weighed twice as much, and had double the fruit set of those not exposed. No significant increase over flowers exposed during good weather was observed when clusters were exposed during good and poor weather.

Pollination is a key factor in fruit production and self-incompatibility is one of the main limiting factors of this process. PCD has recently been put forward as a possible cause of pollen-growth arrest. As far as the olive is concerned, no data have been published concerning the mechanisms involved in hindering the growth of pollen tubes in incompatible pollen. Thus, we have studied olive pistils excised from freely pollinated flowers at different stages before and during the progamic phase using different cytochemical techniques, including trypan blue staining. To discover whether the elimination of incompatible pollen might be associated to PCD, we applied different tests to the excised pistils: (1) TUNEL assay; (2) DNA degradation analysis; (3) detection of caspase-3-like activity. Once we had determined that PCD was involved in pollen selection after free pollination, we conducted experiments after controlled pollination in pistils excised from flowers: (a) developing in the absence of pollen; (b) pollinated with sterile pollen that does not germinate; (c) self-pollinated; (d) pollinated with compatible pollen. Our results demonstrate that the growth of tubes in incompatible pollen is halted in the stylar area in a way that suggests the intervention of PCD. Furthermore, any pollen, even if sterile, seemed to accelerate PCD in papillar cells in the olive. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Olive; Pistil; Pollen; Programmed cell death; Trypan blue; TUNEL assay,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952419497

In polymorphic species, morphs may evolve quantitative differences in additional characters as a result of morph-specific selection. The perennial rosette herb Primula farinosa is polymorphic for scape length. The short-scaped morph is less damaged by grazers and seed predators but is more strongly pollen limited than the long-scaped morph. We examined whether morph-specific differences in biotic interactions are associated with differences in selection on two other traits affecting floral display (number of flowers and petal size) and on one trait likely to affect pollination efficiency (corolla tube width) in three P. farinosa populations. Differences in selection between morphs were detected in one population. In this population, selection for more flowers and larger petals was stronger in the short-scaped than in the long-scaped morph, and although there was selection for narrower corolla tubes in the short-scaped morph, no statistically significant selection on corolla tube width could be detected in the long-scaped morph. In the study populations, the short-scaped morph produced more and larger flowers and wider corolla tubes. Current morph-specific selection was thus only partly consistent with trait differences between morphs.

Trifolium argentinense Speg. is an amphicarpic legume species that occurs in native pastures of Southern Brazil. Data on seed dimorphism, chromosome number and karyotype of the species are presented for the first time. T. argentinense is diploid, with 2n = 2x = 16. Chromosome size range from ca. 2.8 to 1.6 ?m, the karyotypic formula is 3 metacentric +1 satellite-bearing metacentric +3 acrocentric +1 subacrocentric and a TCL (total complement length) of 18.10 ?m. All the subterranean, but around 70% of the aerial legumes formed seeds. Subterranean seeds were larger and heavier (2.1 mm and 0.0029 g, respectively) than the aerial ones (1.8 mm and 0.0016 g, respectively). As a follow up to this work, we plan to characterize aerial and subterranean-seed-derived plants regarding aspects such as growing rate, height, leaf size and forage production, as well as to determine the exact mode of reproduction of T. argentinense by pollination experiments and the use of molecular markers. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Amphicarpy; Chromosome number; Karyotype; Seed dimorphism; Trifolium argentinense,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952009502

Although mixed mating is ubiquitous, it has several potential evolutionary explanations. Mixed mating may be actively maintained by selection, passively determined by the pollination environment, or a transitional stage during the evolution of self fertilization. Methods: We studied patterns of self-compatibility and selfing rates in a population of Leavenworthia alabamica that recently lost self-incompatibility. We also experimentally tested whether natural selection against selfing at the pre- or postzygotic stage is suffi cient to explain mixed mating in this population. Key results: Visualizing pollen tube growth following self-pollination, we found that nearly all plants were fully self-compatible. Progeny array analysis revealed that the average selfing rate of the population was s = 0.523. The inbreeding coeffi cient in the parents (F = 0.539) exceeded the amount expected if the selfing rate (s) were constant [F eq = s /(2 - s)], indicating either population subdivision or higher selfing rates in the past. Inference of family-level selfing rates revealed substantial variation. Experiments found that self and outcross pollen fertilized nearly equal numbers of ovules in competition. Comparison of seed production following self- or cross-pollination failed to implicate early acting inbreeding depression as a factor maintaining mixed mating. Conclusions: The results of our experiments suggest that mixed mating is not maintained by selection against self-pollen or zygotes in this population. Mixed mating is most likely a byproduct of the pollination process but may also be a transitional stage during the evolution of higher selfing rates. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Bet hedging; Brassicaceae; Fluctuating environments; Inbreeding depression; Leavenworthia alabamica; Mating system; Pollen competition; Reproductive assurance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953508703

While recent studies have examined the impact of natural or artificial floral damage, very few researchers have manipulated both damage and pollen addition to see whether pollen limitation is enhanced by damage, and no workers, to my knowledge, have examined whether pollen limitation is dependent on the levels of florivory used. I used a pollen addition treatment and six levels of artificial floral damage to investigate whether damage increases pollen limitation and whether that pollen limitation becomes more severe with increasing numbers of petals damaged in Nemophila menziesii Hook. & Am. I found that artificial floral damage that mimics natural florivore damage increases pollen limitation, and that this pollen limitation generally increased with increasing numbers of petals damaged. The treatment with the heaviest amount of damage did not suffer the most pollen limitation, perhaps because flowers in this treatment remained radially symmetric. These findings suggest that florivory may decrease pollen import through pollinator deterrence and could thus serve as a selective force on either floral or defense traits in outcrossing plant populations.",Floral herbivory; Floral symmetry; Florivory; Pollen limitation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953600197

Animals that collect pollen without pollinating (pollen thieves) could reduce siring success of thieved plants and cause pollen limitation of seed set at the population level; however, such impacts on plant reproduction have not been demonstrated experimentally. To test these effects we added hives of native honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) to populations of a primarily bird-pollinated plant, Aloe maculata, in eastern South Africa. In field and aviary trials, bee addition increased pollen removal from anthers but decreased pollen deposition on stigmas, and so reduced both male and female pollination components. Further, total seed production decreased with hive addition in the aviary experiment and in three of four field populations, indicating that population-level pollen theft can also compromise reproductive success. In the field, naturally occurring allodapine bees also seemed to act as pollen thieves, outweighing the effect of honey bee hive addition at one of the four aloe populations. Our results highlight the importance of social, bees as pollen thieves, even of plants that have evolved in their presence, and the role of dichogamy in promoting pollen theft. Given the commonness of both social bees and dichogamy, pollen theft is likely a much more common influence on floral ecology and evolution than suggested by the sparse literature. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Aloe maculata; Antagonist; Apis mellifera scutellata; Cheating, honey bee; Pollen theft; Pollination efficiency; South africa; Sunhirds",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953258589

It could, thus, be regarded as an adaptation to unpredictable pollinator environments. Within the alpine biennial Gentianopsis paludosa, the showy flowers and herkogamy at the early stage of a flower's life cycle may favor outcrossing. As the flower ages, anthers contact the central stigma due to the elongation of all filaments, resulting in autonomous selfing. Flower visitors are extremely rare in a high altitude population; and examination of the mating system indicates that G. paludosa is self-pollinated under natural conditions in this population. While at the lower altitude, the bumblebee visitation rate is relatively high but possibly unreliable. Stigma receptivity is the highest on the third day of anthesis, and decreases thereafter. Pollen viability is the highest when flowers open, and gradually decreases later. Self-pollination of G. paludosa occurs at the late stage of a flower's lifecycle when stigma receptivity and pollen viability have both decreased, suggesting delayed selfing and assurance of seed production. This delayed selfing could assure seed production under the constraints of pollinator scarcity, but ensure outcrossing when pollinators were available.

One gene system that directly links genetic diversity with reproduction, through its influence on fertilization success, is the self-incompatibility (SI) locus in angiosperm plants. Despite the potential importance of SI allele diversity for demographical function, there are few direct measures of S-allele numbers in multiple populations, and no studies have simultaneously measured reproductive output, mate availability, S-allele diversity and pollinator service.We used diallel crosses to estimate S-allele number and mate availability in seven populations of the forb Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides ranging in size from 5 to 100 000 plants. Seed set and correlated paternity were assessed from open-pollinated inflorescences to examine reproductive output and variance in female and male fitness. To assess whether populations were receiving adequate pollinator service, the amount of pollen deposited on open-pollinated stigmas was quantified.3. We found that small populations (<100 plants) of R. leptorrhynchoides have low S-allele diversity and mate availability and exhibit significant reductions in seed set relative to large populations (>1000 plants) with higher numbers of S-alleles, despite the maintenance of pollinator service. Greater variance in seed set among plants and higher correlated paternity in small populations suggest that low S-allele numbers are directly limiting mate availability and causing the observed reproductive failure.. Synthesis and applications. Our work demonstrates that the loss of genetic diversity at the SI locus can have immediate detrimental effects on reproductive performance, despite the maintenance of pollinator service. These results highlight the importance of genetic factors in determining demographical outcomes when clear links between genotype and individual fitness exist, even when populations are not ecologically constrained. This result is important for the conservation and management of many plant species as approximately half of all angiosperm families contain species with genetically controlled SI and the loss of genetic diversity through habitat loss and fragmentation is an ever-increasing reality for plant species worldwide. © 2010 The Authors.

Whereas drought stress at anthesis affects mainly grain size, stress at the young microspore stage of pollen development is characterized by abortion of pollen development and reduction in grain number. We identified genetic variability for drought tolerance at the reproductive stage. Drought-tolerant wheat germplasm is able to maintain carbohydrate accumulation in the reproductive organs throughout the stress treatment. Starch depletion in the ovary of drought-sensitive wheat is reversible upon re-watering and cross-pollination experiments indicate that the ovary is more resilient than the anther. The effect on anthers and pollen fertility is irreversible, suggesting that pollen sterility is the main cause of grain loss during drought conditions in wheat. The difference in storage carbohydrate accumulation in drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant wheat is correlated with differences in sugar profiles, cell wall invertase gene expression and expression of fructan biosynthesis genes in anther and ovary (sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyl-transferase, 1-SST; sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyl-transferase, 6-SFT). Our results indicate that the ability to control and maintain sink strength and carbohydrate supply to anthers may be the key to maintaining pollen fertility and grain number in wheat and this mechanism may also provide protection against other abiotic stresses. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Cell wall invertase; Cereals; Drought tolerance; Germplasm; Pollen sterility; Tapetum; Young microspore,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649154552

Previous authors have suggested that wasteful pollen transfer by bats accounted for the pattern. Here we propose and test a new hypothesis: bats select for increased pollen production because they can efficiently transfer larger amounts of pollen, which leads to a more linear male fitness gain curve for bat-pollinated plants. Flight cage experiments with artificial flowers and flowers of Aphelandra acanthus provide support for this hypothesis; in both instances, the amount of pollen delivered to stigmas by birds is not related to the amount of pollen removed from anthers on the previous visit, while the same function for bats increases linearly. Thus, increased pollen production will be linearly related to increased male reproductive success for bat flowers, while for bird flowers, increased pollen production leads to rapidly diminishing fitness returns. We speculate that fur takes up and holds more pollen than feathers, which seem to readily shed excess grains. Our gain-curve hypothesis may also explain why evolutionary shifts from bird to bat pollination seem more common than shifts in the opposite direction. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Aphelandra acanthus; Burmeistera; Chiropterophily; Male fitness gain curves; Ornithophily; Sex allocation theory,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952054901

It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal, characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager's evenness index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7%) and clonal production (33.3%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63% polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon's diversity index (0.1895) as well as of Nei's gene diversity (0.1186).

Some neighbourhoods within each population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small scales.

Most studies concentrate on the temporary response of bees' peripheral chemoreceptors to these chemicals, and the post-ingestive effects of plant phenolics are largely ignored. In the present study, a series of feeding experiments are conducted to test whether plant phenolics modulate the response thresholds and rhythmic behaviour of the honeybee Apis cerana (Ruttner). The results of the study demonstrate that bees fed with syrup containing high concentrations of phenlics reduce their response thresholds greatly, and shift their feeding rhythms significantly. Because the forager response thresholds determine their foraging choice, and their rhythmic behaviour is required for timing visits to flowers, enhanced plant phenolics as a result of global environment change may change the bees' pollination service in our changing world. © 2010 The Authors.

Floral characteristics indicated adaptations to long-tongued flower visitors. The three species possess large, conspicuously colored flowers that produced sucrose-rich nectar (concentrations: 16.4%-23.9%) and emit a rosy floral perfume with a citrus-related aspect, dominated by terpenoids. Principal scent compounds of V. caerulea and V. rosea were (E)-nerolidol and geraniol, and (E)-8-oxo-?-farnesene [(E)-2,6-dimethyl-10-methylenedodeca-2,6,11-trien-5-one, a new natural product] and (E,E)-farnesyl acetate in V. clavata. Germinating pollen grains were observed in the anthers of all species, forming large interwoven clumps that were transferred by the pollinators as a unit. In V. caerulea and V. rosea, stamens and stigmas were positioned close together, enabling the plants to self-pollinate. In contrast, male and female organs are widely separated in V. clavata. Pollen to ovule ratios of all species were low (33-78), indicating that pollen transfer (either by selfing or by outcrossing) is very efficient. Flower visitors were butterflies (V caerulea, V. rosea) and/or long-tongued bees of the genus Euglossa (V. clavata, V. rosea). Nevertheless, Voyria caerulea and V. rosea were visited only rarely and irregularly. We suggest that these two species follow a mixed selfing-outcrossing strategy to ensure seed production when pollen transfer by visitors fails. In contrast, V. clavata showed a high degree of specialization towards euglossine-pollinators, which were frequent visitors. The close plant-pollinator interaction increases the probability of outcrossings and might have enabled this species to completely rely on pollinators for reproduction. Average seed set in the studied species ranged between 36% and 49% and was very variable among individuals, probably due to resource-limitation. The capsules of V. caerulea and V. clavata showed characteristics of endozoochorous dispersal and were frequently found damaged by possible rodent dispersal agents.","(E)-2,6-dimethyl-10-methylenedodeca-2,6,11-trien-5-one; Euglossini; French Guiana; Gentianaceae; Lepidoptera; Mycoheterotrophic plants; Pollination biology; Voyria",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954501931

Methods: Near simultaneous, manual reciprocal crosses were carried out between clonal lines for two experiments. Infructescences were harvested at intervals during seed development. Each individual seed was weighed and then used to determine dry weight or one of the physiological behaviour traits. Key Results: Whilst population mass maturity was reached at 33-36 days after pollination (DAP), seed-to-seed variation in maximum seed dry weight, when it was achieved, and when maturation drying commenced, was considerable. Individual seeds acquired germinability between 14 and 44 DAP, desiccation tolerance between 30 and 40 DAP, and the capability to become hardseeded between 30 and 47 DAP. The time for viability to fall to 50 (p50) at 60 relative humidity and 45 °C increased between 36 and 56 DAP, when the seed coats of most individuals had become dark orange, but declined thereafter. Individual seed f. wt at harvest did not correlate with air-dry storage survival period. Analysing survival data for cohorts of seeds reduced the standard deviation of the normal distribution of seed deaths in time, but no sub-population showed complete uniformity of survival period. Conclusions: Variation in individual seed behaviours within a developing population is inherent and inevitable. In this outbreeder, there is significant variation in seed longevity which appears dependent on embryo genotype with little effect of maternal genotype or architectural factors. © The Author 2010.",Cohort and population measurements; Model system; Seed coat colour; Seed development; Seed longevity; Seed-to-seed variation; Trifolium ambiguum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952967427

Energetic investments may be expensive, so some species such as Prosopis glandulosa have developed a dimorphic system of nectar production, which is expected to affect floral visitor behaviour and then plant fitness. We quantified bee diversity during a 2 year period in a population of the honey mesquite in order to determine changes in bee diversity due to the presence of nectar, bee preferences to collect either nectar of pollen, and to determine between year variations of bee faunas. Floral visitors were captured at three different times of the day during the flowering seasons of 1994 and 1995, in a population of Prosopis glandulosa which has a 1:1 proportion of nectar: nectarless individuals. Pollinators were clearly distinct between nectar morphs, bee species diversity and relative abundance of visits were significantly greater on nectarful than on nectarless plants, with species on nectarless individuals being a subset of those in the nectarful morph. Our results suggest differences in the function of floral rewards (i. e., nectar and pollen) to attract floral visitors. For the Chihuahuan arid environment, mesquite provides floral rewards with ease, quantity and quality for close to 10% of all bee fauna making them important components of these communities. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bee diversity; Deceit pollination; Diversity profiles; Floral rewards; Floral visitors,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954083812

The conservation of native bee communities within agroforestry landscapes is particularly urgent given the importance of pollination services within these systems. In this study, we examined tropical bee communities within a largely deforested shade coffee-growing region in Chiapas, Mexico. We used regression tree modeling to examine the response of bee functional groups to local and landscape-level habitat management. Our models revealed that the most predictive factors for bee abundance and species richness were the number of tree species, the number of tree species in flower, and the canopy cover of the local agroforestry landscape. Solitary bees were most abundant in habitats with high canopy cover, while social bees were most abundant in habitats with greater tree species richness. Cavity-nesting and wood-nesting bee abundance was positively affected by the amount of canopy cover in the farm, while ground-nesting bees were most abundant in habitats with a large number of tree species in flower. Our results demonstrate that across bee sociality groups, nesting guilds, and tribes, the most critical factor impacting native bee communities was within-farm local vegetation management. These results reveal the important role that agroforestry managers can have on biodiversity conservation, and the potential contribution they can make by creating resource-rich agricultural matrices. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of diverse overstory tree management in supporting native bee communities within tropical agroforestry systems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Agroforestry; Bee; Coffee; Habitat management; Landscape; Nesting; Regression tree; Solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954817373

Here, we show, using the cv MicroTom, that application of N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; an inhibitor of auxin transport) to unpollinated ovaries induced parthenocarpic fruit-set, associated with an increase of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content, and that this effect was negated by paclobutrazol (an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis). NPA-induced ovaries contained higher content of GA1 (an active GA) and transcripts of GA biosynthetic genes (SlCPS, SlGA20ox1, and -2). Interestingly, application of NPA to pollinated ovaries prevented their growth, potentially due to supraoptimal IAA accumulation. Plant decapitation and inhibition of auxin transport by NPA from the apical shoot also induced parthenocarpic fruit growth of unpollinated ovaries. Application of IAA to the severed stump negated the plant decapitation effect, indicating that the apical shoot prevents unpollinated ovary growth through IAA transport. Parthenocarpic fruit growth induced by plant decapitation was associated with high levels of GA1 and was counteracted by paclobutrazol treatment. Plant decapitation also produced changes in transcript levels of genes encoding enzymes of GA biosynthesis (SlCPS and SlGA20ox1) in the ovary, quite similar to those found in NPA-induced fruits. All these results suggest that auxin can have opposing effects on fruit-set, either inducing (when accumulated in the ovary) or repressing (when transported from the apical shoot) that process, and that GAs act as mediators in both cases. The effect of NPA application and decapitation on fruit-set induction was also observed in MicroTom lines bearing introgressed DWARF and SELF-PRUNING wild-type alleles. © 2010 by the American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953190135

However, landscape-scale genetic studies which are necessary to underpin conservation and breeding strategies are often lacking. We investigated molecular diversity in common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) sampled from 42 British and six French sites with microsatellites. Chloroplast haplotype H04 was the most common and widespread in Britain, although rare and localized individuals with H02 and H09 were also detected. In addition, three new chloroplast haplotypes were identified, and these were rare and highly localized. In terms of nuclear microsatellite markers, allelic richness differed between sites and decreased in an east to west direction. Differentiation between sites was often very low (mean FST 0.025), indicating few differences between the majority of sites. There was a clear excess of homozygotes (mean HO 0.669, mean HE 0.818) and a relatively high FIS (mean 0.182), suggests a consistent level of inbreeding or a widespread Wahlund effect in many F. excelsior sites. Gene pool ancestry analysis suggested that the majority of British F. excelsior belongs to a single meta-population which covers mainland western and central Europe. Three northern and western sites diverged markedly from the dominant population, and may represent remnants of two late potential Ice Age refugia in northern Britain. The data provide new information which will aid development of appropriate conservation policies for ash and other wind pollinated tree species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Conservation; Fraxinus excelsior; Microsatellites; Population structure; Secondary refugia; Seed zones,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952721164

We investigated the genetic diversity and structure at four microsatellites of 15 populations comprising continuous-peripheral and disjunct-peripheral populations in Nepal. Estimates of genetic diversity (NA = 8. 98, HO = 0. 62, HE = 0. 69) were similar when compared with those of other tropical tree species. A higher level of genetic diversity was observed in continuous-peripheral populations (NA = 9. 61, HO = 0. 67, HE = 0. 72) as compared to disjunct-peripheral (NA = 8. 04, HO = 0. 55, HE = 0. 64). Population differentiation was higher among disjunct-peripheral populations (FST = 0. 043) than among continuous peripherals (FST = 0. 012). There was a significant association between gene flow distances and genetic differentiation (r2 = 0. 128, P ? 0. 007). No spatial arrangement of populations according to their geographical locations was found. Based on observed genetic diversity protection of some populations in continuous-peripheral range are suggested for the sustainable conservation of genetic resources of the species while protection of some disjunct-peripheral populations are also recommended for conserving rare alleles. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conservation; Genetic diversity; Microsatellites; Nepal; Peripheral populations; Shorea robusta,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952875752

Although symptoms on fruits are not obvious, yield losses occur through decreased fruit size and number. Control of ToCV epidemics is difficult because the virus is transmitted by several whitefly vector species and its relatively wide host range facilitates establishment in local wild reservoirs. Therefore, breeding for ToCV resistance offers the best control alternative. However, no sources for resistance are available thus far. Here, a screen of tomatoes and wild species relatives was performed in search of ToCV resistance. Two sources of resistance to ToCV were identified in this work, lines '802-11-1' and '821-13-1', each derived by two self-pollinations from ToCV asymptomatic plants of the population 'IAC CN RT' (derived from an interspecific hybrid Solanum lycopersicum × S. Peruvianum accession LA0444) and accession LA1028 (S. Chmielewskii), respectively. The resistance was expressed by impairing virus accumulation and disease symptom expression, both under natural infection and after challenging with ToCV in controlled inoculations. Genetic control of resistance to ToCV infection in '821-13-1' was conferred by a major locus with mainly additive effects but also partial dominance for higher susceptibility. Also, an additive × dominance epistatic interaction with at least one additional gene was evident. © 2010 The American Phytopathological Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953212669

Alfalfa is the third important forage crop in India after Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) and Berseem (Trifolium alexandrinum L.). It produces more protein per ha than grain or oilseed crops. The average protein yield of alfalfa is more than twice to that of soybean (Tyagi, 1997; Barnes et al., 1988). The variability accomplished with significant genetic distance among different accessions of a species is known as genetic diversity or genetic divergence. Genetic diversity plays an important role in plant breeding because hybrids between lines of diverse origin generally display a greater heterosis than those between closely related accessions (Ram and Panwar, 1970). The maximum heterosis generally, however, occurs at an optimal or intermediate level of diversity. The D 2 technique (Mahalanobis, 1936) has been used in assessing the variability present in crops, like maize, sorghum, pearl millet, wheat, linseed, cotton, tobacco, alfalfa and brassica (Moll and Stuber, 1974). In addition to it in the selection of divergent parents for hybridization, D 2 statistics measures the degree of diversification and relative proportion of each component character to the total divergence.

As previously hypothesized, the characteristic occluded (personate) corolla of Antirrhinum was exclusively pollinated by bees, but by a higher number (four) of bee families than predicted. Seven bee species (Bombus hortorum, Anthidium manicatum, Chalicodoma lefebvrei, Anthidium sticticum, Anthophora dispar, Xylocopa violacea and Anthidium cingulatum) account for over 90% of flower visits (2098).

To investigate whether fruit dropping in this individual is related to an abnormal development of the embryo sac following self-fertilization, histological sections of ovaries from self and cross-pollinated flowers were observed by light microscopy. Additionally, the presence of pollen tubes in the ovary and fruit set were determined for both types of pollination. Despite pollen tubes reached the ovary after both pollinations, differences in embryo sac and endosperm development after fertilization were found. Thus, while for cross-fertilized ovules a pro-embryo and an endosperm with abundant nuclei were generally observed, most self-fertilized ovules remained in a previous developmental stage in which the embryo sac was not elongated and endosperm nuclei were absent. Although 30 days after pollination fruit set was similar for both pollination types, at 60 days it was significantly reduced for self-pollination. These results provide evidence that the high fruit drop in this genotype is the consequence of a disrupted development of the endosperm, what could be an expression of its high level of inbreeding. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Embryo sac; Endosperm; Fruit drop; Inbreeding; Prunus dulcis; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952675425

The honey pots from each nest were homogenised and the four honey samples were analysed by melissopalynological methods, whereas the pollen pots were studied individually.

Understanding of biotic interactions may thus be skewed towards the negative, which could have important implications for ecological management and conservation. This article provides a comprehensive review of all types of impacts, both beneficial and detrimental, that can result from species translocation. An extensive review of literature on species introductions to terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems and involving a wide range of taxa (including microorganisms, parasites, plants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, fish and Crustacea) showed that, despite limited research into facilitative alien-native interactions, such interactions occur surprisingly frequently. Examples were found of introduced species acting as hosts, food sources, pollinators or seed dispersers for native species, as well as providing herbivory, predatory or parasite release. However, research showed that numerous negative interactions also occurred and combination impacts (when an alien benefits some natives but disadvantages others) were common. In many cases, the traditional view that biological invasions constitute a significant threat to native biota is both accurate and appropriate. Efforts to prevent translocation and control non-native species can be vital. However, the ""native good, alien bad"" maxim does not convey the complexity of invasion ecology: alien species do not axiomatically pose a threat to native biota. In order to move understanding of invasion ecology forward and to develop maximally-effective management strategies, facilitative alien-native interactions need to be added into the alien species debate.",Contemporary evolution; Facilitative interactions; Non-native species; Species introductions; Translocations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953846483

Warming in the region in the past century was around 0.5°C, slightly lower than the global average of 0.7°C, while rainfall has remained the same. It is projected that the warming trend will continue for the next two centuries, while precipitation will increase slightly, and soil moisture level will decrease. We identify a number of threats due to climate changes to orchid community in the Yachang Orchid Nature Reserve in Guangxi (hereafter refer to as Yachang Reserve), a good representative of the region. Firstly, decreased soil moisture is likely to have a negative effect on growth and survival of orchids, especially terrestrial and saprophytic ones. Sixty eight (50%) orchid species in the Yachang Reserve are in this category. Secondly, the greater majority of the orchids in Yachang Reserve (72%) have populations on or close to the limestone mountain tops. These populations are likely to shrink or even become extinct as the warming continues because they have no higher places to which they are able to migrate. Natural poleward migration is unlikely for these populations because of the complex terrain, small size of the reserve and human-dominated surroundings. Species with narrow distributions (14%) and/or small population sizes (46%) will be the most vulnerable. In addition, populations represent the southern limit of the species (24%) are also prone to local extinction. Thirdly, extreme rainfall events are projected to occur more frequently, which can exacerbate erosion. This may impact orchid populations that grow on steep cliffs. Fifty seven species (42%) of the orchids in Yachang have cliff populations. Fourthly, the majority of orchid species have specialized insect pollination systems. It is unknown whether the change or lack of change in plant phenology will be in synchrony with the potential phenological shifts of their pollinators. Fifty four (40%) orchid species in Yachang Reserve flower in the spring and are potentially subject to this threat. Finally, mycorrhizal fungi are vital for seed germination for all orchids and important for post-seedling growth for some species. Yet there is a lack of knowledge of the nature of mycorrhiza on all orchids in the region, and little is known on the responses of these vital symbiotic relationships to temperature and soil moisture. Overall, 15% of the orchid species and a quarter of the genera bear high risk of population reduction or local extinction under the current projection of climate change.

In species with highly patchy spatial distributions, genetic drift can overwhelm balancing selection and cause stochastic loss of S-alleles. Natural selection may favor the breakdown of SI in populations with few S-alleles because low S-allele diversity constrains the seed production of self-incompatible plants. We estimated S-allele diversity, effective population sizes, and migration rates in Leavenworthia alabamica, a self-incompatible mustard species restricted to discrete habitat patches in rocky glades. Patterns of polymorphism were investigated at the S-locus and 15 neutral microsatellites in three large and three small populations with 100-fold variation in glade size. Populations on larger glades maintained more S-alleles, but all populations were estimated to harbor at least 20 S-alleles, and mate availabilities typically exceeded 0.80, which is consistent with little mate limitation in nature. Estimates of the effective size (Ne) in each population ranged from 600 to 1600, and estimated rates of migration (m) ranged from 3 × 10-4 to nearly 1 × 10-3. According to theoretical models, there is limited opportunity for genetic drift to reduce S-allele diversity in populations with these attributes. Although pollinators or resources limit seed production in small glades, limited S-allele diversity does not appear to be a factor promoting the incipient breakdown of SI in populations of this species that were studied. © 2010 The Author(s).

These organisms can disperse between non-crop habitats and crops and can benefit from resources in non-crop areas. Thus, it may be important to conserve non-crop habitats to maintain ecosystem services within crops. However, even single ecosystem services, such as pollination or prédation of pests, may be provided by a complex of species. Different species may respond to landscape structure at differing spatial scales. This raises the question: What scales should conservation take place at to sustain an ecosystem service? Here, we examine variation in predation of two potato pests in response to landscape structure. Specifically, predation of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, were quantified in potato and field-margin habitats set in landscapes that varied at different scales. At a local scale (meters), potato fields of different sizes were bordered by different areas of grassy field margin. At a broad scale (kilometers), these habitats were set in landscapes composed of varying percentages of non-crop habitat. Predation of both pests was associated with landscape structure, but this relationship occurred at different scales for each pest and interacted differently with habitat type. Predation of L. decemlineata eggs was greater in field margins than in the potato crop and increased in both habitats when field margins were large relative to potatoes. In contrast, aphid predation in field margins increased with the area of non-crop habitat within 1.5 km, but did not change in adjacent potato. These data emphasize that, even a single ecosystem service, such as predation of pests, can be influenced by landscape structure at multiple scales. More generally, it may be necessary to conserve heterogeneity both at local scales (individual farm fields) and broad scales (entire mosaic landscapes) to maintain ecosystem services. This may be especially true for ecosystem, services that are the aggregate result of the actions of many species or ecological processes. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Agricultural environmental schemes; Colorado potato beetle; Conservation biological control; Dation; Ecosystem services; Field borders; Green peach aphid; Landscape context; Leptinotarsa decemlineata; Myzus persicae; Pré; Spatial scale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953158269

The silencing cassettes containing the fragments of these genes in the sense and antisense orientations were cloned into the pMCG161 binary vector and used for Agrobacterium-based transformation. Out of the five cultivars representing the three studied species, transgenic plants were obtained from one barley cultivar Golden Promise, one wheat cultivar Kontesa, and one triticale cultivar Wanad. Almost 80% of 52 regenerated lines of Golden Promise exhibited significantly decreased cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) enzyme activity in bulked samples of their T1 roots. There was a positive correlation between the enzyme activity and the plant productivity, expressed as the yield, the number of seeds per plant, and the 1000 grain weight. Additionally, these traits were associated with a greater root mass. Lower CKX activity led to a higher plant yield and root weight. This higher plant productivity and altered plant architecture were maintained in a population of segregating T1 plants. The levels of HvCKX1 transcript accumulation were measured in various tissues of Golden Promise and Scarlett non-transgenic barley plants in order to choose the most appropriate plant organs to study the expression and/or silencing of the gene in those transgenic lines. The highest levels of the HvCKX1 transcript were detected in spikes 0 days after pollination (0 DAP), 7 DAP, and 14 DAP, and in the seedling roots. The analysis of HvCKX1 gene expression and CKX enzyme activity and the evaluation of the phenotype were performed in the progeny of seven selected transgenic T1 lines. The relative expression of HvCKX1 measured in the spikes 0 DAP and 14 DAP, respectively, ranged from 0.52±0.04 to 1.15±0.26 and from 0.47±0.07 to 0.89±0.15. The lowest relative values were obtained for the enzyme activity in the spikes at 0 DAP, which ranged from 0.15±0.02 to 1.05±0.14 per single progeny plant. Based on these three values, the coefficient of HvCKX1 silencing in the spikes was estimated. Possible mechanisms leading to higher plant productivity via the silencing of HvCKX1 and a decrease in CKX enzyme activity are discussed. © 2010 The Author(s).",Barley; CKX; Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase; High productivity; HvCKX1; RNAi; Roots; Silencing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951127638

We quantified rust infection in populations of jewelweed; its effect on host mating system, potential biotic and abiotic correlates of infection; and spatial patterns within populations. Jewelweed (Impatiens capensis) is a woodland annual that can become infected with the heteroecious rust, Puccinia recondita, whose alternate hosts are often grasses. It produces dimorphic self-pollinated cleistogamous (CL) flowers and open-pollinated chasmogamous (CH) flowers. Infected plants may have fewer resources, so we predicted a decrease in CH flowering relative to that of uninfected plants. Infection occurred early in the growing season and disappeared by midsummer, although plants continued to grow and flower until the frost. We found no clustering of infection within populations. Infection prevalence did not vary among sites in 2005, but one site had more disease in 2004 than in 2005. Rust infection showed negative host density dependence, which is unusual for most pathogens but not unexpected for heterocyclic rusts. Infection decreased host fitness but increased proportional allocation to CH flowering, potentially increasing the production of resistant offspring by susceptible plants. These results indicate that disease varies over time and with host density and can affect host fitness and mating system. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

Deceptive species are a characteristic trait of insect-plant mutualisms. Deception of pollinators is essential for reproduction in diverse plant species; however, mimicry in seed dispersal is almost unknown. Myrmecochory, the dispersal of diaspores by ants, is a mutualism in which the elaiosome, a lipid-rich seed appendage, works as an ant reward. This coevolved interaction may be exploited by cheating, non-rewarding diaspores that mimic elaiosomes. 2. Our study assesses the impact of the morphology and fatty acid composition of diaspores on ant dispersal in rewarding and cheating myrmecochores and non-myrmecochorous species. Four elaiosome types (defined by Sernander 1906) were included in our research: the 'Viola odorata type', with a clearly defined elaiosome, the similar but diplochorous 'Euphorbia type' with an additional ballistic dispersal of diaspores, and the 'Puschkinia' and 'Hepatica' types, which we classify as 'cheaters' as they mimic ant rewards by chemical cues. 3. We tested the influence of morphology, chemical composition of diaspores and presence of rewards on removal rates of diaspores, dummies impregnated with seed extracts and pure fatty acids and scent-standardized diaspores in a population of Formica polyctena ants with 10 European spring ephemerals, mostly Ranunculaceae. The main free fatty acids of diaspores were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis. 4. Removal rates of diaspores and dummies treated with seed extracts were significantly influenced by their fatty acid composition. Discriminant function analysis confirmed oleic acid as the main trigger substance eliciting seed-removal behaviour by ants in most species. Oleic acid content and removal rates differed among elaiosome types and were highest in rewarding myrmecochores, lower in cheaters and smallest in non-myrmecochorous seeds. Removal rates of scent-standardized diaspores did not differ among mutualists and cheaters suggesting a selective pressure for morphological adaptation and were lowest in non-myrmecochorous species, thus corroborating an influence of diaspore morphology on ant-removal patterns. 5. For the first time, we demonstrate chemical mimicry in myrmecochory as a means of seed dispersal. Evolutionary stability of the ant-seed mutualism is maintained by the ability of ants to discriminate between certain types of rewards and to respond with differential diaspore distribution rates. © 2009 The Authors.

Upon arrival at the female gametophyte two sperm cells are discharged into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization. The first players involved in inter-gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes and to arrest their growth have been recently identified. In contrast the physiological mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and thus sperm discharge remained elusive. Here, we describe the role of polymorphic defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins ZmES1-4 (Zea mays embryo sac) from maize, leading to pollen tube growth arrest, burst, and explosive sperm release. ZmES1-4 genes are exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte. ZmES4-GFP fusion proteins accumulate in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells and are released during the fertilization process. Using RNAi knock-down and synthetic ZmES4 proteins, we found that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. Pollen tube plasma membrane depolarization, which occurs immediately after ZmES4 application, as well as channel blocker experiments point to a role of K+-influx in the pollen tube rupture mechanism. Finally, we discovered the intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1 as a direct target of ZmES4. Following ZmES4 application, KZM1 opens at physiological membrane potentials and closes after wash-out. In conclusion, we suggest that vesicles containing ZmES4 are released from the synergid cells upon male-female gametophyte signaling. Subsequent interaction between ZmES4 and KZM1 results in channel opening and K+ influx. We further suggest that K+ influx leads to water uptake and culminates in osmotic tube burst. The species-preferential activity of polymorphic ZmES4 indicates that the mechanism described represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants. © 2010 Amien et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954697561

Some natural enemies are there all year, others recolonise with each new crop. Most make their living for some part of the year in other crops and non-crop vegetation. However, some natural enemies, particularly parasitoids, are quite specific about what they will eat. To get the most out of natural pest control, the farmer needs the right natural enemies to be around when their worst pests are. While these invertebrates are an obvious feature of any environment, what is not so obvious is that each of these species is part of a complex network of hundreds of species all interacting with one another in a variety of ways. Even species that seem relatively isolated from one another in time and space are caught up in this 'tangled web'. These interactions between species are important because they are essential to the proper functioning of the ecosystem. They form the basis of processes such as pollination, natural pest control, waste decomposition and seed dispersal. These all come under the umbrella of ecosystem services, the products of nature that contribute to human well-being. These benefits can be wide ranging but, from the point of view of food webs, pest control and pollination are two that are important to farmers. The activities of beneficial invertebrates such as predators (for example spiders and ladybirds) and parasitic wasps that are already present in crops and other on-farm vegetation can help suppress pest populations. While it is obvious that a predator might eat a pest, the extent to which natural pest control occurs depends on many factors - what crop is being grown where, what permanent vegetation is around, how much and what types of insecticide are used and the weather. © 2010 Research Information Ltd.",Beneficials; Broad acre; Broad-acre; Canola; Crop; Crops; Ecosystem; Ecosystem services; Food web; Insecticide; Interactions; Invertebrates; Natural enemies; Non-crop; Parasites; Pest control; Pests; Populations; Predators; Vegetation; Web,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953860548

In most species, SI is under the control of a complex, multiallelic S-locus. The recognition system is associated with quantitative variations of the strength of the SI reaction; the origin of these variations is still not elucidated. To define the genetic regulations involved, we studied the variability of the SI response in homozygous S15S15 plants in cauliflower. These plants were obtained from a self-progeny of a self-compatible (SC) plant heterozygous for S15, which was generated after five selfing generations from one strongly self-incompatible initial plant. We found a continuous phenotypic variation for SI response in the offspring plants homozygous for the S15 haplotype, from the strict SI reaction to self-compatibility, with a great proportion of the plants being partially self-compatible (PSC). Decrease in SI levels was also observed during the life of the flower. The number of pollen tubes passing through the stigma barrier was higher when counted 3 or 5 days after pollination than one day after pollination. Analysis of the expression of the two key genes regulating self-pollen recognition in cauliflower, the S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) and S-locus cysteine-rich (SCR/SP11) genes, revealed that self-compatibility or PSC was associated with decreased SRK or SCR/SP11 expression. Our work shows the particularly high level of phenotypic plasticity of the SI response associated with certain S-haplotypes in cauliflower. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Brassica oleracea Partial-self-incompatibility; S15 haplotype,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952671761

In both study areas, the seasons of chestnut pollination were similar and lasted from June to the end of July, which is comparable to other European cities. A general rule was noticed - the shorter the main pollen season, the higher the pollen peak concentration. Although the pollen season of Fagales pollen is prolonged to summer in the area of inland west-north Croatia due to the genus Castanea summer pollination, the number of days with pollen air concentration higher than 50 per m 3 was low and was not likely to have any major effects in allergic individuals. Airborne pollen concentration of Castanea showed positive statistically significant correlation with air temperature and negative non-significant correlation with precipitation.

A greenhouse experiment was carried out to determine yield, growth, fruit quality, net photosynthesis (ACO2), electrolyte leakage, and mineral composition of two cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) genotypes (hybrid ""Ekron"" or open-pollinated variety ""Marketmore"") with inoculated and noninoculated arbuscular mycorrhizal biofertilizer. Plants were supplied with nutrient solutions at two pH values (6.0 or 8.1). The high pH nutrient solution had the same basic composition with an additional 10 mM NaHCO3 and 0.5 g l-1 CaCO3. The percentage root colonization was higher in ""Marketmore"" (21.8%) than ""Ekron"" (12.7%). Total and marketable yield and total biomass were significantly higher by 189%, 213%, and 77%, respectively, with Ekron in comparison to those recorded with Marketmore. The highest crop performance with Ekron in comparison to Marketmore was due to the improved nutritional status (higher N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and B), higher leaf area, and net photosynthesis. Increasing the concentration of NaHCO3 from 0 to 10 mM in the nutrient solution significantly decreased yield, plant growth, ACO2, N, P, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, and B concentration in leaf tissue, whereas the electrolyte leakage increased. The inoculated plants under alkaline conditions had higher total, marketable yield, and total biomass than noninoculated plant. Mycorrhizal cucumber plants grown under alkaline conditions had a higher macronutrient concentration in leaf tissue compared to noninoculated plants. The highest yield and biomass production in inoculated plants seems to be related to the capacity of maintaining higher net ACO2 and to a better nutritional status (high P, K, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Mn and low Na accumulation) in response to bicarbonate stress with respect to -AM plants. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Arbuscular mycorrhizal; Cucumis sativus L.; Genotypes; Net photosynthesis; Nutritional status; pH level,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952674050

In jojoba, the development of molecular strategies for the identification of sexes at early stages has been a priority in plantations and breeding programs. Two previous studies reported two candidate male-specific jojoba DNA markers. However, present study indicated that these markers were not useful in jojoba sex identification. A reliable gender diagnostic marker for jojoba is, therefore, needed.

The ovary of cultured pollinated spikelets grew rapidly and developed into fruits with an embryo and endosperm. When unpollinated spikelets were cultured on a medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, parthenocarpic fruits lacking an embryo and endosperm developed. The number and size of the cells in the pericarp of parthenocarpic fruits were almost identical to those of fruits induced by pollination, and degeneration of nucellus tissue was observed in both pollinated and parthenocarpic fruits. These results suggested that ovary growth was induced through increased auxin content in the spikelets. Quantitative measurement of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content in the spikelets indicated that the IAA level increased after pollination. Further analysis of IAA contents in the ovary and rachilla-pedicel of cultured spikelets suggested that fruit development is associated with IAA synthesis in the ovary following pollination/fertilization and subsequent transport of IAA from the ovary to the rachilla-pedicel. Partial or complete removal of the rachilla and/or pedicel prior to spikelet culture greatly inhibited fruit development. These results indicated that the rachilla and pedicel are essential for rice fruit development.

The commercially important bahiagrass cultivar 'Argentine' is preferred for genetic transformation over sexual diploid cytotypes, since it produces uniform seed progeny through apomixis. Pseudogamous apomictic seed production in Argentine bahiagrass may contribute to transgene confinement. It is characterized by embryo development which is independent of fertilization of the egg cell, but requires fertilization with compatible pollen to produce the endosperm. Pollen-mediated gene transfer from transgenic, glufosinate-resistant apomictic bahiagrass as pollen donor at close proximity (0.5-3. 5 m) with non-transgenic sexual or apomictic bahiagrass cultivars as pollen receptors was evaluated under field conditions. Hybridization frequency was evaluated by glufosinate herbicide resistance in >23,300 seedlings derived from open-pollinated (OP) pollen receptor plants. Average gene transfer between transgenic apomictic, tetraploid and sexual diploid bahiagrass was 0. 03%. Herbicide-resistant hybrids confirmed by immuno-chromatographic detection of the PAT protein displayed a single copy bar gene identical to the pollen parent. Hybrids resulting from diploid pollen receptors were confirmed as triploids or aneu-triploids with significantly reduced vigor and seed set as compared to the parents. Transmission of transgenes to sexual bahiagrass is severely restricted by the ploidy difference between tetraploid apomicts and diploid sexual bahiagrass. Average gene transfer between transgenic apomictic tetraploid and non-transgenic, apomictic tetraploid bahiagrass was 0.17%, confirming a very low frequency of amphimixis in apomictic bahiagrass cultivars. While not providing complete transgene containment, gene transfer between transgenic apomictic and non-transgenic bahiagrass occurs at a much lower frequency than reported for other cross-pollinating or facultative apomictic grasses. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649634325

We searched for molecular markers that could be polymorphic in relation to flowering time in order to classify male kiwifruit plants to discard those that are not likely to perform as efficient pollen donors. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and modified amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were generated using 41 male kiwifruit plants in two flowering groups, early- and late-flowering males (with respect to the female cultivar 'Hayward'). One RAPD and nine modified-AFLP markers polymorphic between male plants exhibiting different flowering time were identified, sequenced and analysed in databases. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) clustering and multidimensional scaling showed that these markers could be used to classify the male plants into flowering groups. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) agreed with this classification, showing that most of the genetic variation is found between flowering groups. Sequence analysis based on a database search revealed that the polymorphism PolM contains a 7-nucleotide long element involved in the repression of the phytochrome A gene, that Pol4 is a partial sequence of a phytochrome B gene, and that sequences Pol3, Pol5, Pol7, and Pol9 show high identity with ESTs from kiwifruit buds treated with hydrogen cyanamide. Clustering analysis supported the previous classification of males into flowering groups, making it feasible to predict male plants' flowering times with respect to the cultivar 'Hayward' based upon these molecular markers. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Flowering time; Kiwifruit; Marker assisted selection; Modified-AFLP; Molecular markers; RAPD,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955176008

Samples were extracted with 2% triethylamine (TEA) in acetonitrile (ACN) followed by salting out, solid phase extraction (SPE) cleanup, and detection using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method was validated in triplicate at three fortification concentrations in each matrix. Good recoveries were observed for most analytes and ranged between 70 and 120% with relative standard deviations between replicates of <20% in most cases. The method limits of detection were 0.2 ng/g for the parent neonicotinoid pesticides and ranged between 0.2 and 15 ng/g for the neonicotinoid metabolites. This refined method provides lower detection limits and improved recovery of neonicotinoids and their metabolites, which will help researchers evaluate subchronic effects of these pesticides, address data gaps related to colony collapse disorder (CCD), and determine the role of pesticides in pollinator decline. © This article not subject to U.S. Copyright.

We performed extensive progeny tests and identified two fertility restorer lines ('R171' and 'R121') for this new CMS. Two F1 hybrid populations were self-pollinated and backcrossed to produce F2 and BC populations. Inheritance patterns of male-sterility in segregating populations varied depending on paternal lines. Segregation of male-sterility in F2 populations originating from the cross between MS19 and R121 showed that a single locus was involved in fertility restoration. However, populations originating from the cross between MS15 and R171 showed the involvement of more than one restorer-of-fertility genes. The single fertility restorer locus identified in the cross between MS19 and R121 was designated Rfd1 locus. Bulked segregant analysis was performed using RAPD and AFLP, which identified one marker each. Both RAPD and AFLP markers were converted into simple PCR-based co-dominant markers after their isolated flanking sequences were analyzed. Indels 773-bp and 67-bp in length were identified between two Rfd1 allele-linked flanking sequences of the RAPD and AFLP fragments, respectively, then utilized to develop simple PCR markers. In addition, we prove that the newly identified Rfd1 locus is independent of the Rfo locus, another radish fertility restorer for CMS caused by Ogura cytoplasm. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cytoplasmic male-sterility; DCGMS cytotype; Molecular markers; Radish (Raphanus sativus L.); Restorer-of-fertility genes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955175328

Using greenhouse and common garden experiments, we investigated the strength of post-pollination barriers that restrict or prevent gene flow between two subspecies of Antirrhinum: Antirrhinum majus pseudomajus and A. m. striatum. The two are distributed parapatrically but share the same major pollinators (bumblebees), and form narrow hybrid zone in many areas of southern France and northern Spain where they come into close contact. We assessed the strength and symmetry of mating barriers and their homogeneity among populations by comparing fruit set, seed set and offspring performances between intra- and inter-subspecific crosses performed in parental and hybrid populations. Although all populations showed high levels of self-incompatibility, we found very little evidence for barriers to gene flow once pollen had been transferred to the stigma. We suggest that reproductive isolation in this system mostly involves barriers related to processes occurring before pollination, with little or no role of post-pollination barriers. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Antirrhinum; Hybridization; Pollinator sharing; Post-pollination barriers; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953480615

The orchids mimic the sex pheromone of receptive female insects, mainly hymenopterans, in order to attract males seeking to copulate. Most Ophrys species have achromatic flowers, but some exhibit a coloured perianth and a bright, conspicuous labellum pattern. We recently showed that the pink perianth of Ophrys heldreichii flowers increases detectability by its pollinator, males of the long-horned bee Eucera berlandi. Here we tested the hypothesis that the bright, complex labellum pattern mimics the female of the pollinator to increase attractiveness toward males. In a dual-choice test we offered E. berlandi males an O. heldreichii flower and a flower from O. dictynnae, which also exhibits a pinkish perianth but no conspicuous labellum pattern. Both flowers were housed in UV-transmitting acrylic glass boxes to exclude olfactory signals. Males significantly preferred O. heldreichii to O. dictynnae flowers. In a second experiment, we replaced the perianth of both flowers with identical artificial perianths made from pink card, so that only the labellum differed between the two flower stimuli. Males then chose between both stimuli at random, suggesting that the presence of a labellum pattern does not affect their choice. Spectral measurements revealed higher colour contrast with the background of the perianth of O. heldreichii compared to O. dictynnae, but no difference in green receptor-specific contrast or brightness. Our results show that male choice is guided by the chromatic contrast of the perianth during the initial flower approach but is not affected by the presence of a labellum pattern. Instead, we hypothesise that the labellum pattern is involved in aversive learning during post-copulatory behaviour and used by the orchid as a strategy to increase outcrossing. © 2010 The Author(s).",Colour vision; Object detection; Ophrys heldreichii; Pollination; Sexual deception; Signal evolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956650751

Here, we use published data and new data for species of Juncus and Luzula (Juncaceae) to test the hypotheses that, in wind-pollinated species, woody perennials should exhibit larger pollen-ovule (P/O) ratios than herbaceous species and that species with separate sexes have larger P/O ratios than homoecious species. In total, we report pollen and ovule production for 291 wind-pollinated species, including 19 Juncus and 5 Luzula species. Compared with other wind-pollinated species, Juncus exhibits unusually low P/O ratios (log P/O = 2.06 ± 0.46) because of high ovule production. We argue that the high ovule and seed production in Juncus, associated with frequent self-fertilization, may be beneficial in habitats preferred by the genus. In general, we found higher P/O ratios in woody perennials (log P/O = 4.37 ± 1.18) or in species with separate sexes (log P/O = 4.28 ± 1.12) than in herbaceous (log P/O = 3.51 ± 0.77) or homoecious (log P/O = 3.52 ± 0.80) species, respectively. However, when we analyzed woody perennials separately, we found no significant difference in P/O ratios between homoecious and nonhomoecious species. We argue that woody perennials, independent of dicliny, may be preferentially outcrossed and therefore exhibit decreased variation in mating systems compared with herbs. Because the degree of outcrossing correlates with P/O ratios, differences between homoecious and nonhomoecious woody perennials could be less pronounced. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Juncaceae; Juncus; Life history; Mating system; Pollen-ovule ratios; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953477510

In contrast, Phaius delavayi, an alpine plant endemic to temperate zones of China, is strictly pollinator dependent. Only female workers and males of the bumblebee species B. hypnorum and B. lepidus are effective pollinators. The pollinaria are deposited on top of the head or the prothorax of the pollinators. The different depositions of pollinaria are regarded as an adaptation of the chamber dimensions of the flower to the size of the pollinator. The natural fruit set reported here (24.6-37.1%) suggests that pollination is successful in the deceptive P. delavayi. The yellow perianth and sweet floral scent of P. delavayi are important cues in attracting pollinators, while flowering time and mass population are associated with the process of ""learning and avoidance"" of the rewardless flowers. This orchid, therefore, employs a deceptive pollination strategy with diverse pollinators and pollinaria depositions rather than autogamy as do its congeners. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Deceptive pollination; Functional morphology; Phaius delavayi; Pollinaria deposition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953480645

Before flowering, the treated spikes were emasculated and bagged. After 2-3 d, the emasculated flowerets were pollinated using pollens from T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. One plant with two translocation chromosomes involved in both the long and short arm of 5Lr was detected in the M1 by GISH. The plant was crossed with line DA5Lr, and its progenies with one 5Lr and two translocation chromosomes were analyzed for chromosome pairing behavior in their pollen mother cells (PMCs). A cross-shaped configuration at diplonema and Z-shaped or ring-shaped quadrivalent configuration at metaphase I were observed, indicating that the two translocation chromosomes were reciprocal translocation. Chromosome C-banding indicated that the wheat chromosomes involved in the reciprocal translocation belonged to A- or D-genome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using pSc119.2 and pAs1 as the probe found that only pAs1 signals were present in the wheat chromosome segments of the two translocation chromosomes. Combining these results, the reciprocal chromosomal translocation was designated as T7DS·5LrL/5LrS·7DL. The two translocation chromosomes were found to be transmitted together in the gametes of heterozygous reciprocal translocation plants with the transmission ratios of 59.4% in the female gametes and 83.9% in the male gametes, revealing preferential pollen transmission. In the self-fertilized progenies of the heterozygous reciprocal translocation, a line with the homozygous translocation line with a pair of translocation chromosome T7DS·5LrL was identified.

However, we did not detect this compound at a nearby rainforest. Estragole is a known attractant of the African oil palm weevil (Elaeidobius kamerunicus), which pollinates oil palms (Elaeis guineensis). There has been recent interest in the biogenic emissions of estragole but it is normally not included in atmospheric models of biogenic emissions and atmospheric chemistry despite its relatively high potential for secondary organic aerosol formation from photooxidation and high reactivity with OH radical. We report the first direct canopy-scale measurements of estragole fluxes from tropical oil palms by the virtual disjunct eddy covariance technique and compare them with previously reported data for estragole emissions from Ponderosa pine. Flowers, rather than leaves, appear to be the main source of estragole from oil palms; we derive a global estimate of estragole emissions from oil palm plantations of ?0.5 Tg y-1. The observed ecosystem mean fluxes (0.44 mgm-2 h-1) and mean ambient volume mixing ratios (3.0 ppbv) of estragole are the highest reported so far. The value for midday mixing ratios is not much different from the total average as, unlike other VOCs (e.g. isoprene), the main peak occurred in the evening rather than in the middle of the day. Despite this, we show that the estragole flux can be parameterised using a modified G06 algorithm for emission. However, the model underestimates the afternoon peak even though a similar approach works well for isoprene. Our measurements suggest that this biogenic compound may have an impact on regional atmospheric chemistry that previously has not been accounted for in models and could become more important in the future due to expansion of the areas of oil palm plantation. © 2010 Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952137490

We studied flowers of four Acianthera species, a genus of myophilous orchids belonging to the largest fly-pollinated orchid group Pleurothallidinae, in order to characterize the secretory structures related to their pollination mechanism. Flowers at anthesis were sampled to detect volatile compounds and nectar; samples were fixed for light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The labellum presents epidermal cells and the first mesophyll layer involved with secretory processes. Cellular characteristics of these regions associated with the occurrence of sugars allowed us to recognize them as nectaries. Some portions of the sepals also shown to be involved with secretory processes and the presence of nitrogenated volatile compounds characterize them as osmophores. The production of nectar in these species makes the occurrence of sapromyophily questionable, even though these flowers present characteristics of this floral syndrome.

In this paper, we argue that the service-providing unit (SPU) concept may help achieve this objective by promoting the systematic quantification of the key components of nature that provide services (e.g., population density of a key pollinator) and linking these with measurable outcomes for human well-being. We discuss and provide examples of the potential role of the SPU concept in improving economic valuation of ecosystem services. Further, we suggest the concept may contribute to addressing the endpoint problem, which can be defined simply as the inability of researchers to communicate the implications of environmental change in a way that is understood by a broad cross-section of society. The endpoint problem is of particular relevance to stated preference approaches, and we discuss the capacity of the SPU concept to refine these approaches. We argue that the concept enhances interdisciplinary collaboration, promoting more validated, well-informed valuation applications. It also has the potential to minimize 'warm glow effects' and put the notion of marginal changes in the provision of ecosystem services in a new light. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sugar composition in watermelon, as in all cucurbit fruits, includes sucrose, fructose and glucose. The proportions of these three sugars are determined primarily by three enzyme families: invertases, sucrose synthases (SuSys) and sucrose phosphate synthases (SPSs). The goal of the present research was to explore the process of sugar metabolism in watermelon fruits. Crosses between the domestic watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and three wild species provided a wide germplasm to explore genetic variability in sugar composition and metabolism. This survey demonstrated great genetic variability in sugar content and in the proportions of sucrose, glucose and fructose in mature fruits. Genotypes accumulating high and low percentage of sucrose provided an experimental system to study sugar metabolism in developing fruits. Insoluble invertase activity was high and constant throughout fruit development in control lines and in genotypes accumulating low levels of sucrose, while in genotypes accumulating high levels of sucrose, activity declined sharply 4 weeks after pollination. Soluble acid invertase activity was significantly lower in genotypes accumulating high levels of sucrose than in low-sucrose-accumulating genotypes. Conversely, activities of SuSy and SPS were higher in the high-sucrose-accumulating genotypes. The present results establish that, within the genus Citrullus, there are genotypes that accumulate a high percentage of sucrose in the fruit, while others accumulate high percentages of glucose and fructose. The significant negative correlation between insoluble invertase activity and fruit sucrose level suggests that sucrose accumulation is affected by both phloem unloading and sugar metabolism. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Genetic variation at microsatellite loci was used to quantify genetic structure in two wind pollinated, gravity and animal-dispersed tree species (Fagus sylvatica L. and Fagus crenata Blum.) and to derive historical estimates of gene flow. The gene dispersal distances estimated assuming effective population density to be 1/4 of the observed density were ?77 m in European beech and ?40 m in Japanese beech. Parentage analyses and a neighbourhood model approach were used to estimate contemporary patterns of seed and pollen dispersal. Our results suggest restricted seed dispersal abilities in both European beech (?s = 10.5 m) and Japanese beech (?s = 12.4 m), with an exponential shaped seed dispersal kernel. A non-negligible rate of seed immigration (ms = 27%) was detected in European beech sites but not in Japanese beech site. Pollen dispersal within studied sites also appeared limited (?p = 41.63 m in European beech and ?p = 79.4 m in Japanese beech), despite high rate of pollen immigration (mp = 68% in European beech and mp = 40% m in Japanese beech).

Five hundred and sixty trees from 129 families and three central Victorian races were sampled from an open-pollinated progeny trial in Tasmania, Australia. Acoustic wave velocity (AWV) was assessed on standing trees and sawlogs. Wedges from disks extracted from sawlogs were assessed for basic density and checking. Processed boards from 496 of the trees were assessed for board stiffness (static modulus of elasticity, MOE), and internal and surface checking. Genetic differences among races were significant for AWV and MOE traits. The Southern race had the highest mean values for these traits. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens boards could be improved through breeding. Estimated narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.85 for standing-tree AWV, 0.71 for log AWV, 0.37 for board MOE, and ranged from 0.20 to 0.52 for checking traits. A strongly positive genetic correlation (rg = 1.05) was observed between standing-tree AWV and board MOE, indicating that AWV could be used as a selection trait to improve E. nitens board stiffness. The genetic correlation between basic density and board MOE was also positive (rg = 0.62). However, a significant and adverse genetic correlation (rg = 0.61) was identified between basic density and surface check length. Wood stiffness and checking traits were more-or-less genetically independent, and genetic correlations between surface and internal checking were positive but only moderate (rg = 0.48-0.52). © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Checking; Density; Eucalyptus nitens; Heritability; Sawn timber; Stiffness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957164875

By providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far. Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem function within intensively farmed monocultures. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Ample maturation allows prolonged storage and increases the quality of citrus fruits. The eight major volatile compounds in fresh juices from mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco var. Willow Leaf), clementine (Citrus reticulata × Citrus sinensis var. Commune), and their six cross-pollinated hybrids were quantified by gas chromatography. Mandarin juice contained the highest volatile concentration (2177. 6 ± 110. 6 mg L-1), whereas the total aromatic compounds of the hybrid and clementine juices were lower (1060. 6 ± 81. 6-1724. 2 ± 138. 5 mg L-1 and 864. 8 ± 67. 8 mg L-1, respectively).

The relative volatile concentration was higher when the juice was extracted with peel, and the juicing process induced differences in the relative volatile concentrations of between 20 and 40%. The levels of volatile compounds in the juice changed according to the degree of fruit maturity. The concentrations of the eight major juice components increased during ripening and until the commercial maturity stage when the juice was obtained from peeled fruits, whereas their concentrations increased until the post-maturation stage when the juices were produced from whole fruits.

Its pollination ecology is studied and compared among populations. Flowers of S. sennenii are distinguished by several morphological and physiological characters, including night emission of scent, which are related to nocturnal pollination. Although visited by insects at night and during day, selective insect exclusion experiments show that this plant is pollinated mainly at night. However, differences among populations are observed in visitation rates and reproductive success, which indicates that the system composed by the plant and its pollinators show evidences of disruption in some populations. The causes and consequences of this disruption are analyzed, with a focus on differences in population size, habitat quality, and genetic diversity.

Two co-dominant STS markers (BE499250 and BE591682) polymorphic for the short arm of 1V#3S and two dominant STS markers (BE518358 and BE585781) polymorphic for the long arm of 1V#3L were developed to screen a large number of progeny to identify plants that had only the 1V#3S or 1V#3L arms. Five compensating Robertsonian heterozygous translocations, two (plants #56 and #83) for the short arm (T1DL·1V#3S) and three (plants #7, #123, and #208) for the long arm (T1DS·1V#3L) were identified from 282 F2 plants and confirmed by genomic in situ hybridization and C-banding analyses. Two homozygous translocations T1DL·1V#3S (plants #14 and #39) were identified from 52 F3 plants derived from F2 plant #83. Four homozygous translocations T1DS·1V#3L (plants #3, #22, #29, and #30) were identified from 68 F3 plants derived from F2 plant #208. The homozygous translocation T1DL·1V#3S had a significantly higher (37.4 ml) and T1DS·1V#3L had significantly lower (10 ml) Zeleny sedimentation values compared to Chinese Spring wheat (30.7 ml). Our results showed that 1V#3S increased gluten strength and enhanced wheat quality, but 1V#3L decreased gluten strength and did not enhance wheat quality. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Dasypyrum villosum; Grain quality; Robertsonian translocation; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956170482

The reproduction of many plants depends on both soil N and pollination, and N may affect floral traits, such as flower number or size, which are important for pollinator attraction to plant individuals and communities. Thus, N may influence plant biomass and reproduction directly as well as indirectly via changes in pollination. The degree to which the effects of N enrichment scale from plant individuals to assemblages through emerging community-level changes in species interactions, like pollination, is relatively unknown. For 4 years, we tested how N addition to subalpine plant assemblages in Colorado, USA, affected primary productivity and species diversity, floral traits and plant-pollinator interactions, and components of female and male plant reproduction. At the community level, we found that high-N addition favoured the biomass and seed production of grasses, whereas low-N addition promoted forb growth, flower production and pollinator visitation. However, using a pollen supplementation experiment, we found no evidence that N addition altered patterns of pollen limitation of seed production. Pollinators distributed themselves evenly across floral resources such that per-flower visitation rate did not differ among N treatments. Thus, individual plants did not incur any extra benefit or cost from community-level changes in plant-pollinator interactions that resulted from N enrichment, and the effects of N on forb reproduction were direct. Synthesis. Understanding how mutualistic and antagonistic species interactions influence individual and community responses to abiotic resources may provide insight to the dominant forces structuring communities and is especially important in the context of predicting the effects of environmental change. In this case, the direct effects of N addition on plants were stronger than the indirect effects mediated through plant-pollinator interactions, thus supporting the concept of bottom-up resource limitation controlling plant response. © 2010 The Authors.

Weak directional selection for longer corollas was found in two populations with low flower-pollinator mismatch; much stronger directional selection was detected for shorter corollas in two populations with high flower-pollinator mismatch; finally, the remaining two populations with intermediate flower-pollinator mismatch showed stabilizing selection for corolla length. N. glauca populations differed in every flower character measured but variations in pollinator-mediated selection among populations were only observed for corolla length. Multiple covariation among traits was favoured, as suggested by the predominately functional patterns of integration and selection of complexes of many interacting floral traits. This was consistent with the patterns of correlational selection exhibited by four of the six populations, where corolla length was under significant selection in combination with corolla width, style length or stamen length. Overall floral integration was relatively high in all populations but phenotypic integration patterns were not clearly accounted by the degree of flower-pollinator mismatch or type of phenotypic selection, suggesting that trait covariation at the entire flower level is not explained by the current scenario of pollinator-mediated selection. © 2009 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953090934

If costs come to exceed benefits as population density or the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits and costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools for predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently, most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed-consumer mutualisms, such as the yucca moth-yucca interaction. There, benefits to female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the flower's ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak in seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most plant-pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction frequency remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit and cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator-plant interactions, and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of relationships between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction frequency. We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit curves to measures of female reproductive success for three typical pollination mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose the most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator mutualisms, as well as the challenges that lie ahead for disentangling the underlying benefit and cost curves for typical pollination mutualisms. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Benefits and costs of mutualism; Density dependence; Interaction frequency; Nectar robbery; Pollinating seed-consumer mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951803263

Decreasing habitat quality and quantity caused by fragmentation may lead to a disruption of plant-pollinator interactions and to a reduction in sexual reproduction in plant species. We conducted a 6-year field experiment to investigate the effects of small-scale fragmentation on plant-pollinator interactions and genetic diversity in the self-compatible Betonica officinalis. We examined the abundance and composition of pollinators, the foraging behaviour of bumblebees and the performance, outcrossing rate and genetic diversity of B. officinalis after 2 and 6 years in experimentally fragmented nutrient-poor, calcareous grassland in the northern Swiss Jura mountains. Fragments of different size (2.25 and 20.25 m2) were isolated by a 5-m-wide strip of frequently mown vegetation. Control plots of corresponding size were situated in adjacent undisturbed grassland. Experimental grassland fragmentation altered the composition of B. officinalis pollinators and reduced their flower visitation rate. Furthermore, the foraging behaviour of bumblebees was changed in the fragments. After 6 years of fragmentation seed weight was higher in fragments than in control plots. However, the densities of B. officinalis rosettes and inflorescences, plant height and inflorescence length were not affected by fragmentation. The outcrossing frequency of B. officinalis growing in fragments was reduced by 15% after 2 years and by 33% after 6 years of experimental fragmentation. This resulted in a significant reduction of the genetic diversity in seedlings emerging in fragments after 6 years. Our study shows that small-scale habitat fragmentation can disturb the interaction between B. officinalis and pollinators resulting in a reduced outcrossing frequency and genetic diversity in plants growing in fragments. However, the response to fragmentation was considerably delayed. This finding strengthens the claim for long-term field experiments with proper replications and controls to assess delayed effects of habitat fragmentation. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Betonica officinalis; Genetic diversity; Outcrossing frequency; Pollinator foraging behaviour; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950990263

However, the exact sequence of evolutionary events that led to such great diversity in floral traits is unknown for most plant groups. Here, we characterize the patterns of evolution of individual floral traits and overall floral morphologies in the tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae). We identified 12 discrete traits that are associated with seven floral types previously described for the group and used a penalized likelihood tree of the tribe to reconstruct the ancestral states of those traits at all nodes of the phylogeny of Bignonieae. In addition, evolutionary correlations among traits were conducted using a maximum likelihood approach to test whether the evolution of individual floral traits followed the correlated patterns of evolution expected under the ""pollination syndrome"" concept. The ancestral Bignonieae flower presented an Anemopaegma-type morphology, which was followed by several parallel shifts in floral morphologies. Those shifts occurred through intermediate stages resulting in mixed floral morphologies as well as directly from the Anemopaegma -type morphology to other floral types. Positive and negative evolutionary correlations among traits fit patterns expected under the pollination syndrome perspective, suggesting that interactions between Bignonieae flowers and pollinators likely played important roles in the diversification of the group as a whole. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Bignonieae; Discrete traits; Evolutionary correlations; Evolutionary specialization; Floral traits; Morphological transitions; Pollinator shifts,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952382818

Hybrid (HY) canola (Brassica napus L.) produces a higher seed yield than open-pollinated (OP) canola. While it is expected higher-yielding HY canola may require higher total available nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), the evidence is not conclusive. This study used canola yield data from several site-years and fertility experiments to determine whether HY and OP canola types require different rates of total available N (TAN) and total available phosphorus (TAP). The yield response of the two canola genotypes to TAP was the same, but for TAN the yield response was greater for HY canola. The quadratic yield response results were confirmed using three plateau equations. Optimal TAN for HY canola was higher than for OP canola.

Very few pollinators were found to emerge during plant anthesis, leading to a low (if any) potential benefit through pollen dispersal. This opens the question why male plants do not also cheat their pollinators. Female plants flowered late in the season, when many males had just achieved their own anthesis, which increased the efficiency of pollen transfer. Finally, some late-flowering males reached their anthesis simultaneously with females, which open the possibility for pollinator to choose between honest males and cheating females. Nevertheless, female plants were found to produce fruits, even though fruit production was limited by pollen (and pollinator) supply, meaning that cheating was not entirely retaliated by the mutualistic partner. © 2010 The Author.

Many pollination studies report inter-annual fluctuations in the composition of pollinators to particular species. However, the factors causing such variation are still poorly understood. Here we investigate how flowering duration and plant and pollinator assemblages influenced the inter-annual changes in the functional generalization level of the 20 most common plant species of a semi-natural meadow in southern Norway. We also studied the extent to which changes in generalization levels were controlled by flower-shape and flowering time. Large inter-annual changes in generalization levels were common and there was no relationship between the generalization level one year and the following. Generalization level of particular plant species increased with flowering duration, sampling effort, and the abundance of managed honeybees in the community. Generalization level decreased with the flowering synchrony between the focal plant species and the rest of the plant community and with the focal species' own abundance, which we attribute to inter-specific competition for pollinator attraction and foraging decisions made by pollinators. Plants with different flower-shapes and flowering times did not differ in the extent of inter-annual variation in generalization levels. Most studies do not consider the effect of the plant community on the generalization level of particular plant species. We show here that both pollinator and plant assemblages can affect the inter-annual variation in generalization levels of plant species. Studies like ours will help to understand how pollination interactions are structured at the community level, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences that these inter-annual changes in generalization levels may have. © 2009 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953113916

However, whether specialized pollination requirements pose a significant barrier to plant invasions is not yet clear. Likewise, the contribution of pollinators to the fecundity of facultatively selfpollinating invasive plant species is poorly understood. We addressed these issues using the self-compatible and autonomously self-pollinating Lilium formosanum, which also has large, showy flowers that are adapted for pollination by hawk moths. We investigated the pollination of this lily-which is indigenous to Taiwan-in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where it is invasive. The long-tongued hawk moth Agrius convolvuli was identified as the primary pollinator on the basis of field observations, pollen load analysis, presence of lepidopteran scales on stigmas, and higher seed production in emasculated flowers exposed at night than in those exposed during the day. Remarkably, this moth is native to much of the Old World, including Taiwan and South Africa. Autonomous self-pollination resulted in seed production, but at a reduced level relative to the seed production of open-and hand-pollinated flowers, which was significant in one out of two populations examined. Thus, pollinators potentially contribute to invasion by increasing seed production and genetic variability through cross-pollination, although contributions of pollinators to seed set versus that of autonomous self-pollination may vary between populations. We conclude that specialized pollination requirements do not present a barrier to invasions when plants are specialized to pollinators or pollinator functional groups with very wide distributions. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

Consequently, pollinators are more likely to encounter predators when visiting the most rewarding flowers. I present a model of how different pollinator species can maximize lifetime resource gains depending on the density and distribution of predators, as well as their vulnerability to capture by predators. For pollinator species that are difficult for predators to capture, the optimal strategy is to visit the most rewarding flowers as long as predator density is low. At higher predator densities and for pollinators that are more vulnerable to predator capture, the lifetime resource gain from the most rewarding flowers declines and the optimal strategy depends on the predator distribution. In some cases, a wide range of floral rewards provides near-maximum lifetime resource gains, which may favor generalization if searching for flowers is costly. In other cases, a low flower reward level provides the maximum lifetime resource gain and so pollinators should specialize on less rewarding flowers. Thus, the model suggests that predators can have qualitatively different top-down effects on plant reproductive success depending on the pollinator species, the density of predators, and the distribution of predators across flower reward levels. © 2009 The Author.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953085109

However, as ecological conditions change through habitat loss and fragmentation, the interactions among species may evolve in new and unexpected directions. Human-induced environmental variation is likely to affect selection regimes, but as yet no empirical examples have been reported. In the study reported here, we examined the influence of human-induced habitat transformation on the composition of pollinator assemblages and, hence, pollinator-mediated selection on the flower phenotype of Viola portalesia (Violaceae). Our results indicate that pollinator assemblages differed substantially in terms of species composition and visitation rate between nearby native and transformed habitats. Similarly, the insect species that contributed most to visitation rates differed between plant populations. While the magnitude and sign of pollinator-mediated selection on flower length and width did not differ between sites, selection for flower number lost significance in the transformed habitat, and a significant pattern of disruptive selection for flower shape, undetected in the native habitat, was present in the transformed one. Overall, the results of this study suggest that human-induced habitat change may not only modify the species composition of pollinator assemblages, relaxing the selection process on some flower characters, but they may also create new opportunities for fitness-trait covariation not present in pristine conditions. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Chile; Flower; Phenotypic selection; Pollination; Ruil forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951025376

The floral neighborhood of individual plants is part of this immediate environment and affects the frequency and behavior of their pollinators. However, the interactions among plants for pollination might differ among populations because populations differ in floral densities and pollinator assemblages. Despite that, manipulative experiments of the floral neighborhood in different populations with a specific focus on pollinator behavior are still rare. Methods: We introduced mixtures of two species (Salvia farinacae and Tagetes bonanza) in two populations of Taraxacum officinale and examined their effect on pollinators' foraging behavior on Taraxacum. Key results: The effects of the heterospecific neighborhood differed among pollinator groups and between the two populations. Only honeybees consistently preferred both the most diverse (containing three species) and completely pure patches of Tarax acum in both populations. We found a strong and positive effect of patch diversity on visitation to Taraxacum in one population, whereas in the other population either no effect or a negative effect of plant diversity occurred, which we attribute to differences between populations in the ratio of pollinators to inflorescences. Pollinator visitation consistently increased with local Taraxacum density in both populations. Conclusions: Our study shows that a similar local neighborhood can differentially affect the frequency and foraging behavior of pollinators, even in closely situated populations. Experimental studies conducted in several populations would contribute to determine which factors drive the variation in pollination interactions among populations. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Competition; Composition of visits; Facilitation; Floral neighborhood; Foraging behavior; Local density; Local diversity; Salvia farinacae; Tagetes bonanza; Taraxacum officinale; Visitation rates,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952363720

The aim of the present study was, with the help of molecular markers, to examine the siring ability of self- and cross-pollen in a single clone of E. grandis, after both mixed- and single-donor pollinations, in order to confirm the presence of CSI. Single-donor cross-pollinations set a significantly higher number of seeds per flower pollinated compared to those performed with self-pollen, while there were no significant differences between the open control and single-donor self-pollinations. Molecular markers revealed that 100% of the progeny from mixed-donor pollinations were outcrossed, confirming the competitive advantage of cross-pollen. In addition, there was a significant change in the self:outcross seed ratio between single- and mixed-donor pollinations, suggesting that the observed deficit of selfed seeds in mixed-donor fruits could be the result of differential pollen tube growth. From the extremely low seed yields following single-donor self-pollinations, it is clear that an additional incompatibility mechanism is operating in E. grandis, and this is suggested to be late-acting self-incompatibility, acting before fertilisation. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.",Cryptic self-incompatibility; Eucalyptus grandis; Late-acting self-incompatibility; Mixed-pollinations; Self-pollinations; Single-donor pollinations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650366865

In trials where pollination was 100%, these two reproductive components showed the same trend, but less dramatically. This may support the idea that the trade-offs would be more pronounced when the resource was scarce. Besides, a higher inflorescence production with a lower fruit reproduction occurred as a consequence of decreased pollination level. This increased inflorescence production may be a mechanism to promote outcrossing by enhancing floral attraction or by synchronizing reproductive activity with insect pollinators. Examination for possible trade-offs in resource allocation revealed that there was also a trade-off caused by pollination between fruits plus flowers and bulbils production, which might have detrimental effects on the survival of individuals and populations, but promotes outcrossing and genetic variability. © 2009 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Pollination; Resource allocation; Sagittaria potamogetifolia; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952422617

Selfing in synchronous monocarps may provide reproductive assurance but conflict with the benefits of outcrossing, a key evolutionary driver of synchrony. We predicted that animal-pollinated species with synchronous flowering would have unspecialised flowers and attract abundant generalised pollinators, but predictions for selfing and outcrossing frequencies were not obvious. We examined the pollination biology of Isoglossa woodii (Acanthaceae), an insect-pollinated, monocarpic herb that flowers synchronously at 4-7-year intervals. The most frequent visitor to I. woodii flowers was the African honeybee, Apis mellifera adansonii. Hand-pollination failed to enhance seed production, indicating that the pollinators were not saturated. No seed was set in the absence of pollinators. Seed set was similar among selfed and outcrossed flowers, demonstrating a geitonogamous mixed-mating strategy with no direct evidence of preferential outcrossing. Flowers contained four ovules, but most fruits only developed one seed, raising the possibility that preferential outcrossing occurs by post-pollination processes.

This allows the exact distance and trajectory of successful pollen to be traced to characterize pollination patterns. Parentage assignment of established seedlings also allows researchers to accurately determine how far new recruits have traveled from their seed parent. This paper reviews the history and development of molecular parentage assignment in studies of native plants, as well as the limitations and constraints to this approach. This paper also reviews 53 articles published in the past 15 years that use parentage assignment to study pollination and seed dispersal in native plants. These parentage studies have overturned many common assumptions regarding pollen and seed dispersal patterns. They show that long-distance dispersal of pollen is common in both wind and animal dispersed systems, with average pollination distances commonly being hundreds of meters. The pollination neighborhood is often extremely large, and simple dispersal functions based on distance alone fail to make accurate predictions of pollination. Rather than hindering gene flow, fragmentation and isolation sometimes, and perhaps even commonly, results in increased pollination distances. Studies of seed dispersal using parentage assignment have also yielded some surprises. We now know that it may be erroneous to assume that seeds growing under the crown of a conspecific adult are growing beneath their mother, or that seed dispersal distances are more limited than pollen dispersal distances. Taken together, the studies to date demonstrate that both seed and pollen dispersal are quite complex phenomena influenced by many ecological processes. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",DNA markers; Microsatellites; Paternity assignment; Pollen dispersal; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952491597

We used spatially explicit neighborhood models together with data from 10 0.5-ha mapped census plots in a fragmented landscape spanning 1000 km2 to (1) evaluate the relative importance of seed production, dispersal, and safe-site limitation for the recruitment of the understory herb Heliconia acuminata; and (2) determine how these processes differ between fragments and continuous forests. Our analyses demonstrated a large degree of variation in seed production, dispersal, and establishment among and within the 10 study plots. Seed production limitation was strong but only at small spatial scales. Average dispersal distance was less than 4 m, leading to severe dispersal limitation at most sites. Overall, safe-site limitation was the most important constraint on seedling establishment. Fragmentation led to a more heterogeneous light environment with negative consequences for seedling establishment but had little effect on seed production or dispersal. These results suggest that the effects of fragmentation on abiotic processes may be more important than the disruption of biotic interactions in driving biodiversity loss in tropical forests, at least for some functional groups. These effects may be common when the matrix surrounding fragments contains enough tree cover to enable movement of dispersere and pollinators. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Amazonian forest; Heliconia acuminata; Landscape modification; Safe-site limitation; Seed limitation; Seedling recruitment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951787111

Here we report an unusual kind of distyly associated with self- and/or intramorph compatibility in a perennial herb, Hedyotis acutangula. Floral morphology, ancillary dimorphisms and compatibility of the two morphs were studied. H. acutangula did not exhibit precise reciprocal herkogamy, but this did not affect the equality of floral morphs in the population, as usually found in distylous plants. Both pin and thrum pollen retained relatively high viability for 8 h. The pollen to ovule ratio was 72.5 in pin flowers and 54.4 in thrum flowers. Pistils of pin flowers remained receptive for longer than those of thrum flowers. No apparent difference in the germination rate of pin and thrum pollen grains was observed when cultured in vitro, although growth of thrum pollen tubes was much faster than that of pin pollen tubes. Artificial pollination revealed that pollen tube growth in legitimate intermorph crosses was faster than in either intramorph crosses or self-pollination, suggesting the occurrence of cryptic self-incompatibility in this species. Cryptic self-incompatibility functioned differently in the two morphs, with pollen tube growth rates after legitimate and illegitimate pollination much more highly differentiated in pin flowers than in thrum flowers. No fruit was produced in emasculated netted flowers, suggesting the absence of apomixis.

What remains unclear is how such a community is maintained. Niche partitioning, or spatial heterogeneity among the mutualists and exploiters, is generally believed to enable stability within a mutualistic system. However, our examination of a reciprocal mutualism between a fig species (Ficus racemosa) and its pollinator wasp (Ceratosokn fusciceps) shows that spatial niche partitioning does not sufficiently prevent exploiters from overexploiting the common resource (i.e., the female flowers), because of the considerable niche overlap between the mutualists and exploiters. In response to an exploiter, our experiment shows that the fig can (1) abort syconia-containing flowers that have been galled by the exploiter, Apocryptophagus testacea, which oviposits before the pollinators do; and (2) retain syconia-containing flowers galled by Apocryptophagus mayri, which oviposit later than pollinators. However, as a result of (2), there is decreased development of adult non-pollinators or pollinator species in syconia that have not been sufficiently pollinated, but not aborted. Such discriminative abortion of figs or reduction in offspring development of exploiters while rewarding cooperative individuals with higher offspring development by the fig will increase the fitness of cooperative pollinating wasps, but decrease the fitness of exploiters. The fig-fig wasp interactions are diffusively coevolved, a case in which fig wasps diversify their genotype, phenotype, or behavior as a result of competition between wasps, while figs diverge their strategies to facilitate the evolution of cooperative fig waps or lessen the detrimental behavior by associated fig wasps. In habitats or syconia that suffer overexploitation, discriminative abortion of figs or reduction in the offspring development of exploiters in syconia that are not or not sufficiently pollinated will decrease exploiter fitness and perhaps even drive the population of exploiters to local extinction, enabling the evolution and maintenance of cooperative pollinators through the movement between habitats or syconia (i.e., the metapopulations). © by the Ecological Society of America.",Apocryptophagus spp; Ceratosolen fusciceps; China; Coevolution; Exploiter; Ficus racemosa; Figfig wasp systems; Metapopulation; Mutualism; Niche partitioning; Pollination; Species coexistence; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951790244

Evolution of population flowering phenologies depends on the phenotypic variances and heritabilities of the within-individual mean and variance of flowering time. In the ecological scenarios we investigate selection does not produce a correlation of the mean and variance of individual flowering time. Self-incompatibility causes weak stabilizing selection on flowering time that acts to reduce the within-individual variance in flowering time. Disruptive selection due to pollinator limitation acts mostly to increase the among-individual variance in flowering time. Stabilizing selection due to pollinator attraction, or short reproductive season, acts mostly to decrease the within-individual variance in flowering time. Temporal autocorrelation of environmental stochasticity in pollinator visitation rate strongly selects to increase the within-individual variance in flowering time. These predictions can be tested by measuring the causal factors described above, partitioning the variance in population phenology within and among individuals, and estimating the inheritance of, and selection on, within-individual mean and variance of flowering time. © 2009 The Author(s).

For this purpose, the essential oil of an Indian medicinal plant, Terminalia chebula, commonly known as Myrobalan, was isolated for the first time. Hitherto unknown chemical constituents of the essential oil were determined by GC/MS. The repellent activity of formulations of the essential oil, tested towards the Indian honeybee Apis florea, was found to be dose dependent. The repellency (?R) increased with the concentration of essential oil in the formulations, reaching a maximum for the formulation containing 50 mg/ml of oil. A further increase in the oil concentration was found to reduce the ?R. The screening of formulations of the major essential-oil components identified indicated that formulations of furfural, 5-methylfurfural, tetradecanoic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid elicited no response in honeybees. In contrast, the formulations of phenylacetaldehyde were repellent, while those of ethyl cinnamate were attractant. These findings might be an asset for beekeepers to improve the bee management.

However, owing to their intensive use, there exists a debate regarding the involvement of this microbial insecticide in beecolony losses. In this study, inatiered approach using laboratory microcolonies, an evaluation was made of the potential lethaland sublethal hazardson colony reproduction and for aging behaviour of workers of the bumblebee Bombusterrestris (L.) of two commercial Bt strains: kurstaki (Dipel®) and aizawai (Xentari®). Bumblebees, like honey bees, are intensively used in modern agriculture for pollination and fulfil a crucial role in the natural ecosystem. Results: Exposure of bumble bees dermally or viatreated pollen to either of the two Btformulations at their fielder commended rates (0.1%) caused no reduction in survival. However, when applied in the feeding sugar water, aizawai killed all workers at a concentration of 0.1%, but this lethal effect was lost at 0.01%. With respect to reproductive effects, kurstaki was harmless, while aizawai at 0.1% delivered in the feeding sugar water and pollen reduced reproduction by 100 and 31% respectively. Lower doses of 0.01% aizawai in the sugar water showed no more effect. In addition, kurstaki at 0.1% and aizawai at 0.01% in the feeding sugar water did not impair the foraging behaviour, resulting in normal nest colony performance. Conclusion: The results with kurstaki and aizawai demonstrated that, in general, the Bt strains are safe to B. terrestris bumblebees, although in some cases there were detrimental effects that dependedon strain and route of exposure. In addition, the authors believe that to draw firm conclusions regarding the hazards of Bt to bumblebees would require more information on relevant concentrations of Bt products in the environment. Hence, routine testing for lethal and sublethal effects is recommended to ascertain combined use of Bt products and bumblebees in modern agriculture. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.",Aizawai; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bombus terrestris; Dipel®; Foraging behaviour; Kurstaki; Reproduction; Side effects; Survival; Xentari®,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950532447

For example, distal fruits are often smaller and produce fewer and smaller fruits and seeds than more basal fruits. To assess the causes and functional significance of intra-inflorescence variation, pollen and resources were manipulated to test whether such patterns could be altered within racemes of Stylidum armeria, a perennial Australian herb. MethodsPollen and resource levels were manipulated over two flowering seasons. How the number of ovules, fertilized ovules and seeds, the probability of fruit set, and the biomass of floral and fruiting structures varied with their position on the raceme were analysed. Key ResultsMost plants showed a decline in ovule and seed number toward the distal positions on the raceme, but plants differed in their pattern of intra-inflorescence allocation: racemes with greater investment in basal fruits displayed a stronger trade-off with distal investment than did racemes that made smaller initial investments. This trade-off was (a) much stronger for ovule number than for seed number, (b) ameliorated but not erased by resource addition, and (c) exacerbated by resource reduction. There was large and seemingly erratic variation across fruit positions in ovule fertilization and seed set following both natural and supplemental pollination. ConclusionsIn S. armeria, allocation to reproductive traits within the inflorescence is influenced by dynamic trade-offs in resource allocation between early and late fruits, and may also be subject to inherent architectural effects. Large, unpredictable variation among fruits in fertilization success and seed set may influence the evolution of inflorescence size, ovule number and floral dimorphism. © The Author 2010.

An extreme case of an apparently highly specialized plant-pollinator interaction with thigmonastic pollen presentation has been described for the morphologically complex tilt-revolver flowers of Caiophora arechavaletae (Loasaceae) pollinated by oligolectic Bicolletes pampeana (Colletidae, Hymenoptera). We studied the floral biology of Nasa macrothyrsa (Loasaceae) in the field and in the glasshouse, which has very similar floral morphology, but is pollinated by polylectic Neoxylocopa bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera). We investigated the presence of thigmonastic anther presentation, visitor behaviour (pollinators and nectar robbers), co-ordination of pollinator visits with flower behaviour and the presence of nectar replenishment. The aim of this study was to understand whether complex flower morphology and behaviour can be explained by a specialized pollination syndrome, or whether alternative explanations can be offered. The results showed that Nasa macrothyrsa has thigmonastic pollen presentation, i.e. new pollen is rapidly (&lt;&lt; 10 min) presented after a pollinator visit. Nectar secretion is independent of removal and averages 7-14 ?L h-1. The complex flowers, however, fail to exclude either native (hummingbirds) or introduced (honeybees) nectar robbers, nor does polylectic Neoxylocopa actively collect the pollen presented. The findings do not support a causal link between complex flower morphology and functionality in Loasaceae and a highly specialized pollination. Rapid pollen presentation is best explained by the pollen presentation theory: the large proportion of pollinators coming shortly after a previous visit find little nectar and are more likely to move on to a different plant. The rapid presentation of pollen ensures that all these valuable 'hungry pollinators' are dusted with small pollen loads, thus increasing the male fitness of the plant by increasing the likelihood of siring outcrossed offspring. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Asymmetric specialization; Hungry pollinator; Nectar replenishment; Pollen presentation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952913694

I prevented visits of the pollinator moth Anatrachyntis sp. to male Cycas micronesica (Cycadaceae) cones to show that consumption of the cone tissue by the mutualist hastened initiation of the plant' s subsequent reproductive event. This is the first documented case where removal of a postdispersal cycad pollination organ speeds up subsequent reproductive events, and the current paradigm that the offering of cone tissue as a nursery is a sacrifice by the plant in return for the pollination services is therefore inaccurate. In C. micronesica, the herbivory stage of pollination mutualism confers a cryptic benefit of cone tissue disposal, which translates into an increase in ultimate lifetime reproductive effort. The plant population relies on the pollinator for moving gametes, as well as for increasing the number of male coning events. The dual benefits afforded to the plant by associating with this pollinator shows that mutualism can operate simultaneously on very different traits. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Anatrachyntis; Cycadaceae; Cycas micronesica; Mutualism; Plant-insect interaction; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952376687

The present study assesses whether inbreeding increases herbivory and estimates the magnitude of inbreeding depression on reproductive components of fitness in the annual plant Datura stramonium. MethodsTwo experiments were performed under natural conditions of herbivory to assess the effect of inbreeding on plant damage in D. stramonium. In the first experiment, outcrossed progeny was generated using foreign pollen donors, whereas inbred progeny was produced by self-pollination. In both groups, survival, herbivore damage and reproductive components of fitness were measured. In the second experiment, inbred and outcrossed progenies were produced using only local pollen donors, and only damage by herbivores was measured. Key ResultsDespite yearly variation in damage caused by the same specialist herbivores, inbred progeny suffered consistently more damage than outcrossed progeny. There was a significant inbreeding depression for fruit number ( = 0?3), seed number per fruit ( ?19) and seed number per plant ( ?43). Furthermore, significant genetic variation amongst families in the magnitude of inbreeding depression was observed. DiscussionThe results suggest that the plant's mating system modified the pattern of herbivory by specialist insects in D. stramonium. Inbred plants suffer not only from the genetic cost of low vigour but also from greater damage by herbivores. The mechanism by which inbreeding reduces plant resistance to herbivores remains unknown but is an interesting area for future research. © The Author 2010.

We used near infrared spectroscopy to study genetic variation in pulp yield and other traits in a 16-year-old E. globulus trial. Pulp yield was predicted for 2165 trees from 467 open-pollinated families from 17 geographic subraces. Significant differences between subraces and between families within subraces were detected for all traits. The high pulp yield of southern Tasmanian subraces suggested that their economic worth was previously underestimated. The narrow-sense heritability of pulp yield was medium (0.40). The significant positive genetic correlation between pulp yield and diameter (0.52) was at odds with the generally neutral values reported. The average of the reported genetic correlations between pulp yield and basic density (0.50) was also at odds with our nonsignificant estimate. Pulp yield of the subraces increased with increasing latitude, producing a negative correlation with density (-0.58). The absence of genetic correlations within subraces between pulp yield and density suggests that the correlation may be an independent response of the two traits to the same or different selection gradients that vary with latitude.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951997833

As honey bees play a vital role in pollination in cardamom, the impact of insecticides on honey bees needs to be explored to assess its safety. Results: Risk assessment based on contact toxicity revealed diafenthiuron to be a non-selective insecticide to bees with a low selectivity ratio (the ratio between the LD50 for beneficial and pest species). A dose of diafenthiuron that killed 90% of cardamom borer, Conogethes punctiferalis Guenee, was found to kill 100% of Indian bees. Based on the hazard ratio (the ratio between the field-recommended dose and the LD50 for the beneficial), diafenthiuron was found to be slightly to moderately toxic to bees. Diafenthiuron, even at low concentrations of LC1 (the concentration that killed 1% of bees), was found to affect the foraging and homing behaviour of Indian bees. Of bees fed with 30 ?g mL-1 of diafenthiuron, 40% were found missing on the third day after exposure. However, diafenthiuron did not affect bee visits to the cardamom fields. Conclusion: Diafenthiuron is more highly toxicto Apisceranaindica F. than to C. punctiferalisby contact, using selectivity ratio and probit substitution methods of risk assessment, but the hazard ratio revealed diafenthiuron to be a slightly to moderately toxicchemical. Diafenthiuron was found to affect the for agingand homing behaviour of bees at sublethal concentrations.

Knight, Cypripedium reginae Walter, and Cypripedium tibeticum Schltr. The average natural (insect-mediated) pollination rates measured over five seasons are wide ranging among the six species (0.08-0.74). However, the pollination rate of hand-manipulated populations (self and/or cross) is significantly greater than the rate of insect-mediated pollinations in all species studied. A few pollen tubes in both self-and cross-pollinations display aberrant growth in the styles and/or ovaries, but their numbers are too small to suggest evidence of self-incompatibility. Pollen tubes germinate and grow up to the bases of styles within 48 h in C. bardolphianum, C. flavum, and C. tibeticum. Pollen tubes remain at the bases of the styles in C. montanum for 5 d after pollination. In C. parviflorum, pollen tubes penetrate ovaries at 7 d. Pollen tube penetration of ovaries is observed within 15 d after hand pollination in all six species but remains incomplete at this time, with the greatest number of ovule penetrations observed in C. reginae (which has the shortest floral life span). Therefore, we suggest there are additional factors aside from low pollinator visitation for low conversion rates of flowers into fruits in these Cypripedium species. These include inadequate pollen loads deposited on receptive stigmas (pollen limitation), coupled with environmental stress and/or predation disrupting or destroying the slow processes of fertilization and/or fruit maturation. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

Thus, one of the most important challenges is to understand the impact of exotic species on native species and habitats (e.g. Jones 2008). The probability that entire invasive communities will develop increases as more species establish in new areas (Bourgeois et al. 2005). For example, introduced species may act in concert, facilitating one another's invasion, and increasing the likelihood of successful establishment, spread and impact. Simberloff & Von Holle (1999) introduced the term invasional meltdown for this process, which has received widespread attention since (e.g. O'Dowd 2003, Richardson et al. 2000, Simberloff 2006). Positive interactions among introduced species are relatively common, but few have been studied in detail (Traveset & Richardson 2006). Examples include introduced insects and birds that pollinate and disperse exotic plants, thereby facilitating the spread of these species into non-invaded habitats (Goulson 2003, Mandon-Dalger et al. 2004, Simberloff & Von Holle 1999). From a more general ecological perspective, the study of interactions involving introduced and invasive species can contribute to our knowledge of ecological processes - for example, community assembly and indirect interactions.

Animal-pollinated flowers need to attract pollinators but also to avoid conflicts with antagonistic consumers. The view of flower visitors as mutualistic and antagonistic agents considers primarily the plants' interest. A classification emphasizing the consumer's point of view, however, may be more useful when considering animal's adaptations to flower visits which may include a tolerance against defensive floral scent compounds. MethodsIn a meta-analysis covering 18 studies on the responses of animals to floral scents, the animals were assigned to the categories of obligate and facultative flower visitors which considers their dependency on floral resources. Their responses on floral scents were compared. Key ResultsOn average, obligate flower visitors, often corresponding to pollinators, were attracted to floral scent compounds. In contrast, facultative and mainly antagonistic visitors were strongly repelled by floral scents. The findings confirm that floral scents have a dual function both as attractive and defensive cues. ConclusionsWhether an animal depends on floral resources determines its response to these signals, suggesting that obligate flower visitors evolved a tolerance against primarily defensive compounds. Therefore, floral scent bouquets in conjunction with nutritious rewards may solve the conflicting tasks of attracting mutualists while repelling antagonists. © The Author 2010.

Local ecological knowledge and associated practice are essential to sustain and enhance ecosystem services on the ground. Here, we focus on social or collective memory in relation to management practice that sustains ecosystem services, and investigate where and how ecological practices, knowledge and experience are retained and transmitted. We analyze such social-ecological memory of allotment gardens in the Stockholm urban area, Sweden. Allotment gardens support ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal and pest regulation in the broader urban landscape. Surveys and interviews were preformed over a four-year period with several hundreds of gardeners. We found that the allotment gardens function as communities-of-practice, where participation and reification interact and social-ecological memory is a shared source of resilience of the community by being both emergent and persistent. Ecological practices and knowledge in allotment gardens are retained and transmitted by imitation of practices, oral communication and collective rituals and habits, as well as by the physical gardens, artifacts, metaphors and rules-in-use (institutions). Finally, a wider social context provides external support through various forms of media, markets, social networks, collaborative organizations, and legal structures. We exemplify the role of urban gardens in generating ecosystem services in times of crisis and change and conclude that stewards of urban green areas and the social memory that they carry may help counteract further decline of critical ecosystem services. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

SI in this species is mainly due to late-acting pre- and post-zygotic mechanisms operating in the ovary, and not S alleles. This study aimed to assess the phenotypic variation in SI levels within E. globulus and determine its genetic control and stability across pollination techniques, sites and seasons. METHODS: SI levels were estimated for 105 genotypes originating from across the geographical range of E. globulus over multiple years of crossing. Separate grafted trees of some genotypes growing at the same and different sites allowed the genetic basis of the variation in SI to be tested and its stability across sites and seasons to be determined. The SI level of a tree was measured as the relative reduction in seeds obtained per flower pollinated following selfing compared with outcross pollinations. Thus, if seed set is the same, SI is 0 %, and if no self seed is set, SI is 100 %. KEY RESULTS: The average SI in E. globulus was 91 % and genotypes ranged from 8 to 100 % SI. Most genotypes (>75 %) had SI levels >90 %. There were highly significant differences between genotypes and the within-site broad-sense heritability of percentage SI was high (H(2) = 0.80 +/- 0.13). However, there was evidence that growing site, and to a lesser extent season, can affect the expression of SI levels. Trees with low reproductive loads produced relatively more seed from selfed flowers. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong genetic basis to the phenotypic variation in SI in E. globulus within a site. However, the level of SI was affected, but to a lesser extent, by the environment, which in part may reflect the higher probability of selfed zygotes surviving on sites or in seasons where competition for resources is less.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954700388

Genetic similarity values for touching pairs ranged from 0.308 to 0.765. Based on pairwise touching-neighbor crosses, no evidence was found for yield being affected by genetic similarity. However, self-fertility of clones was a significant positive predictor of outcross yields. The calculation of lethal equivalents, derived from selfing to outcross ratios, showed a large range in genetic load among clones and a higher average load than that previously reported in the related highbush blueberry (V. corymbosum).

Results show that RSD32 reduced not only the seed dormancy but also sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) on germination. The segregation ratio in the F2 population of a cross that had been derived from Norin61 and RSD32 suggested that the reduced dormant phenotype was inherited as a recessive trait. At 30 days after pollination (DAP30) and later developmental stages, ABA-insensitivity of RSD32 was observed, but the seeds were sensitive to ABA at DAP20. Defects of ABA sensitivity depended upon seed development. Auxin acted synergistically for sensitivity to ABA in germination of Norin61, but the effects of auxin on ABA sensitivity were diminished in RSD32. The expression of TaABF, a bZIP class transcription factor associated with ABA signal transduction in seed, was lower in embryos of RSD32 than those of Norin61. TaDOG1 is a wheat orthologue of Arabidopsis DOG1, which is identified as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the regulation of seed dormancy.

One concern has been that the infrastructure used in these experiments can restrict the access of influential herbivores, detritivores or pollinators to the plots, and the absence of these animals is confounded with the treatment effects. However, in this paper we describe why free access by animals to experimental plots does not ensure realistic animal densities in response to global change treatments. On the contrary, much like moths swarm around streetlamps, animals that prefer the local conditions in treated plots may congregate at artificially high densities, or conversely, those that are repelled by the treatments may choose to avoid them. Therefore, animal densities or herbivore damage in the plots of global change experiments may grossly exaggerate or underestimate the contributions of animals to primary productivity or plant species composition under future environmental conditions. We describe how these potential animal congregation and avoidance artifacts may have been overlooked in the interpretation of results from many plot-level global change field experiments. We also provide suggestions for how to best interpret the results of these experiments and how to isolate the effects of animal density artifacts. © 2009 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953111351

Yet, knowledge of these relationships is needed to predict consequences of changes in the frugivore assemblage for seed dispersal. In the absence of comprehensive dietary information, it may be possible to delineate between frugivores that disperse different plants using 'functional traits,' or morphological and behavioral attributes of frugivores that interact with differences in salient characteristics of plant species. Here we use data on the consumption of 244 Australian rain forest plant species by 38 bird species to test for associations between patterns of frugivory and birds': (1) degree of frugivory, (2) gape width, and (3) seed treatment (seed crushing or seed dispersing). Degree of frugivory and gape width explain 74 percent of the variation in the sizes of fruits consumed by frugivorous birds. Among birds that consume a substantial dietary proportion of fruit, birds with wider gapes consume larger fruits. In contrast, this relationship was not shown by birds for which fruit is only a minor dietary component. Degree of frugivory and gape width, together with seed treatment, also strongly predict the overall taxonomic composition and diversity of plants consumed by bird species. Functional classifications of frugivore species may prove useful in developing a predictive understanding of fruit-frugivore interactions in other rain forest regions where detailed dietary information is not available for most frugivores. © 2009 The Author(s).

Plus-Hybrids are a blend of cytoplasmic malesterile (CMS) hybrids and unrelated male-fertile hybrids ensuring pollination of the whole stand. Combining potential benefits of male sterility (CMS effect) and allopollination (xenia effect), they often outperform the corresponding male-fertile sib-pollinated hybrids in terms of yield. The combining abilities of five CMS hybrids and eight pollinators were investigated in a factorial split-plot design in 12 environments in four countries and two years. The plant material from different breeders represented the three types of malesterile cytoplasm. Plus-Hybrids increased grain yield, on average, by 10% or more and by up to 20% in specific environments. Three highly responsive CMS hybrids and four generally good pollinators were identified. The Plus-Hybrid effect affected both yield components, CMS leading mainly to a higher number of kernels (KN) and the xenia effect mainly to an increase in the thousand kernel weight (TKW). Despite some differences in the response of the three types of CMS, the effect of the cytoplasm was not significant. While the CMS effect depended strongly on environment, the xenia was consistent in all environments but its extent varied. As well as increasing yield, we can expect that Plus-Hybrids can make a large contribution to the coexistence of transgenic and conventional maize by biocontainment, that is, eliminating or reducing the release of transgenic pollen in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) maize or herbicide-tolerant (HT) maize. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951081099

Here, we develop general theory for the density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism based on the C-R mechanism of interspecific interaction. To test the influence of C-R interactions on the dynamics and stability of bi- and uni-directional C-R mutualisms, we developed simple models that link consumer functional response of one mutualistic species with the resources supplied by another. Phase-plane analyses show that the ecological dynamics of C-R mutualisms are stable in general. Most transient behavior leads to an equilibrium of mutualistic coexistence, at which both species densities are greater than in the absence of interactions. However, due to the basic nature of C-R interactions, certain densitydependent conditions can lead to C-R dynamics characteristic of predator-prey interactions, in which one species overexploits and causes the other to go extinct. Consistent with empirical phenomena, these results suggest that the C-R interaction can provide a broad mechanism for understanding density-dependent population dynamics of mutualism. By unifying predation, competition, and mutualism under the common ecological framework of consumer-resource theory, we may also gain a better understanding of the universal features of interspecific interactions in general. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Consumer-resource interaction; Context dependent; Density dependent; Equilibrium; Functional response; Indirect interaction; Resource supply; Stability; Transient behavior,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951782961

Mutations in Mn1 result in pleiotropic changes, including a reduction in kernel mass and a recently reported decrease in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) levels throughout kernel development. Here, we show that mn1-1 basal kernel regions (pedicels and basal endosperm transfer layer) accumulate higher levels of sucrose and lower levels of glucose and fructose between 8 and 28 d after pollination when compared with the wild type, whereas upper regions of mn1 accumulate similar or increased concentrations of sugars. To determine the cause of the reduction in IAA accumulation, we investigated transcript levels of several potential IAA biosynthetic enzymes. We demonstrate that reduced IAA levels most closely correspond to reduced transcript levels of ZmYUCCA (ZmYUC), a newly identified homolog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene YUCCA. We further demonstrate that ZmYUC catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of tryptamine and that sugar levels regulate transcript levels of ZmYUC, both in in vitro-cultured kernels and in a promoter-reporter fusion in Arabidopsis.

However, genetic self-incompatibility has been found in species of some lineages of the myophilous subtribe Pleurothallidinae. We carried out experimental pollinations to determine the mating systems of four Anathallis species, a representative genus of a large clade of this subtribe. This is one of the few clades of Pleurothallidinae not studied on this subject to date. All four species present strong self-incompatibility, reinforcing previous findings that this mating system is widespread in the Pleurothallidinae. However, the four species showed two different self-incompatibility reactions, one typical of gametophytic self-incompatibility (pollen tubes becoming irregular in their trajectory with variation in diameter and excessive deposition of callose) and the other typical of sporophytic self-incompatibility (absence of pollen grain germination). The two types of self-incompatibility reaction we found are associated with the two previous groups in previous classification systems: the species that showed a reaction similar to gametophytic self-incompatibility used to be included in Pleurothallis subgen. Specklinia sect. Muscosae and the three species that showed a reaction similar to sporophytic self-incompatibility used to be included in Pleurothallis subgen. Acuminatia. Mating system studies have the potential to help elucidate the phylogeny of groups within the Orchidaceae.

Each engineered chromosome is a wheat-rye (Secale cereale L.) translocation with up to six translocation breakpoints. Consequently, these chromosomes may disassemble by crossing over with normal chromosomes. To determine their transmission rates through gametes and their recombination rates with normal 1R, they were tested in a wide range of genetic backgrounds over several years, both in standard sexual reproduction and in androgenic doubled haploids. Male transmission rates of all chromosomes were signifi cantly lower than female and than random, which suggests reduced genetic compensation of translocations. Recombination frequencies in individual segments were similar to those observed during chromosome development. Reduced male transmission combined with recombination of the engineered chromosomes resulted in relatively low recovery rates of homozygotes on self-pollination. The recovery rate of the chromosomes via androgenesis was no different than transmission via pollen in sexual reproduction, implying that normal chromosome 1R may be involved in the process of androgenesis. Overall, chromosome FC2 appeared to be the most suitable for breeding, as it most completely resolves the gluten issue while offering a reasonably high transmission rate and good stability over generations. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951040003

Erythrosperma. Seeds from hybridization (106 samples), open pollinated (34) and bagged (43) capitula were analyzed for breeding system using a flow-cytometric seed screen. In the section Erythrosperma, diploids are obligate sexuals, mostly allogamous; however, autogamy also occurs (in 28% of unpollinated capitula). Triploids are apomicts with residual sexuality (in 13% of capitula pollinated by pollen of diploids). Pollen of diploids in Taraxacum is usually approximately the same size (regular pollen). In our study, in the section Erythrosperma, many diploids (24%) produced pollen grains of different sizes (irregular pollen) and one plant produced no pollen. The pollen of triploids is either irregular (33%) or the triploids produce no pollen (67%). Consequently, the method of ploidy level assessment on the basis of pollen characteristics is not suitable for Taraxacum sect. Erythrosperma. Low potential for polyploid hybrid formation between diploid maternal plants and polyploid pollen donors, considerable tendency to autogamy and no evidence of the formation of diploid progeny by polyploid maternal plants (facultative apomixis) indicates low intensity of gene flow within Taraxacum sect. Erythrosperma. This, together with a lower population density and spatial isolation of ploidy levels, is expected to result in a lower rate of formation of new apomictic lineages. Thus, Taraxacum sect. Erythrosperma appears evolutionarily more stable and taxonomically less complicated than sect. Ruderalia. The present study supports the agamospecies concept of Taraxacum sect.

To advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying this response, we determined the timing of sucrose, glucose, starch, and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in apical (inferior) and basal (superior) kernels during water deficit (3-8 d after pollination) and recovery. While net flux of material was nearly zero into both apical and basal kernels during stress, growth resumed after rewatering only in basal kernels. In bulk tissues of pedicel-placenta, pericarp, or endosperm, basal kernels did not have higher glucose, sucrose, or starch concentrations than apical kernels. However, glucose and sucrose concentration in the pedicel-endosperm interface where phloem terminates was maintained at control concentrations in basal kernels, while it was depleted in apical kernels. Kernel set in basal versus apical kernels was also associated with lower levels of ABA in the pedicel-placenta tissue of basal kernels after rewatering. These findings support a model of interacting influences of carbohydrate and ABA, and suggest that this interaction might be a good target for future efforts to genetically improve maize drought tolerance. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951062772

However, realized selfing rates under natural conditions, as based on genetic progeny analysis, have not yet been determined for any alpine species across altitude. We therefore assessed the realized selfing rates in about 100 open-pollinated families of the high-alpine cushion plant Eritrichium nanum, sampled along an altitudinal gradient in the Swiss Alps, by using progeny analysis based on six microsatellites. In marked contrast to the general hypothesis, realized selfing rates in E. nanum significantly decreased with increasing altitude, and only progenies from low altitudes were predominantly selfed. However, the higher selfing rates of individuals at lower altitudes could have been caused by unfavorable weather conditions during early growing season when low-elevation plants flowered. In summary, our results on selfing rates in an alpine plant across altitude as well as the results of other studies using experimental hand-pollinations and/or population genetic methods generally do not support the expectation of higher selfing rates at higher altitudes.

Here, we investigated pollen- and seed-mediated gene flow in two mixed-oak forest stands (consisting of Quercus robur L. and Q. petraea [Matt.] Liebl.). The gene flow parameters were estimated based on microsatellite multilocus genotypes of seedlings and adults and their spatial locations within the sample plots using models that attempt to reconstruct the genealogy of the seedling cohorts. Pollen and seed dispersal were modelled using the standard seedling neighbourhood model and a modification - the 2-component seedling neighbourhood model, with the later allowing separation of the dispersal process into local and long-distance components. The 2-component model fitted the data substantially better than the standard model and provided estimates of mean seed and pollen dispersal distances accounting for long-distance propagule dispersal. The mean distance of effective pollen dispersal was found to be 298 and 463 m, depending on the stand, while the mean distance of effective seed dispersal was only 8.8 and 15.6 m, which is consistent with wind pollination and primarily seed dispersal by gravity in Quercus. Some differences observed between the two stands could be attributed to the differences in the stand structure of the adult populations and the existing understory vegetation. Such a mixture of relatively limited seed dispersal with occasional long distance gene flow seems to be an efficient strategy for colonizing new habitats with subsequent local adaptation, while maintaining genetic diversity within populations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Gene flow; Natural regeneration; Parentage analysis; Seed and pollen dispersal; Seedling model,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951998431

Despite a high abundance of animal-dispersed plant species in the savanna-forest mosaic of West Africa, few data are available on the interplay between morphological fruit traits and primate fruit consumers in this ecosystem. We tested whether olive baboons (Papio anubis) at Comoé National Park, north-eastern Ivory Coast, prefer fruit species with particular characteristics relative to the availability of these traits among the woody plant species at the study site. Specifically we were interested in the suites of traits that best predict fruit choice and seed handling by baboons. The baboons ate fruit/seeds from 74 identified plant species, representing 25 percent of the regional pool of woody plant species. They preferred trees to shrubs and lianas as fruit sources. Otherwise, baboons seemed to consume whatever fruit type, color, and size of fruit and seeds available, though they especially included larger fruit into their diet. Against expectations from the African bird-monkey fruit syndrome of brightly colored drupes and berries, baboons ate mostly species having large, dull-colored fruit. Fruit type and color best described whether baboons included a species into their diet, whereas fruit type and seed size best predicted whether baboons predated upon the seeds of their food plant species. As most plant species at the study site had medium-sized to large fruits and seeds, large frugivores like baboons might be particularly important for plant fitness and plant community dynamics in West African savanna-forest ecosystems. © 2009 The Author(s).

These rewards are voraciously consumed by hummingbird flower mites (Acari: Mesostigmata: Ascidae), and nectar and pollen feeding by mites have a strong impact on planthummingbird interactions. Tropicoseius chiriquensis (Acari: Mesostigmata: Ascidae) feed on nectar and pollen of Lobelia laxiflora H.B.K. (Lobeliaceae) flowers, and within the floral corolla they mate and lay eggs. Yet the benefits of nectar and pollen feeding in terms of survival and fecundity of flower mites are quite unexplored. Here, we evaluate the fecundity and numerical response of T. chiriquensis to the availability of pollen in long-lived protandrous flowers of L. laxiflora. Under field conditions, unmanipulated flowers with pollen had more mites (adults, nymphs, larvae, and eggs) than emasculated flowers without pollen, Numbers of mites fluctuated throughout the flower life span. More adult mites were found for the first 2 d of the flower (staminate phase) and decreased for the last three days of life of the flower (pistillate phase). In contrast, we found higher number of larvae in the pistillate phase. In a laboratory experiment, the fecundity of flower mites was 4 times as high when pollen was available as that when flower mites were not provided with pollen. They completed their life cycle in approximately a week, the life span of L. laxiflora flowers. Our results suggest that pollen availability in L. laxiflora long-lived flowers could influence the population dynamics of T. chiriquensis by having a positive impact on numbers and fecundity of the mites. © 2010 Entomological Society of America.",Ascidae; Fecundity; Flower mites; Pollen feeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952005500

A model that can effectively predict pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) is essential for assessing and managing risks from transgene escape. A pollen-trap method was used to measure the wind-borne pollen dispersal in cultivated rice and common wild rice, and effects of relative humidity, temperature and wind speed on pollen dispersal were estimated. A PMGF model was constructed based on the pollen dispersal pattern in rice, taking outcrossing rates of recipients and cross-compatibility between rice and its wild relatives into consideration. Published rice gene flow data were used to validate the model. Pollen density decreased in a simple exponential pattern with distances to the rice field. High relative humidity reduced pollen dispersal distances. Model simulation showed an increased PMGF frequency with the increase of pollen source size (the area of a rice field), but this effect levelled off with a large pollen-source size. Cross-compatibility is essential when modelling PMGF from rice to its wild relatives. The model fits the data well, including PMGF from rice to its wild relatives. Therefore, it can be used to predict PMGF in rice under diverse conditions (e.g. different outcrossing rates and cross-compatibilities), facilitating the determination of isolation distances to minimize transgene escape. The PMGF model may be extended to other wind-pollinated plant species such as wheat and barley. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Gene flow model; Isolation distance; Outcrossing rate; Pollen competition; Pollen dispersal; Transgene escape,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956659872

This long-term interest has allowed a deep knowledge of some complex processes, such as the physiology and dynamics of its characteristic lure-and-trap pollination system, to be built up. However, mainly because of its large distributional range and high degree of morphological variation, species' limits and relationships are still under discussion. Today, the genus comprises 28 species subdivided into two subgenera, two sections and six subsections. In this study, the phylogeny of the genus is inferred on the basis of four plastid regions, and the evolution of several morphological characters is investigated. Our phylogenetic hypothesis is not in agreement with the current infrageneric classification of the genus and challenges the monophyly of several species. This demonstrates the need for a new infrageneric classification based on characters reflecting the evolution of this enigmatic genus. To investigate the biogeography of Arum deeply, further spatiotemporal analyses were performed, addressing the importance of the Mediterranean basin in the diversification of Arum. Our results suggest that its centre of origin was the European-Aegean region, and that major diversification happened during the last 10 Myr. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Character tracing; Infrageneric systematics; Mediterranean biogeography; Phylogenetic inferences,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954112188

As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cuculi along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In Ireland, they cover around 9% of the land area and many that are commercially mature are now being felled and reforested. The potential biodiversity value of such second rotation forests has yet to be determined, yet this may be particularly significant in Ireland where cover of semi-natural woodland is only 1%. Invertebrates are a vital component of forest biodiversity, functioning as decomposers and pollinators, herbivores, predators and prey. Spiders and Carabid beetles are often used in biodiversity assessment as they are easily captured using pitfall traps, are taxonomically well known and respond to changes in habitat structure. This study aimed to examine spider and Carabid beetle diversity in second rotation Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) plantations at different stages of the forest cycle (5, 8-12, 20-30, 35-50 years), and compare the spiders captured in second rotation forests with those from first rotation. Spider and beetle diversity was influenced by stand structural development in second rotation plantations with numbers of forest-associated species increasing over the forest cycle. Overall, spider richness declined over the forest cycle and this was related to decreasing cover of field layer vegetation and fewer open-associated species. In contrast, total beetle richness increased and became more specialised over the forest cycle which may be related to slower colonisation of disturbed areas by beetles in comparison with spiders, and fewer open specialists at the early stages of second rotation. Spider assemblages were distinguished between rotations. This may be related to differing habitat conditions in second rotation forests including dryer soils with lower pH, differing vegetation complexity and presence of brush piles. Few of the forest species accumulated during first rotation were retained and the early stages of second rotation forest cycle was characterised by a generalist open fauna. Nonetheless, as the forest cycle progressed the spider assemblages between rotations became more similar. Current forest policy supports retaining over-mature trees and creating a mosaic of different aged stands within a plantation. Such measures may provide refuge for forest species after clearfell. In countries where forest fragments exist in a landscape dominated by agriculture, consideration should be given to the capacity of mature forest adjacent to felled stands to support forest species, and to the configuration of over-mature areas retained after felling. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of this study were to determine the requirements for embryo growth, dormancy break and germination, to characterise the type of seed dormancy and to evaluate the effects of light, seed age, pollination mechanism, and inter-annual and inter-population variability on germinative ability. After 3 months of incubation at 5°C (cold stratification) in darkness conditions, the mean embryo length increased from 5.6 to 2.07 mm, with 76% of seeds germinating. Conversely, embryos of seeds incubated during 3 months at 20/7 or 28/14°C hardly grew and no germination was recorded. Since cold stratification was the only requirement for the loss of MPD, and both dry storage in laboratory conditions and warm stratification prior to cold stratification shortened the cold stratification period required for germination, it could be concluded that D. fissum subsp. sordidum seeds have intermediate complex MPD. Cold stratification and incubation in darkness conditions promoted higher germination percentages than those in light. In addition, germinative ability increased with seed age up to 8 months (reaching 96% at 5°C in darkness), showed a pronounced inter-annual and inter-population variability, as well as a significant decrease in seeds coming from pollination by geitonogamy. High temperatures (25/10 or 28/14°C) induced seeds to secondary dormancy, so seedling emergence in the greenhouse was restricted to February-March. The requirements for dormancy break and germination reflect an adaptation to trigger germination in late winter. This study is the first one to document a gradual increase in germination percentage with seed age for plant species with intermediate complex MPD. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Embryo length; Morphophysiological dormancy; Pollination mechanism; Seed age; Seed stratification; Soil seed bank,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957918466

A major mechanism to prevent selfing is the self-incompatibility (SI) recognition system, which consists of male and female specificity genes at the S-locus and SI modifier genes 2-4. Under conditions that favour selfing, mutations disabling the male recognition component are predicted to enjoy a relative advantage over those disabling the female component, because male mutations would increase through both pollen and seeds whereas female mutations would increase only through seeds5,6. Despite many studies on the genetic basis of loss of SI in the predominantly selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana7-15, it remains unknown whether selfing arose through mutations in the female specificity gene (S-receptor kinase, SRK),male specificity gene (S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR; also known as S-locus protein 11, SP11) or modifier genes, and whether any of them rose to high frequency across large geographic regions. Here we report that a disruptive 213-base-pair (bp) inversion in the SCR gene (or its derivative haplotypes with deletions encompassing the entire SCR-A and a large portion of SRK-A) is found in 95% of European accessions, which contrasts with the genome-wide pattern of polymorphism in European A. thaliana16,17. Importantly, interspecific crossings using Arabidopsis halleri as a pollen donor reveal that some A. thaliana accessions, including Wei-1, retain the female SI reaction, suggesting that all female components including SRK are still functional. Moreover, when the 213-bp inversion in SCR was inverted and expressed in transgenic Wei-1 plants, the functional SCR restored the SI reaction. The inversion within SCR is the first mutation disrupting SI shown to be nearly fixed in geographically wide samples, and its prevalence is consistent with theoretical predictions regarding the evolutionary advantage of mutations in male components. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Significant decreases were found in the number of flowers and nectar production as C. infuscatus densities increased. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that nectar production was not affected by environmental variables (air temperature, relative air humidity and day-time) that were treated as covariates for the various bug herbivory intensities. Sugar concentration did not vary significantly among treatments, indicating that abiotic conditions were not responsible for differing nectar amounts. In light of A. aestivus's dependence on pollinator visits to produce seeds, we conclude that C. infuscatus could impair pollination success by reducing the amount of nectar in flowers.

In this study we determined the distribution of galls induced by the sawfly Pontania proxima (Serville 1823) (Hymenoptera, Tenthredinidae, Nematinae) on flowering and non-flowering representatives of several clones belonging to Salix fragilis and S. × rubens (Salicaceae). Further, amounts and composition of scent of flowering and non-flowering twigs were compared (dynamic headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, DHS-GC-MS), and a scent sample collected from flowering twigs of S. fragilis was tested by coupled gas chromatography and electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) on the antennae of P. proxima females. The results show that the presence of flower catkins on plants led to a higher degree of allocation with galls, but the number of galls differed not between flowering and non-flowering plants. The DHS-GC-MS analyses revealed that the total amount of flower scent emitted per flowering twig is about 90 times higher than the scent emitted by a non-flowering twig. Further, several compounds were emitted only by flowering but not by non-flowering twigs. In the GC-EAD analyses, antennae consistently responded not only to green leaf volatiles, but also to compounds emitted only by the flowers (e. g. 1,4-dimethoxybenzene). These flower scent compounds are suggested to affect the host plant choice by attracting more sawflies from the distance to flowering plants compared to non-flowering plants. The EAD-active compounds emitted from vegetative plant parts are assumed to act as long-distance signals especially when flowers are absent on host plants, e. g. during the oviposition period of the second generation of P. proxima. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.",GC-EAD; GC-MS; Host plant selection; Plant gall; Pontania proxima; Salix; Tenthredinidae; Willow,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955418920

Sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys attract their pollinators, male insects, on a highly specific basis through the emission of odour blends that mimic the female sex pheromone of the targeted species. In this study, we have investigated a contact site between Ophrys arachnitiformis and O. lupercalis, two sympatric orchid species that are usually reproductively isolated via the exploitation of different pollinator ""niches"", but occasionally hybridise despite their apparent combination of ethological and mechanical isolation barriers. In particular, we have investigated the extent to which these Ophrys hybrids generate ""emergent"" combinations (i.e. novel and unpredictable from the parents' phenotypes) of floral traits, and how these phenotypic novelties, particularly the odour blends emitted by the flower, could facilitate the invasion of a novel pollinator ""niche"" and induce the rapid formation of reproductive isolation, a prerequisite for adaptive evolutionary divergence. Results. Our chemical analyses of floral scents show that the Ophrys F1 hybrids investigated here produce more compounds, significantly different ratios (% of odour compounds in the total blend), as well as new compounds in their floral odour compared to their progenitors. When tested for their attractiveness to the pollinator of each parent orchid species, we found that floral scent extracts of the hybrids triggered less inspecting flights and contacts by the male bees with the scented dummy than those of the parental orchid species. However, a series of additional behavioural bioassays revealed that the novel floral scent of the hybrids was significantly more attractive than either of the two parents to a pollinator species not initially involved in the pollination of any of the parent Ophrys species. Conclusions. Collectively, our results illustrate that the process of hybridisation can lead to the generation of evolutionary novelties, and that novel combinations of floral traits can drive pollinator shifts and rapid reproductive isolation in highly specific plant-pollinator interactions. © 2010 Vereecken et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951086981

This trait, called interspecific incompatibility, is similar to self-incompatibility in pollen tube behaviors of rejected pollen grains. Since some B. rapa lines have no interspecific incompatibility, genetic analysis of interspecific incompatibility was performed using two F2 populations. Analysis with an F2 population between an interspecific-incompatible line and a self-compatible cultivar 'Yellow sarson' having non-functional alleles of S-locus genes and MLPK, the stigmas of which are compatible with B. oleracea pollen grains, revealed no involvement of the S locus and MLPK in the difference of their interspecific incompatibility phenotypes. In QTL analysis of the strength of interspecific incompatibility, three peaks of LOD scores were found, but their LOD scores were as high as the threshold value, and the variance explained by each QTL was small. QTL analysis using another F2 population derived from selected parents having the highest and lowest levels of interspecific incompatibility revealed five QTLs with high LOD scores, which did not correspond to those found in the former population. The QTL having the highest LOD score was found in linkage group A02. The effect of this QTL on interspecific incompatibility was confirmed by analyzing backcrossed progeny. Based on synteny of this QTL region with Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 5, a possible candidate gene, which might be involved in interspecific incompatibility, is discussed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049409970

Unreduced gametes originating via meiotic restitution, including first-division restitution (FDR) and single-division meiosis (SDM), are well documented in triploid F1 hybrids of T. turgidum with diploid Ae. tauschii (genomic constitution ABD, usually with 21 univalents in meiotic metaphase I). In this study, two T. turgidum lines known to carry genes for meiotic restitution were crossed to tetraploid Ae. tauschii. The resulting F1 hybrids (genomes ABDD), had seven pairs of homologous chromosomes and regularly formed 14 univalents and seven bivalents at metaphase I. Neither FDR nor SDM were observed. The distribution of chromosome numbers among progeny obtained by self pollination and a backcross to T. turgidum showed the absence of unreduced gametes. These results suggest that high homologous pairing interfered with meiotic restitution and the formation of unreduced gametes. This may be related to asynchronous movement during meiosis between paired and unpaired chromosomes or to uneven distribution of chromosomes in anaphases, resulting in nonviable gametes. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aegilops tauschii; Chromosome pairing; Triticum turgidum; Unreduced gametes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956175505

Identification of cytoplasm type of rapeseed accessions is becoming the most important basic work for hybrid-rapeseed breeding. In this study, we report a simple multiplex PCR method to distinguish the existing common cytoplasm resources, Pol, Nap, Cam, Ogu and Ogu-NWSUAF cytoplasm, in rapeseed. Cytoplasm type of 35 F1 hybrids and 140 rapeseed open pollinated varieties or breeding lines in our rapeseed breeding programme were tested by this method. The results indicated that 10 of 35 F1 hybrids are the Nap, and 25 the Pol cytoplasm type, which is consistent with the information provided by the breeders. Out of 140 accessions tested, 100 (71.4%), 21 (15%) and 19 (13.6%) accessions possess Nap, Cam and Pol cytoplasm, respectively. All 19 accessions with Pol cytoplasm are from China. Pedigree analysis indicated that these accessions with Pol cytoplasm were either restorers for Pol CMS, including Shaan 2C, Huiyehui, 220, etc. or derived from hybrids with Pol CMS as female parent. Our molecular results are consistent with those of the classical testcross, suggesting the reliability of this method.

However, the ability of annually harvested, unfertilized perennial systems to sustain long-term yields while also maintaining ecosystem services has not been widely studied. Here we compare the impacts of harvested perennial grass and annual crop fields on ecosystem functioning in KS, USA. Despite the lack of mineral fertilizer applications, the aboveground harvests of perennial fields yielded similar levels of N compared to those of conventional high-input wheat (Triticum aestivum) fields and at only 8% of the in-field energy costs. Their 75-yr cumulative N yield per ha was approximately 23% greater than that from the region's wheat fields. In terms of aboveground food webs, perennial fields harboured greater numbers and/or diversity of insect pollinators, herbivores and detritivores. Belowground, perennial grass fields maintained 43 Mg ha-1 more soil carbon and 4 Mg ha-1 more soil nitrogen than annual crop fields in the surface 1 m. Soil food webs in perennial fields, as indicated by nematode communities, exhibited greater food web complexity and stability than did those in annual crop fields. In surrounding watersheds, increased annual cropland was correlated with higher riverine nitrate-nitrogen levels. Given their benefits, harvested perennial grasslands provide valuable ecological benchmarks for agricultural sustainability. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Plants may be particularly prone to pollen limitation if they require pollinators, occur at high elevation, and have human-mediated reductions in plant density due to harvesting. We found that two rare monocarpic Tibetan plant species, known as the Himalayan Snow Lotus, both require pollinators and that seed production in Saussurea medusa (Asteraceae) but not S. laniceps is limited by pollen receipt. We created deterministic and stochastic stage-structured matrix models for S. medusa, and found that pollen supplementation significantly increases population growth rate. However, even when pollen is not limiting, S. medusa is likely at risk for extinction in the next 50 years. Our results for this monocarpic plant differ from other population studies on pollen limitation in polycarpic plant species since the magnitude of pollen limitation for seed production was relatively low, and yet the sensitivity of population growth to changes in seed production was relatively high. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Breeding system; Elasticity analysis; Matrix population models; Pollen limitation; Saussurea laniceps; Saussurea medusa; Sustainable harvest; Tibetan medicine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956010684

Floral morphology of neotropical Malpighiaceae is distinctive and highly conserved, especially with regard to symmetry, and is thought to be caused by selection by its oil-bee pollinators. We sought to characterize the genetic basis of floral zygomorphy in Malpighiaceae by investigating CYCLOIDEA2-like (CYC2-like) genes, which are required for establishing symmetry in diverse core eudicots. We identified two copies of CYC2-like genes in Malpighiaceae, which resulted from a gene duplication in the common ancestor of the family. A likely role for these loci in the development of floral zygomorphy in Malpighiaceae is demonstrated by the conserved pattern of dorsal gene expression in two distantly related neotropical species, Byrsonima crassifolia and Janusia guaranitica. Further evidence for this function is observed in a Malpighiaceae species that has moved to the paleotropics and experienced coincident shifts in pollinators, floral symmetry, and CYC2-like gene expression. The dorsal expression pattern observed in Malpighiaceae contrasts dramatically with their actinomorphic-flowered relatives, Centroplacaceae (Bhesa paniculata) and Elatinaceae (Bergia texana). In particular, B. texana exhibits a previously undescribed pattern of uniform CYC2 expression, suggesting that CYC2 expression among the actinomorphic ancestors of zygomorphic lineages may be much more complex than previously thought. We consider three evolutionary models that may have given rise to this patterning, including the hypothesis that floral zygomorphy in Malpighiaceae arose earlier than standard morphology-based character reconstructions suggest.",CYCLOIDEA; Development; Gene duplication; Malpighiaceae; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950904843

This diversity motivates study of adaptive evolution of flowerpollinator interactions and the functional association between floral traits and plant mating strategies. An integrative study was undertaken, which focused on pollination and reproductive biology of three species representing all three floral types of Clematis. Floral traits were measured, and pollinator assemblages were observed in the field. Bagging, hand-pollination and removal treatments were used to examine breeding systems. The inbreeding depression and pollen limitation were estimated by fruit-set and seed production obtained from pollination treatments. Their floral traits are distinctly different, but are highly associated with pollination syndrome and breeding system. Among them, Clematis akebioides and C. rehderiana may be facultative autogamy (the former was delayed selfing, and the later competing selfing), and C. chrysocoma may be nearly obligate outcrossing. These conclusions are reflected in their stamen-pistil ratios. The levels of inbreeding depression are negatively associated with autonomous self-pollination. Evolution of self-pollination in C. akebioides and C. rehderiana, and pollen limitation in reproduction of the three Clematis species are discussed.

The aims of this research were to: (1) measure the effect of sowing date on the quality of fibre from cotton grown during the dry season as this was not known; (2) use the range in temperature created by varying sowing date in the dry season, to derive relationships with gin turnout, the fibre quality parameters length, strength and micronaire. Over three seasons, two Gossypium hirsutum (upland) cultivars and one Gossypium barbadense cultivar were sown from March to June at the Ord River (15.5°S), Western Australia. For the highest yielding sowing months of March and April, fibre length and strength were at or below market preference due to relatively low temperatures and solar radiation during early fibre development. Fibre micronaire achieved market preference at all sowing months due to favourable late season temperatures and radiation. It is likely that current G. barbadense cultivars will have short fibre when grown in the dry season. For fibre length and gin turnout quadratic responses (p < 0.05) to weighted minimum temperature were fitted for each cultivar, where the optimum minimum temperature was 18-20 and 16-17 °C, respectively. The cultivar differences in fibre properties observed here suggest that wider screening may identify G. hirsutum cultivars with suitable fibre length and strength in the dry season. It was demonstrated by weighting of temperatures for the contribution of the cohort of bolls pollinated each day; the variation in crop fibre quality and gin turnout in the field due to temperature can be predicted.

Here, we selected plant height and seed size to represent plant growth and reproduction states, respectively, and analyzed their associations with flowering time in 11 communities together representing a QingHai-Tibetan flora. Trait associations were examined using Pearson correlation analyses (TIPs) and phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) within individual communities and meta-analyses across all communities. The results of TIPs-based and PICs-based analyses were generally congruent, although fewer contrasts were significant with PICs, probably because of low statistical power. Overall, flowering time was negatively correlated with seed size and plant height (i.e., plants with larger seeds and stature started flowering earlier) in various woody communities, but correlations were neutral or positive in herbaceous communities. The seed size-flowering time relationship was negative for woody and herbaceous perennials but not for annual herbs in most communities. The relationship between plant height and flowering time was negative for woody but positive for herbaceous plants. Moreover, the lack of difference in time-size relationships between anemophilous and entomophilous plants suggests that pollination type may only be a secondary force in controlling flowering phenology. Our studies demonstrate that environmental conditions, community structure, and plant life history strategies may affect community flowering time singly or in combination. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Community structure; Flowering phenology; Growth form; Interspecific trait variation; Phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs); Plant height; Pollination; Seed size; Temperate-alpine vegetation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954243614

The permeability of the syconium changes during receptivity or between seasons, which may affect the behaviour of pollinators. Fig fruits are permeable during receptivity, and in some species, pollinators can enter and re-emerge after oviposition/pollination. We studied the relationship between fig permeability and pollinator re-emergence behaviour with a functional dioecious fig, Ficus hispida and the obligate pollinator Ceratosolen solmsi marchali. The relationship reflects the interaction of figs and pollinators in the mutualism and also the conflicts of interests between the two partners: figs benefit from the enclosed fig fruits which have low permeability, but pollinators benefit from their re-emergence behaviour, which requires high fig permeability. The results showed that at the end of receptivity, the permeability of fig fruits lowered rapidly with changes to the ostiole structures, and re-emergence rate was low, with more re-emerging pollinators trapped in the ostiolar bracts. Our results also showed that in the rainy season, the length of receptivity was shorter and fig permeability was lower. The re-emergence rates were also lower than those in the dry season. The results elucidated that figs' interests dominated in the conflicts between fig and pollinating wasp. Based on a new criteria which employed the classification of pollinators found dead in the ostiolar bracts and which involved a survey of 6 monoecious and 12 dioecious fig species, we found that re-emergence behaviour was prevalent among fig species, and was more prevalent in functional dioecious figs than monoecious ones. © 2010 The Authors.

We examined the potential role of hawkmoth pollinators in driving allopatric divergence and maintaining sympatric coexistence of morphotypes in the African iris Gladiolus longicollis. Floral tube length in this species varies from 35 mm to 130 mm across its geographic range and reflects the prevailing tongue lengths of local hawkmoth assemblages. The distribution of floral tube lengths is bimodal with two relatively discrete categories-long (about 90 mm) or short (about 50 mm)-that match the bimodal distribution of hawkmoth tongue lengths in eastern South Africa. At a contact site between these two floral morphs, we found few individuals of intermediate length, suggesting limited gene flow between morphs despite their interfertility. A difference in flowering phenology appears to be the main isolating barrier between morphs at this site. Long- and short-tubed morphs differed markedly in the chemical composition of their floral fragrance, a trait that could be used as a cue for morph-specific foraging by hawkmoths. Positive directional selection on tube length was found to occur in both morphs. © 2009 The Author(s).

The effect of delaying the termination of overwintering storage (6°C) from April to July (""April bees"" and ""July bees,"" respectively) also was examined. The following observations were made: 1) All developmental stages of the April bees and July bees examined can be stored without harmful effects, as measured by percentage of survival, for 14 d at 12°C and above. 2) Postponing the termination of overwintering storage at 6°C from April until July significantly decreased the mean number of days to 95% adult emergence in the July ready-to-emerge bees across the three temperatures tested. 3) The increase of overwintering duration also caused a decrease in the postemergence longevity of the ready-to-emerge adults stored at 6°C for 14 d. 4) Of the three storage temperatures examined, 18°C seems to be the optimal storage temperature for short-term storage of developing bees because of their slow but continuing development without increased mortality either during storage or after emergence.",Emergence; Low-temperature tolerance; Postemergence longevity; Stress,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952296045

Qualitative data suggested a linear or slower than linear secondary extinction while quantitative data showed sigmoidal decline of plant interaction strength upon removal of the strongest interactor. Temporal snapshots indicated greater stability of re-wired networks over static systems. Tolerance of generalized networks to species extinctions was high in the random removal scenario, with an increase in network stability if species formed new interactions.

Female waterhemp plants were pollinated over a 24-h time period and then isolated from males. Two branches, each containing at least 500 flowers, were harvested from each female at the time of the initial pollination, designated as 0 d after pollination (DAP), as well as at multiple other times after pollination up to 62 DAP. One branch from each harvest was stored at 30 C for 48 h, while the other branch was stored at -20 C for 48 h. Branches were then stored at room temperature until all harvests were complete, at which time seeds from each branch at each time after pollination were collected, weighed, and stratified. Germination tests were then conducted to determine the time at which seeds become viable after pollination. Seeds that had not germinated by the end of the germination tests were subjected to tetrazolium testing for viability. Germination tests were also conducted on nonstratified seeds to investigate changes in seed dormancy that were expected to occur over the amount of time the seeds were allowed to remain on the plants. Seeds stored initially at 30 C postharvest became viable 7 to 9 DAP, whereas seeds stored initially at -20 C postharvest did not become mature until 11 DAP. Seed coat color was white soon after pollination and became dark brown to nearly black by 12 DAP, and seed weight increased until 12 DAP. Tetrazolium tests for seed viability correlated well with the germination tests. Germination tests on nonstratified seeds indicated that dormancy level was initially high in the population used, but began to decrease between 15 and 30 DAP.

Flower visitors, however, can potentially play multiple roles. The floral nectar in Croton suberosus has been proposed to operate as a reward for predators, especially the wasp Polistes instabilis (Vespidae), which kills herbivorous insects, while the plant has been thought to be mainly wind-pollinated. In this study, we reassessed the pollination mode of C. suberosus and the possible role of its flower visitors. Pollinator exclusion experiments demonstrated that C. suberosus should be considered a strictly entomophilous species. Inflorescences of C. suberosus were visited by a diverse entomofauna involving 28 taxa belonging to six orders; however, wasps and bees were the only visitors that carried C. suberosus pollen. The visitation rate of wasps was approximately four times that of bees. This observation, combined with the fact that the small size of bees makes effective contact of their bodies with the stigma difficult, strongly suggests that large wasps are responsible for most of the effective pollination of C. suberosus. Among the wasp visitors, P. instabilis seems to be one of the most important. These findings expose an unusual plant-insect interaction, in which the plant provides nectar and wasps pollinate and defend the plant. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",Bout duration; Croton suberosus; Euphorbiaceae; Mexico; Neotropical dry forest; Plant - animal interaction; Polistes instabilis; Pollen limitation; Pollen load; Pollination mode; Vespidae; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950115239

However, because self-compatibility is necessary for delayed selfing, discounting can be incurred if pollinators mediate selfing concurrently with outcrossing. The extent that pollinator-mediated selfing erodes the best-of-both-worlds mating strategy is largely unknown. In this study, we assess how delayed selfing and pollinator-mediated selfing contribute to reproductive output under contrasting pollination environments in Bulbine vagans (Asphodelaceae). We manipulated floral phenotype under contrasting weather conditions, plant densities and floral display. We emasculated flowers at early-flowering (allowing only outcrossing) or late-flowering (eliminating delayed selfing) stages and compared reproductive output with intact flowers (outcrossing + pollinator-mediated selfing + delayed selfing). During inclement weather, few or no pollinators visited flowers. Reproductive output was severely limited by cross pollen, and delayed selfing provided reproductive assurance. During fine weather, cross pollen was also limiting, but pollinator-mediated selfing boosted reproductive output before delayed selfing could occur. On isolated plants, flowers received fewer pollinator visits and reproductive output was limited more by cross pollen compared with grouped plants. Despite these differences, reproductive output of both isolated and grouped plants was boosted to similar levels by pollinator-mediated selfing before delayed selfing could occur. One- and three-flowered plants were similarly limited by cross pollen. On three-flowered plants, facilitated and geitonogamous selfing boosted reproductive output before delayed selfing could occur. By contrast, on one-flowered plants geitonogamy was eliminated, and pollinator-mediated selfing was reduced. This provided mating flexibility by retaining opportunities for subsequent outcrossing, although delayed selfing boosted reproductive output. Reproductive output was consistently limited by cross-pollination. Yet, delayed selfing provided reproductive assurance only during inclement weather and on one-flowered plants. Under other conditions, pollinators mediated selfing that could render ovules unavailable for outcrossing as selfing occurred and for outcrossing that might occur subsequently. We conclude that best-of-both-worlds flexibility will often be eroded by pollinator-mediated selfing that inevitability occurs with outcrossing. © 2009 The Authors.

In this paper I review current information on the natural history and evolutionary history of obligate pollination mutualism in Phyllantheae. Currently, an estimated >500 species are mutualistic with Epicephala moths that actively pollinate flowers and whose progeny feed on the resulting seeds. The Phyllantheae also includes species that are not mutualistic with Epicephala moths and are instead pollinated by bees and/or flies or ants. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the mutualism evolved independently five times within Phyllantheae, whereas active pollination behavior, a key innovation in this mutualism, evolved once in Epicephala. Reversal of mutualism has occurred at least once in both partner lineages, involving a Breynia species that evolved an alternative pollination system and a derived clade of Epicephala that colonized ant-pollinated Phyllantheae hosts and thereby lost the pollinating habit. The plant-moth association is highly species specific, although a strict one-to-one assumption is not perfectly met. A comparison of plant and moth phylogenies suggests signs of parallel speciation, but partner switches have occurred repeatedly at a range of taxonomic levels. Overall, the remarkable species diversity and multiple originations of the mutualism provide excellent opportunities to address many important questions on mutualism and the coevolutionary process.

We hypothesized that altitudinal variation in the pollinator assemblage is a principal factor mediating morphological and genetic differentiation among I. umbrosus populations. We examined determinants of the morphological and genetic differentiation of Isodon umbrosus by analyzing floral morphology and allozyme variation across the distributional range. A reanalysis of previous data confirmed that altitude was a good indicator of pollinator assemblages. Corolla tube length was highly variable among the 15 study populations, and genetic differentiation among the populations (GST = 0.360) was also highly significant. The differentiation in corolla tube length was explained by altitudinal difference, a proxy of the difference in pollinator assemblages. Genetic differentiation among populations also tended to be affected by the same factor, but statistical support was weak. To better understand the mechanisms responsible for morphological and genetic differentiation in I. umbrosus, we need to investigate altitudinally different populations over a narrower geographical scale. © 2010 The Authors.

Two ways to take a random sample of individuals from one cycle to generate the next that does not require artificial pollination are: 1) completely random (MACA), as in the ideal population (IP), 2) as in the IP but in two stages (MADE), first n families of half-sibs are randomly selected and then from each one of them m individuals are randomly selected. In the latter case, the subsequent random mating will allow crosses between half-sibs. The objective of this study was to determine the effective population size in terms of inbreeding (Ne (f)) of MADE and its relation to that of MACA (Ne(f)CA). As for MADE, it was considered that the size of the completely random sample was mn. Based on the variance of the number of gametes of an individual forming progeny, for MADE it was found that Ne (f) =[4mn - 2]/[m-(mn)-1+ 2 ], which implies that for a sample of constant size mn MADE increases its Ne (f) as m is smaller (and, consequently, n is larger) and for any value of n reaches its maximum when m=1; and only in this case is larger than the effective size of MACA that is always equal to nm. When mn is large, the Ne (f)/Ne (f)CA. ratio is reduced to approximately 4/(m+2); this means that when m=1, the effective size of MADE exceeds that of MACA (approximately 33.33 %); and with m=2 Ne (f) =Ne (f)CA It was found that in MADE the composition of the sample is very important in the collection or regeneration of plant genetic resources. For example, with a sample size mn=1000, Ne (f) can take values from 4 (with m=1000 and n=1) up to 1333.33 (with n=1000 and m=1).",Effective population size; Half-sib families; Ideal population; Random mating,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956432057

We tested for a possible genetic component for a preference of avocado bloom relative to competing bloom. The honey from each hive was extracted at the end of the avocado bloom and the concentration of perseitol, a carbohydrate that is unique to avocado, was analyzed as a measure for avocado foraging. During the first year, five bee strains were compared in three different sites in Israel. Significant differences were found between strains in honey perseitol concentrations, suggesting differences in their efficiency as avocado pollinators, although these differences were site dependent. At two sites, colonies with the highest and lowest perseitol concentrations were selected as parental ""high"" and ""low"" lines, Queens were raised from the selected colonies and were instrumentally inseminated by drones from other colonies of this line, During the second and third years, colonies with inseminated queens were introduced to the avocado orchards, together with the selected colonies still surviving from the previous year. Colonies of the high line had greater perseitol concentrations than those of the low line, Selected colonies that survived from the previous year performed consistently vis - vis perseitol concentration, in the second year of testing. Heritability value of 0.22 was estimated based on regression of offspring on midparent.

To investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships within Cyrtanthus, sequence data from the plastid ndhF gene and the ITS nrDNA region for 41 species were analyzed with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian-inference approaches. Various recombination detection algorithms were used to test for interspecific hybridization in the ITS alignment. The genus resolved as monophyletic, comprising three poorly to well-supported major lineages: a predominantly Afrotemperate lineage, largely restricted to seasonally moist sites in summer rainfall southern Africa, a subtropical lineage found mostly in nonseasonal rainfall regions, often in dry habitats, and a Cape Floristic Region-centered lineage in which most species are concentrated in the summer-dry to nonseasonal rainfall southwest. The ITS sequence alignment shows no evidence for reticulation between any of the species. Relationships inferred by the molecular data disagree with those derived from morphological data, but agree with previously published groupings based on karyotype morphology. Fitch optimization of selected floral characters on the combined gene tree reveals recurrent patterns of convergence. Ornithophilous floral forms occur in parallel among the three primary clades, putatively sphingophilous species are concentrated in the Afrotemperate lineage in seasonally moist upland grasslands; the brush-type Aeropetes tulbaghia butterfly and inferred long-proboscid fly pollination syndromes are unique in the Cape lineage. Macroecological factors inferred to have influenced the evolution of Cyrtanthus are changes in rainfall seasonality, the advent of fire, and the availability of new habitats at high and low altitudes and in rock-free soils or rock crevices. This study gives greater clarity on relationships within the genus and enables its division into three informal infrageneric groups. © 2009 SAAB.",Africa; Amaryllidaceae; Cyrtanthus; Floral morphology; Molecular systematics; Monocotyledons,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950857613

We hypothesized that an invasive mite Varroa destructor, which has caused honeybee decline in NZ, may cause pollinator limitation, so that the additional impact of B. villosus might now reach thresholds for population suppression. We performed manipulative pollination treatments and broad-scale surveys of pollination, seed rain and seed destruction by B. villosus to investigate how pollinator limitation and biocontrol interact throughout the NZ range of broom. The effect of reduced pollination in combination with seed-destruction was explored using a population model parameterized for NZ populations. Broom seed rain ranged from 59 to 21 416 seeds m-2 from 2004 to 2008, and was closely correlated with visitation frequency of honeybees and bumblebees. Infestation of broom seeds by B. villosus is expected to eventually reach 73% (the average rate observed at the localities adjacent to early release sites). The model demonstrated that 73% seed destruction, combined with an absence of honeybee pollination, could cause broom extinction at many sites and, where broom persists, reduce the intensity of treatment required to control broom by conventional means. Nevertheless, seed rain was predicted to be sufficient to maintain broom invasions over many sites in NZ, even in the presence of the varroa mite and B. villosus, largely due to the continued presence of commercial beehives that are treated for varroa mite infestation. Synthesis and applications. Reduced pollination through absence of honeybees can reduce broom seed set to levels at which biocontrol can be more effective. To capitalize on the impact of the varroa mite on feral honeybees, improved management of commercial beehives (for example, withdrawal of licences for beekeepers to locate hives on Department of Conservation land) could be used as part of a successful integrated broom management programme at many sites in NZ. © 2010 The Authors.

Conspecific pollen precedence and other reproductive barriers operating between pollination and seed germination may limit hybridization. This study investigates whether barriers at this stage contribute to reproductive isolation between these species and, if so, which mechanisms are responsible. Methods Pollen-tube lengths for pollen of both species in styles of both species were compared. Additionally, both species were pollinated with majority S. latifolia and majority S. dioica pollen mixes; then seed set, seed germination rates and hybridity of the resulting seedlings were determined using species-specific molecular markers. Key Results The longest pollen tubes were significantly longer for conspecific than heterospecific pollen in both species, indicating conspecific pollen precedence. Seed set but not seed germination was lower for flowers pollinated with pure heterospecific versus pure conspecific pollen. Mixed-species pollinations resulted in disproportionately high representation of nonhybrid offspring for pollinations of S. latifolia but not S. dioica flowers. Conclusions The finding of conspecific pollen precedence for pollen-tube growth but not seed siring in S. dioica flowers may be explained by variation in pollen-tube growth rates, either at different locations in the style or between leading and trailing pollen tubes. Additionally, this study finds a barrier to hybridization operating between pollination and seed germination against S. dioica but not S. latifolia pollen. The results are consistent with the underlying cause of this barrier being attrition of S. dioica pollen tubes or reduced success of heterospecifically fertilized ovules, rather than time-variant mechanisms. Post-pollination, pre-germination barriers to hybridization thus play a partial role in limiting introgression between these species. © 2010 The Author.",Conspecific pollen precedence; Hybridization; Pollen tubes; Reproductive isolation; Silene dioica; Silene latifolia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950984270

Heritability estimates indicated that genetic control of cell anatomy traits and wood density increased with cambial age, whereas the genetic control of MFA and MOE remained relatively low across growth rings. Wood density, radial cell diameter, cell wall thickness, and specific fibre surface were highly heritable, indicating that significant genetic gains could be expected in tree improvement programs, although cambial age at selection may strongly influence the magnitude of realized gains.

Similarly, internally ovipositing fig-parasitizing wasps and fig-pollinating wasps provide interesting models for comparative analysis. In addition to the fig-pollinating wasp Eupristina sp., we found that Ficus curtipes hosts two species of internally ovipositing fig-parasitizing wasps: D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. Eupristina sp. males showed less aggression. Eupristina sp. has wingless males that mate only within the natal patch, providing excellent examples of full local-mate competition. D. yangi males showed high levels of aggression and lethal combat. D. yangi has winged males but mate mostly within the natal patch. Only a few matings occur after male dispersal. Its sex ratio was lower than the prediction of partial local mate competition theory. Wingless male Lipothymus sp., which mate partly after dispersal, did not present fatal fight. Therefore, the mating behaviour of D. yangi and Lipothymus sp. did not follow predicted patterns, based on wing morph.

To understand the extent of genetic variability in 40 elite indigenous breeding lines of subtropical carrots, 48 DNA markers consisting of 16 inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), 10 universal rice primers (URPs), 16 random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and six simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used. These 48 markers amplified a total of 591 bands, of which 569 were polymorphic (096). Amplicon size ranged from 200 to 3500 base pairs (bp) in ISSR, RAPD and URPs markers and from 100 to 300 bp in SSR markers. The ISSR marker system was found to be most efficient with (GT)n motifs as the most abundant SSR loci in the carrot genome. The unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis of the combined data set of all the DNA markers obtained by four marker systems classified 40 genotypes in two groups with 045 genetic similarity with high Mantel matrix correlation (r=092). The principal component analysis (PCA) of marker data also explained 055 of the variation by first three components. Molecular diversity was very high and non-structured in these open-pollinated genotypes. The study demonstrated for the first time that URPs can be used successfully in genetic diversity analysis of tropical carrots. In addition, an entirely a new set of microsatellite markers, derived from the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) sequences of carrots, has been developed and utilized successfully. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951096130

Models predict that the costs of restoration are important determinants of population sex ratios. However, current approaches to the estimation of these costs require prior identification of CMS genotypes, information that is available for few species.We tested a novel approach to estimating the cost of restoration in natural populations without determining CMS or Rf genotypes. We used estimates of pollen viability and offspring sex ratios from open- and hand-pollinated families of Lobelia siphilitica to test whether the cost of restoration, expressed as low pollen viability, is higher in populations with more females.Among populations with CMS, we found that variation in pollen viability was higher in small populations with more females, as expected if the proportion of females within populations increases with the maximum cost of restoration. In controlled crosses, families with low pollen viability also produced fewer females, suggesting that variation in viability is primarily determined by the number and frequency of Rf alleles carried.This approach to estimating the cost of restoration can be applied to other cytonuclear gynodioecious species, offering new opportunities for testing gynodioecy models in the wild. © The Authors (2010).

True carpel closure, involving postgenital fusion of inner carpel margins, is inferred to have arisen once within the ancient order Nymphaeales, in the common ancestor of Nymphaeaceae. We studied pollen tube development, from pollination to fertilization, in a natural population of Nymphaea odorata, using hand pollinations and timed flower collections. Pollen germinates in stigmatic secretions within 15 min and pollen tubes enter subdermal transmitting tissue within an hour, following wide intercellular spaces towards the zone of postgenital fusion. At the zone of fusion they turn downwards to grow in narrow spaces between interlocked cells and then wander freely to ovules within ovarian secretions. The pollen-tube pathway is 2-6 mm long and upper ovules are first penetrated 2.5 h after pollination. Pollen tubes grow at rates of approximately 1 mm/h whether in stigmatic fluid, transmitting tissues or ovarian secretions. Pollen-tube pathways are structurally diverse across Nymphaeales, yet their pollen tubes have similar morphologies and rapid growth rates. This pattern suggests pollen tube growth innovations preceded and were essential for the evolution of complete carpel closure. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Angiospermy; Callose; Carpel; Character evolution; Growth rate; Hand-pollination; Homoplasy; Nymphaeales; Origin of angiosperms,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952762375

As the level of flower and fruit herbivory increased, the pattern of selection on floral-sex ratio went from stabilizing (with an optimum of 29% male flowers), to directional toward a lower proportion of males, with the optimum bottoming at 0% male. This pattern of selection likely helped generate the broad-sense genetic correlation (r = 0.42) between floral-sex ratio and resistance to herbivory.

In red anemones and poppies in Israel, female beetles occupy only a subset of the flowers, do not aggregate, and are hidden below the petals. This raises the question of how males find their mates. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that males and females orient to similar plant-generated cues, thereby increasing their mate encounter prospects. Previous studies have demonstrated that beetle attraction to red models increases with display area. Choice tests with flowers and with models indicate that both male and female beetles prefer large displays. In anemones, beetles rest, feed, and mate mainly on male-phase flowers, which are larger than female-phase flowers. Poppies that contain beetles are larger than the population average. These findings support the hypothesis that males and females meet by orienting to large red displays. Corolla size correlates with pollen reward in both plant species, suggesting that visits to large flowers also yield foraging benefits. Male beetles often jump rapidly among adjacent flowers. By contrast to the preference for large flowers by stationary individuals, these jump sequences are random with respect to flower sex-phase (in anemone) and size (in poppy). They may enable males to detect females at close range. We hypothesize that males employ a mixed mate-searching strategy, combining orientation to floral signals and to female-produced cues. The glaphyrids' preference for large flowers may have selected for extraordinarily large displays within the 'red anemone' pollination guild of the Levant. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Beetle pollination; Co-evolution; Display size; Glaphyridae; Mate searching; Red,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952790330

The reproductive ecology and inbreeding of a common coastal heath species, Boronia falcifolia (Rutaceae), was investigated. Pollination observations and experiments were carried out at one site, and inbreeding was assessed using genetic markers at eight populations. Four pollination treatments were assessed: cross-pollination, self-pollination, autogamous pollination and open (insect) pollination. Boronia falcifolia was found to be highly self-compatible, frequently setting seeds from autogamous pollination. There were no significant differences between the autogamous, self and cross pollen treatments for any measures of reproductive success (pollen tube growth, fruit set, swollen locules and seed production). Insect activity resulted in fewer seeds per fruit than hand cross pollination, although pollinator visits were few. All populations studied were highly inbred.

The aim of this study is to establish the dynamics of the Poaceae allergens and determine their distribution in the different-sized particles in the atmosphere. Methods: The air of Granada (southern Spain) was sampled during the pollination period of Poaceae using a cascade impactor and a Hirst-type volumetric collector simultaneously. The sampled airborne allergens were analyzed by indirect ELISA and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Airborne pollen was evaluated with the Spanish Aerobiological Network methodology. Results:Poaceae pollen and allergenic activity have parallel dynamics during the period of maximum pollination, which is reflected in the positive correlations between the 2 variables. In addition, the highest Lol p 1 concentrations were recorded in particle sizes lower than 3.3 ?m (stage 4-F). The Spearman correlation test showed that airborne allergens are not dependent on meteorological factors, such as humidity, wind direction or sunshine, however, Lol p 1 allergen correlated positively with Poaceae pollen. Conclusions: The results of the present study confirm that the Lol p 1 allergen is detected more frequently with pollutants than with coarse particles with similar dynamics and a positive correlation between airborne pollen and aeroallergens.

By combining three chloroplast and one nuclear loci, as well as AFLPs, a highly resolved tree with good statistical support was obtained. The phylogeny is in most parts in congruence with the traditional classification of the genus. By comparing the phylogeny with the data on the pollination biology of the genus we could show that the mimicry of faeces is the oldest and most basal pollination mechanism, but is also present in the youngest and most derived species.

However, defense-related mechanisms, such as the jasmonate response, play a more diverse role than previously appreciated. Jasmonates also regulate key mutualist relationships, leading to a suit of potential conflicting selection pressures as a single response is employed to mediate multiple species interactions. Here, we experimentally manipulate the host's jasmonate response and document the impact on two key plant mutualisms: (i) changes to arbuscular mycorrhizal symbionts belowground (ii) modifications to floral traits affecting pollinator mutualists aboveground. By exogenously applying a range of methyl jasmonate solutions to cucumber plant roots grown with and without mycorrhizal fungi, we are able to examine the potential costs of the jasmonate response to both above and belowground mutualists. We demonstrate that the negative effect of jasmonates on floral traits depends on whether the plant is mycorrhizal or nonmycorrhizal. Mycorrhization had a positive effect on floral traits, but benefits were lost with jasmonate application. While low levels of jasmonate decreased floral traits, these same jasmonate levels increased colonization by the mycorrhizal symbiont three-fold, but only under high phosphorus conditions. Our results highlight potential conflicts for the host in the regulation of their mutualists under different conditions and suggest that the overall impact of the jasmonate response depends on the plant mycorrhizal status and its nutrient context. These findings suggest that increasing the jasmonate response may lead to differential costs and benefits for plants and their mutualists, and highlight potential conflict in planta, with mycorrhizal symbionts benefiting from intermediate levels of jasmonates while certain floral traits can be depressed at this same level. © 2009 The Authors.

Hence, their flowering phenology is expected to be rigorously controlled by climatic factors. We studied ten alpine plant species from habitats with early and late melting snow cover for 2 years and compared the synchronizing effect of temperature sums (TS), time of snowmelt (SM) and photoperiod (PH) on their flowering phenology. Intraseasonal and habitat-specific variation in the impact of these factors was analysed by comparing predictions of time-to-event models using linear mixed-effects models. Temperature was the overwhelming trigger of flowering phenology for all species. Its synchronizing effect was strongest at or shortly after flowering indicating the particular importance of phenological control of pollination. To some extent, this pattern masks the common trend of decreasing phenological responses to climatic changes from the beginning to the end of the growing season for lowland species. No carry-over effects were detected. As expected, the impact of photoperiod was weaker for snowbed species than for species inhabiting sites with early melting snow cover, while for temperature the reverse pattern was observed. Our findings provide strong evidence that alpine plants will respond quickly and directly to increasing temperature without considerable compensation due to photoperiodic control of phenology. © 2009 The Authors.

Problems and effective conservation approaches for the species were also identified. Three subpopulations were located at 436 to 834 m elevation. Rafflesia manillana produced flowers and fruits from March till July, with more male flowers formed compared with female. The cytotaxonomic data confirmed the observed phenology of R. manillana. Mitotic chromosome number was 2n = 22. In Mt. Makiling, compared with Rafflesia in other locations, the threat to R. manillana was caused more by its sex ratio imbalance, unsuccessful pollination and seed dispersal, and habitat disturbances caused by tropical typhoons rather than direct human exploitation. The successful conservation of this species requires information on reproduction and dispersal of R. manillana and the biology of its host plant (Tetrastigma harmandii), which this study attempted to elucidate.

(Physic nut) is a commercially important non-edible oil seed crop known for its use as an alternate source of biodiesel. In order to investigate the morphogenic potential of immature embryo, explants from four developmental stages were cultured on medium supplemented with combinations of auxins and cytokinins. It was found that the size of embryo is critical for the establishment of callus. Immature embryos (1.1-1.5 cm) obtained from the fruits 6 weeks after pollination showed a good response of morphogenic callus induction (85.7%) and subsequent plant regeneration (70%) with the maximum number of plantlets (4.7/explant) on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium supplemented with IBA (0.5 mg l-1) and BA (1. 0 mg l-1). The above medium when supplemented with growth adjuvants such as 100 mg l-1 casein hydrolysate + 200 mg l-1l-glutamine + 8.0 mg l-1 CuSO4 resulted in an even higher frequency of callus induction (100%). Plant regeneration (90%) with the maximum number of plantlets (10/explant) was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 500 mg l-1 polyvinyl pyrrolidone + 30 mg l-1 citric acid + 1 mg l-1 BA + 0.5 mg l-1 Kn + 0.25 mg l-1 IBA. It was observed that plantlet regeneration could occur either through organogenesis of morphogenic callus or via multiplication of pre-existing meristem in immature embryos. The age of immature embryos and addition of a combination of growth adjuvants to the culture medium appear to be critical for obtaining high regeneration rates. Well-developed shoots rooted on half-strength MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg l-1 IBA and 342 mg l-1 trehalose.

While some plant conservation plans have focused on outcrossing through cross-pollination as a way to increase estimated Ne, variance in reproductive output determined by ecological factors such as competition can also strongly affect estimated Ne. We examined the effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition, stressful soils, and local adaptation on estimates of Ne in an annual plant species. While ecological influences on plant growth rate variance have been predicted to influence estimates of Ne/N, we found a significant effect on the estimate of Ne/N, but no significant ecological effects on growth rate variance. Lower survivorship on stressful soil was the most important effect reducing estimates of Ne/N. If stochastic mortality is greater in environments that are abiotically stressful, then populations in these stressful environments may be slower to adapt because of lower census sizes and reduction of Ne/N. In populations of conservation concern, increasing survivorship may be of greater benefit for maximizing Ne than the reduction of variability in reproductive output among surviving adults. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimal pollinated time of female catkins was confirmed as timing point for each treatment. When female catkins of P. pseudo-simonii × P. nigra 'Zheyin3#' had become 5.62 ±0.13 cm long 84 h after they emerged from their bract scales and all stigmas were exposed, pistils all over the entire catkin had optimal stigma receptivity. Observation of paraffin sections showed that embryo sac development of 'Zheyin3#', which initiated 12 h before pollination and finished 132 h after pollination, was a successive and asynchronous process. Generative cell division of pollen of the male parent P. × beijingensis took place 3-16 h after pollination. Catkins of 18-96 h after pollination of 'Zheyin3#' were treated with colchicine solution. In the progeny, twenty three triploids were detected by chromosome counting and the highest rate of triploids was 66.7% in one treatment. The rate of triploid yield was positively correlated with the frequency of four-nucleate embryo sacs (r = 0.6721, p = 0.0981) and was not significantly correlated with the percentages of uni-, twoand eight-nucleate embryo sac (r = -0.1667, p = 0.7210, r = -0.3069, p = 0.5031 and r = 0.0189, p = 0.9679, respectively), suggesting that the third mitotic division of embryo sac may be the effective stage to induce 2n eggs. Through this approach, completely homozygous 2n eggs can be produced.

We have isolated chromosomal linker histones from developing maize kernels before (11 days after pollination, dap) and after (16 dap) initiation of storage synthesis. Six linker histone gene products were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A marked shift of around 4 pH units was observed for the linker histone spot pattern after 2D-gel electrophoresis when comparing the proteins of 11 and 16 dap kernels. The shift from acidic to more basic protein forms suggests a reduction in the level of post-translational modifications of linker histones during kernel development. Analysis of their DNA-binding affinity revealed that the different linker histone gene products bind double-stranded DNA with similar affinity. Interestingly, the linker histones isolated from 16 dap kernels consistently displayed a lower affinity for DNA than the proteins isolated from 11 dap kernels. These findings suggest that the affinity for DNA of the linker histones may be regulated by post-translational modification and that the reduction in DNA affinity could be involved in a more open chromatin during storage synthesis. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",2D-gel electrophoresis; Chromatin; DNA interaction; H1; Linker histone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950536652

The genus Ipomoea is a pan tropically distributed plant genus characterized by showy flowers that often differ in color among closely related species. Flower color is determined primarily by products of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. To determine whether flower color evolution among members of the genus is driven by adaptive molecular evolution of the anthocyanin pathway genes, we analyzed data from 10 genes sequenced from 19 species of Ipomoea. Six protein-coding genes from the anthocyanin pathway were drawn for evolutionary analysis in addition to three genes from the unrelated leucine biosynthesis pathway and one MADS box regulatory gene for comparison. The analyses provided: (i) no convincing evidence for positive selection on anthocyanin pathway structural genes, or on the other sampled genes, despite shifts in flower color among species included in the sample; (ii) pathway position correlated weakly with estimates of the intensity of evolutionary constraint on the anthocyanin pathway enzyme coding genes; and (iii) there was substantial gene-specific heterogeneity in the rates of synonymous site evolution. Synonymous rate heterogeneity does not appear to be accounted for by codon bias or local contextual or compositional sequence differences, leading us to implicate heterogeneous rates of mutation among genes as the most probable cause of synonymous rate heterogeneity. © 2010 The Authors.

Average sucrose concentration was 57.75% (coefficient of variation 19.1%). The only floral morphological character that was correlated with the nectar-sugar profile is the length of the corolla tube, as taxa with relatively long floral tubes produce nectar with lower glucose concentrations. The flowering period is also related to sugar composition, as nectar of late-flowering species contains lower sucrose concentrations.

Treatments were pollenizer cultivars planted singly ['Companion', 'Super Pollenizer 1' ('SP1'), 'Summer Flavor 800' ('SF800'), and 'Mickylee'] or in pairs ('Companion' + 'SP1', 'Companion' + 'SF800', and 'SP1' + 'SF800'). All pollenizers from these seven treatments were interplanted with the triploid cultivar Tri-X-313. Planting arrangement was compared by establishing 'SF800' in a hill versus an interplanted field arrangement. Effect of pollenizer establishment timing on triploid fruit yields and quality was evaluated by establishing 'SP1' 3 weeks after planting and comparing it with the establishment of 'SP1' at the time of triploid plant establishment. Finally, a triploid planting with no pollenizer (control) was included to determine pollen movement. Fruit yield from the control was 22% or less of yield of the other treatments containing a pollenizer and less than 10% in the initial or early harvests. Pollen movement was minimal among plots and differences in yield and fruit quality could be attributed to pollenizer treatment. In 2005, the use of 'Companion', 'SP1', or 'Mickylee' as pollenizers produced similar total yields, whereas 'SF800' produced the lowest yield. In 2005, 'Companion' produced more large fruit than the other individual pollenizer treatments. Combining the pollenizers generally did not enhance triploid yields or quality. Interplanting of pollenizers consistently resulted in greater yield compared with the hill system. Late planting of 'SP1' increased the incidence of hollow heart in the marketable fruit and decreased yield compared with simultaneously planting 'SP1' and triploid plants. Thus, selection of pollenizer, planting arrangement, and time of pollenizer establishment are all important considerations to optimizing triploid yield and quality.",Citrullus lanatus; Diploid; Honey bee; Interplant; Plant establishment; Pollination; Seedless; Spacing; Timing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952075621

The regenerants produced roots on half strength MS medium supplemented with 0.27 ?M NAA. Phenotypically, the S. alatum × S. indicum hybrid plants were intermediate to those of parents for majority of the traits.

This review compiles information from available literature on Prunus species in regard to gene flow and hybridization within this complex of species. The review serves as a resource for environmental risk assessment related to pollen mediated gene flow and the release of transgenic Prunus. It reveals that Prunus species, especially plums and cherries show high potential for transgene flow. A range of characteristics including; genetic diversity, genetic bridging capacity, inter-and intra-specific genetic compatibility, self sterility (in most species), high frequency of open pollination, insect assisted pollination, perennial nature, complex phenotypic architecture (canopy height, heterogeneous crown, number of flowers produced in an individual plant), tendency to escape from cultivation, and the existence of ornamental and road side Prunus species suggest that there is a tremendous and complicated ability for pollen mediated gene movement among Prunus species. Ploidy differences among Prunus species do not necessarily provide genetic segregation. The characteristics of Prunu s species highlight the complexity of maintaining coexistence between GM and non-GM Prunus if there were commercial production of GM Prunus species. The results of this review suggest that the commercialization of one GM Prunus species can create coexistence issues for commercial non-GM Prunus production. Despite advances in molecular markers and genetic analysis in agroecology, there remains limited information on the ecological diversity, metapopulation nature, population dynamics, and direct measures of gene flow among different subgenera represented in the Prunus genus.

Life-history traits of a seven-member community of galler and parasitoid fig wasp species (Chalcidoidea), developing within the inflorescences (syconia) of Ficus racemosa (Moraceae) in India, were determined and used to examine community structure and ecology. Gallers were pro-ovigenic (all eggs are mature upon adult emergence) whereas parasitoids were synovigenic (eggs mature progressively during adult lifespan). Initial egg load was correlated with body size for some species, and there was a trade-off between egg number and egg size across all species. Although all species completed their development and left the syconium concurrently, they differed in their adult and pre-adult lifespans. Providing sucrose solutions increased parasitoid lifespan but had no effect on the longevity of some galler species. While feeding regimes and body size affected longevity in most species, an interaction effect between these variables was detected for only one species. Life-history traits of wasp species exhibited a continuum in relation to their arrival sequence at syconia for oviposition during syconium development, and therefore reflected their ecology. The largest number of eggs, smallest egg sizes, and shortest longevities were characteristic of the earliest-arriving galling wasps at the smallest, immature syconia; the converse characterised the later-arriving parasitoids at the larger, already parasitised syconia. Thus life history is an important correlate of community resource partitioning and can be used to understand community structure. This is the first comprehensive study of life-history traits in a fig wasp community. The comparative approach revealed constraints and flexibility in trait evolution. © 2010 The Authors.

In the present study, we examined a contact zone between Serapias vomeracea and Serapias cordigera, two unrewarding Mediterranean orchid species with a non-specific pollination strategy. Fruit production and seed viability from interspecific hand-pollination treatments pointed out the weaknesses of post-pollination barriers. The occurrence of hybridization was molecularly confirmed in the genus Serapias for the first time, as parts of plants with a transitional morphology were observed in both alleles of the parental LEAFY intron. Amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that plants with uncertain morphology and classified as one of the other parental species are actually backcrosses, attesting to an extensive interspecific gene exchange. Overall, the contact zone is more similar to a hybrid zone of Ophrys species, well known for their highly specialized pollination, than to a hybrid zone of unspecialized food-deceptive orchids. Therefore, species boundaries in Serapias are maintained by pre-pollination mechanisms that need to be better investigated. In light of the intriguing similarities between Serapias and Ophrys underlined by the present study, we hypothesize that the emission of floral scents could be involved in the maintenance of species boundaries in Serapias. © 2010 The Authors.

Analysis of floral chemistry revealed no differences in the emission of the floral attractants benzylacetone and benzaldehyde or in the concentrations of nectar sugar and nicotine between wild-type and ir-pi flowers, suggesting that these two lines are equally able to attract insect visitors. TPI activity was found in all wild-type flower parts and was highest in anther heads, while TPI activity was not found in any parts of ir-pi flowers. The nectar of ir-pi flowers contained 3.6-fold more total proteins than the nectar of wild-type flowers. Proteomics analysis and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) measurements revealed that ir-pi nectar contained more nectarins and nectar germin-like proteins and about 1.5-fold more H2O2 compared with wild-type nectar. Field experiments with wild-type flowers supplemented with a solution containing sugar and glucose oxidase demonstrated a causal association between the accumulation of H2O2 and the reduction in nectar removal. These results showed that silencing TPI expression increases the accumulation of nectar proteins and H2O2 levels, which in turn reduces nectar removal by native insect floral visitors. The effect of silencing TPIs on nectar protein accumulation suggests an endogenous regulatory function for TPIs in N. attenuata flowers.

Results indicated that a number of tree species native to eastern U.S. forests of southern latitudes are currently present in northern urban forests. The biomass density (Mg/ha) of urban tree species is typically less than half of forestland densities with the majority of urban tree species found in nearby (<100 km) forestland. Urban tree propagation is often facilitated by humans, whereas the necessary pollinators and agents of tree seed dispersal in forestlands may be lacking regardless of climate change.

Fruit are large with a mass normally higher than 150 g, are oblate in shape, seedless in absence of cross-pollination and ripen in December. The overall aspects of 'Bellezza' mandarins are very attractive with deep orange peel colour and aromatic juicy flesh. Objective of this trial was: a) to compare the physico-chemical and nutritional characteristics of 'Bellezza' mandarins with the fruit of the parents; and b) to study their storability under retailing conditions for two weeks. Juice pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids, ascorbic acid, total phenols, sucrose glucose, fructose, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity were periodically monitored. The results indicate that 'Bellezza' mandarins ripen later than the parents and hold well on tree until the end of December.

We evaluated models including local and landscape factors that might influence the bee and butterfly richness of community gardens located within densely populated neighborhoods of the Bronx and East Harlem in New York City (&gt;10,000 people/km2). The gardens were surrounded by buildings and limited amounts of green space (3,600-17,400 building units and 10-32% green space within a 500 m radius). Contrary to our initial prediction that landscape green space might be especially influential in this heavily urbanized setting, the most highly supported models for both bee and butterfly richness (based on Akaike Information Criterion) included just the local, within-garden variables of garden floral area and sunlight availability. There was marginal support for models of bee richness including the number of building units surrounding gardens within a 500 m radius (which exhibited a negative association with bee richness). In addition, perhaps because bees are central place foragers that may nest within or near gardens, supported models of bee species richness also included total garden area, canopy cover, and the presence of wild/unmanaged area in the garden. Generally, our findings indicate that sunlight and floral abundance are the major factors limiting local pollinator diversity in this setting. This suggests that rooftop and other ""open"" urban habitats might be managed to increase local pollinator diversity, even if seemingly ""isolated"" within heavily developed neighborhoods. © 2010 The Author(s).",Community gardens; Green space; Modeling species richness; New York City; Urban biodiversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954542639

(Gentianaceae), a protandrous, insect-pollinated species at risk. Pollination processes were explored in disturbed and non-disturbed sites in both high and low density patches on each of three lakes in southwest Nova Scotia, Canada. The primary pollinators were Syrphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Halictid bees (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). Pollinator diversity was not significantly different among lakes or sites. High flowering density plots were visited significantly more frequently than low density plots in all site types; pollination rates and handling time were significantly lower in disturbed compared to non-disturbed sites, such that pollinators both visited and spent less time handling flowers in disturbed sites. The reproductive success of open-pollinated flowers was significantly different among lakes; there was also a disturbance by lake interaction with higher reproductive success on disturbed sites in two of the lakes. Thus, this study finds evidence of reduced pollination service together with a beneficial reproductive effect of disturbance. The significance of these results and the possibility that the spatial genetic structure of disturbed sites is reduced are discussed. We conclude that reduced pollination service and changes in the genetic structure of populations demonstrate the potentially negative impact of human associated activities on pollinator activity and plant reproductive strategy. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Lakeshore development; North American Atlantic Coastal Plain flora; Plymouth gentian; Pollination service; Sabatia kennedyana; Species at risk,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956013095

In the F2 population developed with true F1 hybrids, the chi square test was not significant for the deviation from the expected 3:1 (dormant: non-dormant) ratio.

The average frequency (48%) of true F1 hybrids give evidence that deviations from expected ratios in the populations (F2 and BC1P1S) developed from non-tested F1 individuals, is most likely due to inadvertent selfs.

For example, mutualistic associations formed with pollinators or seed dispersers may facilitate invasion, but reduced fitness from attack by native herbivores can also suppress it. Since population expansion depends on effective seed dispersal, interactions with seed dispersers and predators in a plant species introduced range may be of particular importance. We explored the relative contributions of potential seed dispersers (ants) and vertebrate predators (rodents and birds) to seed removal of two diplochorous (i.e., wind- and ant-dispersed), invasive thistles, Cirsium arvense and Carduus nutans, in Colorado, USA. We also conducted behavior trials to explore the potential of different ant species to disperse seeds, and we quantified which potential ant dispersers were prevalent at our study locations. Both ants and vertebrate predators removed significant amounts of C. arvense and C. nutans seed, with the relative proportion of seed removed by each guild varying by location. The behavior trials revealed clear seed preferences among three ant species as well as differences in the foragers' abilities to move seeds. In addition, two ant species that acted as potential dispersal agents were dominant at the study locations. Since local conditions in part determined whether dispersers or predators removed more seed, it is possible that some thistle populations benefit from a net dispersal effect, while others suffer proportionally more predation. Additionally, because the effectiveness of potential ant dispersers is taxon-specific, changes in ant community composition could affect the seed-dispersal dynamics of these thistles. Until now, most studies describing dispersal dynamics in C. arvense and C. nutans have focused on primary dispersal by wind or pre-dispersal seed predation by insects. Our findings suggest that animal-mediated dispersal and post-dispersal seed predation deserve further consideration. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ants; Elaiosome; Mutualism; Myrmecochory; Seed dispersal; Vertebrate predators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956012846

Stable androdioecy is rare in nature, and theory suggests that it requires that males sire more than twice as many offspring as hermaphrodites. In several members of the olive family (Oleaceae), androdioecy occurs with higher frequencies of males than predicted by theory. In Phillyrea angustifolia L., we found that high male frequencies can be maintained in natural populations because hermaphrodites belong exclusively to one of two self-incompatibility groups, and thus, each can fertilize only half of all pollen recipients. In contrast, males can pollinate all hermaphrodites.

Depending on their range of action, these signals coordinate the growth of cells within an organ or the growth of different organs in a larger, functionally integrated structure [3-7]. In plants, flowers are such integrated structures, yet it remains poorly understood how growth of the constituent organs is coordinated to ensure their correct relative sizes. The cytochrome P450 KLUH/CYP78A5 and its homolog CYP78A7 promote organ growth via a non-cell-autonomous signal [8-10]; however, the range of this signal and thus its developmental function are unknown. Here we use a system for the predictable generation of chimeric plants to determine the range of the KLUH-dependent signal. In contrast with the largely autonomous behavior of another tested growth-control gene, we find that KLUH activity extends beyond individual organs and flowers. Its overall activity is integrated across an inflorescence to determine final organ size, which is largely independent of the genotype of the individual organs. Thus, the KLUH-dependent signal appears to move beyond individual organs in a flower, providing a mechanism for coordinating their growth and ensuring floral symmetry as an important determinant of a plant's attractiveness to pollinators [11]. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Vass., a rare desert species endemic to central Asia, was examined by a series of observational studies and manipulative experiments in two natural populations during 2007-2008. Results showed that the duration of flowering lasted 21 and 23 days, respectively, in Populations A and B from late May to late June in 2008. Anthesis of a single flower often lasted for 3 days. However, if pollinators were excluded, both the anthesis and stigma receptivity lasted 2 days longer. Mating-system experiment showed that E. songoricum was self-compatible and pollination success relied on pollinators. Fruit set after bagging without emasculation was 0.02±0.01%. This suggested that spontaneous autogamy rarely happened. E. songoricum primarily relies on a combination of large floral display, secretion of nectar and a yellow 'nectar guide' on the standard to further attract pollinators, which may be the result of adaptation to a habitat with unreliable access to pollinators. A single flower produced ?0.18?L and 0.50?L of nectar during 2 days in Populations A and B, respectively. The peak secretion occurred at 1300-1500hours, which overlapped with the climax of visitation of the effective pollinators at 1300-1400hours. There were four effective pollinators in both populations, namely Colletes popovi Nosk., Megachile terminate Morawitz, Coelioxys sp. and Bembix planifrons F.Mor. The most frequent one, Colletes popovi Nosk., was observed pollinating many flowers of the same individual plant (65.8±1.1%) in Population A, suggesting that geitonogamous self-pollination is unavoidable.

To overcome postzygotic barriers, transfer of hybrid embryos to new medium is necessary. We carried out detailed ultrastructural analyses to establish: (i) at which stage of embryo development the first signs of programmed cell death (PCD) could be detected; and (ii) at which stage the lack of serious or irreversible changes guaranteed that advanced development of hybrid plants could occur after embryo rescue. Transmission electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the presence of both developing and degenerating embryos. Developing globular, heart-shaped, and early cotyledonary embryos contained cells of correct ultrastructure. The only sign of intergeneric hybridisation was a delay in development for a few days, in comparison with control embryos. The earliest indicators of embryo degeneration were noted at 9 days after pollination (DAP). The most common indicators were excessive embryo vacuolisation, which was characterised by a large number of vesicles and formation of small vacuoles, as well as enlarged central vacuoles. Extended plastid thylakoids, folding of the cell wall, and autophagosomes were observed. Our detailed investigation of PCD in hybrid embryos enabled us to conclude that the embryo rescue technique was most effective in intergeneric willow×poplar crosses if applied between 9 and 16 DAP. © 2010 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949402345

We quantified effects of an invasion by a nonnative grass on the insect community in grasslands of southeastern Arizona. We sampled insects on 54 1-ha plots established across a gradient of invasion by Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees), a perennial species native to southern Africa. Between 2000 and 2004, we captured 94,209 insects representing 13 orders, 91 families, and 698 morphospecies during 2,997 trap nights. Richness of families, richness of morphospecies, and overall abundance of insects decreased as dominance of nonnative grass increased. With every 100 g/m2 increase in biomass of nonnative grass, the average number of insect families decreased by 5%, morphospecies decreased by 6%, and overall abundance decreased by 14%. In areas dominated by nonnative grass, 2 of 8 orders and 6 of 27 families of insects were present less frequently and one family was present more frequently; 5 of 8 orders and 6 of 27 families of insects were less abundant and 3 families were more abundant than in areas dominated by native grasses. As a result, this plant invasion altered the structure of the insect community, which has consequences for animals at higher trophic levels and for ecosystem processes, including decomposition and pollination. Because complete eradication of nonnative plants might be possible only rarely, maintaining stands of native vegetation in invaded areas may be an important practical strategy to foster persistence of animals in grasslands invaded by nonnative plants. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Eragrostis lehmanniana; Grasslands; Invertebrates; Lehmann lovegrass; Nonnative plants; Phytophagous insects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956885224

Air quality in South of France and more specifically in Nice, is known to be bad, especially in summer. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test has been developed for detecting and estimating monotonic trends in the time series and applied in our study at annual values of pollutants air concentrations and mortality. An important objective of many environmental monitoring programs is to detect changes or trends in pollution levels over time. Over the period 1990-2005, concerning the emissions of main pollutants, we obtained significant decreasing trends. By considering the ozone mean values in urban areas over the 1997-2005 period, an increase of 3.0% year- 1 was obtained with annual averages and 3.9% year- 1 with median values. A clear increasing trend for PM10 ambient concentrations is obtained. In addition, we observed an increase of the Olea (and Grass) pollination season. Over the same period, an annual change rate of +0.31% year- 1 for ""airway diseases"" and of + 2.50% year- 1 for ""unknown causes"" were identified in the ""Alpes Maritimes"" county. To see the results, there seems to be a short-term link between the levels of these pollutants and mortality for respiratory causes. The other pollutants concentration showed a downward trend reflecting the reduction policy of the emissions. In addition, we obtained significant decreasing trends concerning the ""ischemic heart diseases"" (- 1.20% year- 1) and ""asthma"" (- 4.03% year- 1) categories.

The outcrossing rate was evaluated using 300 open-pollinated offspring from 25 seed-trees. Pollen dispersal was measured by parentage analysis. We used spatial genetic structure (SGS) to test the minimal distance for harvesting seeds in conservation and breeding programs. Our data indicate that the populations studied had a high degree of genetic diversity (?e =0.619) and population structure, as suggested by the high level of divergence among populations (?ST =0.803). The estimated outcrossing rate (t?m =0.711) suggested a mixed mating system, and the intrapopulation fixation index was influenced by SGS.

Flowering and fruiting phenology was monitored in neighbouring burned and unburned forests. The shrubs flowered and fruited in both sites, but the small trees did so only in the unburned site. There is no overlapping in the flowering and fruiting phenophases between the natives and the exotic species. Therefore, they do not compete in resource offering to pollinators and seed dispersers.

The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with heat susceptibility index (HSI) of yield components in response to a short-term heat shock during early grain-filling in wheat. The HSI was used as an indicator of yield stability and a proxy for heat tolerance. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the heat tolerant cultivar 'Halberd' and heat sensitive cultivar 'Cutter' was evaluated for heat tolerance over 2 years in a controlled environment. The RILs and parental lines were grown in the greenhouse and at 10 days after pollination (DAP) half the plants for each RIL received a three-day heat stress treatment at 38°C/18°C day/night, while half were kept at control conditions of 20°C/18°C day/night. At maturity, the main spike was harvested and used to determine yield components. A significant treatment effect was observed for most yield components and a HSI was calculated for individual components and used for QTL mapping. QTL analysis identified 15 and 12 QTL associated with HSI in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Five QTL regions were detected in both years, including QTL on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, and 3B. These same regions were commonly associated with QTL for flag leaf length, width, and visual wax content, but not with days to flowering. Pleiotropic trade-offs between the maintenance of kernel number versus increasing single kernel weight under heat stress were present at some QTL regions. The results of this study validate the use of the main spike for detection of QTL for heat tolerance and identify genomic regions associated with improved heat tolerance that can be targeted for future studies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Abiotic; Genetic mapping; Heat stress; QTL; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954214996

Although micro-organisms represent the 'unseen majority' of species, individuals and biomass in many ecosystems and play pivotal roles in community development and function, the study of the factors influencing the assembly of microbial communities has lagged behind that of plant and animal communities. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the mechanisms accounting for the low species richness of yeast communities inhabiting the nectar of the bumble-bee-pollinated Hetteborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae), and explore the relationships between community assembly rules and phylogenetic relatedness. By comparing yeast communities on the glossae of foraging bumble-bees (the potential species pool) with those eventually establishing in virgin nectar probed with bee glossae (the realized community), we address the questions: (i) does nectar filter yeast inocula, so that the communities eventually established there are not random subsamples of species on bumble-bee glossae? and (ii) do yeast communities establishing in H. foetidus nectar exhibit some phylogenetic bias relative to the species pool on bumble-bee glossae? Results show that nectar filtering leads to species-poor, phylogenetically clustered yeast communities that are a predictable subset of pollinator-borne inocula. Such strong habitat filtering is probably due to H. foetidus nectar representing a harsh environment for most yeasts, where only a few phylogenetically related nectar specialists physiologically endowed to tolerate a combination of high osmotic pressure and fungicidal compounds are able to develop. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Community assembly rules; Environmental filtering; Helleborus foetidus; Metschnikowia; Nectar yeast communities; Phylogenetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649218207

However, there have been sightings of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris during the warmer winters in recent years in southern England. But what floral resources are they relying upon during winter and how much winter forage can they collect? Methodology/Principal Findings: To test if urban areas in the UK provide a rich foraging niche for bees we set up colonies of B. terrestris in the field during two late winter periods (2005/6 & 2006/7) in London, UK, and measured their foraging performance. Fully automatic radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology was used in 2006/7 to enable us to record the complete foraging activity of individually tagged bees. The number of bumblebees present during winter (October 2007 to March 2008) and the main plants they visited were also recorded during transect walks. Queens and workers were observed throughout the winter, suggesting a second generation of bee colonies active during the winter months. Mass flowering shrubs such as Mahonia spp. were identified as important food resources. The foraging experiments showed that bees active during the winter can attain nectar and pollen foraging rates that match, and even surpass, those recorded during summer. Conclusions/Significance: B. terrestris in the UK are now able to utilise a rich winter foraging resource in urban parks and gardens that might at present still be under-exploited, opening up the possibility of further changes in pollinator phenology. © 2010 Stelzer et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949725030

Field experiments were conducted using two original synthetic populations derived from different genetic pools; the control populations (C) and two upward (S+), and two downward (S-) selected populations. In these populations, design and display of floral traits grouped into functional categories was studied. Outcrossing rates were estimated using codominant isozyme markers, and the mixed mating and the multilocus methods. The simultaneous responses of functional floral traits to selection for allogamy/autogamy were analyzed by using multivariate Discriminant Analysis. Whether selection was for increased or decreased outcrossing, the four selected groups shifted in the opposite direction of the selected type. Discriminant Analysis revealed how the patterns of increased or decreased outcrossing in the selected populations were due to a concordant multidimensional change in floral traits, thus limiting or contra-balancing the effects of artificial selection. Indirect selection does not act on traits individually, but on combinations of traits that are functionally integrated. Our results provide evidence that evolution towards self-fertilization has occurred by different genetic pathways after upward selection for outcrossing. This occurrence was by autogamous and by geitonogamous selfing. For the improvement of faba bean populations in the context of sustainable agriculture, direct selection on outcrossing cannot be a selection criterion. However, floral traits, in combination with pollinator behaviour, should be used as indirect selection criteria to increase allogamy. This approach, in turn, will allow the development of both pollinator-friendly varieties and enhance the environmental services of faba beans. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Apis mellifera is not native to the United States and the first record of this species in the United States was during the early to mid 17th century when European settlers brought it to the United States. The mitochondrial DNA COI-COII intergenic region of A. mellifera exhibits a high degree of genetic variability within and among A. mellifera lineages and is useful for differentiating lineages as well as detecting unique mitotypes. We conducted a study of the genetic diversity of honey bees from central and south central United States from primarily feral populations. Of the 469 samples from 14 states subjected to DNA sequencing we found evidence of four mitotypes from the 'O' lineage: O5, O5d, O5""b, and O2. Only one of these mitotypes, O2, has been previously observed (in Lebanon). Within the feral population, this lineage accounted for 5% of the observed mitotypes. Of the 24 'O' lineage samples mitotype O5 was the most common and accounted for 52% of the total observed 'O' mitotypes. Bayesian and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic analysis revealed that O2, O5, and O5d were more closely related to those found in Libya (O5b, O5a, O4a, O4b), Lebanon (O1b, O2, O3), and Egypt (O1c). However, O5""b appears to have no close relationship to any of the other mitotypes. The existence of the Middle Eastern 'O' lineage in the south central and central United States suggests that further molecular genetic studies of the honey bee population is needed for utilizing and conserving the genetic variation which most likely exists in the Unites States. Furthermore, this study also suggests that feral honey bees are surviving despite the introduction of the varroa mite in the 1980s which reduced the feral and managed populations.",Apis mellifera; COI-COII intergenic region; Middle Eastern honey bee; mtDNA; O lineage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77349111737

Fruit initiation was pollen limited, but fruit maturation was not. This limiting effect varied between flowering seasons and between populations, and also within a given phenological stage. In the first season, the early flowers had the lowest fruit set, while in the second season fruit set was highest in these early flowers. This was possibly related to the pollination environment. Seed initiation (fertilized ovules) increased following pollen supplementation, but this was not translated into a significant increase in either the number of seeds per fruit, or seed mass. This indicates that seed initiation is pollen limited but that other factors (e. g., resource availability) are involved in seed maturation. Abiotic factors such as excess humidity during flowering were responsible for the loss of inflorescences, especially in one of the two populations. In this population, the prevailing wind in autumn-winter was less effective in drying the flowers when there was excess humidity. Also, significantly fewer inflorescences were lost from solitary plants than from clustered plants, probably reflecting the beneficial action of the wind and the greater light levels during flowering. Of the biotic factors analyzed, sheep predation was the most important, being worse in drought years. This predation, by affecting population density, could modify the plant-pollinator interaction and severely reduce the plant's breeding success because of its pollen limitation. © Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic 2009.",Abiotic factors; Fertilization; Herbivory; Offspring; Pollen limitation; Predation; Sheep,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950690072

Following this rationale, centrality measures can be used to (i) identify keystone species in ecological networks, a major issue in community ecology, and (ii) differentiate the keystone species concept, e.g. species may play a key role in a network for different topological reasons. In 34 pollination communities we examine the relationship between the generalization level of species (ND) and two complementary centrality indices: closeness (CC) and betweenness centrality (BC). CC measures the proximity of a species to all other species in the community, while BC describes the importance of a species as a connector. Most networks had a linear ND-CC relationship with a minimum CC value of 0.41. Hence, species were close to each and will be likely to be rapidly affected by disturbances. Contrarily, in most networks, the ND-BC relationships were power-law distributed with exponents larger than one. Only 59% of the species were connectors (BC > 0). In particular, there was a connector threshold value of ND = 0.46. Species above this threshold represent ?40%, almost all of which were connectors. These results indicate that in pollination systems the most generalized species are usually network keystone species, playing at least two roles: (i) interact closely with most other species (high CC) and (ii) connect otherwise unconnected subnetworks (high BC).

Putting these two results together, previous research reported that population growth rate ? was negatively impacted by high pollination. Thus, costs and benefits have to be translated into the common currency of their respective effects on population dynamics to determine whether populations are truly pollen limited or whether they are already at an optimal level of pollination. Also, when pollinators and demography vary from year to year we require a framework that examines reproductive benefits and demographic costs in the context of a variable environment. Whether or not additional pollination will increase the stochastic population growth rate ?S depends upon the balance of stochastic elasticities of the costs and benefits. In constant environment models, where seed survival, germination and seedling survival were increased, we found that the high cost of reproduction could be offset by improvements in seed survival and germination, but not by improvements of seedling survival. In variable environment models, where changes in the sequence and frequencies of high- and low-pollination years mixed with occasional high-germination years were modelled, we found that increasing the frequency of high-germination conditions could offset the cost of reproduction, and the offset was even greater if high-germination years occurred after a high-pollination year or if high pollination was accompanied by high-germination conditions in the same year. Both deterministic ? and stochastic ?S were less sensitive to perturbation of reproduction than to perturbation of the probability for flowering plants to remain reproductive. In other words, a small change in the parameter which is related to the 'cost' of reproduction had a bigger effect than a small change in the parameter which is related to the 'benefit' of increased pollination for Lathyrus. Synthesis. Stochastic environment-specific elasticities for reproduction and stasis of flowering plants differ in their response to environmental context. The cost-benefit relationships, the ultimate fitness consequences of supplemental pollen, are influenced by the frequency and sequence of years differing in pollen availability and recruitment conditions. © 2010 The Authors.

The models are simplistic, but the majority have the virtue that their solution is feasible by using data that is easy to collect. The models provide first approximations that could be useful to ecologists and conservationists when they must guess the potential impacts of exotic pollinators.

Here, we tested the hypotheses that (i) the invasive plant Impatiens glandulifera outcompetes native plant communities for pollinators, and (ii) pollinator abundances depend on landscape structure, but are modulated by this mass-flowering invader. We selected 14 study sites in riparian habitats along a landscape gradient with decreasing proportion of natural land cover. Within each site paired invaded or non-invaded plots were studied. We performed standardized surveys of pollinators and established experimental plots by adding the native plant Raphanus sativus to assess the impact of I. glandulifera on visitation rates and seed set. Impatiens glandulifera was well integrated in the plant-pollinator network, being visited by several native pollinators, mainly bumblebees. The invader received higher visitation rates than simultaneously flowering native riparian plants and the experimentally added native R. sativus. However, visitation rates to the native plant community showed no significant differences between invaded and non-invaded plots, with the exception of honeybees, which slightly increased their visits in invaded plots. With regard to the experimental setting, the presence of I. glandulifera reduced bumblebee visitation to R. sativus pots, but had no significant effects on seed set. We found enhanced visitation rates of bumblebees in intensively used agricultural landscapes. However, in the presence of I. glandulifera this landscape effect was masked by bumblebees being highly attracted to I. glandulifera stands independent of the structure of the surrounding landscape. Surprisingly, wild bees and hoverflies were not affected by landscape structure, but, as also the case with bumblebees, they were principally affected by the immediate community flower abundance. Synthesis. Our data provide no evidence that I. glandulifera outcompetes native plants for pollinators. However, social bees were very attracted to this late-seasonal floral resource. We conclude that both, plant invasions and landscape structure have important effects on the plant-pollinator community studied, but that they operate at different stages of the flowering season. © 2010 The Authors.

We tested whether the number of flowering individuals in the fragments affected the fruit set and further examined the adult and sapling densities of self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species. We measured the natural level of fruit set and pollinator limitation (calculated as the difference in fruit set between hand cross-pollinated and naturally pollinated flowers).

However, the hand cross-pollinated flowers in SC and SI species produced similar levels of fruit set, further indicating that lower fruit set was due to pollinator limitation and not due to lack of cross-compatible individuals in the fragments. There was no significant relation between number of flowering individuals and the levels of natural fruit set, except for two species Derris ovalifolia, Ixora pavetta. In these species the natural fruit set decreased with increasing population size, again indicating pollinator limitation. The adult and sapling densities in self-compatible species were significantly higher than in self-incompatible species. These findings indicate that the low reproductive output in self-incompatible species may eventually lead to lower population sizes. Restoration of pollinator services along with plant species in fragmented habitats is important for the long-term conservation of biodiversity. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Visiting frequency of pollinators insects were observed by using focal sampling. Those information together with flowering periods, flower nectar volumes, and environmental factors were used as the basic data to determine the effectiveness of insect pollination both in covered and uncovered of seed set plants. Results showed that nine species of insect pollinators were from three order (Hymenoptera, Lepidotera, and Diptera) pollinated J. curcas. Four species of Hymenoptera i.e. Prenolepis, Apis dorsata, Xylocopa confusa, and Apis cerana showed the highest abundances. The highest abundance and species richness of pollinators occurred at 08.00-10.15 and 15.00-17.15 h. Bees of X. confusa, A. cerana, and A. dorsata of Apidae are effective as insect pollinators in J. curcas plantations, due to high visited frequencies. The insect pollinators also increased fruits and seeds set of J. curcas in the uncovered experiment plants. Thereby, enhancement the three pollinator insects as part of crop management have to be considered by farmers. © 2010 Institut Pertanian Bogor",diversity; fruit set; Jatropha curcas L.; pollinator insects; visiting frequencies,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857632904

We investigated the relationship between pollen limitation and pollinator visitation in the purple coneflower, Echinacea angustifolia (Asteraceae), which grows in the extremely fragmented tallgrass prairie of North America. Previous investigations showed that pollen limitation of E. angustifolia increases with plant isolation and decreases with population size. We observed insect visitation to E. angustifolia over two flowering seasons and estimated pollen limitation of observed plants, using seed set as a proxy measure in 2004 and persistence of receptive style rows in 2005. We analyzed spatial patterns of bee visitation and pollination at two spatial scales: individual isolation, as measured by the distance to their fcth nearest flowering neighbors (k = 1-15), and population size. Our results indicate that E. angustifolia is pollinated by over 26 species of native bees, with 70-75% of visits by halictid bees. Surprisingly, in both years, bee visitation increased with isolation of individual plants and did not vary significantly with population size. As expected, plant isolation increased pollen limitation and lowered seed set. There was no effect of population size on seed set in 2004, and pollen limitation decreased nonsignificantly with population size in 2005. We conclude that pollen receipt limits reproduction in E. angustifolia, but pollinator visitation does not. Remarkably, isolated plants simultaneously have increased rates of pollinator visitation by pollinators and decreased reproduction, We discuss alternative explanations of pollen limitation that are consistent with this apparent discrepancy, including a decline in the availability of compatible conspecific pollen with increased plant isolation. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.",Density; Echinacea angustifolia; Habitat fragmentation; Isolation; Pollen limitation; Pollinator limitation; Population size; Prairie remnants; Purple cornflower; Spatial scale; Style persistence; USA; Western minnesota,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949894659

No other plant family shows as wide a range of pollinator-linked floral forms as Orchidaceae. In spite of the large size of this model family and a long history of orchid pollination biology, the identity and specificity of most orchid pollinators remains inadequately studied, especially in the tropics where the family has undergone extensive diversification. Angraecum (Vandeae, Epidendroideae), a large genus of tropical Old World orchids renowned for their floral morphology specialized for hawkmoth pollination, has been a model system since the time of Darwin. Methods The pollination biology of A. cadetii, an endemic species of the islands of Mauritius and Reunion (Mascarene Islands, Indian Ocean) displaying atypical flowers for the genus (white and medium-size, but short-spurred) was investigated. Natural pollinators were observed by means of hard-disk camcorders. Pollinator-linked floral traits, namely spur length, nectar volume and concentration and scent production were also investigated. Pollinator efficiency (pollen removal and deposition) and reproductive success (fruit set) were quantified in natural field conditions weekly during the 2003, 2004 and 2005 flowering seasons (January to March). Key Results Angraecum cadetii is self-compatible but requires a pollinator to achieve fruit set. Only one pollinator species was observed, an undescribed species of raspy cricket (Gryllacrididae, Orthoptera). These crickets, which are nocturnal foragers, reached flowers by climbing up leaves of the orchid or jumping across from neighbouring plants and probed the most 'fresh-looking' flowers on each plant. Visits to flowers were relatively long (if compared with the behaviour of birds or hawkmoths), averaging 16·5 s with a maximum of 41·0 s. At the study site of La Plaine des Palmistes (Pandanus forest), 46·5 of flowers had pollen removed and 27·5 had pollinia deposited on stigmas. The proportion of flowers that set fruit ranged from 11·9 to 43·4 , depending of the sites sampled across the island.

However, populations may evolve a diverse variety of strategies depending on the ecological context of pollination. In this study we examined the pollination environment, inbreeding depression, and herkogamy of Mimulus luteus (Phrymaceae) in two consecutive years in an attempt to evaluate the extent to which these factors determine the current level of autogamy in this population. Results indicate that pollinators were almost absent in the study site in 2005 and 2006. Likewise, no evidence of significant inbreeding depression for seed production and seed germination was detected in the 2 years. Because M. luteus presents hermaphrodite flowers with 'movement herkogamy' (touch-sensitive stigmata that close upon contact), and anther-stigma separation, we evaluated the role of these traits in self-fertilization. First, we assessed the effects of pollen source (self- and xenogamous pollen, and control solution) on stigmata dynamics after pollen deposition, and seed production. We observed that stigmata that received pollen (self- and xenogamous hand-pollinated) remained closed for a longer time than flowers that received no pollen (control flowers). Seed production, however, was unaffected by pollen source, indicating that movement herkogamy does not prevent self-fertilization in this population. Second, a phenotypic selection analysis revealed that seed production increased with a reduction of anther-stigma separation in absence of pollinators (bagged flowers), suggesting that low herkogamy levels are promoted in this population. Our results indicate that lack of inbreeding depression, ineffective movement herkogamy, and selection against anther-stigma separation are factors that may contribute to the prevalence of autogamous reproductive mechanisms when M. luteus faces environments with scarce mating opportunity. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Chile; Inbreeding depression; Monkey flower; Phenotypic selection; Selfing; Stigma behavior,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952743302

Loss of leaf area can affect subsequent photosynthesis and resources available for growth and reproduction; damage to flowers can result in loss of ovules and seeds by consumption, but herbivory may also disfigure flowers, interfering with their functions of attracting and rewarding pollinators. We examined natural populations of the butterfly pea, Centrosema virginianum, in pine rockland habitat in Everglades National Park (intact habitat) and a pine rockland fragment in suburban Miami-Dade County to answer the following questions: (1) What is the breeding system of C. virginianum? (2)What are the pollinators of this species in southern Florida pine rocklands? And (3) how are flower herbivores affecting pollinator visitation and subsequent fruit set? Controlled hand-pollination experiments revealed this species to be self-compatible but requiring visitation/pollination for fruit set. Crosspollinated flowers and open-pollinated flowers set substantially more seed per fruit than did self-pollinated flowers. Flowers are visited by a variety of bees (Bombus pensylvanicus, Xylocopa micans, Megachile spp., and Melissodes spp.), which serve as pollinators. Flowers were produced abundantly in areas that had experienced recent fires, and roughly half of the flowers were damaged by one of two florivore guilds (blister beetles that ate the flowers and petal-sucking flies in the family Agromyzidae). Damaged flowers were visited much less frequently by pollinators than were undamaged flowers, and, consequently, they set many fewer fruit and much less seed. We conclude that florivory is a major impediment to successful pollination and plant sexual reproduction of C. virginianum in areas where the species naturally occurs. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

Here we review studies on alien bee pollinators, demonstrating the ways in which invasive honeybees and bumblebees affect native plant seed production. Impacts of alien pollinators vary among pollination systems and among components of pollination success (visitation frequency, pollen transfer per visit, and pollen limitation). Reproduction of native bird-pollinated plants is little impacted by alien honeybees, because birds can pollinate even when honeybees visit target flowers. In bee-pollinated native plants, alien honeybee impacts on reproduction may be pervasive, but are not clearly defined in many cases; this lack of clarity arises because very few control sites without invasive bees are available, making comparative evaluation impossible. In bumblebee-pollinated plants, alien bumblebee effects are strong because native and invasive bee species are closely related congeners (of the genus Bombus) with similar pollinator mechanisms; alien bumblebees compete strongly with natives or replace them. In general, morphological, ecological, and behavioral similarities between native and alien pollinators are important for predicting their competitive interaction intensities and their effects on plant reproduction. The impacts of alien bees include (1) decreased pollen transfer per visit because of the loose morphological correspondence between flowers and alien bees, (2) increased competition for floral resources and exclusion of native pollinators because native and alien bees have similar ecological requirements, (3) changes in native pollinator visitation frequency and pollination efficiency caused by particular alien pollinator behavioral traits (such as stealing nectar or collecting previously-deposited pollen from stigmas). For a quantitative evaluation of invasion impacts, it is important to determine whether native plants suffer pollen limitation.

Little is known about the impacts of pesticides on wild pollinators in the field. Insect pollinators were sampled in an agricultural system in Italy with the aim of detecting the impacts of pesticide use. The insecticide fenitrothion was over 150 times greater in toxicity than other pesticides used in the area, so sampling was set up around its application. Species richness of wild bees, bumblebees and butterflies were sampled at three spatial scales to assess responses to pesticide application: (i) the 'field' scale along pesticide drift gradients; (ii) the 'landscape' scale sampling in different crops within the area and (iii) the 'regional' scale comparing two river basins with contrasting agricultural intensity. At the field scale, the interaction between the application regime of the insecticide and the point in the season was important for species richness. Wild bee species richness appeared to be unaffected by one insecticide application, but declined after two and three applications. At the landscape scale, the species richness of wild bees declined in vine fields where the insecticide was applied, but did not decline in maize or uncultivated fields. At the regional scale, lower bumblebee and butterfly species richness was found in the more intensively farmed basin with higher pesticide loads. Our results suggest that wild bees are an insect pollinator group at particular risk from pesticide use. Further investigation is needed on how the type, quantity and timing of pesticide application impacts pollinators. © 2009 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Agriculture; Agro-chemicals; Bees; Butterflies; Fenitrothion; Insecticide,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749145484

Long-tailed degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity are the most prevalent topological patterns found in most bipartite networks analyzed up to day. In this work we evaluate the variation of these topological properties along an altitudinal gradient. To this end, we examined four plant-pollinator networks from the Chilean Andes at 33°S, in range from 1800 to 3600 m elevation. Our results indicate that network topology is strongly and systematically affected by elevation. At increasing altitude, the number of potential visitors per plant decreased, and species' degree distributions are closer to random expectations. On the other hand, the nested structure of mutualistic interactions systematically decreased with elevation, and network modularity was significantly higher than random expectations over the entire altitudinal range. In addition, at increasing elevations the pollination networks were organized in fewer and more strongly connected modules. Our results suggest that the severe abiotic conditions found at increased elevations translate into less organized pollination networks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For plants that lack rewards for pollinators, pollination success is predicted to be negatively related to flower density and flowering synchrony. We investigated the relationships between pollination success and flower abundance and flowering synchrony, and estimated pollinia dispersal distance in a rewardless species, Changnienia amoena (Orchidaceae). The results obtained in the present study revealed that male pollination success was negatively influenced by population size but was positively affected by population density, whereas female pollination success was independent of both population size and density. Phenotypic analysis suggested that highly synchronous flowering was advantageous through total pollination success, which is in contrast to previous studies. These results indicate that pollination facilitation rather than competition for pollinator visits occurs in this rewardless plant. The median distance of pollinia dispersal was 11.5 m (mean distance = 17.5 m), which is comparable to that of other rewardless plants but longer than for rewarding plants. However, pollen transfer occured mainly within populations; pollen import was a rare event. Restricted gene flow by pollinia and seeds probably explains the previous population genetic reporting a high degree of genetic differentiation between populations. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Phenotypic selection; Population density; Selection coefficient; Synchronous flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76449097505

Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly speculative. 2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape circles (500 mradius) differing in edge densities (landscape configuration) and % non-crop habitats (landscape composition). Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting sites). 3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape, wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or the availability of their food resources differed. 4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors. A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive. 5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss. Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape scale. ©2009 The Authors.

Pollinating insects readily learn to associate floral characteristics, such as color, shape, or pattern, with appetitive stimuli, such as the presence of a nectar reward. However, in nature pollinators may also encounter flowers that contain distasteful or toxic nectar, or offer highly variable nectar volumes, providing opportunities for aversive learning or risk-averse foraging behavior. Whereas some bees learn to avoid flowers with unpalatable or unreliable nectar rewards, little is known about how Lepidoptera respond to such stimuli. We used a reversal learning paradigm to establish that monarch butterflies learn to discriminate against colored artificial flowers that contain salt solution, decreasing both number of probes and probing time on flowers of a preferred color and altogether avoiding artificial flowers of a non-preferred color. In addition, when we offered butterflies artificial flowers of two different colors, both of which contained the same mean nectar volume but which differed in variance, the monarchs exhibited risk-averse foraging: they probed the constant flowers significantly more than the variable ones, regardless of flower color or butterfly sex. Our results add to our understanding of butterfly foraging behavior, as they demonstrate that monarchs can respond to aversive as well as appetitive stimuli, and can also adjust their foraging behavior to avoid floral resources with high variance rewards. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949878412

The flowers of each plant species were prospected for at least 4 days per month, between 07.00 and 18.00h, for recording the nectar and/or pollen foraging behaviour of A. m. adansonii workers. Results show that A. m. adansonii harvested the nectar of each plant species. In addition, L. kerstingii and V. amygdalina were visited for pollen. The greatest number of workers foraging simultaneously on a plant varied from 26 (E. sigmoidea) to 4200 (V. amygdalina).

Imaging of homologous regions of the adaxial surface, paying particular attention to the diagnostic feature of the comparatively reflective speculum, revealed the presence of between three and seven epidermal cell types on each labellum, the less complex labella being plesiomorphic. Epidermal protuberances range from short, domed papillae to long, twisted unicellular filaments. Multiple origins are inferred for pale labellar margins, large yellow appendices (both putative osmophores exuding pseudopheromones), broad flat labella and long lateral horns. Homoplasy in the speculum is manifested in unusually complex or simple outlines and the presence or absence of a pale margin or iridescence. The reflectivity of the speculum is caused by a combination of chemical and physical colour, whereas iridescence can be caused only by physical properties. The specula of most microspecies studied bear striated trichomes, albeit maturing comparatively late in ontogeny and being sufficiently narrow to allow light to reach the flat polygonal trichome bases. Reflectivity appears to be negatively correlated with the convexity and degree of cuticular corrugation shown by these epidermal cells. Two clades (the Speculum + Tenthredinifera + Bombyliflora group and Bertolonii subgroup of the Sphegodes group) have lost specular trichomes and include the most iridescent species; their flat, polygonal, nonstriated cells resemble those observed on the paired pseudoeyes that bracket the stigmas of all Ophrys except the Fusca group. The smooth thick-layered cuticle and dense layers of organelles and starch bodies revealed by preliminary transmission electron microscopy study provide alternative candidates for the primary reflective surface of the speculum; in contrast, the trichomes and conical cells that dominate Ophrys labella, and occur on the specula of all but the most reflective species, absorb and/or diffuse light. Multiple MYB family genes are hypothesized to control epidermal micromorphology. The relative contributions of olfactory, visual and tactile cues to the sophisticated pseudocopulatory pollination mechanism that characterizes Ophrys remain unclear, but the degree of reproductive isolation achieved, and thus the speciation rate, have certainly been greatly exaggerated by most observers. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Iridescence; Ontogeny; Phylogeny; Plant-pollinator co-evolution; Pollinator cues; Reflectivity; Scanning electron microscopy (SEM); Speciation; Species delimitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952749496

Inter-and intra-specific crossing barriers in maize and Tripsacum have been studied and a precise description of progamic pollen tube development in maize is reported here. It was found that pollen germination and initial tube growth are rather unspecific, but an early, first crossing barrier was detected before arrival at the transmitting tract. Pollination of maize silks with Tripsacum pollen and incompatible pollination of Ga1s/Ga1s-maize silks with ga1-maize pollen revealed another two incompatibility barriers, namely transmitting tract mistargeting and insufficient growth support. Attraction and growth support by the transmitting tract seem to play key roles for progamic pollen tube growth. After leaving transmitting tracts, pollen tubes have to navigate across the ovule in the ovular cavity. Pollination of an embryo sac-less maize RNAi-line allowed the role of the female gametophyte for pollen tube guidance to be determined in maize. It was found that female gametophyte controlled guidance is restricted to a small region around the micropyle, approximately 50-100 ?m in diameter.

Despite prevailing negative associations, relations between phenological overlap and conspecific pollen receipt varied extensively among species and between years. Heterospecific pollen receipt was low and presumably of limited biological significance. However, our results supported the hypothesis that concurrent flowering promotes interspecific pollen transfer, after accounting for changes in the abundance of conspecific flowers. Seed output was consistently reduced during maximum phenological overlap during the first flowering season because of limited fruit set. Responses varied more during the second year, despite an overall negative trend among species. Relations between estimated effects of phenological overlap on pollination and seed output, however, provided mixed evidence that conspecific pollen loss during pollinator visits to foreign flowers increases pollen limitation. By flowering together, different plant species might benefit each other's pollination by increasing hummingbird recruitment at the landscape level. Nevertheless, our results are mostly consistent with the hypothesis of pollinator-mediated competition shaping the segregated flowering pattern reported previously for this temperate plant assemblage. The mechanisms likely involve effects on male function, whereby pollen-transport loss during heterospecific flower visits limit pollen export, and more variable effects on female function through pollen limitation. © 2009 The Authors.

For example, there is a well-documented negative association between dioecy and latitude, for which we have no candidate mechanisms. Conversely, it has been suggested that the relative proportion of dioecious species should be positively correlated with changes in elevation. Location Costa Rica, Central America. Methods We made use of data on the distribution of 175 seed plant species from a series of plots along a transect in Costa Rica that ranged from 30 to 2600 m a.s.l. to test the prediction that dioecy is correlated with elevation. Specifically, we examined relationships between the proportion of dioecy, at the species and individual levels, and the elevation, species richness, number of individuals, and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of plots. For comparison, we repeated all analyses with monoecious species, which also have unisexual flowers but do not suffer from reduced mate assurance and the seed shadow effect that may be the outcomes of having spatially separated sexes. Results The relative proportions of dioecious species and individuals displayed a unimodal relationship with elevation, both peaking at 750 m a.s.l. In contrast, the relative proportions of monoecious species and individuals displayed negative associations with elevation. In addition, the proportion of dioecious species was significantly positively associated with species richness and with the PD of plots. The proportion of monoecious species was not associated with species richness and was weakly positively associated with the PD of plots. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the selection pressure of elevation on the pollinators and life-history strategy of dioecious species is much less than expected, and is overshadowed by the as-yet unexplained correlation of dioecy with species richness. Additional studies of the ecology of cosexual and unisexual (i.e. dioecious and monoecious) species along large environmental gradients are needed. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Breeding systems; Community phylogenetics; Costa Rica; Dioecy; Elevational gradient; Monoecy; Phylogenetic diversity; Species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149150737

Pollen removal and deposition were studied in the field for naturally fused versus experimentally separated anthers. Campsis grandiflora flowers were protandrous, with a low pollen : ovule ratio, were mostly outcrossed, and were self-compatible, with pollinators needed. The main pollinators were pollen-collecting halictid bees and nectar-feeding vespid wasps. Halictid bees scooped pollen on long anthers for a significantly longer time period and removed twice as much pollen from fused anthers than from separated anthers.Vespid wasps contacted fused short anthers more frequently and more precisely and removed nearly twice as much pollen than when contacting separated short anthers. Pollen deposition on stigmas was not affected by manipulation of either pair of anthers. Our results suggest that anther fusion can promote pollen removal efficiency by aggregating anthers at a similar position, increasing the pollinator's contact probability and precision with anthers and extending the visit duration of the pollinator. The maintenance of didynamous stamensmayreflect functional advantages of the fused anthers in two distinct heights because they can interact with pollinators of different behaviors and sizes. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

The insect visitation rate was not significantly different between the two plant species. Solidago nemoralis was visited by fewer insect taxa per day than S. sericeum, but the constancy of its visitors was higher. The insect visitor composition changed over time, with B. bifarius ignoring S. sericeum plants initially, then visiting them more frequently as the number of receptive S. nemoralis capitula declined. Hand pollination increased seed set in the ear- liest flowering capitula of S. sericeum, but not for those flowering during the peak.

Objectives: To determine peak pollination periods, atmospheric concentrations, and year-to-year variation for identified tree, weed, and grass aeroallergens and examine the influence of selected meteorological parameters. Methods: Atmospheric sampling for pollen aeroallergens was performed using a volumetric rotating-arm impaction sampler. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between daily counts and selected meteorological parameters. Results: Previous findings for area trees, conducted at a different location, are corroborated. Predominant pollen types include Quercus, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Morus, Betulaceae, Acer, Platanus, Fraxinus, Poaceae, and Ambrosia. Early flowering weeds (Rumex and Typha) and Poaceae overlap with peak tree season in April. Biphasic seasons are noted for Poaceae and Ulmus. Tree pollen accounts for 91.2%, weeds 3.8%, and grasses 3.2% of total annual pollen yield. Variation in overall pollen production is evident from year to year. High production years for some species are low for others. Cyclic pollinating patterns for Alnus, Betulaceae, and Fagus were observed. Grass and weed pollen correlated positively with maximum temperature and dew point; however, the results for individual tree species were variable. Conclusion: The Washington, DC, metropolitan area is host to a variety of tree, weed, and grass species that produce copious amounts of pollen.

Scalesia cordata is a tree occurring only in the southern part of Isabela as small, remnant populations of larger forests. We studied the reproductive ecology of a population protected in an enclosure in order to reveal the extent to which the reproductive system limits the recruitment of young individuals. Pollinator observations revealed that each capitulum received, on average, 2.5 visits per hour and exposed receptive stigmas received many pollen grains. Even so, the seed set and recruitment of trees was poor. Crossing experiments showed that S. cordata produced about twice as many fertile seeds after outcrossing than after selfing. In addition, self-pollinated capitula flowered for a longer time than outcrossed capitula (3.8 ± 1.1 days vs. 2.1 ± 0.8 days). These results may suggest that the species is partly self-incompatible, as other species of the genus. The small population size, with its potential derived consequences, is most certainly a prominent threat to S. cordata. The pressure from introduced plant species found in the enclosure also contributes to the seemingly poor condition of the population. To recover S. cordata, we suggest enlarging the enclosure, removing the introduced plant species and continuing to cultivate plants as a genetic reserve.

In angiosperms, mature pollen grains released from dehisced anthers are transferred to the stigma where they become hydrated and begin to germinate. Pollen grains of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana do not germinate inside the anther under normal growth conditions. We report two Arabidopsis lines that produced pollen grains able to in situ precociously germinate inside the anther. One of them was a callose synthase 9 (cs9) knockout mutant with a T-DNA insertion in the Callose Synthase 9 gene (CalS9). Male gametophytes carrying a cs9 mutant allele were defective and no homozygous progeny could be produced. Heterozygous mutant plants (cs9/+) produced approximately 50% defective pollen grains with an altered male germ unit (MGU) and aberrant callose deposition in bicellular pollen. Bicellular pollen grains germinated precociously inside the anther. Another line, a transgenic plant expressing callose synthase 5 (CalS5) under the CaMV 35S promoter, also contained abnormal callose deposition during microsporogenesis and displaced MGUs in pollen grains. We also observed that precocious pollen germination could be induced in wild-type plants by incubation with medium containing sucrose and calcium ion and by wounding in the anther. These results demonstrate that precocious pollen germination in Arabidopsis could be triggered by a genetic alteration and a physiological condition. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Arabidopsis; Callose; Callose synthase; Pollen development; Precocious pollen germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950546008

These can lead to detrimental genetic and demographic consequences for the populations, even for common species. This study investigated genetic variation and structure for 12 allozyme loci and reproductive fitness in populations of Lychnis flos-cuculi (Caryophyllaceae), an insect-pollinated perennial herb occurring in wetland fragments and along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium), in relation to population size. No effect of population size on genetic variation and usually low between-population genetic differentiation were found for urban populations of L. flos-cuculi. A significant pattern of isolation by distance indicated that beyond a certain distance, especially along the Woluwe, populations might still exchange genes. Floral display and fruit set increased with population size, but this relationship did not seem to be predominant. Significant differences found among populations suggest that other factors (e.g., plant density, neighbour competition and habitat quality) may have a stronger impact on reproductive fitness. Some of the small populations may also be still connected through pollen flow, increasing reproductive success and preventing inbreeding depression. The present findings suggest that populations of L. flos-cuculi in Brussels urban zone are not prone to the detrimental effects of habitat fragmentation, as we may have expected, despite the relative small size of the populations. These genetically diverse and productive populations can still be considered of conservation value, including the small ones, which within a certain spatial distance might be regarded as important connecting components of pollen-exchanging network of populations, buffering populations against the negative effects of small population size.

Pollen delivery, an important component of fitness of sexual plants, is a function of not just the floral traits of any particular individual, but of features of the population and community as it depends on pollinator abundance and preferences. Many pollinators in flowering communities will prefer patches with high floral abundance or diversity yet may exhibit lower floral constancy when more flowering species are present. Thus, pollination efficiency could increase or decrease with increased species richness and this will alter the selection pressures placed upon the floral traits (such as floral colour or reward) of any member of a particular community. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that plant-pollinator networks are phylogenetically structured (pollinators visit related plant species more than expected by chance) and this may be an important factor structuring flowering plant communities. Thus, the sheer number of species within a patch may be less important than the number of closely-related species. We investigate whether species richness or phylogenetic proximity of coflowering species influences the amount and proportion of conspecific pollen delivered to nodding onion, Allium cernuum, in fragment patches of Garry Oak meadows in South Western British Columbia, Canada. We find that pollen delivery depended upon the presence of close relatives far more than on species richness or population density, indicating a central role of the community structure on pollination in flowering plant communities.

This methodology involves inbred development of homostyle (ShSh) and pin (ss) lines by using the self-compatibility gene (Sh). Further, single-cross hybrid seeds are produced using these inbred homostyle and pin lines as pollen and seed parents, respectively. This strategy successfully produced self-compatible homostyle hybrids (Shs); the percentage of hybrid plants among the progeny was more than 90%. In a greenhouse trial, the heterosis (best parent) in top dry weight, including stem and leaves, was 29.1-48.1% during the early growth stage. The seed yield of the progeny obtained in single-cross experiments was superior to that of an open-pollinated standard variety ""Kitawasesoba"" by 10% on average.

The BiPrx1 gene consists of 5 exons, encoding 220 amino acid residues with one conserved cysteine residue. The BiTPx1 gene consists of three exons, encoding 195 amino acid residues with 2 conserved cysteine residues. Recombinant BiPrx1 (27 kDa) and BiTPx1 (25 kDa), expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells, reduced H2O2 in the presence of electrons donated by dithiothreitol. Unlike BiTPx1, however, BiPrx1 did not show reduction activity when thioredoxin was used as the electron donor. Both BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 protected super-coiled DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) in vitro. Tissue distribution analyses showed the presence of BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 in the fat body, midgut, muscle and epidermis, but not in the hemolymph, suggesting that BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 are not secretable. When H2O2 was injected into B. ignitus bees, BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 transcripts were acutely up-regulated in the fat body tissues. We also demonstrated the regulation of BiPrx1 and BiTPx1 expression via reduction of transcript levels in the fat body with RNA interference (RNAi). Under H2O2 overload, the RNAi-induced BiPrx1 knock-down B. ignitus worker bees showed up-regulated expression of BiTPx1. Reciprocally, BiTPx1 RNAi knockdowns showed up-regulated BiPrx1 expression in the fat body. These results indicate that the loss of expression of BiPrx1 or BiTPx1 is compensated by the up-regulation of expression of the other peroxidase in response to H2O2 overload. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Transportation of bumblebees accelerated in the late 1980s following the development of techniques for mass rearing them, and their widespread adoption as the preferred pollinator for a range of glasshouse crops, primarily tomatoes. There is now a worldwide trade in one species, Bombus terrestris dalmatinus, originating from south east Europe. Within North America, which does not allow the importation of B. terrestris, the trade is primarily in Bombus impatiens. Trade in B. t. dalmatinus threatens the integrity of other subspecies within Europe, such as B. t. audax which is endemic to Britain and Ireland. However, there is a conspicuous absence of data as to whether B. t. dalmatinus has established in the wild outside its native range, and whether it interbreeds with native subspecies. Perhaps a more significant risk associated with trade in bumblebees is the accidental spread of parasites, and the subsequent risk that native bumblebee species may be exposed to parasites for which they have little resistance. There is circumstantial evidence that catastrophic declines of several North American bumblebee species may have been triggered by the accidental introduction of pathogens from Europe. Even if commercial bumblebee colonies are reared locally, the high densities at which they are kept mean that glasshouse nests are likely to act as reservoirs for spread of disease to wild bumblebee populations nearby. There is clearly the need for tight quarantining of bee colonies before transportation, and a moratorium should be placed on the transport of bumblebees in cases where native species suitable for commercial rearing are readily available.",Bombus; Competition; Introgression; Parasites; Pathogens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953890005

Br.) is a high-quality appearance-grade timber species native to eastern Australia. Wide variation in its survival, growth and form, together with issues related to site selection and intensive silvicultural management, limit progress in its domestication and commercial development. To determine the effect of genetics on these traits, five blackwood progeny trials in northern Tasmania, Australia, aged between 15 and 19 years were assessed. All trials contained a variety of open-pollinated, single-tree, family collections from Tasmania, with one trial containing a selection of provenances from mainland Australia. Significant genetic variation in survival, growth and form were found. This variation was partly explained by broad scale adaptive differences across the wide geographic distribution of blackwood. Blackwood from the tropical northern range of the species had poor survival in cool temperate Tasmania. Significant differences in survival between Tasmanian seedlots were also observed. Among the Tasmanian seedlots, those from low altitudes grew better than those from high altitudes, while those from the north-east of Tasmania had significantly better growth rates than seedlots from the south-east. Seedlots from the north-west seed zone had intermediate growth rates. Significant genetic differences in the proportion of trees with single stems, and the number of large branches in the lower stem were found between Tasmanian seedlots. Early-age seedlot height was significantly positively correlated with mid-age diameter. Stem form was improved under nurse crops, but even open-grown blackwood had low percentages of trees of excellent form. These results indicate that at the broad scale, climatic matching of seed source with planting site is clearly important, however, within Tasmania there was no evidence that seedlots collected from the same region as the trials outperformed those from other regions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adaptation; Australian blackwood; Heritability; Provenance; Tasmania,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950461772

In Japan, invasions of B. terrestris have occurred in Hokkaido, northern Japan, since 1996, and areas of naturalization are growing. Invasions of B. terrestris in Japan have predominantly occurred in human-modified areas, such as open agricultural areas, which are comparable to the preferred environments of the bumblebees' original distribution ranges.

This large distribution has been attributed partly to the ability of the seeds of the large-fruited M. citrifolia L. var. citrifolia L. to be transported by oceanic drifting. This form of M. citrifolia var. citrifolia has been predicted to be the progenitor colonizer of the island endemic Morinda species. Using a phylogenetic approach and large sampling of the widespread, large-fruited M. citrifolia var. citrifolia, we assessed the potential area of origin of M. citrifolia and tested the hypothesis that the large-fruited M. citrifolia var. citrifolia is an ancestral colonizer. Location Tropics. Methods We performed Bayesian analyses of 22 species of the tribe Morindeae (including 11 individuals of the three currently recognized varieties of M. citrifolia) based on combined nrETS, nrITS, rps16 and trnT-F sequence data. Geographic origins of the studied taxa were mapped onto the Bayesian majority rule consensus tree. Results Nine sequenced individuals of M. citrifolia from diverse geographic locations formed a highly supported clade, which was sister to the Australo-Micronesian clade that included M. bracteata var. celebica and M. latibracteata. These sister clades are part of the broader Asian, arborescent Morinda clade. We found no support for the current varietal classification of M. citrifolia. Main conclusions Our analyses suggest a Micronesian origin of M. citrifolia. This implies that the large-fruited M. citrifolia var. citrifolia might well have been present in the Pacific before the arrival of the Micronesian and Polynesian ancestors from Southeast Asia. The wide distribution of this form of M. citrifolia var. citrifolia is attributed partly to the trans-oceanic dispersal of its buoyant seeds, self-pollination and its ability to produce flowers and fruits year-round. The hypothesis that the widespread, large-fruited M. citrifolia var. citrifolia is the progenitor colonizer of the island endemic Morinda species is inconsistent with its derived position within the Asian, arborescent Morinda clade and with the fact that the nine sampled individuals of M. citrifolia form a clade. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biogeography; DNA sequence data; Indian mulberry; Morinda citrifolia; Morinda s.s.; Morindeae; Noni; Phylogeography; Rubiaceae; Taxonomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75149139830

(2n = 4x = 48), is an autotetraploid species, the breeding of which at the tetraploid level is complicated by tetrasomic inheritance. Dihaploids (2n = 2x = 24) from the tetraploid cultivated potato have great potential for breeding and genetic studies. The common method deployed to obtain potato dihaploids is to make interspecific-interploidy (4x × 2x) crosses between a tetraploid seed parent and special clones from the diploid S. phureja as pollinator. Pollinators carrying a marker gene have been used, but unfortunately, these clones were very weak, with rare flowering and low male fertility under the given conditions. To find a suitable pollinator, three clones were selected from S. phureja based on flowering, pollen shed and male fertility and were crossed with five cultivated tetraploid potatoes to evaluate their dihaploid induction ability. A total of 1529 interploidy crosses were made, resulting in 1116 berries and 1456 seeds. The progeny were divided into two groups based on stem, flower and tuber colour: hybrids and non-hybrids (putative dihaploids). Chromosome counting in non-hybrid genotypes detected 39 dihaploids. The clone phu 3 and cv. Picasso, with 12.1 and 10.7 dihaploids per 100 berries, respectively, were the best dihaploid inducer and seed parent for dihaploid production. © 2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",Dihaploid induction; Interploidy crosses; Potato; S. phureja; Solanum tuberosum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950306874

In this study we assessed how prey sensory preference affected the exploiter signal design by investigating the evolutionary relationship and relative attractiveness of linear and cruciate form web decorations built by Argiope spiders. Because insects have an innate preference for bilaterally symmetrical patterns, we hypothesized that cruciate form decorations were evolved from linear form due to their higher visual attractiveness to insects. We first reconstructed a molecular phylogeny of the Asian members of the genus Argiope using mitochondrial markers to infer the evolutionary relationship of two decoration forms. Results of ancestral character state reconstruction showed that the linear form was ancestral and the cruciate form derived. To evaluate the luring effectiveness of two decoration forms, we performed field experiments in which the number and orientation of decoration bands were manipulated. Decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form were significantly more attractive to insects than those arranged in a linear form, no matter whether they were composed of silks or dummies. Moreover, dummy decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form attracted significantly more insects than those arranged in a vertical/horizontal form. Such results suggest that pollinator insects' innate preference for certain bilateral or radial symmetrical patterns might be one of the driving forces shaping the arrangement pattern of spider web decorations. © 2010.

The potential long-range transport cases of birch pollen in Lithuania were analysed for the whole period of available observations, 2004-2007. The birch pollen was recorded at three measurement stations in Lithuania by using Hirst-type volumetric spore traps. The phenological observations in Lithuania were also used for the detection of potential long-range transport-induced episodes. Two variants of the regional and continental scale atmospheric dispersion model SILAM (Lagrangian and Eulerian) in an adjoint mode (used for inverse dispersion modelling and data assimilation), and the trajectory model HYSPLIT were employed to evaluate the source origins of the observed pollen. During four seasons in 2004-2007, we found in total 24 cases, during which remarkable pollen concentrations were recorded before the local flowering season. According to modelling, most of these were originated from the sources outside Lithuania: Latvia, southern Sweden, Denmark, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, possibly, also coastal regions of Germany and Poland. Two episodes were attributed to local early-flowering birch trees. The spatial and temporal patterns of the long-range transport of early pollen to Lithuania were found out to be highly variable; the predicted source regions for the cases considered were similar only for some dates in 2004 and 2006. During the analysed period, we found both cases, in which the predictions of the SILAM model variants and those of the HYSPLIT model were similar, and cases, in which there were substantial differences. In general, for complicated atmospheric circulation patterns the model predictions can be drastically different, with a tendency of trajectory model to fail reproducing the key episode features. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aerobiology; HYSPLIT; Lithuania; Long-range transport; Phenology; Pollen; SILAM; Source apportionment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649231528

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weak-ened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments. However, the activity of glucose oxidase, enabling bees to sterilize colony and brood food, was significantly decreased only by the combination of both factors compared with control, Nosema or imidacloprid groups, suggesting a syner-gistic interaction and in the long term a higher suscep-tibility of the colony to pathogens. This provides the first evidences that interaction between an infectious organism and a chemical can also threaten pollinators, interactions that are widely used to eliminate insect pests in integrative pest management. © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950675074

In addition, in order distinguish between possible physical and biochemical mechanisms, the effects of solid vermicompost and vermicompost extracts on pine seedling growth were compared. Five different open-pollinated pine progenies were used in order to evaluate the possible genotype-dependent effects of vermicompost. All pots were provided with adequate mineral fertilization in order to avoid nutrient limitations and arranged in the greenhouse following a bifactorial randomized block design. Twenty weeks after sowing, seedlings were harvested and their aerial and root growth were measured, as well as biomass partitioning and seedling maturity. Amendment with solid vermicompost at 2.5% and 10% significantly stimulated pine seedling height, but not aerial biomass. Vermicompost also produced seedlings with greater shoot:root biomass ratios than the control. Besides, we noticed a significant inhibition of aerial and root biomass with the higher dose of solid vermicompost (25% substrate substitution). No effects, either positive or negative, were detected in plant growth due to the vermicompost extracts.

So far no studies exist, which investigated the influence of the sulfur nutritional status on the emission of volatiles by other agricultural plants during flowering. In the present study the influence of the sulfur supply on the floral scent of crops with (white mustard, oil radish) and without sulfur-containing secondary compounds (chamomile, field beans, and peas) was determined. The plant sulfur status was monitored at the start of main growth and the volatile emissions of flowers were characterized three times during main flowering by employing an electronic nose. Sulfur fertilization increased the sulfur content in leaves and flowers of all crops. Significant differences in the emission of volatiles in relation to sulfur fertilization were determined at least at one sampling date for all investigated crops except white mustard.

Here, we present an assembly free analysis of SRS data that discovers sequence variants among focal genomes by tabulating the presence and frequency of 'complex' fragments in the data. Using data from nine tree species, we compare genomic diversity from populations to families. As a control, we simulated SRS data for three known plant genomes. The results provide insight into the quality and distributional bias of the sequencing reaction. Three main types of informative complexmers were identified, each possessing unique statistical properties. Type I complexmers are unique to a genome but suffer from a high false positive rate, being highly dependent on read coverage and distribution. Type II complexmers are shared between two genomes and can highlight potential copy-number differences. Type III complexmers are exclusive to a subset of genomes and can be useful for associating genetic differences with phenotypic or geographic variation. At the population level in an endangered timber species, numerous markers were identified that could potentially determine geographic origin of individuals and regulate international trade. We observed that the genomic data for the four fig species were more divergent than for stone oak species, possibly due to their complex pollination syndrome and high rates of gene flow. Our approach greatly enhances the application of SRS technology to the study of non-model organisms and directly identifies the most informative genetic elements for more detailed study and assembly. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Complexmers; Ficus; Figs; Gonystylus; Lithocarpus; Ramin; Simulated SRS data; Stone oaks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951885556

In organic production, insects present a major pest challenge that negatively impacts crop health and yield. To successfully manage an organic farmland, an effective insect pest management program is key. In this review, we first describe the approaches currently used for pest management in organic farming. Next, we review natural plant defense mechanisms, especially those based on plant volatile organic compounds. Chemically complex, plant volatiles have multiple ecological roles in plant-insect interactions including attracting pollinators, acting as cues for foraging herbivores as well as functioning as direct defense, indirect defense, or interplant priming. Based on the ecological roles of plant volatiles, we then discuss in-depth how pest management may be improved through a variety of strategies including using resistant cultivars, polyculture, using beneficial microorganisms such as mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes, and using plant-derived pesticides, all of which are reviewed in the context of plant volatiles. Lastly, integration of these different strategies based on the trait of plant volatiles for a successful and sustainable pest management program in organic farming is discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Insect pests; Organic farming; Plant defenses; Plant volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950891715

Their chemical composition makes nectars prone to microbial infestation. As protective strategy, floral nectar of ornamental tobacco (Nicotiana langsdorffii 3 Nicotiana sanderae) contains ""nectarins,"" proteins producing reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were detected in Acacia extrafloral nectar (EFN), which is secreted in the context of defensive ant-plant mutualisms. We investigated whether these PR proteins protect EFN from phytopathogens. Five sympatric species (Acacia cornigera, A. hindsii, A. collinsii, A. farnesiana, and Prosopis juliflora) were compared that differ in their ant-plant mutualism. EFN of myrmecophytes, which are obligate ant-plants that secrete EFN constitutively to nourish specialized ant inhabitants, significantly inhibited the growth of four out of six tested phytopathogenic microorganisms. By contrast, EFN of nonmyrmecophytes, which is secreted only transiently in response to herbivory, did not exhibit a detectable inhibitory activity. Combining two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that PR proteins represented over 90% of all proteins in myrmecophyte EFN. The inhibition of microbial growth was exerted by the protein fraction, but not the small metabolites of this EFN, and disappeared when nectar was heated. In-gel assays demonstrated the activity of acidic and basic chitinases in all EFNs, whereas glucanases were detected only in EFN of myrmecophytes. Our results demonstrate that PR proteins causally underlie the protection of Acacia EFN from microorganisms and that acidic and basic glucanases likely represent the most important prerequisite in this defensive function. © 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949514643

A traditional open-pollinated white flour corn yielded from 22 to 76 bu/acre (1155 to 4127 kg/ha); the higher yields were obtained in New York's Lake Plain region with its fertile soils and long growing season. Corn grain yields were also higher at increased plant densities and closer spacing. We argue that these grain yields, which are significantly higher than other scholars have reported, are an accurate reflection of the yield potential of the productive soils of this region. Other researchers have failed to account for the complex and critical ways that soil organic matter and agronomic practices determine corn yields. Our yield estimates are further supported by eyewitness accounts that describe a highly productive agriculture practiced by Iroquoian farmers in the 16th through 18th centuries. Using Land Equivalency Ratios, we also demonstrate that the three crops grown as a polyculture were more productive than monocultures of individual crops. Corn grain yields were little affected by competition from bean and squash, but these two crops yielded much less in the polyculture compared to monocultures.

Many Leucadendron species are serotinous, with females of serotinous species maintaining seeds in transpiring cones for a number of years. Since cones must be kept alive, serotinous females presumably incur higher costs in terms of water loss than non-serotinous females and, particularly, males. Given that branching architecture is known to affect water conductance, with less resistance in less highly branched plants, we predicted a positive correlation between the degree of serotiny in a species and sexual dimorphism in branching. We tested the effect of serotiny and several other factors on the degree of sexual dimorphism in Leucadendron by conducting a comparative analysis of variation across 49 species using phylogenetic regression. There was a strong positive association between the degree of serotiny and sexual dimorphism. This association is consistent with the idea that the costs of maintaining cones may select females to be less highly branched than males. Synthesis. Serotiny is a strategy of maternal care that contributes to offspring survival after seed maturation. We found that, in Leucadendron, the evolution of increased serotiny corresponds with the evolution of more marked sexual dimorphism. This study exposes a hitherto unidentified association between sexual dimorphism and maternal care in plants and points to a possible additional reproductive burden carried by serotinous plants compared with those that release their seeds at maturity. © 2010 The Authors.

Av. Carlos III, s/n. 45071 Toledo, Spain","Plant phenology is strongly controlled by climate and has consequently become one of the most reliable bioindicators of ongoing climate change. We used a dataset of more than 200 000 records for six phenological events of 29 perennial plant species monitored from 1943 to 2003 for a comprehensive assessment of plant phenological responses to climate change in the Mediterranean region. Temperature, precipitation and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were studied together during a complete annual cycle before phenological events to determine their relative importance and potential seasonal carry-over effects. Warm and dry springs under a positive phase of NAO advance flowering, leaf unfolding and fruiting dates and lengthen the growing season. Spatial variability of dates (range among sites) was also reduced during warm and dry years, especially for spring events. Climate during previous weeks to phenophases occurrence had the greatest impact on plants, although all events were also affected by climate conditions several months before. Immediate along with delayed climate effects suggest dual triggers in plant phenology. Climatic models accounted for more than 80% of variability in flowering and leaf unfolding dates, and in length of the growing season, but for lower proportions in fruiting and leaf falling. Most part of year-to-year changes in dates was accounted for temperature, while precipitation and NAO accounted for <10% of dates' variability. In the case of flowering, insect-pollinated species were better modelled by climate than wind-pollinated species. Differences in temporal responses of plant phenology to recent climate change are due to differences in the sensitivity to climate among events and species. Spring events are changing more than autumn events as they are more sensitive to climate and are also undergoing the greatest alterations of climate relative to other seasons. In conclusion, climate change has shifted plant phenology in the Mediterranean region. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Flowering; Fruiting; Global warming; Growing season; Leaf falling; Leaf unfolding; North Atlantic Oscillation; Precipitation; Spain; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77149136736

Although extensive sanctuaries can provide crucial protection for many organisms and ecosystems, they cannot fulfill all the needs of regional conservation. An alternative to a few large refuges is to create many different habitats across the landscape that enhance and improve local and regional biodiversity and provide immediate benefits to nearby communities in the form of ecosystem services. Furthermore, these can all be initiated and achieved by individuals or communities. Some key landscape enhancements can be undertaken on a local level: the creation or expansion of small wooded areas, windbreaks, or hedgerows; the construction of small wetlands; and the release of some lands from heavy pressure for the reestablishment of natural ecological processes, namely, the natural accumulation of woody and other organic materials. Newly created ecosystems can be inoculated at the outset with soil biota such as seed banks, microbes, fungi, and organic material that can accelerate ecological functioning and balance. In addition to increasing much local and regional biodiversity, locally enhanced areas can provide fuel, plant and animal food and medicinal products, and agroforestry products directly to the nearby community. These small ecological oases can serve as nesting and overwintering sites for numerous pollinators that are hugely beneficial to agricultural production. Moreover, several ecosystem enhancements may contribute positively to local and regional hydrologic cycles and prevent prolonged droughts. Enhancements to local landscapes can take on many forms. We believe that any changes that increase structural complexity in natural systems almost certainly lead to increases in local biological complexity. In addition, wider landscape level considerations, such as corridors and connectivity of populations, can be integrated on a broader scale to improve regional biodiversity and ecosystem services. Small landscape enhancements undoubtedly cannot provide for all conservation needs, but they can greatly increase widespread biodiversity, restore local ecosystem services, and can be used to complement the relatively few larger parks. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",Biodiversity; Community level; Created wetlands; Ecosystem services; Enhancements; Landscape improvements; Woody debris,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952885204

In both olive and other fruit tree species, the juvenile-adult transition has been successfully hastened by forcing and formation procedures designed to rapidly achieve a minimum height. Precise knowledge of the position within the tree canopy where the juvenile-adult transition occurs, identified by the location of the first flowers, offers further potential for manipulating tree structure in order to hasten that transition. The occurrence of the juvenile-adult transition has been described spatially within the canopy as the formation of a juvenility cone, which we report here for olive plants from seed, and for the first time quantitatively describe its position based on the added trunk and branch distances from the soil. In canopies of seedlings from open pollination of cv. Arbequina olive the first-flowering position was consistently located, in our conditions, at an average distance of 200 cm from the trunk base. Based on that evidence, that first flowering can occur at lower positions, and on the values we obtained, three canopy-formation heights (100-130 cm, 130-160 cm and >160 cm) were compared for their effect on the length of the juvenile period and the vigour of olive seedlings. Canopy heights of 100-130 cm, much lower than the 160 cm previously reported by the olive tree breeding program of Córdoba, produced the highest number of flowering plants in the first two flowering years and also provided easier management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This system has mutualism between the plant and the pollinators, and competition for food between pollinators. Both pollinators are different: the large pollinator can consume all the nectar offered by the plant in each visit; it permits the genetic interchange between plants from different patches, so, it avoids self-fertilization problems. The small pollinator consumes only a fraction of the flower nectar but the seeds produced by its pollination are less successful. The model gives different dynamics depending on both the differences between the pollinators' growth rates and the inbreeding effect. Stronger oscillations occur when the growth rates are very different. Paradoxically, a high inbreeding causes an increment in populations. The three species system is biologically stable and the asymmetry between pollinator species results in different roles that enhance the global stability and persistence of the system. © 2009, Penkala Bt., Budapest, Hungary.",Competition; Mathematical models; Mutualism; Pollination; Population dynamics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76849092390

Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measures may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches from two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (<20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged. © 2009 Rübel Foundation, ETH Zürich.",Centaurea jacea; Connectivity; Fluorescent dye; Population size; Seed production; Urban parks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849143118

Pollen performance (the speeds of germination and pollen tube growth) in particular is thought to be strongly subject to intrasexual selection, but the effect of mating system on this process has not been rigorously evaluated. Here we propose four predictions derived from the logic that pollen performance should evolve with mating system as an adaptive response to: (1) the competitive environment among pollen genotypes and (2) variation among female genotypes regularly encountered by a given pollen genotype. First, as previously predicted, due to the higher potential for intense selection among diverse pollen genotypes in outcrossing relative to selfing taxa, pollen should evolve to germinate and/or to grow more rapidly in outcrossers than in selfers. Second, due to stronger selection on pollen performance in outcrossing than in selfing taxa, heritable variation in pollen tube growth rate is more likely to be purged in outcrossers. In selfers, by contrast, genetic variation in pollen tube growth rates may readily accumulate because selfing reduces the number of genetically distinct male gametophytes likely to be deposited on any given stigma, thereby relaxing selection on male gametophytic traits. A summary of published studies presented here provides preliminary support for this prediction. Third, due to the high probability that the pollen of outcrossing individuals will be exposed to multiple pistil genotypes, we predict that the pollen of habitually outcrossing taxa will evolve to perform more consistently across female genotypes than the pollen of selfing taxa. Fourth, we predict that epistatic interactions between pollen and pistil genotypes are more likely to evolve in selfers than in outcrossers. We suggest several empirical approaches that may be used to test these predictions. © 2009 Rübel Foundation, ETH Zürich.",Gametophytic competition; Mating system; Pollen competition; Pollen tube growth; Self-fertilization; Sexual selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849121947

Jasmonates are well-known for their effects on senescence, the development and opening of flowers and on plant defences such as extrafloral nectar. Their role in floral nectar secretion has, however, not been explored so far. We investigated whether jasmonates have an influence on floral nectar secretion in oil-seed rape, Brassica napus. The floral tissues of this plant produced jasmonic acid (JA) endogenously, and JA concentrations peaked shortly before nectar secretion was highest. Exogenous application of JA to flowers induced nectar secretion, which was suppressed by treatment with phenidone, an inhibitor of JA synthesis. This effect could be reversed by additional application of JA. Jasmonoyl-isoleucine and its structural mimic coronalon also increased nectar secretion. Herbivory or addition of JA to the leaves did not have an effect on floral nectar secretion, demonstrating a functional separation of systemic defence signalling from reproductive nectar secretion. Jasmonates, which have been intensively studied in the context of herbivore defences and flower development, have a profound effect on floral nectar secretion and, thus, pollination efficiency in B. napus. Our results link floral nectar secretion to jasmonate signalling and thereby integrate the floral nectar secretion into the complex network of oxylipid-mediated developmental processes of plants. © 2010 Radhika et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949514496

Conservation management, such as agri-environment schemes (AES), has been introduced to counteract these declines, but in Western European countries these tend to produce mixed biodiversity benefits. Not much is known about the effects of AES in Central and Eastern European countries. We evaluated the effect of reduced stocking rates (0.5 cow/ha vs. >1 cow/ha) on bees and insect-pollinated plants in semi-natural pastures in Hungary. We sampled bees using sweep net and transect surveys in the edge and interior of the fields three times in 2003. On the same transects, we also estimated the cover of all plant species. We found no management effect on species richness and abundance with respect to cover of bees and insect-pollinated plants, but grazing intensity resulted in differences in species composition of insect-pollinated plants. Furthermore, we compared our results with those of a similar study carried out in Switzerland, and the Netherlands, but with different management regimes. There were positive effects of management in Switzerland, but conservation effects were lacking in the Netherlands. Species richness of both bees and insect-pollinated plants was highest in Hungary, intermediate in Switzerland and lowest in the Netherlands. Across all countries, the richness of insect-pollinated plants was a good predictor of bee species richness. Grassland extensification schemes were effective for bees and insect-pollinated plants in the country with intermediate land-use intensity and biodiversity only (Switzerland). The absence of effects in the Netherlands may have been caused by the management being highly intensive on both field types. In Hungarian grasslands biodiversity levels were high regardless of management and both investigated stocking rates may be qualified as conservation management. Therefore, agricultural policy in Hungary should encourage the maintenance of a variety of traditional grazing practices for conserving this still highly diverse pollinator fauna. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This species is extensively used for commercial pollination in Europe, and along with other Bombus spp. is a key member of natural pollinator assemblages. Furthermore, the species is studied in a wide variety of biological fields. The objective of this project was to create a B. terrestris EST resource that will prove to be valuable in obtaining a deeper understanding of this significant social insect.Results: A normalised cDNA library was constructed from the thorax and abdomen of B. terrestris workers in order to enhance the discovery of rare genes. A total of 29'428 ESTs were sequenced. Subsequent clustering resulted in 13'333 unique sequences. Of these, 58.8 percent had significant similarities to known proteins, with 54.5 percent having a ""best-hit"" to existing Hymenoptera sequences. Comparisons with the honeybee and other insects allowed the identification of potential candidates for gene loss, pseudogene evolution, and possible incomplete annotation in the honeybee genome. Further, given the focus of much basic research and the perceived threat of disease to natural and commercial populations, the immune system of bumblebees is a particularly relevant component. Although the library is derived from unchallenged bees, we still uncover transcription of a number of immune genes spanning the principally described insect immune pathways. Additionally, the EST library provides a resource for the discovery of genetic markers that can be used in population level studies. Indeed, initial screens identified 589 simple sequence repeats and 854 potential single nucleotide polymorphisms.Conclusion: The resource that these B. terrestris ESTs represent is valuable for ongoing work. The ESTs provide direct evidence of transcriptionally active regions, but they will also facilitate further functional genomics, gene discovery and future genome annotation. These are important aspects in obtaining a greater understanding of this key pollinator species. © 2010 Sadd et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949437244

In order to test the relative contribution of phylogeny to the pattern of distribution of floral characters related to pollination, flower form and pollinators have been mapped onto a molecular phylogeny of the family. Bilateral flower symmetry (zygomorphy) is prevalent in the basal grades of the family, and more derived clades have flowers that are largely radially symmetric, with some parallel evolution of floral bilateralism. Pollinator types ('syndromes') are extremely homoplastic in the family, but members of subfamily Solanoideae are exceptional in being largely bee pollinated. Pollinator relationships in those genera where they have been investigated more fully are not as specific as flower morphology and the classical pollinator syndrome models might suggest, and more detailed studies in some particularly variable genera, such as Iochroma and Nicotiana, are key to understanding the role of pollinators in floral evolution and adaptive radiation in the family.

Although the ecological and conservation consequences of PL have received considerable attention in recent times, its evolutionary implications are poorly appreciated. To identify general influences of PL on reproductive adaptation compared with those under other seed-production limits and their implications for evolution in altered environments, we derive a model that incorporates pollination and postpollination aspects of PL. Because PL always favours increased ovule fertilization, even when population dynamics are not seed limited, it should pervasively influence selection on reproductive traits. Significantly, under PL the intensity of inbreeding does not determine whether outcrossing or autonomous selfing can evolve, although it can affect which response is most likely. Because the causes of PL are multifaceted in both natural and anthropogenically altered environments, the possible outcrossing solutions are diverse and context dependent, which may contribute to the extensive variety of angiosperm reproductive characteristics. Finally, the increased adaptive options available under PL may be responsible for positive global associations between it and angiosperm diversity. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Competition for pollination; Habitat fragmentation; Inbreeding depression; Mate limitation; Pollen limitation; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749170290

The third and forth reciprocal backcrosses produced a number of seeds per silique similar to that of self-pollinated wild B. juncea, except in plants with glufosinate-tolerant backcross progeny used as maternal plants and wild B. juncea as paternal plants, which produced fewer seeds per silique than did self-pollinated wild B. juncea.

Many of Darwin's insights, gained from careful observations and experiments on diverse angiosperm species, remain remarkably durable today and have stimulated much current research on floral function and the evolution of mating systems. Here I review Darwin's seminal contributions to reproductive biology and provide an overview of the current status of research on several of the main topics to which he devoted considerable effort, including the consequences to fitness of cross- versus self-fertilization, the evolution and function of stylar polymorphisms, the adaptive significance of heteranthery, the origins of dioecy and related gender polymorphisms, and the transition from animal pollination to wind pollination. Post-Darwinian perspectives on floral function now recognize the importance of pollen dispersal and male outcrossed siring success in shaping floral adaptation.

Here, we report on our work with Petunia, an attractive model system for quantitative plant genetics and genomics. From interspecific crosses, we obtained F2 plants that differed in the length of the floral tube or the size of the limb. We used these plants to study the behaviour of the hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca sexta. Plants with larger limbs were preferentially visited, consistent with the notion that flower size affects visibility under low light conditions. The moths also displayed an innate preference for shorter tubes. However, in those cases that flowers with long tubes were chosen, the animals fed for equal time. Thus, the perception of tube length may help the moths, early on, to avoid those plants that are more difficult to handle. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Floral morphology; Hawkmoth; Petunia; Pollination syndrome; QTL,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749156687

K. pomifera exhibited very low self-compatibility, with the barrier to self-fertilisation being prevention of pollen-tube growth in the style or ovary. Following intraspecific pollination amongst a number of different genotypes of K. pomifera, 38.4% of pollinated flowers developed fruit; arrest of compatible pollen-tubes in the style, preventing fertilisation, contributes to the low fruit set in this species. Interspecific compatibility was examined between K. pomifera (pistillate parent) and K. ambigua (staminate parent) where seed set per pollinated flower (4.47) was not significantly different from intraspecific crosses (4.66). In crosses between K. pomifera (pistillate parent) and K. ericoides as staminate plant, 0.037% of pollinated flowers produced fruit, with 0.0075 seeds per pollinated flower.

Within ecological communities, the timing of interactions among species may be altered if the species experience asymmetrical phenological shifts. We present a model that examines the consequences of changes in the relative timing of herbivory and pollination in a community of herbivores and pollinators that share a host plant. Our model suggests that phenological shifts can alter the abundances of these species and, in some cases, their population dynamics. If historical patterns of interactions in a community change and herbivores become active before pollinators, the community could see a reduction in pollinators and an increase in herbivores, while if pollinators become active before herbivores, there could be a loss of stable coexistence. Previous studies have warned of the potential for climate change to cause large phenological mismatches whereby species that depend on one another become so separated in time that they can no longer interact. Our results suggest that climate change-induced phenological shifts can have a major impact on communities even in cases where complete phenological mismatches do not occur. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This wheat genotype could be used as a recipient partner in wheat-rye crosses for the efficient introduction of new allelic variation into 1RS in translocation wheats. After crossing the wheat cultivars 'Mv Magdaléna' and 'Mv Béres', which carry the 1BL.1RS translocation involving the 1RS chromosome arm from 'Petkus', with the line 'Mv9 kr1', 117 F2 plants were analysed for crossability, ten of which had higher than 50% seed set with rye and thus presumably carried the kr1kr1kr2kr2 alleles. Four of the ten plants contained the 1BL.1RS translocation in the disomic condition as detected by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The wheat × rye F1 hybrids produced between these lines and the rye cultivar 'Kriszta' were analysed in meiosis using GISH. 1BL.1RS/1R chromosome pairing was detected in 62.4% of the pollen mother cells. The use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with the repetitive DNA probes pSc119.2, Afa family and pTa71 allowed the 1R and 1BL.1RS chromosomes to be identified. The presence of the 1RS arm from 'Kriszta' besides that of 'Petkus' was demonstrated in the F1 hybrids using the rye SSR markers RMS13 and SCM9. In four of the 22 BC1 progenies analysed, only 'Kriszta'-specific bands were observed with these markers, though the presence of the 1BL.1RS translocation was detected using GISH.

An experiment was conducted to assess the risk factor and methods to increase hybrid-seed purity in a thermosensitive male-sterile tomato mutant, T-4, whose fertility is partially restored in autumn, but largely remains sterile in spring, with some residual fertility. Examination of pollen germination and the subsequent pollen-tube growth in vitro and on stigma revealed that a small proportion of the T-4 pollen was viable, with 10-20% germination, while normal pollen from 'Tiny Tim' had 60-85% germination 3-6 h after pollination. A stable male-sterile mutant T-3, whose pollen development collapses at the microspore stage, was pollinated with T-4 pollen followed by normal 'Tiny Tim' pollen with time lags of 2, 4, and 8 h. Concurrently, the T-4 mutant was self-pollinated by hand followed by normal pollen from an inbred line (M) with time lags of 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. The progeny was scored for contamination based on differences in leaf characteristics. The percentage of T-4 seedlings (narrow leaved) in the F1 progeny was lowest at 2 h (0.2-6.3%), highest at 8 h (16.9-17.7%) and declined at 24 h-48 h (13.5-10.3%) time lag. The contamination rate was extremely low when pollination was done with normal pollen at (0.4%) and 24 h after (1.4%) anthesis without prior hand pollination with T-4 pollen. It was concluded that with pollination timing soon after anthesis, the T-4 mutant could be effectively applied in a two-line hybrid-seed production system with lower roguing cost of undesirable seedlings as opposed to the conventional three-line system. © 2010 JSHS.",Hybrid seed; Male-sterility; Pollen competition; Residual fertility; Two-line system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75949119683

Herbivory is known to alter pollination rates, by altering flower number [2], size [3, 4], nectar production [5], seasonal timing of flowering [6], or pollinator behavior [7]. Nicotiana attenuata, a night-flowering tobacco that germinates after fires in the Southwestern United States, normally produces flowers that open at night and release benzyl acetone (BA) to attract night-active hawkmoth pollinators (Manduca quinquemaculata and M. sexta), which are both herbivores and pollinators. When plants are attacked by hawkmoth larvae, the plants produce flowers with reduced BA emissions that open in the morning and are preferentially pollinated by day-active hummingbirds. This dramatic change in flower phenology, which is elicited by oral secretions (OSs) from feeding hawkmoth larvae and requires jasmonate (JA) signal transduction, causes the majority of outcrossed seeds to be produced by pollinations from day-active hummingbirds rather than night-active hawkmoths. Because oviposition and nectaring are frequently coupled behaviors in hawkmoths, we propose that this OS-elicited, JA-mediated change in flower phenology complements similarly elicited responses to herbivore attack (direct defenses, indirect defenses, and tolerance responses) that reduce the risk and fitness consequences of herbivory to plants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The species is predominantly outcrossing, but with a demonstrated capacity to set selfed seed where outcross pollen is limited, with consequent inbreeding depression in the progeny. Current controlled pollination methods therefore include a time-consuming emasculation step. We used microsatellite genotyping of seedlings to determine the consequences of outcross pollination with and without emasculation. Only 1 of 3 mother trees set a small amount (5%) of selfed seed. Using whole inflorescences from the male parent as the pollen applicator rather than sieved pollen reduced outcross contamination rates from 19.1 to 8.7% and substantially increased worker productivity. Application of sugar solution to the female flowers immediately prior to pollination increased yield of sound seeds per spike.

Despite this, the processes governing reproductive isolation among cytotypes growing in mixed-ploidy populations are still largely unknown. Theoretically, coexistence of diploid and polyploid individuals in sympatric populations is unlikely unless cytotypes are prezygotically isolated through assortative pollination. Here, we investigated the pre-mating barriers involved in the maintenance of three co-occurring cytotypes from the genus Gymnadenia (Orchidaceae): tetraploid and octoploid G. conopsea and tetraploid G. densiflora. We assessed differences in flowering phenology, floral morphology, and visual and olfactory cues, which could lead to assortative mating. Gas chromatography coupled with electroantennographic detection was used to identify scent compounds with physiological activity in the two main pollinators, Deilephila porcellus and Autographa gamma. The importance of olfactory cues was also assessed in the field by analysing the moths' responses to the olfactory display of the plants, and by following the pollinator's behaviour on artificial arrays. Our complex approach demonstrated that the coexistence of Gymnadenia cytotypes in mixed-ploidy populations was only partly explained by differences in floral phenology, as cytotypes with overlapping flowering (i.e., octoploid G. conopsea and tetraploid G. densiflora) might freely exchange pollen due to only 1 mm differences in spur lengths and the lack of assortative behaviour of pollinators. While floral colour among the cytotypes was similar, floral scent differed significantly. Though both pollinator species seemed to physiologically detect these differences, and the floral scent alone was sufficient to attract them, pollinators did not use this cue to discriminate the cytotypes in the field. The absence of pre-mating barriers among cytotypes, except partial temporal segregation, suggests the existence of other mechanisms involved in the cytotypes' coexistence. The genetic differences in ITS sequences among cytotypes were used to discuss the cytotype's origin. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cytotypes; Floral volatiles; Fragrant orchid; Gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection; Matting barriers; Polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955774846

Comparing sexual to apomictic plants, apomictic pollen has more abortion after meiosis during the microspore stage and a lower viability and, of both types, only some plants have sufficient germination in a high sugar concentration. Using in vitro pollination with the sexual plant, the pollen tube penetrates into the nucellus and micropyle, but the embryo sac degenerates and collapses.

Although the exudate is believed to play important roles in the pollination process, the biosynthetic pathway of stigmatic estolide, including genes encoding the key enzymes, remains unknown. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP86A22, which encodes a fatty acyl-CoA ?-hydroxylase involved in estolide biosynthesis in the stigma of Petunia hybrida. A CYP86A22 cDNA was isolated from a developing stigma cDNA library, and the corresponding gene was shown to express predominantly in the developing stigma. Among six P450 genes isolated from this library, only CYP86A22 was implicated in ?- hydroxylation following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated suppression. Unlike wild-type plants in which ?-hydroxy fatty acids (mainly in the form of 18-hydroxy oleic acid and 18-hydroxy linoleic acid) compose 96% of total stigma fatty acids, the ?-hydroxy fatty acids were essentially absent in the stigmas from 18 of 46 CYP86A22-RNAi transgenic plants and had varying levels of suppression in the remaining 28 plants. Furthermore, lipids in the 18 CYP86A22-RNAi stigmas were predominantly triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols instead of the estolides, which characterize the wild-type stigma. Analyses of recombinant CYP86A22 conclusively demonstrated that this P450 is a ?-hydroxylase with a substrate preference for both saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoAs rather than free fatty acids. We conclude that the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP86A22 is the key fatty acyl-CoA ?-hydroxylase essential for the production of ?-hydroxy fatty acids and the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol-/diacylglycerol-based estolide polyesters in the petunia stigma. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950476602

Resources, Kingsclear Forest Nursery, Island View, NB, E3E 1G3, Canada","Two series of realised genetic gain tests of large plots, one for black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) and one for white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss), were established in the early 1990s in New Brunswick, Canada, to investigate realised gains from planting improved seedlots representing early-stage tree improvement activities. Individual-tree growth was recorded up to age 15 (one-quarter of their rotation age). Four improved seedlots were included in the black spruce gain test. Planting the superior stand seedlot (CAN101) could obtain moderate gain (7.0% in volume/tree and 3.5% in volume/ha at age 15). Growth improvement for the seedlot (UNROG) collected from a seedling seed orchard (FRA_SSO) established using phenotypically selected plus trees was negligible but genetic roguing improved the FRA_SSO seedlot's growth, resulting in 3.3 and 2.1% increase in 15-yr volume per tree and per hectare, respectively. The highest gain was observed by deploying the elite half-sib family (01-15), which resulted in a gain of 27.6% in 15-yr volume/ha. Three improved seedlots were included in the white spruce realised-gain test. The seedlot (OVSSO) collected from a provenance seedling seed orchard had 9.2% more volume/ha at age 15 years. Much higher gains were observed in the seedlots collected from an unrogued clonal seed orchard (DNR_CSO). Mixed cone collections from the DNR_CSO achieved 25.6% more volume/ha at age 15 than the unimproved seedlot. Practicing supplemental mass pollination with unimproved pollen in the DNR_CSO greatly reduced its seedlot gains, i.e. 12.9% in 15-yr volume/ha. In both tests, the gain varied with age or site index. Realised gains in this study differed greatly from those observed in the corresponding genetic tests using small-plots. This suggests that using a small plot size for trials could greatly bias the actual gains possible on a plantation-scale, particularly when using seedlots obtained from orchards. © 2010 New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited, trading as Scion.",Black spruce; Large-plot gain test; Seed orchard; White spruce,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75649118577

In a fragmented landscape, strong variation in population size and in local density is expected to cause strong variation in allelic diversity at the S-locus, which could generate an Allee effect on female reproductive success by constraining compatible pollen availability. In this experimental study, we aimed at detecting this SI-specific Allee effect (or S-Allee effect) in the endangered species Biscutella neustriaca. We demonstrated the occurrence of a SI mating system in the species and determined compatibility relationships among genotypes through a large set of controlled pollinations. For the experiment, we chose three different pollen receptor genotypes, each compatible with respectively 100, 75 and 25% of four other genotypes, which constituted the pollen sources. We placed different ramets of each receptor at different distances from the pollen sources to control for pollen limitation due to low local density, and we measured the seed set on each receptor plant three times consecutively. Analyses performed with generalized linear mixed models showed that both the distance to the pollen sources and the mate availability due to SI had a significant effect on seed set, with a strong reduction observed when mate availability was limited to 25%. Our results suggest that pollen limitation due to a restriction in compatible mate availability could occur in small or scattered populations exhibiting low allelic diversity at the S-locus. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Allee effect; Brassicaceae; Generalized linear mixed model; Mate availability; Pollen limitation; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952094414

Crosses between the diploids Hylocereus polyrhizus and H. undatus in both directions were performed. Fertilized ovules carrying embryos at very early pro-embryonic stages were excised from ovaries 5 days after pollination (DAP) and placed on half-strength basal MS medium containing 680 ?M glutamine, 0.55 ?M ?-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 0.45 ?M thidiazuron (TDZ) and various concentrations of sucrose. After 30 days in culture, ovules were isolated from the surrounding tissue and transferred to the same fresh medium. Significant differences were found between the main effects (cross and sucrose concentration) in ovule response, i.e., increased ovule size and callus formation. The best responses were obtained in the cross: H. polyrhizus × H. undatus; and sucrose concentration of 0.09 M. In terms of embryo conversion, polyembryony and number of regenerated plants, the highest responses were observed on the culture medium supplemented with 0.17 M sucrose in both interspecific crosses. All tested plants were found to be diploid by flow cytometric analyses. Fluorescent amplified-fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) confirmed the hybrid origin of the regenerated plants. This study reports on the success of a three-step embryo rescue procedure for Hylocereus species. The procedure developed here provides the means for producing plants from very-early embryo stage, thus expanding the prospects for vine-cactus breeding programs. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",?-Naphthaleneacetic; Cactaceae; Embryo rescue; Flow cytometry; Fluorescent AFLP; Ovule culture; Thidiazuron,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953323052

The study was carried out in the Paulo de Faria Ecological Station, São Paulo State, Brazil and included the sampling and mapping of 467 adult-trees and 149 juveniles. Open-pollinated seeds (514) from 29 seed-trees were also sampled and genotyped. Significant SGS was detected in both adult (Sp = 0.0269) and juveniles trees (Sp = 0.0246), indicating short-distance seed dispersal. Using maternity analysis, all juveniles had the mother-tree assigned within the stand. A father-tree within the stand was also assigned for 97.3% of the juveniles and 98.4% of offspring. The average pollen dispersal distance measured in juveniles (?? = 138 ± 169 m, mean ± SD) and offspring (?? = 252 ± 204 m) were higher than the average seed dispersal distance measured in juveniles (?? = 124 ± 150 m). About 70% of the pollen from juveniles and 51% from offspring traveled less than 200 m and, 72% of the seeds traveled less than 50 m. The effective population size of the studied sample indicates that the 467 adult-trees and 145 juveniles correspond respectively to 335 and 63 individuals that are neither inbred nor relatives.

In some systems, the background is an organism whose fitness is affected by the predator-prey interaction. In these cases, the phenotype of the background species may evolve to affect the degree of background matching in the predator-prey interaction. For example, some flower species (the background) are inhabited by camouflaged ambush predators that attack visiting pollinators. These flowers have a fitness interest in the outcome of the predator-prey interaction because flowers depend on pollinator visitations for reproduction. Therefore, floral colour might evolve relative to predator colour so as to influence the detectability of resident predators. I have created a three-player game, based on Signal Detection Theory, to model the co-evolution of predator and prey/pollinator behavioural strategies with floral colour. This model makes two general predictions: (1) Constraints on predator distributions favour the evolution of flowers that match the predators' colour because they prevent predators from overexploiting these flowers; (2) factors that produce less discriminating pollinators also favour the evolution of flowers that match the predators' colour because these pollinators are willing to land on these flowers even if the safety of the flower is in doubt. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.",Background matching; Game Theory; Signal Detection Theory,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649342309

To understand better the post-transcriptional changes regulating petal senescence, a proteomic approach was used to profile protein changes during the senescence of Petunia×hybrida 'Mitchell Diploid' corollas. Total soluble proteins were extracted from unpollinated petunia corollas at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after flower opening and at 24, 48, and 72 h after pollination. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in non-senescing (unpollinated) and senescing (pollinated) corollas, and image analysis was used to determine which proteins were up-or down-regulated by the experimentally determined cut-off of 2.1-fold for P <0.05. One hundred and thirty-three differentially expressed protein spots were selected for sequencing. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to determine the identity of these proteins. Searching translated EST databases and the NCBI non-redundant protein database, it was possible to assign a putative identification to greater than 90% of these proteins. Many of the senescence up-regulated proteins were putatively involved in defence and stress responses or macromolecule catabolism. Some proteins, not previously characterized during flower senescence, were identified, including an orthologue of the tomato abscisic acid stress ripening protein 4 (ASR4).

Islands with deer had a substantially lower absolute density and a greater relative density of A. formosa than deer-free islands. The presence of deer was associated with higher pollen deposition, which probably resulted from the greater relative density of A. formosa on islands with deer.

Accordingly, a pattern of selection on floral traits is expected to be consistent with increasing the attraction and pollen transfer of the important pollinator. We measured individual variation in six floral traits and yearly and lifetime total plant seed and fruit production of 758 plants across nine years of study in natural populations of Ruby-Throated Hummingbird-pollinated Silene virginica. The type, strength, and direction of selection gradients were observed by year, and for two cohorts selection was estimated through lifetime maternal fitness. Positive directional selection was detected on floral display height in all years of study and stigma exsertion in all years but one.

It is difficult to reliably sustain commercial M. rotundata populations in the United States because of problems with disease, parasites, predators, and unexplained mortality. One possible explanation for early immature mortality is that, relative to floral availability, superfluous numbers of bees are released in alfalfa fields where resources quickly become limited. Our objective was to determine how M. rotundata density affects bee nesting, pollination efficiency, and reproductive success. Various numbers of bees were released into enclosures on an alfalfa field, but only 1090% of released female bees established nests. Therefore, a ""bee density index"" was derived for each enclosure from the number of established females and number of open flowers over time. As the density index increased, significant reductions occurred in the number of pollinated flowers, number of nests, and number of cells produced per bee, as well as the percentage of cells that produced viable prepupae by summer's end and the percentage that produced adult bees. The percentage of cells resulting in early brood mortality (i.e., pollen balls) significantly increased as the density index increased. We conclude that bee nest establishment, pollination efficiency, and reproductive success are compromised when bee densities are high relative to floral resource availability. Open field studies are needed to determine commercial bee densities that result in sustainable bee populations and adequate pollination for profitable alfalfa seed production.",Alfalfa leafcutting bee; Bee density; Medicago sativa; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76649089654

Flowers consisting of meranthia (floral parts that function as single pollination units; commonly observed in garden Iris) are extremely rare among the angiosperms and their significance poorly understood. Unlike all other known examples of meranthia, the novel type described for H. pulchra is not bilabiate. All Huttonaea species are unique in having twin petal sacs with glandular verrucae that secrete oil and are pollinated by Rediviva (Melittidae) oil-collecting bees. But only Huttonaea pulchra has long and widely divergent petal claws that place the oil sacs well beyond the reach of a centrally po-sitioned bee. The wide separation of these sacs forces the pollinator, R. colorata, to visit each side of the flower independently and effectively divides the flower into two meranthia. Molecular data indicate that the evolution of the Huttonaea-type meranthium was dependent on the prior evolution of the oil flower/oil bee relationship. Meranthium evolution was also facilitated by the presence of oil in two separate structures (petal sacs) that were not physically constrained to remain in close proximity.",Diseae; Floral evolution; Huttonaea; Meranthium; Oil-collecting bees; Orchidaceae; Pollination; Rediviva,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76349089804

Subsidizing energy crops, for example, recently fostered a strong increase in the area cultivated with oilseed rape Brassica napus across the EU. These changes in landscape structure affect biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Mass-flowering oilseed rape has been shown to positively affect colony growth and densities of bumblebees, which may enhance pollination services in agroecosystems. Not considered, however, have been species-specific traits of pollinators resulting in disproportionate benefits from these recurrent resource pulses. A subsequent community shift towards the subsidized species potentially distorts plant-pollinator interactions in the surrounding landscape. We analysed the effects of mass-flowering crops on the abundance of legitimate long-tongued bumblebee pollinators, nectar robbing by illegitimate short-tongued bumblebees and seed set in the long-tubed flowers of red clover Trifolium pratense in 12 landscape sectors with differing amounts of oilseed rape. Densities of long-tongued bumblebees visiting long-tubed plants decreased with increasing amounts of oilseed rape. The simultaneous increase of nectar robbing suggests that resource depletion is a likely explanation for this decline which may lead to a distortion in plant-pollinator interactions. The decline in long-tongued bumblebees, however, did not result in an immediate effect on seed set. In contrast, seed set increased with increasing amounts of semi-natural habitats, indicating the positive effects of these habitats on the legitimate long-tongued pollinators. Synthesis and applications. Accounting for species-specific traits is essential in evaluating the ecological impacts of land-use change. The disproportional trait-specific benefits of increasing oilseed rape to short-tongued bumblebees may abet an increasingly pollinator-dependent agriculture but simultaneously threaten the more specialized and rare long-tongued species and their functions. Semi-natural habitats were found to positively affect seed set in long-tubed plants indicating that they can counteract the potentially distorting effects of transient mass-flowering crops on plant-pollinator interactions in agroecosystems. Future agri-environmental schemes should aim to provide diverse and continuous resources matching trait-specific requirements of various pollinators in order to avoid resource competition. Thereby they harmonize the economic interest in abundant pollinators and the conservation interest in protecting rare species. © 2009 The Authors.

It has been suggested that indirect effects of crab spiders (Thomisidae) on pollinator behaviour can cascade down the food web and negatively affect plant fitness. However, it is poorly understood how different pollinator groups react to crab spiders and, thus, when a reduction in plant fitness is likely to occur. Using continuous video surveillance, we recorded the behaviour of pollinators on two flower species and the pollinators' responses to three crab spider treatments: inflorescences (1) with a pinned dried spider, (2) with a spider model made of paper, and (3) without spiders (control). We found that pollinators avoided inflorescences with dried spiders only on one plant species (Anthemis tinctoria). Pollinators showed no significant avoidance of paper spiders. Honeybees and bumblebees did not react to dried spiders, but solitary bees and syrphid flies showed a strong avoidance. Finally, we found no evidence that inflorescences with dried spiders suffered from a decrease in fitness in terms of a reduced seed set. We hypothesise that top-down effects of predators on plants via pollinators depend on the degree of specialisation of pollinators and their tendency to avoid spiders. © 2009 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Indirect effects; Multitrophic interactions; Plant fitness; Predation; Xysticus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75749107039

This discrepancy is exacerbated by the lack of a theoretical context to assess patterns in epiphyte community structure. We attempt to fill this gap by developing an analytical framework to investigate epiphyte assemblages, which we then apply to a data set on epiphyte distributions in a Panamanian rain forest. On a coarse scale, interactions between epiphyte species and host tree species can be viewed as bipartite networks, similar to pollination and seed dispersal networks. On a finer scale, epiphyte communities on individual host trees can be viewed as meta-communities, or suites of local epiphyte communities connected by dispersal. Similar analytical tools are typically employed to investigate species interaction networks and meta-communities, thus providing a unified analytical framework to investigate coarse-scale (network) and fine-scale (meta-community) patterns in epiphyte distributions. Coarse-scale analysis of the Panamanian data set showed that most epiphyte species interacted with fewer host species than expected by chance. Fine-scale analyses showed that epiphyte species richness on individual trees was lower than null model expectations. Therefore, epiphyte distributions were clumped at both scales, perhaps as a result of dispersal limitations. Scale-dependent patterns in epiphyte species composition were observed. Epiphyte-host networks showed evidence of negative co-occurrence patterns, which could arise from adaptations among epiphyte species to avoid competition for host species, while most epiphyte meta-communities were distributed at random. Application of our ""metanetwork"" analytical framework in other locales may help to identify general patterns in the structure of epiphyte assemblages and their variation in space and time. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Checkerboard distribution; Co-occurrence; Epiphyte, host trees; Meta-community; Nestedness; Network; Null model; Panamanian rain forest; Plant assemblages; Scale-dependent patterns; Spatiotemporal variation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949276875

However, although the diversity of pollinators and floral morphology is much lower in Europe and Asia than in North America, the number of columbine species is similar in the three continents. This supports the hypothesis that habitat and pollinator specialisation have contributed differently to the radiation of columbines in different continents. To establish the basic background to test this hypothesis, we expanded the molecular phylogeny of the genus to include a representative set of species from each continent. Our results suggest that the diversity of the genus is the result of two independent events of radiation, one involving Asiatic and North American species and the other involving Asiatic and European species. The ancestors of both lineages probably occupied the mountains of south-central Siberia. North American and European columbines are monophyletic within their respective lineages. The genus originated between 6.18 and 6.57 million years (Myr) ago, with the main pulses of diversification starting around 3 Myr ago both in Europe (1.25-3.96 Myr ago) and North America (1.42-5.01 Myr ago). The type of habitat occupied shifted more often in the Euroasiatic lineage, while pollination vectors shifted more often in the Asiatic-North American lineage. Moreover, while allopatric speciation predominated in the European lineage, sympatric speciation acted in the North American one. In conclusion, the radiation of columbines in Europe and North America involved similar rates of diversification and took place simultaneously and independently. However, the ecological drivers of radiation were different: geographic isolation and shifts in habitat use were more important in Europe while reproductive isolation linked to shifts in pollinator specialisation additionally acted in North America. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Adaptive radiation; Allopatric speciation; Columbines; Habitat specialisation; Historical contingency; Pollination syndromes; Sympatric speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949542316

For the start to close time, both F1 and F2 hybrids were similar in showing the major peak in the evening. The ratio of evening closing and morning closing among F2 hybrids did not deviate from 3: 1.

Due to their intimate host association, pollinating fig wasps are expected to occupy the entire distribution of their host fig. An understanding of the physiology of fig wasp species and the factors affecting adult survival are important for understanding and explaining wasp abundance and distribution patterns. We examine distribution and abundance patterns of a fig tree-fig wasp system in which the non-pollinator (Ceratosolen galili) has been reported to be rarer than the pollinator (Ceratosolen arabicus) in drier areas due to lower desiccation tolerance. Both species are closely related and utilise the same oviposition sites on Ficus sycomorus. We used ecological niche modelling to determine whether C. galili covers the range of F. sycomorus and whether it is consistently rarer than C. arabicus. We examined emergence times, critical thermal limits, desiccation and starvation tolerances of the wasps. The suggested rarity of C. galili relates to lower abundance in certain months and at certain localities but a similar number of occurrence records within the distributional range (except in arid regions, e.g. Namibia). In contrast to C. galili, C. arabicus has a wider thermal range, lives longer under hydrating and dehydrating conditions and is a nocturnal flier. The synergistic effect of physiological tolerances and flight time differences exacerbate the less favourable conditions available to C. galili during flight and location of receptive figs. These factors enable C. arabicus to survive for longer than C. galili, meaning that they are more likely to disperse to trees that are flowering further away in space and time. Combining correlative and mechanistic approaches has aided us in understanding the ecological niches of these species. © 2010 The Author.

In the present study, the progamic phase, from pollination to fertilization, is characterized in Annona cherimola, which is a member of the Annonaceae, the largest extant family among early-divergent angiosperms. Beside interest due to its phylogenetic position, this species is also an ancient crop with a clear niche for expansion in subtropical climates. Methods The kinetics of the reproductive process was established following controlled pollinations and sequential fixation. Gynoecium anatomy, pollen tube pathway, embryo sac and early post-fertilization events were characterized histochemically. Key Results A plesiomorphic gynoecium with a semi-open carpel shows a continuous secretory papillar surface along the carpel margins, which run from the stigma down to the obturator in the ovary. The pollen grains germinate in the stigma and compete in the stigma-style interface to reach the narrow secretory area that lines the margins of the semi-open stylar canal and is able to host just one to three pollen tubes. The embryo sac has eight nuclei and is well provisioned with large starch grains that are used during early cellular endosperm development. Conclusions A plesiomorphic simple gynoecium hosts a simple pollen-pistil interaction, based on a support-control system of pollen tube growth. Support is provided through basipetal secretory activity in the cells that line the pollen tube pathway. Spatial constraints, favouring pollen tube competition, are mediated by a dramatic reduction in the secretory surface available for pollen tube growth at the stigma-style interface. This extramural pollen tube competition contrasts with the intrastylar competition predominant in more recently derived lineages of angiosperms.",Annona cherimola; Annonaceae; Embryo sac; Endosperm; Magnoliid; Ovule; Pollen tube; Pollen-pistil interaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76649085194

We used Sinojackia xylocarpa, a well documented Chinese endemic species that is extinct in the wild, as a model case to address this concern. We used paternity analyses to assess the spontaneous hybridization and patterns of pollen flow between S. xylocarpa and its congener species, S. rehderiana, in conserved populations in Wuhan Botanic Garden. Interspecific hybridization events were detected in seven out of eight maternal trees of S. xylocarpa, and an average of 32.7% seeds collected from maternal trees of S. xylocarpa were hybrids. The paternity of 93 out of 249 seedlings from S. xylocarpa assigned to S. rehderiana provided convincing evidence that spontaneous interspecific hybridization occurred extensively in the living garden collection we studied. Different patterns of pollen dispersal (predominantly short-distance vs. long-distance pollination) were observed between intra- and interspecific hybridization events in the garden. Pollen dispersal within the ex situ populations was not restricted by distance, as evidenced by a lack of significant correlations between the average effective pollen dispersal distance (?) and the geographic distances (d1 and d2) between maternal and paternal trees. The interspecific pollen-dispersal distance ranged from 10 to 620.1 m (mean 294.4 m). Such extensive hybridization in ex situ collections could jeopardize the genetic integrity of endangered species and irrevocably contaminate the gene pool if such hybrids are used for reintroduction and restoration. We recommend strongly that measures be taken to minimize the genetic risks of this kind of hybridization, including establishing buffer zones in ex situ collections, manipulating flowering phenology, testing seed lots before use in reintroduction programs, and controlling pollination for seed purity. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.",Ex situ collections; Hybridization risks; Jack tree; Pollen dispersal; S. rehderiana; Sinojackia xylocarpa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74549173000

If evolutionary transitions between reproductive systems involve morphological floral adjustments, changes in the magnitude and pattern of phenotypic integration of floral traits may be expected. In this study, we focused on the evolutionary dynamics of a complex adaptive trait, the extent of reciprocity (reciprocal placement) among sexual organs in a heterostylous species, and explored the associated changes in phenotypic floral integration during the transition from tristyly to distyly. The extent of reciprocity and both the magnitude and pattern of floral integration were characterized in 12 populations of Oxalis alpina representing the tristyly-distyly gradient. Although the extent of reciprocity increased along the tristyly-distyly transition, the flower size diminished. These adjustments did not affect the magnitude, but did affect the pattern, of floral integration. Changes in the pattern of floral integration suggested that allometric, functional and pleiotropic relationships among floral traits were affected during this evolutionary transition. © 2009 New Phytologist.",Constraints; Distyly; Floral integration; Flower morphology; Heterostyly; Phenotypic evolution; Phenotypic matrix; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74549161650

Box 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224, United States","Climate change is expected to alter patterns of species co-occurrence, in both space and time. Species-specific shifts in reproductive phenology may alter the assemblages of plant species in flower at any given time during the growing season. Temporal overlap in the flowering periods (co-flowering) of animal-pollinated species may influence reproductive success if competitive or facilitative interactions between plant species affect pollinator services. We used a 33-year data set on flowering phenology in subalpine meadows in Colorado, USA, to determine whether interannual variation in snowmelt date, which marks the start of the growing season, affected co-flowering patterns. For two of four species considered, we found a significant relationship between snowmelt timing and composition of the assemblage of co-flowering plants. In years of early snowmelt, Lathyrus lanszwertii var. leucanthus (Fabaceae), the species we investigated in most detail, tended to overlap with earlier-flowering species and with fewer species overall. In particular, overlap with the flowering period of Lupinus polyphyllus var. prunophilus, with which Lathyrus leucanthus shares pollinators, was significantly reduced in early-snowmelt years. The observed association between timing of snowmelt and patterns of flowering overlap could not have been predicted simply by examining temporal trends in the dates of peak flowering of the dominant species in the community, as peak flowering dates have largely shifted in parallel with respect to snowmelt date. However, subtle interspecific differences in responsiveness of flowering time, duration, and intensity to interannual climate variation have likely contributed to the observed relationship. Although much of the year-to-year variation in flowering overlap remains unexplained by snowmelt date, our finding of a measurable signal of climate variation suggests that future climate change may lead to altered competitive environments for these wildflower species. © 2010 by the Ecological society of America.",Climate change; Co-flowering; Colorado; Heterotheca; Hymenoxys; Lathyrus; Long-term data; Lupinus; Mertensia; Phenology; Rocky mountain biological laboratory; Snow; Snowmelt; USA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949290852

By comparing the abundance and diversity of insect pollinators and generalist natural enemies in three model biofuel crops: corn, switchgrass, and mixed prairie, we tested the hypothesis that biofuel crops comprised of more diverse plant communities would support increased levels of beneficial insects. These three biofuel crops contained a diverse bee community comprised of 75 species. Overall, bees were three to four times more abundant in switchgrass and prairie than in corn, with members of the sweat bee (Halictidae) and small carpenter bee (Ceratina spp.) groups the most abundant. Switchgrass and prairie had significantly greater bee species richness than corn during the July sampling period. The natural enemy community at these sites was dominated by lady beetles (Coccinellidae), long-legged flies (Dolichopodidae), and hover flies (Syrphidae) which varied in their response to crop type. Coccinellids were generally most abundant in prairie and switchgrass, with the exception of the pollen feeding Coleomegilla maculata that was most abundant in corn. Several rare or declining coccinellid species were detected in prairie and switchgrass sites. Dolichopodidae were more abundant in prairie and switchgrass while Syrphidae showed no significant response to crop type. Our results indicate that beneficial insects generally responded positively to the increased vegetational diversity of prairie and switchgrass sites; however, when managed as a dedicated biofuel crop, plant and arthropod diversity in switchgrass may decrease. Our findings support the hypothesis that vegetationally diverse biofuel crops support higher abundance and diversity of beneficial insects. Future policy regarding the production of biofuel feedstocks should consider the ecosystem services that different biofuel crops may support in agricultural landscapes. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2010.",Agricultural landscapes; Bees; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Natural enemies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76649109566

In the field it is generally assumed that flowers serve as beacons to guide pollinators. Artificial hummingbird feeders are coloured red to serve a similar function. However, anecdotal reports suggest that hummingbirds return to feeder locations in the absence of the feeder (and thus the beacon). Here we test these reports for the first time in the field, using the natural territories of hummingbirds and manipulating flowers on a scale that is ecologically relevant to the birds. We compared the predictions from two distinct hypotheses as to how hummingbirds might use the visual features of rewards: the distant beacon hypothesis and the local cue hypothesis. In two field experiments, we found no evidence that rufous hummingbirds used a distant visual beacon to guide them to a rewarded location. In no case did birds abandon their approach to the goal location from a distance; rather they demonstrated remarkable accuracy of navigation by approaching to within about 70 cm of a rewarded flower's original location. Proximity varied depending on the size of the training flower: birds flew closer to a previously rewarded location if it had been previously signalled with a small beacon. Additionally, when provided with a beacon at a new location, birds did not fly directly to the new beacon. Taken together, we believe these data demonstrate that these hummingbirds depend little on visual characteristics to beacon to rewarded locations, but rather that they encode surrounding landmarks in order to reach the goal and then use the visual features of the goal as confirmation that they have arrived at the correct location. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Beacon; Landmark; Local cue; Rufous hummingbirds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77349101074

Here we quantify queen dispersal in two common bumblebee species in an arable landscape. Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal. Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used to take into account an expected low level of false identification of sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal. Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly disperse over distances greater than 10 km.

To clarify how spring ephemerals use current photosynthetic products for reproduction, the allocation patterns of photosynthate at flowering and fruiting and the effects of resource limitation on reproductive performance in Corydalis ambigua were assessed. 2. A 13C tracing experiment revealed that about 20% of the current photosynthetic carbon was used for reproduction at both flowering and fruiting. The proportion of 13C allocated to fruits was constant irrespective of the light level. In contrast, 13C translocation to tubers increased at fruiting, and this trend was accelerated when plants were shaded. 3. Defoliation treatment significantly reduced nectar production and tuber mass, while seed production was not affected. Therefore, when carbon assimilation was limited, carbon was preferentially allocated to current reproduction (seeds) rather than to pollinator attraction (nectar) or storage (tuber). 4. If seed production is partly supported by carbohydrate reserved in the old tissue of tubers, nectar and seed production may not compete strongly for carbon sources. In contrast to the ability of high seed production, the susceptibility of nectar production to current photosynthesis indicates that seed production of this species is basically limited by pollen capture. 5.

Exposure of the insects to insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) contained in pollen of transgenic maize was also assessed. Female C. carnea were most abundant in a maize field when the majority of plants were flowering and fresh pollen was abundant. Field-collected females contained an average of approximately 5000 maize pollen grains in their gut at the peak of pollen shedding. Comparable numbers were found in females fed ad libitum maize pollen in the laboratory. Maize pollen is readily used by C. carnea adults. When provided with a carbohydrate source, it allowed the insects to reach their full reproductive potential. Maize pollen was digested mainly in the insect's mid- and hindgut. When Bt maize pollen passed though the gut of C. carnea, 61% of Cry1Ab (event Bt176) and 79% of Cry3Bb1 (event MON 88017) was digested. The results demonstrate that maize pollen is a suitable food source for C. carnea.

In fruit harvested between a young stage (66 days after pollination) (DAP) and an early commercial harvesting stage (143 DAP), 2 days of exposure to propylene were sufficient to initiate ethylene biosynthesis while in fruit harvested at commercial harvesting stage (154 DAP), 4 days of propylene treatment were required. This observation suggests that response of ethylene biosynthesis to propylene treatment in kiwifruit declined with fruit maturity. Propylene treatment resulted in up-regulated expression of AC-ACO1, AC-ACO2, AC-SAM1 and AC-SAM2, prior to the induction of AC-ACS1 and ethylene production, confirming that AC-ACS1 is the rate limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis in kiwifruit. Treatment of fruit with more than 5 ?L L-1 of 1-MCP after the induction of ethylene production subsequently suppressed ethylene production and expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes. Treatment of fruit with 1-MCP at harvest followed with propylene treatment delayed the induction of ethylene production and AC-ACS1 expression for 5 days. These observations suggest that in ripening kiwifruit, ethylene biosynthesis is regulated by positive feedback mechanism and that 1-MCP treatment at harvest effectively delays ethylene production by 5 days. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated this hypothesis in invasive eastern North American populations of tristylous Lythrum salicaria L. (purple loosestrife) by controlled self- and cross-pollinations of 124 plants sampled from 12 populations grown under uniform glasshouse conditions. We evaluated whether populations at the northern front of the invasion exhibited higher levels of SC than southern populations, which are closer to source populations for the North American invasion. We also sought evidence for morph-specific differences in the strength of trimorphic incompatibility. We used the ASTER statistical program to jointly model three measures of SC: (1) the probability of producing at least one seed following self-pollination, (2) the number of fruits produced by selfpollination, and (3) the average number of seeds per fruit resulting from self-pollination. Just over one-quarter of plants set at least one fruit after self-pollination, and there was a significant effect of style morph on variation in SC, with the mid-styled morph most compatible. Although variation for SC was detected in 11 of the 12 populations, there was no evidence that SC increased toward the northern range limit as a result of the invasion process. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

To understand the mechanisms of the species' distribution, we investigated local adaptation and adaptive plasticity in a range-wide context in Sitka spruce, a wind-pollinated tree species that has recently expanded its range after glaciations. Phenotypic traits were observed using growth chamber experiments that mimicked temperature and photoperiodic regimes from the limits of the species realized niche. Bud phenology exhibited parallel reaction norms among populations; however, putatively adaptive plasticity and strong divergent selection were seen in bud burst and bud set timing respectively. Natural selection appears to have favoured genotypes that maximize growth rate during available frost-free periods in each environment.

Although recent studies have resulted in C. subg. Cyclonema and C. sect. Konocalyx being removed to the resurrected genus Rotheca, and the unispecific genus Huxleya being sunk into Clerodendrum, it has been unclear whether Clerodendrum as currently circumscribed is monophyletic, particularly in relation to the American genera Aegiphila, Amasonia, and Tetraclea. This phylogenetic study employs four relatively fast-evolving chloroplast DNA regions, trnT-L, trnL-F, trnD-T, and trnS-fM, to clarify the generic boundaries of Clerodendrum and its relationship to allied genera. The results corroborate previous studies that there are three well-supported clades in the currently recognized Clerodendrum: an Asian clade, an African clade, and a Pantropical Coastal clade. The Asian clade and African clade are sister groups and together form a monophyletic group. However, the Pantropical Coastal clade is more closely related to the three American genera than it is to the other two Clerodendrum clades. In addition, a Caribbean species, C. spinosum, is found to be more closely related to the American genera than it is to any of the three major Clerodendrum groups. These results indicate that Clerodendrum as currently circumscribed is not monophyletic. We propose to separate the Pantropical Coastal clade and C. spinosum by reviving the genera Volkameria (including Huxleya) and Ovieda, respectively for these, and to restrict Clerodendrum to the Asian and African clades. Brief descriptions of the genera to be recognized are provided. All Neotropical 'Clerodendrum' taxa are referred to other genera, necessitating six new combinations, which are also provided, where required, for two other well-studied Old World Volkameria species; all names ever used in Ovieda are given their modern placings (two placed newly in synonymy). The study also sheds light on the evolution of an intriguing breeding strategy that avoids self-pollination or/and sexual interference. This strategy involves presentation of pollen and stigma in the centre of the flower in a sequential fashion by moving the filaments and style. It appears to have evolved in the common ancestor of Clerodendrum, Volkameria, Ovieda, Amasonia, Tetraclea, Aegiphila and Kalaharia, and still occurs in all of these taxa except Aegiphila, where it has been succeeded by a heterostylous system.",Aegiphila; Breeding strategy; Chloroplast DNA; Clerodendrum; Huxleya; Ovieda; Phylogeny; Volkameria,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77149121107

The average frequency of cultivar-marker introgression across the wild populations was very low (0.02).

In multitrophic communities diversity may vary at different trophic levels, with either synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecosystem functioning. Intensification of land-use systems is often found to reduce diversity, which in turn may lead to reduced associated ecological functions in natural food webs, such as host-parasite interactions. In this study we investigated the relationship between the number of natural enemy and host species and the mean rate and temporal variability of parasitism (inverse of stability), along an intensification gradient of coffee agroforests in Ecuador. We used standardised trap nests for bees and wasps and their natural enemies in 14 agroforests, and evaluated these monthly over a period of 17 months. We found that parasitism rates of wasps and bees increased with increasing number of enemy species and decreased with increasing number of host species. Temporal variability in parasitism rates decreased with increasing number of enemy species and increased with temporal variability in enemy species richness; however, these effects were restricted to wasp hosts. Intensification of agroforests did not significantly affect species richness of hosts or enemies or their relation to parasitism and its temporal variability. We conclude that high enemy diversity may enhance parasitism rates and that high host diversity may provide resistance against consumption. Furthermore, we show that a diverse and stable enemy community may also have a stabilizing effect on parasitism rates. However, these effects may be host-guild specific, as these relations were restricted to wasps. © The Author(s) 2009.",Biodiversity; Land use; Management; Pollinator; Predator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949275183

Particular emphasis is given to the comic but exceedingly sober song Gee, Officer Krupke. Bernstein's sensitivity to the ambiguity and tension inherent in the tritone in West Side Story is conceptualized as an intersection of music theory and theories of mind; this perspective holds implications for clinical practice and transports psychoanalytic concepts from the couch to the Broadway stage and into the community to address the complexities of love, hate, aggression, prejudice, and violence.

Unlike the situation in the Solanaceae, where self-compatibility accompanying polyploidization is often due to the compatibility of heteroallelic pollen, the genotype-dependent loss of SI in sour cherry is due to the compatibility of pollen containing two nonfunctional S haplotypes. Sour cherry individuals with the S4S 6S36aS36b genotype are predicted to be SC, as only pollen containing both nonfunctional S36a and S36b haplotypes would be SC. However, we previously found that individuals of this genotype were SI. Here we describe four nonfunctional S36 variants. Our molecular analyses identified a mutation that would confer loss of stylar S function for one of the variants, and two alterations that might cause loss of pollen S function for all four variants. Genetic crosses showed that individuals possessing two nonfunctional S36 haplotypes and two functional S haplotypes have reduced self-fertilization due to a very low frequency of transmission of the one pollen type that would be SC. Our finding that the underlying mechanism limiting successful transmission of genetically compatible gametes does not involve GSI is consistent with our previous genetic model for Prunus in which heteroallelic pollen is incompatible. This provides a unique case in which breakdown of SI does not occur despite the potential to generate SC pollen genotypes.

The reproductive phenophases (cone bud initiation to pollination) goes up to four months with a blooming and pollination period of one month. The prolonged period of male cones during the immature phase was due to two months dormancy, and the dormancy, in turn, could be due to high precipitation during this phase. The pattern of opening of male cones was basipetal succession. Microsporangium dehiscence was dependent on air temperature and relative air humidity with a peak between noon and 2 pm. Flowering shows a high level of asynchrony among individuals within the population, leading to a possibility for geitonogamous selfing. Annual production of male cones varies greatly from one year to the next. A reduced number of pollen cones per tree in 2001 resulted in a decline in overall annual pollen production. In conclusion, the results revealed that the production of male cones represent only one factor that substantially influences the mating system, which will interact with the flowering phenology to influence the genetic composition of the population. © 2010 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952937388

In 1965, with the foundation of the Germplasm Bank of Tropical and Subtropical Fruit Trees (Havana Province), the principal Cuban guava collection was established. This gene bank was formed from three different sources: (i) foreign cultivars, (ii) plants prospected in different localities throughout the country, and (iii) selected genotypes segregating from open-pollinated seeds. During this period, an incipient breeding program was started, which resulted in the identification of nine cultivars with 'E.E.A. 1-23', 'E.E.A. 18-40', 'Belic L-207', 'Belic L-215', 'Belic L-97' and 'E.E.A. 28-44' showed the highest yields. The two formers are also dwarf genotypes and nowadays constitute the main cultivars for commercial production in Cuba. In 2001, a breeding program by controlled crosses produced a total of 354 hybrid plants from which 25 dwarf genotypes were finally selected on the basis of quantitative and qualitative traits for the establishment of new commercial cultivars. The three populations from these crosses were further employed to develop guava genetic linkage maps and to map QTLs using morph-agronomic characters and molecular markers. The combination of molecular marker methods and phenotypic description was greatly facilitated cultivar identification, diversity estimation, and elite genotypes recommendation in guava germplasm.

The RCTP-1 was selected from a segregated population of the various crosses carried out during1993-1999. The evaluation and maintenance were carried out during 2004-2007 at this centre since last three years. Flowering and fruiting started at a height of 84.58 cm from base of the plant. Plant is tall in stature with single straight stem without branching. After pollination fruit set occurred in 5.60 days and fruit matured in 132.55 days. Plants flowered in 169.45 days after transplanting and had remarkably higher fruiting zones of 214.68 cm. Stem of 32.88 cm girth produced 92 leaves and grew up to 293.67 cm height. Fruits were well shaped adequately spaced on the plants with out any thinning. The plant produced an average fruit yield of 63.25 kg compared to 52.65 kg/plant yield of 'Pusa Delicious'. The average fruit weight was 2.05 kg containing 159 seeds with 90.50% germination power. Its fruits measured 3.12 cm flesh thickness, and 24.25 cm fruit length. The total soluble solids were 12.5 brix at ripening stage of the fruit. The infestation of Papaya ringspot virus was not observed during the last two year of crop period. Hence, this selection could be utilized for commercial cultivation for sub-tropical region of north east India and Tripura as well.",Improvement; Papaya; Selection; Yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951060470

Agarkar Road, Pune, 411004 Maharashtra, India","The present paper reports on palynology and pollination ecology of eight taxa of Amorphophallus from North Western Ghats (NWGS) and Konkan region of India. Out of ten known pollen exine ornamentations of the genus, six are represented - psilate, striate, fossulate, verrucate, scabrate and the new type 'pseudofossulate' of Amorphophallus commutatus var. wayanadensis. These diverse pollen exine ornamentations can be utilized as an important taxonomic tool to distinguish taxa and also to resolve taxonomic problems (A. commutatus complex). The pollen of all eight taxa had retained their sculptured surface (exine ornamenatation type) after acetolysis. This clearly demonstrates that these taxa do not show susceptibility to the conventional acetolysis technique as reported earlier. The present study also highlights the importance of pollen surface morphology concerning phytogeography of the genus. Observation of pollination ecology of the studied Amorphophallus taxa reveals that all are mostly visited by beetles (Bostrichidae, Cetoniidae, Hybosoridae, Lyctidae, Nitidulidae, Rutelinae, Scarabaeidae, Staphylinidae), followed by flies (Drosophilidae, Muscidae), bees (Apidae: Trigone), ants (Formicidae, Dolichoderinae) and cockroaches (Blaberidae/Panesthiinae). The beetle families Bostrichidae, Lyctidae and Rutelinae, ant families Formicidae and Dolichoderinae and the cockroach family Blaberidae/Panesthiinae are for the first time reported as visitors in the genus Amorphophallus. Most of the taxa display features characteristic of cantharophily (beetle pollination) except A. commutatus var. commutatus and A. commutatus var. wayanadensis, where Trigona bees are the actual pollinators. The beetles (Cetoniidae, Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae) and bees (Apidae: Trigona) are the real pollinators for the Amorphophallus species of NWGS and Konkan while rest of the insects are mere visitors for alimentary/food resources (staminode flowers, stigmatic fluid, pollen, appendix surface, appendix exudates) and using the inflorescences as mating and egg laying sites. Species belonging to the section Rhaphiophallus (Amorphophallus konkanensis and Amorphophallus sylvaticus) are pollinated by Epuraea - Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles only. Generally, the species of Amorphophallus in NWGS and Konkan region with short flowering peduncle are always pollinated by dung beetles or scarabs while species bearing a long flowering peduncle are usually pollinated by Epuraea - Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles and Trigona bees. Based on the comparative observations, five different phases of insect trapping in Amorphophallus taxa are characterized, focusing on the intricacies of pollination strategies of various pollinators. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Neither is currently available in the ornamental plant industry. To aid domestication, we are investigating the possibility of creating inter-generic hybrids with related exotic ornamental plant species, Portulaca grandiflora and Portulaca umbraticola. Portulaca grandiflora has been selected for temperate climates and flowers do not close under low light intensity. Our preliminary experiments have shown these species do not produce inter-generic hybrid seeds, and capsules die within 12 days after pollination as pollen tube growth is inhibited within the stigma. We are characterising capsule, seed, and embryo development of these species to establish a development window for when in vitro ovule pollination and embryo rescue might be achieved. Further, we have demonstrated that in ovulo embryo culture can be achieved using swollen, dark green capsules having brown to black colour swollen seeds at six to nine days after pollination in intra-specific control crosses of P. umbraticola.",Breeding; Capsule; In ovulo embryo culture; Pollen tube growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71649103082

Using conventional methods, breeding programs are extremely lengthy and preference is given to vegetative clonal propagation. Plant tissue culture can be used to reduce the time required to achieve crop improvement in terms of fruit size and quality and height of trees. Tall tree height in date palm is one of the major difficulties affecting date production. Conventional breeding techniques incorporated with plant tissue culture techniques were successfully implemented to develop tall date palm by dwarf date palm (T x D) hybrid date palms in Kuwait. Female date palm cultivars 'Barhi', 'Madjhool', and 'Sultana' were pollinated with male pollen of dwarf date palm (Phoenix pusilla). Fertilization followed by fruit set was achieved in all three female date palm cultivars. However, seed development was arrested followed by embryo abortion. Seedless fruit were obtained in all three cultivars pollinated with dwarf date palm. Immature hybrid embryos from the three cultivars were successfully isolated from the sterilized immature fruits and cultures were established in vitro. Plantlets were produced using embryo culture techniques using modified MS medium. Adventitious rooting of plantlets was achieved in vitro using 0.1 mg/L NAA and rooted plantlets were acclimatized using standardized date palm acclimatization procedures. Acclimatized T x D hybrid date palms were planted in the field and maintained for growth and flowering.

Two main questions were examined: (i) Do the frequencies of pollination categories estimated at plant species level differ from those estimated considering plant abundance? and (ii) Does plant abundance differ according to categories of pollination in the context of each vegetation attribute? The frequencies of classes of pollination agents and systems of pollination specificity were estimated at plant species and plant abundance level for the community, habitats, life-forms, strata, horizontal disposition, and season. Besides, plant abundance of each category of pollination agent classes and systems of pollination specificity were statistically compared. Most of the comparisons between the frequency of plant species and plant abundance were non-significant (58.3%). The multivariate classifications of life-forms and habitats according to pollination agent classes using plant species and plant abundance separately are very similar. In both analyses, perennial herbs come out as a separate group, which is associated with a comparable frequency distribution of pollination agent classes. The frequency distributions of polyphilous, oligophilous, and monophilous species were statistically higher for plant abundance than for plant species in the disturbed area and in the lowest stratum (D), which is primarily associated with the relation between life-forms and vegetation strata. The average values of abundance for wind-pollinated plants were found to be larger than those for other categories of pollination systems specificity and pollination agent classes, respectively, in the forest-savanna transition and overall community. All anemephilous species have clumped distribution and plant abundance was higher in this case than what was found with the other categories of pollination specificity with clumped distribution. Estimates of pollination agent classes at plant species level proved to be a practical method to estimate pollination frequency, mainly for those studies related to the floristic composition of the community. The large values of abundance for wind-pollinated species are in concordance with the savanna-forest mosaic vegetation growing in the Venezuelan Central Plain, but are in contrast with the comparatively low percentage of wind-pollinated species recorded. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Resistance breeding is an effective way of controlling pests and diseases, provided that the resistance is durable. As the gene pyramiding strategy for increasing durability requires a sufficient supply of resistance genes with different modes of action, the identification and mapping of new resistance genes is an ongoing process in breeding. In this paper, we describe the mapping of an apple scab, a powdery mildew and a woolly apple aphid gene from progeny of open-pollinated mildew immune selection. The scab resistance gene Rvi16 was identified in progeny 93.051 G07-098 and mapped to linkage group 3 of apple. The mildew and woolly aphid genes were identified in accession 93.051 G02-054. The woolly aphid resistance gene Er4 mapped to linkage group 7 to a region close to where previously the genes Sd1 and Sd2, for resistance to the rosy apple leaf-curling aphid, had been mapped.

We found that the peak of flowering (when the highest number of species flowered) was 4-8 weeks later for spiny species than for non-spiny species. The flowering peak of non-spiny species was in late March, while that of spiny species was at the beginning of May. The seasonal shift in flowering time from the main season, when most Mediterranean plants bloom, to the end of the flowering season, when fewer species bloom, might be the evolutionary result of a change in phenology reducing the competition for pollinators. Our results clearly indicate that spinescence of plants in the semi-arid east Mediterranean region is associated with a delayed flowering season at the beginning of the dry summer when most of the herbaceous vegetation is already dry. During this season, mammalian grazers consume any edible herbaceous vegetation, selecting for late flowering species that allocate more resources for anti-herbivore defenses than early flowering species. There is a well-known global geographical trend where the occurrence of spiny plants is higher in arid regions than in humid ones. In parallel to the global trend, we show a seasonal one, that non-spiny plants grow and flower in the spring, which is the main flowering season in the Mediterranean basin, while spiny plants flower later, in the hot and dry summer.

Despite their central roles in pollination biology, very little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying nectar production. This project was undertaken to identify genes potentially involved in mediating nectary form and function in Brassica rapa. Methodology and Principal Findings: Four cDNA libraries were created using RNA isolated from the median and lateral nectaries of B. rapa flowers, with one normalized and one non-normalized library being generated from each tissue. Approximately 3,000 clones from each library were randomly sequenced from the 59 end to generate a total of 11,101 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Sequence assembly of all ESTs together allowed the identification of 1,453 contigs and 4,403 singleton sequences, with the Basic Localized Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) being used to identify 4,138 presumptive orthologs to Arabidopsis thaliana genes. Several genes differentially expressed between median and lateral nectaries were initially identified based upon the number of BLAST hits represented by independent ESTs, and later confirmed via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). RT PCR was also used to verify the expression patterns of eight putative orthologs to known Arabidopsis nectary-enriched genes. Conclusions/Significance: This work provided a snapshot of gene expression in actively secreting B. rapa nectaries, and also allowed the identification of differential gene expression between median and lateral nectaries. Moreover, 207 orthologs to known nectary-enriched genes from Arabidopsis were identified through this analysis. The results suggest that genes involved in nectar production are conserved amongst the Brassicaceae, and also supply clones and sequence information that can be used to probe nectary function in B. rapa. © 2010 Hampton et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649322638

However, the importance of intraspecific genetic variation and diversity to floral abundance and pollinator visitation has received little attention. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental common garden that manipulated genotypic diversity (the number of distinct genotypes per plot) of Solidago altissima, we document that genotypic diversity of a dominant plant can indirectly influence flower visitor abundance. Across two years, we found that 1) plant genotype explained 45% and 92% of the variation in flower visitor abundance in 2007 and 2008, respectively; and 2) plant genotypic diversity had a positive and non-additive effect on floral abundance and the abundance of flower visitors, as plots established with multiple genotypes produced 25% more flowers and received 45% more flower visits than would be expected under an additive model.

Furthermore, shading by an invasive plant may reduce pollinator visitation and therefore reproduction in native plants. Our study quantifies and identifies mechanisms of these direct and indirect effects of an invasive shrub on pollination and reproductive success of a native herb. We measured pollinator visitation rate, pollen deposition, and female reproductive success in potted arrays of native Geranium maculatum in deciduous forest plots invaded by the non-native shrub Lonicera maackii and in two removal treatments: removal of aboveground L. maackii biomass and removal of flowers. We compared fruit and seed production between open-pollinated and pollen-supplemented plants to test for pollen and light limitation of reproduction. Plots with L. maackii had significantly lower light, pollinator visitation rate, and conspecific pollen deposition to G. maculatum than biomass removal plots. Loniceramaackii flower removal did not increase pollinator visitation or pollen deposition compared to unmanipulated invaded plots, refuting the hypothesis of competition for pollinators. Thus, pollinator-mediated impacts of invasive plants are not limited to periods of co-flowering or pollinator sharing between potential competitors. Geranium maculatum plants produced significantly fewer seeds in plots containing L. maackii than in plant removal plots. Seed set was similar between pollen-supplemented and open-pollinated plants, but pollen-supplemented plants exhibited higher seed set in plant removal plots compared to invaded plots. Therefore, we conclude that the mechanism of impact of L. maackii on G. maculatum reproduction was increased understory shade. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Competition; Ecosystem service; Lonicera maackii; Pollen limitation; Pollinator visitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954455544

We quantified the total number of perfect and staminate flowers, the pollen received and fruits produced per plant in two populations, and estimated phenotypic gender and fruit set. Local density failed to explain phenotypic gender, nevertheless, plant height and fruit set increased with local density in one population where, in addition, the slopes for the size-dependent sex allocation curve were steeper. As observed for other plant species, this suggests that between population differences in resource availability is the main underlying factor for the observed population differences in the size-dependent allocation pattern to flowers and fruits. On the other hand, the number of staminate and perfect flowers per plant increased with plant height and the fastest increase of staminate flowers resulted in a male-biased size-dependent sex allocation strategy in both populations. Since pollination intensity was not correlated with plant height in any population, the observed allocation strategy cannot be attributed to differences in pollen availability between different sized individuals, but to differences in plant size. Finally, because fruit set and total fruit number increased with plant height in one population, the obtained results provide further evidence that animal-pollinated, andromonoecious species may exhibit a male-biased size-dependent sex allocation strategy, which may favor female fecundity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Fitness; Local density; Phenotypic gender; Plant height; Size-dependent sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953476721

It is also well known that early germination occurs in viviparous mutants, which are impaired in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. To provide some insight into the genetic determinism of kernel desiccation in maize, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for traits related to kernel moisture and ABA content in both embryo and endosperm during kernel desiccation. In parallel, the expression and mapping of genes involved in kernel desiccation and ABA biosynthesis, were examined to detect candidate genes.Results: The use of an intermated recombinant inbred line population allowed for precise QTL mapping. For 29 traits examined in an unreplicated time course trial of days after pollination, a total of 78 QTLs were detected, 43 being related to kernel desiccation, 15 to kernel weight and 20 to ABA content. Multi QTL models explained 35 to 50% of the phenotypic variation for traits related to water status, indicating a large genetic control amenable to breeding. Ten of the 20 loci controlling ABA content colocated with previously detected QTLs controlling water status and ABA content in water stressed leaves. Mapping of candidate genes associated with kernel desiccation and ABA biosynthesis revealed several colocations between genes with putative functions and QTLs. Parallel investigation via RT-PCR experiments showed that the expression patterns of the ABA-responsive Rab17 and Rab28 genes as well as the late embryogenesis abundant Emb5 and aquaporin genes were related to desiccation rate and parental allele effect. Database searches led to the identification and mapping of two zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) and five novel 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) related genes, both gene families being involved in ABA biosynthesis. The expression of these genes appeared independent in the embryo and endosperm and not correlated with ABA content in either tissue.Conclusions: A high resolution QTL map for kernel desiccation and ABA content in embryo and endosperm showed several precise colocations between desiccation and ABA traits. Five new members of the maize NCED gene family and another maize ZEP gene were identified and mapped. Among all the identified candidates, aquaporins and members of the Responsive to ABA gene family appeared better candidates than NCEDs and ZEPs. © 2010 Capelle et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950471284

The aim of this study is to determine the main organic acids present in this novel melon and to clarify the mechanisms of acid accumulation. Fruit development and acid accumulation patterns in 'Flavor No. 3' were compared with those of a conventional low-acid melon, 'Xuelihong'. The titratable acidity (TA) and organic acids in fruits were measured at different developmental stages. There is a positive correlation between TA and citric acid content in 'Flavor No. 3', indicating that citric acid is the predominant organic acid present throughout the fruit development. The activities of the enzymes involved in citric acid metabolism, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), citrate synthase (CS), aconitase (ACO), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and malic enzyme (ME), were determined. Although no single enzyme was responsible for citric acid accumulation throughout the fruit development, the activities of ACO and ME were positively correlated with citric acid concentration in the two cultivars from 5 to 25 days after pollination (DAP). Moreover, ACO and ME activities in 'Flavor No. 3' increased over time and were higher than those in 'Xuelihong', resulting in citric acid accumulation in the fruits of 'Flavor No. 3'. Although a sharp decrease in ACO activity took place after 25 DAP in the fruits of 'Flavor No. 3', the earlier accumulation of citric acid was sufficient enough to maintain the high acid concentration until the melon fruits became mature.

Once the lip is touched by a landing insect, it will move up and down or swing left and right continuously, just like a moving caterpillar. By suck a lip movement, the pollinator, a very small fruit fly (Drosophila sp.) ca. 1 mm in height, will be pressed toward the column apex where anther and stigma are located, and then cross-pollination takes place.

The objectives of this study were to describe the floral biology, nectar production, the reproductive system, the effect of pollination intensity and flowering phenology of Ruellia angustiflora, as well as keeping a record of the hummingbirds that visit the flowers of this species. Data collection was performed in a stretch of the Salobrinha stream in the Serra da Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, from August 2005 to July 2006. R. angustiflora flowered throughout most of the study period; it has diurnal anthesis and has increased nectar production in the morning hours with decreasing production rates during the day. The results of the reproduction experiments indicate self-fertility and pollen limitation in R. angustiflora. Among experiments with different pollination intensity there was no significant difference in fruit formation. Four hummingbird species were observed visiting the flowers of R. angustiflora, and Phaethornis pretrei was the most frequent followed by females of Thalurania furcata. According to its behavior and frequency of visits, P. pretrei can be considered the main pollinator of R. angustiflora in the study area. The experiments on flowers treated with different pollen loads indicate that most successful fruit formation in this species is obtained in flowers that received greater pollen loads on their stigmas. Besides, data suggest that major success in fruit set could be reached with more than three visits of P. pretrei. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

We investigated the relationship between specialization and pollination efficiency, defined as the proportion of pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal, using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system. Rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency. Sexually deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency, but food-deceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency. Values for pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination. Population genetic data indicated that both food- and sexually deceptive species have higher degrees of among-population gene flow than do rewarding orchids. Thus, the shift from food to sexual deception may be driven by selection for more efficient pollination, without compromising the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive species. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.",Food deception; Pollination efficiency; Pollination strategy; Pollinia; Sexual deception; Specialized pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77449151449

(Watermelon) is an important crop plant in Kenya. Being monoecious, watermelon is entirely dependent upon pollination services usually by insects for production. Although the centre of origin for this plant is thought to be tropical Africa, essentially not much has been studied of its pollination requirements in this region. The current study investigated the identity of the wild pollinators of watermelon, their behaviour and relative pollination efficiencies at Yatta, a farm near Thika (Eastern Province). The main pollinator for this crop was found to be the honey bee, Apis mellifera but three wild species of Lasioglossum were found as important pollinators. These wild bees have a significantly higher (P< 0.0001) pollen deposition on stigmas of watermelon than honeybees. One of the Lasioglossum (Ctenonomia) sp. 4 deposited on average three times as much pollen as the honeybee. At about the time of stigmatic receptivity, the number of visits by this species to female flowers increases until it equals visits to male flowers irrespective of number of flowers per plot. This behavioural pattern coupled with the high pollen deposition potential makes Lasioglossum (Ctenonomia) sp. 4 a superior candidate as an alternatively managed pollinator for watermelon. Knowing that visitation occurs mostly in the morning, and that flowers last only for one day, spraying can be done in the later hours of the day when the pollinators have virtually stopped foraging on the flowers. In view of the reported pollinator decline globally, the wild pollinator species reported in this study warrant further investigation on their nesting biology and potential for domestication.",Native pollinators; Pollen deposition; Visitation patterns; Watermelon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149290279

Since floral visitors can vary in their ability to remove and transfer pollen, it is important to show that visitation patterns reflect effective pollination. Given the difficulty of measuring per-visit pollen deposition at the community scale, a first step is to examine the amount of conspecific pollen carried by insect visitors. Here I compared the plant-animal visitation network with the pollen-transport network, estimated from insect pollen loads, for a montane meadow community from southern California, USA. Visitation and pollen-transport networks were positively associated with each other in both 2001 and 2002. However, the exclusion of visitors that do not carry any conspecific pollen reveals that pollen-transport networks are more specialized from the plants' perspective and that species are involved in fewer mutualistic interactions compared with estimates derived from visitation frequencies. Although conspecific pollen loads were smaller in 2002, bees tended to carry the largest conspecific loads in both years and were responsible for transporting the most pollen. These results suggest that, although visitation networks are suitable first-order approximations of pollination networks, information on which visitors carry conspecific pollen, and in what amounts, is crucial for distinguishing between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. © 2009 Oikos.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72949106257

Question: Do pollinating fig wasps adjust their offspring sex ratio in response to their relatedness to other nearby ovipositing fig wasps? Organisms: Ceratosolen solmsi Mayr, an obligate pollinator of the functionally dioecious fig tree, Ficus hispida Linn. Methods: From May to October 2007, we reared pollinators from a single foundress through five generations. We collected male syconia before they matured and placed them in a fine-mesh bag. We used female pollinators that emerged. Our protocol ensured that females were sibs at each stage. We counted female and male wasps, galls, bladders (inflated, hollow ovules), and total female flowers in 25% of each syconium. More than 10 syconia were obtained in each generation. For comparison, we ran a non-sibling foundress treatment in July and August 2007. We analysed the data using a generalized linear model Results: Offspring sex ratio was similar among the five sibling mating generations in our experiments, and the offspring sex ratio in the local mate competition models with sibling foundresses and non-sibling foundresses was also similar. The offspring sex ratio increased in the presence of more foundresses. Conclusion: Ceratosolen solmsi does not adjust its offspring sex ratio according to sibling relatedness. © 2010 Da W.

One such adaptation is the reported colour difference caused by unequal distribution of anthocyanidin pigments amongst plant species visited by hummingbirds and passerines. This phenomenon has been suggested to reflect possible differences in the colour vision of these pollinating birds. The presence of any such difference in colour vision would arguably affect the ecological and evolutionary interactions between flowers and their visitors, accentuating differences in floral displays and attractiveness of plants to the favoured avian pollinators. We have tested for differences in colour vision, as indicated by the amino acid present at certain key positions in the short-wavelength-sensitive type 1 (SWS1) visual pigment opsin, between the major groups of pollinating birds: the non-passerine Trochilidae (hummingbirds), the passerine Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) and Nectariniidae (sunbirds) plus five other Passerida passerine families.

We studied several aspects of its reproductive biology, including potential pollinators, floral biology, and diurnal and seasonal flowering phenology. Flower visitors were observed in G. tomentosum populations on O'ahu, Kaho'olawe, and Maui. Primary visitors were introduced species, honeybees and carpenter bees, both of which were pollinating the flowers. No native bee species were seen visiting flowers. In examining floral biology we found that in some cases 10% of flowers had styles that were as short as the anthers or were recurved toward the anthers. In the greenhouse, in the absence of pollinators, these flowers were the only ones that set fruit. Flowering of G. tomentosum commences in January and February, following the rainy season, peaks in May, and may continue into August and September. In one year, after higher than average precipitation during the rainy season, there was a greater abundance of flowering, and flowering persisted later into the year. Transgenic varieties of commercial cotton, G. hirsutum, are grown in Hawai'i and are interfertile with G. tomentosum. Honeybees and carpenter bees are also known pollinators of commercial cotton. Because these pollinators are long-distance foragers, we estimate that transgenic cotton fields would have to be greater than 10 km from a G. tomentosum population to prevent gene flow. © 2010 by University of Hawai'i Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952589047

We studied the seed dispersal and pollination modes of woody species of two 12-year-old secondary forest patches, beforehand used for sugarcane cultivation. Sixty plots were installed with a total area of 0.6 ha. A total of 61 woody species were encountered. Although the study sites were isolated from old-growth forests by the matrix of sugarcane, the array of dispersal modes was the same as in old-growth forest fragments and the percentage of animal-dispersed species was similar (89.8%). The percentage of large-seeded species was even larger than expected (18%), despite the local extinction of large-bodied mammals and birds. Besides the dispersal of large seeds mainly by rodents and bats, more than half of the large-seeded species are consumed by humans and may have reached the study areas this way. Most pollination modes found in forest fragments in the region were also present in the secondary forests; however, no pollination mediated by vertebrates was found among the studied species, neither by birds nor by bats, and a high percentage of species showed an unspecialized pollination mode (55.7%). Due to the high abundance of a few species pollination by hawkmoths was very common among canopy individuals (42.7%), and many sub-canopy individuals were pollinated by large bees (39.8%). The study exemplifies the resilience of sites degraded by intense agriculture, which may still lead to a forest, simplified in plant-animal interactions. Such secondary forest is likely to serve for protection against erosion, and increasing connectivity between forest fragments. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

They are pollinated by host-specific pollinator fig wasps (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae), and their fruit phenology and reproductive success are, therefore, modulated by symbiotic fig wasps. However, there are few studies focusing on the variation of Ficus reproductive success in strongly seasonal environments. We examined the phenology and reproductive success of Ficus altissima growing in a highly seasonal climate towards the northern limit of the range of fig trees in Xishuangbanna, China. Leaf production occurred at irregular intervals throughout the year, with new leaves and syconia initiated together, producing between three and seven crops over a 3-year period. Syconia were produced in synchronous crops with asynchrony between trees. The syconia produced more seeds than pollinators, and those syconia with more seeds also produced more pollinators. Reproductive success (measured as the number of seeds and pollen-carrying agaonid females produced by each syconium) varied greatly between seasons. It was highest for crops that matured during the cooler, relatively dry periods from February to March and October to November, and was lowest during the summer months from April to August. This variation corresponded to small differences in the number of flowers in the syconia, but was mainly driven by large seasonal differences in the relative abundance of non-pollinating fig wasps. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ficus; Fig wasps; Mutualism; Phenology; Seasonality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954242805

Developing a pollination technique that results in an acceptable level of fruit set with a minimum amount of pollen grains and without a further need for thinning is critically required especially under harsh conditions. During 2009 and 2010 seasons, the effect of pollen grain-water suspension spray at different concentrations on fruit set, yield and quality were examined on 'Khenazy' date palm cultivar. Fruit setting was significantly higher in the spray pollination than in the traditional pollination. Spray pollination at the concentration of 1.5 or 2.0 g/1 gave higher fruit setting than the application at 0.5 g/l. Both of bunch weight and total yield per tree were significantly higher in spray than in traditional pollination. The Rutab percentage was not affected by the method of pollination. At both the Bisir and the Rutab stages, fruit and flesh weight were significantly higher in the traditional pollination than all other treatments, except for the spray pollination at 0.5 g/1. However, seed weight was not affected by any of the pollination treatments. Fruit diameter was significantly higher in the traditional pollination than in spray pollination. Fruit length was significantly higher in the traditional pollination than in all other treatments, except for the spray pollination at 0.5 g/1 at both stages. TSS, acidity, vitamin C, total phenols and soluble tannins concentrations of fruit were not significantly affected by any of the pollination treatments at both the Bisir and the Rutab stages. The concentrations of TSS and acidity were higher at the Rutab than at the Bisir stage. However, the concentrations of vitamin C, total phenols and soluble tannins were greatly lower at the Rutab than at the Bisir stage. The time needed for spray pollination was about half of the time needed for traditional pollination. In addition, the amount of the pollen grain required for the spray pollination was less than the half of that needed for the hand pollination. This study showed the possibility to pollinate 'Khenazy' date palms by pollen grain-water suspension spray with optimum amount of pollen grains and without a further need for thinning in attempt to reduce labor and costs especially under hot arid conditions. However, more research work is required to justify the optimum concentration of grain-water suspension and the response of each date palm cultivar to this pollination technique.",Date palm; Pollen grains suspension; Pollination; Quality; Thinning; Yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751609757

Co-flowering related plant species displaying a generalized pollination system can decrease their fitness due to interspecific mating. In this study, we determine the difference in diversity and composition of the pollination systems of two co-occurring species endemic to the alpine region of the Sierra Nevada (SE Spain), Erysimum nevadense Reut. and Erysimum baeticum baeticum (Heywood) Polatschek (Brassicaceae), and check for the potential role of floral and plant traits in explaining the observed differences. For this, we labeled 30 plants in two populations of each plant species located in the same area. We determined flower visitor assemblage by sampling all insects approaching the flowers and contacting the sexual organs during 60-min surveys. We found that the diversity of the pollinator assemblage was similar between the two studied wallflower species, both species showing a much generalized pollination system. However, the composition of the pollinator assemblage was different, since the flowers of E. nevadense were visited mostly by beetles and in a lesser extent by hover-flies, whereas the flowers of E. baeticum baeticum were visited mostly by ants and bees. Interestingly, flower traits varied between species, with E. nevadense displaying yellow, smaller and shallower flowers and E. baeticum baeticum displaying purple, large and deeper flowers. These findings suggest that differences in floral traits can explain the observed differences in the composition of the pollinator assemblage between both wallflower species. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

However, little is known about Neotropical plants that are pollinated by less specialized phyllostomid bats. Therefore, we studied the pollination biology of Parkia pendula, a tree pollinated by Phyllostomus. Flowers of P. pendula are arranged in capitula, and a capitulum is composed of approximately 800 hermaphrodite flowers and 260 sterile flowers. The sterile flowers produced a total of 7.4 ml nectar per night, with a sugar concentration of 14.95%, and proline as the dominant amino acid. Nectar production is highest at dusk and ends at 03:00 h. The floral scent is dominated by monoterpenoids (97.9%), with (. E)-?-ocimene being the dominant (84.0%) compound. No sulfur compounds were detected. The capitula are heavily visited by four species of phyllostomid bats, of which Phyllostomus discolor is the most abundant (98.9%). Nectar production per capitulum is within the reported range of nectar produced by this pantropical genus (5.0-8.0 ml). This genus-wide range seems to be optimal for attracting non-specialized nectar-feeding bats and forces them to visit capitula of several trees to satisfy their dietary needs, thus increasing the probability of cross-pollination for this plant. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Atlantic Forest; Bat pollination; Brazil; Fabaceae; Floral odor; Mimosoideae; Nectar composition; Nectar production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952416399

Abortion of pollinated capsules, however, remains a common problem, resulting in reduced yield and greater cost of seed. We studied capsule retention following pollination of 1 072 000 flowers over three commercial CP seasons at a grafted E. globules seed orchard. The aim of our study was to quantify genetic and orchard management effects on capsule retention. We also characterized trends in capsule abortion for 15 mo following pollination to determine associations with weather and orchard management events. Average capsule retention varied between 32% and 46% across the three seasons. Within seasons, capsule retention values for maternal clones varied by 48%. Maternal clone values were highly correlated between seasons (r = 0.830.95), suggesting that maternal clone effects can be reliably estimated from a single season. The effect of paternal clone was significant but smaller than the effect of maternal clone. Ramets with poorest health had an average of 17% lower capsule retention than those with the best health score. Ramets that had received an application of the growth hormone paclobutrazol within the previous 5 y had on average 13% lower capsule retention in two of the three seasons. Capsule retention was on average 0.6% lower for each year of ramet age. In two of the three seasons, capsule retention was 1. 7% lower for every 500 flowers pollinated on the tree. The rate of capsule loss from the time of pollination followed different trends in the two years that data were recorded. No maternal or paternal effect was found on the pattern or rate of capsule loss, suggesting overriding environmental effects. Orchard management activities such as irrigation and pruning had no discernible effect. We conclude that the cost of CP and MSP seed can be greatly reduced by careful selection of clones and by eliminating ramets of poor health. The negative association between paclobutrazol application and capsule retention needs to be balanced with the positive effect of paclobutrazol on flower production. Further research is required to understand the physiological bases for capsule abortion, although our results suggest that carbon limitation may be a significant factor. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Abortion; Costs; Effects; Environmental factors; Eucalyptus globules; Genetic variation; Health; Management; Maternal; Pollination; Seed orchards; Seeds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957845409

In both populations studied, the presence of bisexual inflorescences was not negligible (13%), where 'female' and 'male' bisexual plants were categorised according to the relative number of stamens and ovaries. 'Male bisexual' plants produce only pollen and 'female bisexual' plants produce only fruit. Hence, A. triphyllum is a true dioecious plant, as each plant only reproduces through either the male or the female function.

The present study reveals how a hemiparasitic plant parasitizing three host species gives rise to three distinct hemiparasite-host neighborhoods which differ in terms of volatile composition and pollinator attractiveness. The study was performed in a population of the mistletoe Tristerix verticillatus infecting three different species of hosts occurring in sympatry within a small area, thus exposing all individuals studied to similar abiotic conditions and pollinator diversity; we assessed the effect of hosts on the hemiparasites' visual and olfactory cues for pollinator attraction. During the study period, the hemiparasite individuals were flowering but the hosts were past their flowering stage. We collected volatile organic compounds from the hemiparasite and its hosts, measured floral display characteristics and monitored bird and insect visitors to inflorescences of T. verticillatus. We showed that: (1) floral patches did not differ in terms of floral display potentially involved in the attraction of pollinators, (2) hosts and hemiparasites on each host were discriminated as distinct chemical populations in terms of their volatile chemical profiles, (3) insect visitation rates differed between hemiparasites parasitizing different hosts, and (4) volatile compounds from the host and the hemiparasite influenced the visitation of hemiparasite flowers by insects. The study showed that a species regarded as ""ornithophilic"" by its floral morphology was actually mostly visited by insects that interacted with its sexual organs during their visits and carried its pollen, and that host-specific plant-volatile profiles within the T. verticillatus population were associated with differential attractiveness to pollinating insects. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Host-parasite chemical ecology; Loranthaceae; Plant-plant interactions; Tristerix verticillatus; Volatile organic compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74449088428

In obligate pollination-seed consumption mutualisms, selective abortion of flowers containing excessive eggs represents one such mechanism, but empirical tests have long been limited to the yucca-yucca moth mutualism. We present evidence for selective abortion in the recently discovered mutualism between Glochidion trees and Epicephala moths. In Glochidion acuminatum, proportion of aborted flowers progressively increased both with higher egg load and increased ovule damage. Selective abortion resulted in a 16% seed production increase compared with expectations under random abortion, and moths suffered fitness losses as high as 62% when ovipositing into pre-infested flowers.

The effects of this burrowing on plants, however, are typically evaluated only by assessing changes in photosynthetic or production traits, not pollination traits. Therefore little is known about the indirect effects of burrowing on pollinators through its effects on the emergence of insect-pollinated plants. We recorded the relative elevation, grass cover, and flower height of insect-pollinated plant species; the number of inflorescences; and the number of pollinators in a marmot colony on the Mongolian steppe. We compared these parameters on and off marmot mounds and searched for factors that might explain variations in pollinator biodiversity at the plot and individual-plant levels. Flower numbers and flower visitation frequency per plot were significantly higher in the on-mound plots. The number of pollinators at the plot level was positively correlated with the relative elevation and number of flowers. Species richness of the pollinators was negatively correlated with grass cover. These results demonstrate that mounds created by marmots attracted pollinators by increasing flower numbers and by making flowers more conspicuous by raising them above the surrounding vegetation or removing that vegetation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that both P. beesiana and P. bulleyana are typical heterostylous and obligate outcrossing species; the main pollinators of the two species were bees and butterflies. At the sites of all three populations, the main pollinating visitors of the two species showed preference for one of the two species, resulting in the ethological isolation of the two species by the pollinators. This ethological isolation contributes to the reproductive isolation of the two species, which supports the hypothesis that P. beesiana and P. bulleyana are two distinct species. The reproductive isolation of the two species (ethological isolation) is probably an important mechanism in maintaining species boundaries in the genus and has contributed to the species diversification of Primula in the area. In addition, gene exchanges between P. beesiana and P. bulleyana has occurred to some extent in the overlapping population, but whether natural hybridization has contributed to species diversification in Primula remains to be determined. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Pollination biology; Primula beesiana; Primula bulleyana; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949969438

Local variation in pollination can cause variation in mating patterns, reproductive output, genetic diversity, and selection, which can influence invasion dynamics. We quantified pollinator visitation, pollen deposition, and pollen limitation of reproduction in the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii in adjacent forest edge and forest interior habitats. Flowers in edge habitats received as many or more pollinator visits than those in interior habitats, resulting in twofold greater pollen deposition and nearly twice as many seeds produced per flower. Supplemental pollination increased seed production over open pollination by 37%-145% in both edge and interior habitats. Edge flowers produced more seed than interior flowers. Despite greater pollen deposition in edge habitats, the magnitude of pollen limitation was similar to interior plants. Thus, different mechanisms of pollen limitation characterize these habitats. Pollen receipt and other resources limited reproduction of interior plants, which were located in a shady environment. Pollen quality likely limited reproduction of edge plants, because pollinators visited more flowers per plant and likely delivered more geitonogamous pollen in this habitat than in the interior. Therefore, local variation in abiotic conditions influenced reproduction in this invasive plant, both directly and indirectly via pollinators. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Apis mellifera; Local environmental variation; Nonnative plant; Pollen deposition; Pollinator visitation; Resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949099492

We examined relations between flowering phenology, floral display and reproductive success in the nectar- producing orchids Sirindhornia mirabilis, S. monophylla and S. pulchella in Thailand. We found each species to be self-compatible and dependent on insects for pollination. Sirindhornia mirabilis exhibited prolonged longevity of individual flowers and produced more flowers per inflorescence - features that may have evolved in response to low visitation rates. Patterns of reproductive success in relation to floral display suggest selection for increased inflorescence size in S. mirabilis and S. monophylla, but this may be counterbalanced by selection for a sustainable annual fruit set. In all three species, the female (and in S. mirabilis also the male) reproductive success decreased from the basal to the apical part of the inflorescence.

However, feral bees and managed honeybees are threatened globally by several anthropogenic factors such as changes in agricultural practices, loss of unimproved grasslands, urbanization, and spread of pathogens. These factors have led to the extinction of many native bees, to a reduction in the number of managed honeybee colonies, and put the nutritional bases for bees at risk. Chronic exposure to insec ticides, even when they are appropriately used, may affect the foraging behavior of honeybees, which in turn weakens a colony and makes it more susceptible for diseases. Honeybees suffer from parasites like the Varroa mite, and from several viral and bacterial pathogens, which need to be controlled with great efforts. Climate changes represent future threats that will probably impact native bee populations as well as apicultural practices. Coordinated actions are needed to prevent the global loss of large pollinator populations. Especially the maintenance of plant and bee diversity is very important - as well as basic research on the causes for honeybee colony losses.

To better understand the cause of this low sexual reproduction, pistil receptivity, and pollen quality were investigated using culture medium and histochemical staining, with emphasis on pollen viability at different flowering stages. Cross-pollination, geitonogamy, and self-pollination were undertaken on flowers of sample trees. We found that flowers produce a large number of pollen grains available for effective pollination. Pollen viability varied at different stages, but was highest during stage 3, in which the stamens detach from the axis, the anthers dehisce, and the gynoecium stigma starts to fade. The duration of pistil receptivity was approximately 5 h. These results indicate that poor fertilisation may occur if the optimum period for pollination is missed or the stigma receives poor-quality pollen grains from stages other than stage 3. Although dichogamy avoids selfing, it has led to considerable geitonogamy. Our anatomical analysis of ovule and seed development further revealed that fertilisation occurred in samples with geitonogamy, but that the embryo degenerated in the torpedo stage, demonstrating that aborted seeds were produced by fertilisation, rather than by pseudogamy. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of reduced seed set under natural conditions. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

In particular, senita moths exploit senita cacti by obligately pollinating and ovipositing floral resources. Larvae consume the fruit but do not disperse among them. Previous studies have shown that moth oviposition occurs in a non-random, uniform distribution among floral resources (one egg per flower). Question: Do host-marking pheromones of senita moths, pollinated stigmas, and florivory act as signals and cues that aid them to avoid ovipositing in the previously exploited floral resources? Methods: We measured rates of moth pollination and oviposition of flowers in a series of experiments. In one experiment, we simulated pheromone deposition by placing an extract of moth abdomens on flowers. In another, we compared oviposition rates on hand-pollinated flowers with those on controls. In a third, we simulated florivory by damaging stigmas, anthers or petals. Results: Moth exploitation of floral resources was higher for control than abdomen-extract flowers. Control flowers received more ovipositions than those with pollinated stigmas. Finally, damaging the stigmas of flowers reduced ovipositions, although neither anther nor petal damage did so. Conclusion: Host-marking signals and the cues of pollinated stigmas and of florivory aid in the differential exploitation of floral resources by senita moths and their uniform distribution of eggs among flowers. © 2010 J.

Total pollen mass was measured after 24 and 48 h in flowers exposed to flower mites and excluded from hummingbirds, flowers exposed to mites and hummingbird visitation, and in flowers recently opened with dehisced anthers. Compared with recently opened flowers, pollen availability was reduced about half in the presence of flower mites and the same effect was observed in the three plant species.

Molecular fingerprints provide a powerful tool to address the relevant issues. Genetic structure of 22 populations of two self-pollinating pasture species, Elymus nutans and E. burchan-buddae, collected from various altitudes of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was studied using fluorescence-based amplified fragment length polymorphism technique. Analysis of molecular variance revealed 42.97% and 37.63% among-population variation for the two Elymus species, respectively, indicating that the majority of the total variation presented within populations. This result contradicts the common genetic variation pattern for a selfing plant species: lower genetic variation within populations. Further analysis suggested higher level of gene flow among populations within the same region than among different regions across the sampled area for the two Elymus species. STRUCTURE analyses of the Elymus populations indicated an evident admixture genetic structure, particularly among neighboring populations from the same region, supporting the hypothesis of considerable seed dispersal among populations. The excess within-region gene flow of E. nutans and E. burchan-buddae might be caused by grazing animals that promote seed dispersal when moved around the pastoral lands during foraging. The among-population gene flow promulgated by grazing animals may promote the maintenance of genetic diversity in the pasture species, particularly in small and fragmented populations within a given region. © The Society of Population Ecology and Springer 2009.",AFLP; Altitude; Elymus; Genetic differentiation; Structure of populations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72949086405

Controlled crosses were made for the cross-pollination treatments, while for the free pollination treatment flowers were allowed to receive pollen from more than 40 cultivars present in the field. Significant differences were recorded between treatments, cultivars and years. The lowest degree of shotberry formation was observed in free-pollinated trees while the highest was in self-pollinated trees of all cultivars. Low air temperature incidents during the flowering period increased shotberry formation. Cultivars Koroneiki and Mastoidis were reciprocally the most effective pollinator varieties in reducing shotberries.

Our surveys occurred before, during, and after the importation (between 1989 and 1996) of thousands of colonies of the Sardinian subspecies B. t. sassaricus. Queens and males of B. t. sassaricus were observed foraging outside commercial greenhouses in 1991, 1993, and 1994 and feral workers were observed foraging on native vegetation nearly two years after the importation of B. t. sassaricus ceased. However, no B. t. sassaricus, or F1 hybrids were observed after 1998. We conclude that B. t. sassaricus remains inconspicuous in France and competition from the three native subspecies may have prevented it from becoming invasive.

Nevertheless, the existence of private channels, i.e., the potential for exclusive communication via unique signals and receptors, is still debated in the literature. Interactions between figs and their pollinating wasps offer opportunities for exploring this concept. Several experiments have demonstrated that chemical mediation is crucial in ensuring the encounter between figs and their speciesspecific pollinators. Indeed, chemical messages emitted by figs are notably species-and developmental stage-specific, making them reliable cues for the pollinator. In most cases, the species-specificity of wasp attraction is unlikely to result from the presence of a single specific compound. Nevertheless, a recent paper on the role of scents in the interaction between Ficus semicordata and its pollinating wasp Ceratosolen gravelyi showed that a single compound, 4-methylanisole, is the main signal compound in the floral scent, and is sufficient by itself to attract the obligate pollinator. Mainly focusing on these results, we propose here that a floral scent can act as a private channel, attracting only the highly specific pollinator. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.",Agaonidae; Chemical mediation; Coevolved mutualism; Ficus; Floral filter; Private channel,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956988840

The effects of pressure, conspecific and heterospecific pollen, and pollen load (the amount of pollen deposited) on stigma behavior were examined in 270 flowers (of the total 430 flowers evaluated in the entire study). Pressure alone resulted in faster closure than did conspecific pollination and faster reopening than did heterospecific pollination. Stigmas never reopened after conspecific pollination. Pollen load had no effect on stigma behavior. Stigmas discriminated between conspecific and foreign pollen; they reopened only after pollination with the latter. A manipulative experiment revealed that stigma closure did not affect the number of conspecific pollen grains received. We also counted pollen tubes in styles that were either hand-supplemented with outcross conspecific pollen or open-pollinated. Pollen tube numbers were highest after light pollination (~900 grains), indicating that interference among pollen grains may occur after pollination with very heavy loads (> 6000 grains).

The aim of this work was to investigate the ultrastructure of osmophores involved in the release of the carrion odor of Orbea variegata and Boucerosia indica flowers. In spite of their similar architecture (epidermal epithelium+subepidermal secretory layers), the osmophores of stapeliads feature some differences in morphology and ultrastructure. The epidermal epithelial cells of O. variegata and B. indica differ in shape, but both are extremely rich in endoplasmic reticulum and flocculent material in the vacuole. Unlike the Orbea, Boucerosia has starchless leucoplasts in the epidermal epithelium. Orbea features a cuticle with microchannels, while Boucerosia has a different mechanism for the pathway of scent substances to the cell exterior. They are released by rupturing of the outer layer of cuticle at the apex of the papillae. The epidermal cells of the adaxial corolla differ even between parts of the corolla, the corolla lobes and the annulus in the flower. This diversity may be connected with an odor gradient. The morphological and anatomical features of stapeliad (subtribe Stapeliinae) osmophores are generally similar to osmophores of members of subtribe Ceropegiinae (Ceropegia), thus, we suggest that this model of osmophores evolved before early diversification of Ceropegieae. The ultrastructural features of stapeliad osmophores are generally similar to those of Araceae, Orchidaceae and Passifloraceae. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Analogously, flower visitors either solely feed on floral resources or complement their diet with these, and are hence dependent or not on the flowers they visit. We assume that obligate flower visitors evolved abilities that enable them to effectively forage on flowers including mechanisms to bypass or tolerate floral defences such as morphological barriers and repellent/deterrent secondary metabolites. Facultative flower visitors, in contrast, are supposed to lack these adaptations and are often prevented to consume floral resources by defence mechanisms. In cases where obligate flower visitors are mutualists and facultative ones are antagonists, this dichotomy provides a solution for the plants' dilemma to attract pollinators and simultaneously repel exploiters. In a meta-analysis, we recently supported this hypothesis: obligate flower visitors are attracted to floral scents, while facultative ones are repelled. Here, we add empirical evidence to these results: bumblebees and ants, obligate and facultative flower visitors, respectively, responded as predicted by the results of the meta-analysis to synthetic floral scent compounds. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.",Antagonists; Exploitation; Floral defences; Mutualism; Nectar; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955350163

However, little is known about the relationship between the parents' genetic relatedness and biparental inbreeding depression in their progeny in natural populations. This study assesses the effect of kinship between parents on the fitness of their progeny and the extent of spatial genetic structure in a natural population of Rhododendron brachycarpum. Methods Kinship coefficients between 11 858 pairs of plants among a natural population of 154 R. brachycarpum plants were estimated a priori using six microsatellite markers. Plants were genotyped, and pairs were selected from among 60 plants to vary the kinship from full-sib to unrelated. After a hand-pollination experiment among the 60 plants, offspring fitness was measured at the stages of seed maturation (i.e. ripening) under natural conditions, and seed germination and seedling survival under greenhouse conditions. In addition, spatial autocorrelation was used to assess the population's genetic structure. Key Results Offspring fitness decreased significantly with increasing kinship between parents. However, the magnitude and timing of this effect differed among the life-cycle stages. Measures of inbreeding depression were 0·891 at seed maturation, 0·122 (but not significant) at seed germination and 0·506 at seedling survival. The local population spatial structure was significant, and the physical distance between parents mediated the level of inbreeding between them. Conclusions The level of inbreeding between individuals determines offspring fitness in R. brachycarpum, especially during seed maturation. Genetic relatedness between parents caused inbreeding depression in their progeny. Therefore, biparental inbreeding contributes little to reproduction and instead acts as a selection force that promotes outcrossing, as offspring of more distant (less related) parents survive better. © 2010 The Author.",Biparental inbreeding depression; Genetic structure; Germination rate; Rhododendron brachycarpum; Seed maturation; Selfing rate; Survival rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953939498

Its maintenance theoretically depends on differences in female and male reproductive success among gender morphs. Although many gynodioecious species also include gynomonoecious individuals that carry a mixture of female and perfect flowers, little is known about the male and female fitness of this third morph. Here, we present the first study of the reproductive system of Silene nutans, including females, gynomonoecious plants, and hermaphrodites. By measuring 10 floral traits in controlled conditions, we showed that females bear smaller and lighter flowers than hermaphrodites, with female and perfect flowers of gynomonoecious plants being intermediates. By measuring pollen quantity and quality, we showed that gynomonoecious plants had a lower potential male fitness than hermaphrodites at the level of both flowers and individuals. In addition, gynomonoecious plants were shown to widely vary their proportion of female flowers (0.03-0.9) and their floral traits, suggesting a quantitative restoration of male fertility. Finally, controlled pollinations showed evidence for inbreeding depression (? = 0:3) in progeny of hermaphrodites and gynomonoecious individuals, affecting both pre- and postdispersal traits; this could provide a selective advantage for females. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Floral traits; Gynodioecy; Gynomonoecy; Inbreeding depression; Pollen viability; Sex polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74949101925

Understanding how these processes affect ecosystems and their functioning, in particular in the high-diversity ecosystems of the tropics, has become a key issue in ecological research. In this chapter, our focus is on the agriculture-forest landscapes of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, an island widely known for its endemic yet still poorly known flora and fauna. The rise of the region to one of the largest cacao producing areas in the world is at the core of recent land-use change and intensification processes. Covering plants (trees, rattan palms, herbs, bryophytes) and several invertebrate (ants, dung beetles, cacao insect herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, parasitic Hymenoptera, spiders) and vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, murids, reptiles), we give an in-depth overview of the determinants of biodiversity in cacao landscapes, including both management and landscape-scale variables into our analyses. Results show that shaded agroforests host a rich community of species. By adopting a large-scale study design we showed that proximity of natural forest is a key predictor for species richness of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates alike. Endemics and forest specialists benefit most from indigenous shade tree cover and proximity to natural forest. Importantly, several functionally important groups such as insectivorous and seed-dispersing birds benefit from tall shade trees, shade tree diversity and proximity to forest edge, while parasitoid diversity is greatest close to natural forests. Available data on the effects of landuse change in cacao landscape of Central Sulawesi is increasing. Change in landscape configuration and management practices are being clearly reflected in the composition of species communities, with likely impacts on ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination. More knowledge is needed especially in terms of species interactions and ecosystem functioning, but also on how existing knowledge can contribute to effective conservation in human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Agricultural intensification; Agroforestry; Amphibians; Ants; Arthropods; Bees; Biodiversity; Birds; Bryophytes; Butterflies; Cacao; Cocoa; Community structure; Conopomorpha cramerella; Decomposition; Dung beetles; Forest distance; Fungal disease; Herbivores; Herbivory; Herbs; Hymenoptera; Insects; Land-use change; Landscape ecology; Lianas; Mammals; Muridae; Nymphalidae; Parasitoids; Plants; Pollination; Predation; Rats; Rattan palms; Reptiles; Shade trees; Spiders; Theobroma cacao; Trees; Trophic interactions; Vertebrates Biodiversity and trophic interations in tropical landscapes in Sulawesi,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874530625

Foliage samples of L. arborea came from transects encompassing three distinct environments (plateau, slope, storm-washed flat) across the island. Samples of potential marine nutrient sources (beach-cast kelp; seabirds using the island) were also collected, to contextualise the L. arborea data. Samples of invertebrate taxa (exotic and indigenous) from multiple ecosystem guilds were hand-collected; a bee, a sap-sucking Homoptera, a litter-feeding tenebrionid beetle, various carrion-feeding flies, a predatory carabid beetle, a salticid spider, and (from a seabird cadaver) Dermestes sp. exuviae. Discarded skins from the gecko Hoplodactylus maculatus were collected from moulting sites. Highly enriched ?15N values showed that L. arborea from all three environments utilised seabird N, even though breeding seabirds were absent from the storm-washed flat. The isotopic signatures of the Homoptera, and the tenebrionid and carabid beetles could be accounted for entirely by food webs based on L. arborea. Bee and salticid spider isotopic signatures could be accounted for by varying contributions from L. arborea. The flies and Dermestes were (as expected) linked to carrion from either the island or the adjacent mainland. In contrast, gecko data indicated direct dependence on seabirds, although the exact relationship was unclear. Our study therefore showed that L. arborea is an integral part of the terrestrial ecosystem of the island across multiple trophic levels from pollinators to top-level predators. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Habitat modification; Motunau Island; Penguin; Petrel; Plant invasion; Stable isotope,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952292946

Recent surveys have suggested that pollen limitation is associated with floral specialization. This study uses a group of Antillean Gesneriaceae with contrasting pollination systems (bat, hummingbird, and generalist) to assess the premise that plants with specialized pollination systems and infrequent pollinator visitation experience greater pollen limitation of fruit and seed set than their generalist congeners. Alternatively, specialists may possess mechanisms that reduce pollen limitation, such as autonomous self-pollination. A survey of autonomous self-pollination conducted on 13 Gesneria and Rhytidophyllum species during 2006-2008 revealed no significant association between reproductive assurance mechanisms and pollination system specialization. However, high levels of potential autonomous self-pollination were only found among specialized hummingbird-pollinated species. A comparison of fruit and seed set between emasculated and unmanipulated flowers provided evidence for autonomous selfing acting as a reproductive assurance mechanism in three out of four ornithophilous species. Furthermore, the Puerto Rican population of G. reticulata relies almost exclusively on self-pollination for reproduction. Two-year pollen supplementation experiments conducted on nine Gesnerieae species from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico provided evidence for significant pollen limitation associated with pollination specialization including both bat- and hummingbird-pollinated Gesnerieae; no pollen limitation was detected in any of the four generalist species. No pollen limitation was detected either in two ornithophilous Gesneria species with low hummingbird visitation and high levels of autonomous self-pollination. This study provides support for the idea that generalized pollination systems may, in some cases, buffer against fluctuations in the pollinator environment.

We tested whether the previously demonstrated pairwise mutualism between the widespread pollinating floral parasite Greya politella and its Lithophragma hostplants is ecologically enhanced or diminished in a region in which another Greya species, Greya obscura, uses the same host, Lithophragma cymbalaria. Field surveys and experimental trials showed that pollination efficacy by G. politella was more than an order of magnitude higher than by G. obscura, but G. politella abundance varied greatly between years. Greya obscura had a strongly positive effect on seed set in a year when G. politella densities were exceptionally low. Our results suggest that the coevolving mutualism between Greya and Lithophragma has potentially been enhanced rather than diminished as this interaction has diversified in the number of pollinating Greya species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Coevolution; Geographic mosaic; Multispecific interactions; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650387425

The mutualistic interaction between Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) and its pollinating floral parasite Greya politella (Lepidoptera, Prodoxidae) occurs in some communities as a pairwise set apart from most other interactions in those communities. In other communities, however, this pair of species occurs with congeners and with other floral visitors to Lithophragma. We analyzed local and geographic differences in the network formed by interactions between Lithophragma plants and Greya moths in communities containing two Lithophragma species, two Greya species, and floral visitors other than Greya that visit Lithophragma flowers. Our goal was to evaluate if non-Greya visitors were common, if visitor assembly differs between Lithophragma species and populations and if these visitors act as effective pollinators. Sympatric populations of L. heterophyllum and L. parviflorum differ in floral traits that may affect assemblies of floral visitors. Visitation rates by non-Greya floral visitors were low, and the asymptotic number of visitor species was less than 20 species in all populations. Lithophragma species shared some of the visitors, with visitor assemblages differing between sites more for L. heterophyllum than for L. parviflorum. Pollination efficacy experiments showed that most visitors were poor pollinators. Single visits to flowers by this assemblage of species resulted in significantly higher seed set in Lithophragma heterophyllum (30.6 ± 3.9 SE) than in L. parviflorum (4.7 ± 3.4 SE). This difference was consistent between sites, suggesting that these visitors provide a better fit to the floral morphology of L. heterophyllum. Overall, none of the non-Greya visitors appears to be either sufficiently common or efficient as a pollinator to impose strong selection on any of these four Lithophragma populations in comparison with Greya, which occurs within almost all populations of these species throughout their geographic ranges. © The Author(s) 2009.",California; Geographic variation; Greya; Interaction network; Pollinator efficacy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949772324

We studied ID and its genetic variation in a range of floral and fitness traits in a small and large population of the perennial herb Silene nutans, using controlled pollinations in a fully factorial North Carolina II design. Floral traits and early fitness traits, that is seed mass and germination rate, were not much affected by inbreeding (0.2). In contrast, late fitness traits and multiplicative fitness suffered severely from inbreeding (0.4). Lack of genetic correlations indicated that ID in floral, early and late traits is genetically decoupled. There was a trend that the smaller population was less affected by ID than the large one, although the differences were not significant for most traits. Hence, evidence for purging of deleterious alleles remains inconclusive in this study. Genetic variation in ID among paternal families was statistically significant in most floral and all seed traits, but not in late fitness traits. However, some paternal families had 0.5, even in the multiplicative fitness measure that suffered most from ID (0.74), suggesting that the mixed mating system of S. nutans might be evolutionary stable. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73349109782

The honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) was introduced primarily for honey production but has become the most important insect pollinator of seed, vegetable, fruit crops and pastures. The remaining species (Bombus terrestris (L.), B. hortorum (L.), B. ruderatus (F.), B. subterraneus (L.), Megachile rotundata (F.), Nomia melanderi (Cockerell), Osmia coerulescens (L.) were introduced to pollinate either red clover (Trifolium pratense) or lucerne (Medicago sativa). The honey bee has almost exclusively been relied upon for crop pollination although species of Bombus and M. rotundata are occasionally used commercially. The spread throughout New Zealand of the varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman), a parasite that exclusively kills honey bees, has increased the cost of managing honey bee hives. The use of alternative bee species for crop pollination may reduce the potential impact of factors infl uencing the availability and cost of honey bee pollination services. However, consideration must be given to the potential impact that expanding populations of introduced bees could have on native and exotic fl ora and fauna.

Habitat fragmentation can affect pollinator and plant population structure in terms of species composition, abundance, area covered and density of flowering plants. This, in turn, may affect pollinator visitation frequency, pollen deposition, seed set and plant fitness. 2. A reduction in the quantity of flower visits can be coupled with a reduction in the quality of pollination service and hence the plants' overall reproductive success and long-term survival. Understanding the relationship between plant population size and/or isolation and pollination limitation is of fundamental importance for plant conservation. 3. We examined flower visitation and seed set of 10 different plant species from five European countries to investigate the general effects of plant populations size and density, both within (patch level) and between populations (population level), on seed set and pollination limitation. 4. We found evidence that the effects of area and density of flowering plant assemblages were generally more pronounced at the patch level than at the population level. We also found that patch and population level together influenced flower visitation and seed set, and the latter increased with increasing patch area and density, but this effect was only apparent in small populations. 5. Synthesis. By using an extensive pan-European data set on flower visitation and seed set we have identified a general pattern in the interplay between the attractiveness of flowering plant patches for pollinators and density dependence of flower visitation, and also a strong plant species-specific response to habitat fragmentation effects. This can guide efforts to conserve plant-pollinator interactions, ecosystem functioning and plant fitness in fragmented habitats. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Flower density; Flower visitation; Habitat fragmentation; Patch area; Patch density; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72249103891

Hand-pollination of mixed pollen grains significantly reduced the native seed-set compared to conspecific-only pollination. Moreover, natives with a high ratio of invasive pollen on their stigmas suffered severe seed-set reduction, and the proportion of invasive pollen on native stigmas increased as frequencies of the alien neighbor increased. These results, combined with those of previous studies, revealed that depositing invasive pollen on native stigmas contributes to the observed alien-frequency-dependent reduction of native seed-set, and strongly suggest that reproductive interference was the primary cause of displacement in the Taraxacum systems. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Biological invasion; Competition for pollination service; Interspecific competition; Interspecific pollen transfer; Taraxacum japonicum; Taraxacum officinale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952288933

Habitat fragmentation in agricultural landscapes has reduced the population sizes of many plant species while increasing their spatial isolation. Restoration or maintenance of the connectivity by gene flow between the fragmented patches may be determinant to sustaining viable populations, especially for insect-pollinated species. Functional biological corridors facilitating pollen flow between remnants in a human-dominated matrix might achieve this. 2. Dye dispersal was investigated for the extremely fragmented insect-pollinated herb Primula vulgaris, using fluorescent dye particles as pollen analogues, in a study site comprising 20 populations, of which 13 pairs were physically connected by a linear landscape elements (LLEs, ditches), and 11 pairs were not connected by an LLE. The dye deposition events were used to fit a model of pollen dispersal at the landscape level. We examined whether existing LLEs in the intensively used agricultural landscape act as functional corridors for pollen dispersal. The effects of LLE length and size and plant density of the recipient population on the dispersal patterns were tested. 3. Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with 80% of the dye transfers occurring at less than 85.1 m, and a maximal distance of 1010.8 m. The mean distance travelled by fluorescent dye particles based on the dye dispersal model was ? = 87 m. 4. Dye dispersal between populations was found to be significantly higher when populations were connected by an LLE, than when populations were unconnected. For the group of population pairs connected by an LLE, dye deposition significantly decreased with the distance to dye source, but was not related to recipient population size and plant density. 5. Synthesis. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that existing LLEs in an intensively used farmland may act as functional biological corridors facilitating pollen dispersal through pollinator movements. The maintenance or restoration of a network of populations connected by LLEs, but also by other landscape structures (e.g. population relays in vegetation patches and networks of small elements allowing indirect connections) should be strongly encouraged. © 2009 British Ecological Society.",Biological corridor; Connectivity; Fluorescent dye; Habitat fragmentation; Insect pollination; Intensively used agricultural landscape; Landscape management; Plant density; Pollen flow; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72249113449

Sexually deceptive orchids are pollinated only by male insects fooled into mating with orchid flowers and inadvertently transferring orchid pollinia. Over long distances, sexually deceptive orchids lure pollinators with counterfeit insect sex pheromones, but close-range deception with colour mimicry is a tantalising possibility. Here, for the first time, we analyse the colours of four sexually deceptive Cryptostylis orchid species and the female wasp they mimic (Lissopimpla excelsa, Ichneumonidae), from the perspective of the orchids' single, shared pollinator, male Lissopimpla excelsa. Despite appearing different to humans, the colours of the orchids and female wasps were effectively identical when mapped into a hymenopteran hexagonal colour space. The orchids and wasps reflected predominantly red-orange wavelengths, but UV was also reflected by raised bumps on two orchid species and by female wasp wings. The orchids' bright yellow pollinia contrasted significantly with their overall red colour. Orchid deception may therefore involve accurate and species-specific mimicry of wavelengths reflected by female wasps, and potentially, exploitation of insects' innate attraction to UV and yellow wavelengths. In general, mimicry may be facilitated by exploiting visual vulnerabilities and evolve more readily at the peripheries of sensory perception. Many sexually deceptive orchids are predominantly red, green or white: colours that are all potentially difficult for hymenoptera to detect or distinguish from the background. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Cryptostylis; Floral colour; Insect vision; Lissopimpla excelsa; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73649133964

Within a single population, individual plants may also differ greatly in their reproductive output as a result of differences in inflorescence size or local density. In this study, we determined flower and fruit production over 5 years in two populations of the food-deceptive orchid, Orchis purpurea. All plants were monitored annually for survival and flowering at each site to determine whether flowering and fruiting induced costs. The number of flowers per inflorescence varied considerably from year to year (min: 36.6, max: 49.5). Average fruit set was low (7%) and varied considerably among years and populations. A considerable proportion of plants also failed to set any fruit. However, the probability of producing at least one fruit was not affected by inflorescence size or local density. The number of fruits was significantly related to inflorescence size, but proportional fruit set was not. Local density also did not affect the number of fruits, nor proportional fruit set. There was also no evidence that plants with large inflorescence size or high fruiting success had a larger probability of remaining vegetative the year after flowering than plants with small inflorescence size or low fruiting success. Our results suggest that pollinator-mediated selective forces on inflorescence size through female reproductive success alone are weak, most likely because of the low overall level of visitation and the resulting uncertainty of pollination at the individual level. Our results further demonstrate that investigation of patterns of fruit set over several years is needed to better understand the variability in female reproductive success that is typical of most plant-pollinator interactions. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Cost of reproduction; Density; Floral display; Orchis purpurea; Pollinator limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952400575

We expected animals to utilize floral cues in targeting plants to attack so for three field seasons we examined florivory in four sympatric Ipomoea species that differed in their pollination syndrome (flower color and shape) as well as their geographic origin (native vs. introduced). Most of the damage to Ipomoea flowers was caused by larval Spodoptera spp. that consumed all or parts of the corolla, pistil and stamens. There was no overall difference in damage levels to flowers of the bee or hummingbird-pollinated plants. However, florivores exhibited a strong preference for the native, bumble bee-pollinated I. cordatotriloba relative to the remaining three non-native Ipomoea species. The non-native, hummingbird-pollinated I. hederifolia and I. quamoclit consistently experienced the lowest florivory rates. There were reproductive consequences to florivory as damaged flowers had reduced fruit set. Seed set was not influenced by corolla damage, but was reduced when flowers suffered damage to reproductive organs. The results of our study suggest that flower-eating insects are not focusing in on traits associated with different pollination syndromes, but are preferentially visiting the native Ipomoea species, and this may contribute to the successful invasion of introduced Ipomoea plants that suffer reduced damage levels.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72849141802

However, nothing is known about floral plasticity when pollinators are absent because of unsuitable weather conditions. We investigated both, actual longevity of naturally pollinated flowers and potential flower longevity, the capacity to prolong corolla life-time and pistil receptivity when pollination is retarded. Seven high mountain plant species from different elevations in the European Alps were tested: Gentianella germanica, Ranunculus alpestris and Saxifraga caesia are restricted to the alpine zone, Cerastium uniflorum, Ranunculus glacialis, Saxifraga bryoides and Saxifraga moschata occur from the higher alpine to the glacier zone. Flower longevity differed greatly among species, according to their taxonomic background and their gender sequence type. Actual flower longevity ranged from a few days (G. germanica, C. uniflorum, R. alpestris) to more than two weeks (saxifrages, R. glacialis). Unpollinated flowers generally increased longevity, but the plasticity of single floral functions was quite different. Stigma receptivity could be maintained longest. Pollen adhesion was enabled during the full stigma life-time. High levels of pollen germination and pollen tube growth were still possible 29 days after anthesis (DAA) in R. glacialis, and 23 DAA in S. bryoides. In the remaining species this ability was gradually lost or, in C. uniflorum, abruptly ended around 10 DAA. The overall pistil receptivity primarily depended on the duration of ovule receptivity, which in most species ended between 16 and 20 DAA. Corolla life-time was significantly prolonged in S. bryoides, S. moschata and G. germanica. In the remainder of species mean corolla longevity did not differ from the actual longevity, and thus any prolongation of female functions over the corolla life-time would not contribute to reproductive success. The maximal potential longevities of individual flowers with fresh corolla and receptive pistils were 21 d in S. moschata followed by S. caesia (19 d), S. bryoides, R. glacialis (18 d) and G. germanica (14 d). R. alpestris (8 d) and C. uniflorum (8 d) exhibited the shortest potential overall flower longevities.

Over 2 years that contrasted in timing of flowering onset, we studied reproductive strategies, pollen limitation, and selection on flowering time in Mertensia fusiformis, a self-incompatible, spring-flowering perennial. Plants opened most of their flowers early in the flowering period, especially in 2007, the early year; but selection favored early-flowering individuals only in 2008. However, resource allocation to early vs. late seed production was flexible: In 2008, but not 2007, early flowers on a plant produced more and heavier seeds. Late flowers were capable of equal seed production if fertilization of early ovules was prevented, suggesting that late flowers serve a bet-hedging function. Evidence for pollen limitation was weak, although there was a tendency for early flowers to be pollen-limited in 2007 and for late flowers to be pollen-limited in 2008. Poor reproductive success in 2007 was likely attributable less to pollen limitation than to frost damage to flowers.

Recently, jasmonates have also been implicated in the regulation of floral nectar secretion in Brassica napus. Due to a trade-off between reproduction and defence, however, plants need to functionally separate the regulation of these two secretory processes. In line with this prediction, externally applying jasmonates to leaves did indeed not affect floral nectar secretion.

There are over 700 species of fig trees in the tropics and several thousand species of fig wasps are associated with their syconia (inflorescences). These wasps comprise a monophyletic family of fig pollinators and several diverse lineages of non-pollinating wasps. The pollinator larvae gall fig flowers, while larvae of non-pollinating species either initiate their own galls or parasitise the galls of other wasps. 2. A single fig species has one to four pollinator species and also hosts up to 30 non-pollinating wasp species. Most wasps show a high degree of host-plant specificity and are known from only a single fig species. However, in some cases wasps may be shared across closely related fig species. 3. There is impressive morphological co-evolution between figs and fig wasps and this, combined with a high degree of partner specificity, led to the expectation that figs and pollinators have cospeciated extensively. Comparison of deep phylogenies supports long-term codivergence of figs and pollinators, but also suggests that some host shifts have occurred. 4. Phylogenies of more closely related species do not match perfectly and may even be incongruent, suggesting significant roles for processes other than strict cospeciation. Combined with recent evidence on host specificity patterns, this suggests that pollinator wasps may often speciate by host shifts between closely related figs, or by duplication (the wasp speciates but the fig doesn't). The frequencies and biological details of these different modes of speciation invite further study. 5. Far less is known about speciation in non-pollinating fig wasps. Some lineages have probably co-evolved with figs and pollinators for most of the evolutionary history of the symbiosis, while others appear to be more recent colonisers. Many species appear to be highly host-plant specific, but those that lay eggs through the fig wall without entering the syconium (the majority of species) may be subject to fewer constraints on host shifting than pollinators. There is evidence for substantial host shifting in at least one genus, but also evidence for ecological speciation on the same host plant by niche shifts in other cases. 6. Finally, recent work has begun to address the issue of 'community phylogeny' and provided evidence for long-term co-divergence of multiple pollinating and non-pollinating wasp lineages with their host figs. © 2010 The Royal Entomological Society.",Biogeography; Co-evolution; Ecology; Fig; Fig wasp; Host shift; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74549118884

Horseweed has also evolved resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, and biotypes resistant to ALS-inhibiting herbicides and glyphosate are in many of the same areas. An experiment was designed to determine whether glyphosate resistance can be transferred by pollen. We found glyphosate-resistant plants in 1.1 to 3.8 of the progeny. Segregation ratios fit the expected 3 : 1 resistant : sensitive ratios confirming that glyphosate resistance in horseweed can transfer to closely located glyphosate-susceptible biotypes under open-pollinated conditions at low frequencies. The hypothesis of a follow-up experiment was that first-generation progeny of parent plants, selected on a continuum of low to high phenotypic response to glyphosate, will inherit respective low to high phenotypic responses to glyphosate. The variability in field-collected populations (low-level to high-level glyphosate resistance) ranged from 2 to 14 times the commonly recommended field use rate of glyphosate. However, low- and high-levels of glyphosate resistance were not observed in first-generatio progeny. We conclude that differential glyphosate responses observed among parental populations was due to different frequencies of the resistance allele within the populations, rather than the presence of different resistance alleles. © 2010 Weed Science Society of America.",Doseresponse; Realized heritability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75349088095

We compared seed output of emasculated and cross-pollinated plants that could not self-pollinate with that of intact plants. Seed output was similar in emasculated and cross-pollinated plants, but it was about 50% less in intact plants. These findings indicate that the quantity of cross-pollen deposited by pollinators did not limit seed output. However, pollinators also deposited self-pollen, which reduced seed output because selfing disabled ovules, rendering them unavailable for cross-fertilization.

In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Behavior; Bombus terrestris; Bumblebee; Foraging; Imidacloprid; Laboratory test; Sublethal effects; Sugar water; Survival; Thiacloprid; Thiamethoxam,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77249087124

The ability of social bees to recruit nestmates for group foraging is hypothesized to be a major factor in their ability to dominate rich resources such as mass-flowering trees. We tested the role of group foraging in attaining dominance by stingless bees, eusocial tropical pollinators that exhibit high diversity in foraging strategies. We provide the first experimental evidence that meliponine group foraging strategies, large colony sizes and aggressive behavior form a suite of traits that enable colonies to improve dominance of rich resources. Using a diverse assemblage of Brazilian stingless bee species and an array of artificial ""flowers"" that provided a sucrose reward, we compared species' dominance and visitation under unrestricted foraging conditions and with experimental removal of group-foraging species. Dominance does not vary with individual body size, but rather with foraging group size. Species that recruit larger numbers of nestmates (Scaptotrigona aff. depilis, Trigona hyalinata, Trigona spinipes) dominated both numerically (high local abundance) and behaviorally (controlling feeders). Removal of group-foraging species increased feeding opportunities for solitary foragers (Frieseomelitta varia, Melipona quadrifasciata and Nannotrigona testaceicornis). Trigona hyalinata always dominated under unrestricted conditions. When this species was removed, T. spinipes or S. aff. depilis controlled feeders and limited visitation by solitary-foraging species. Because bee foraging patterns determine plant pollination success, understanding the forces that shape these patterns is crucial to ensuring pollination of both crops and natural areas in the face of current pollinator declines. © The Author(s) 2009.",Aggression; Dominance; Group foraging; Species removal; Superorganism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76149136694

The study revealed that D. versipellis is mostly self-incompatible, genetically highly subdivided and depauperate at the population level (e.g., ? ST =0.572/ H E = 0.083), and characterized by a low pollen-to-seed migration ratio (r ? 4.0). The latter outcome likely reflects limited pollen flow in a low-seed disperser whose hypothesized ""sapromyophilous"" flowers undergo scarce, inefficient, and likely specialized cross-pollination by small Anoplodera beetles, rather than carrion flies as assumed previously. In consequence, fruit set in D. versipellis was strongly pollen-limited. Our AFLP data support the hypothesis of a long-standing cessation of gene flow between western and central eastern populations, consistent with previous chloroplast DNA data. This phylogeographic pattern supports the role of the Sichuan Basin as a floristic boundary separating the Sino-Himalayan vs. Sino-Japanese Forest subkingdoms. Our genetic data of D. versipellis also imply that temperate deciduous forest elements to the west and the east of this basin responded differently to Quaternary climate change, which may have triggered or is leading to allopatric (incipient) speciation.",Aflp; Berberidaceae; Breeding system; Dysosma versipellis; Phylogeography; Pollination; Quaternary,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73249120622

In rewardless orchids, it is unknown whether rare white-flowered morphs differ in scent chemistry from pigmented morphs, and whether such intraspecific variation in floral signals may have an impact on reproductive success. We compared the chemical composition of floral volatiles emitted by white- and purple-flowered morphs of Orchis mascula, and recorded the fruit set of both colour morphs. We also used white ping-pong balls to mimic white-flowered morphs in field bioassays. We found that colour polymorphism was not associated with floral odour polymorphism. Surprisingly, when populations of purple-flowered plants included a few white-flowered individuals, the fruit set of the purple morph increased significantly (from 6 to 27%), while that of the white morph remained low. We obtained the same fourfold increase in fruit set when using ping-pong balls as visual lures, demonstrating the association between colour variation and fruit set, and the key role of visual signals in pollinator attraction. Our results are incompatible with negative frequency-dependent selection, a hypothesis invoked to explain colour polymorphism in other rewardless orchids.

Secondary metabolites, which are commonly associated with herbivore defense, are also frequently found in floral nectar. One hypothesized function of this so-called toxic nectar is that it has antimicrobial properties, which may benefit insect pollinators by reducing the intensity of pathogen infections. We tested whether gelsemine, a nectar alkaloid of the bee-pollinated plant Gelsemium sempervirens, could reduce pathogen loads in bumble bees infected with the gut protozoan Crithidia bombi. In our first laboratory experiment, artificially infected bees consumed a daily diet of gelsemine post-infection to simulate continuous ingestion of alkaloid-rich nectar. In the second experiment, bees were inoculated with C. bombi cells that were pre-exposed to gelsemine, simulating the direct effects of nectar alkaloids on pathogen cells that are transmitted at flowers. Gelsemine significantly reduced the fecal intensity of C. bombi 7 days after infection when it was consumed continuously by infected bees, whereas direct exposure of the pathogen to gelsemine showed a non-significant trend toward reduced infection. Lighter pathogen loads may relieve bees from the behavioral impairments associated with the infection, thereby improving their foraging efficiency. If the collection of nectar secondary metabolites by pollinators is done as a means of self-medication, pollinators may selectively maintain secondary metabolites in the nectar of plants in natural populations. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Antimicrobial; Bombus impatiens; Crithidia bombi; Gelsemine; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949773147

Objective: We monitored simultaneously birch pollen and the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 in different size fractions of ambient air from 2004 till 2007 in Munich, Germany. Methods: Air was sampled with a ChemVol® high-volume cascade impactor equipped with stages for particulate matter (PM)&gt;10 ?m, 10 ?m&gt;PM&gt;2.5 ?m, and 2.5 ?m&gt;PM&gt;0.12 ?m. Allergen was determined with a Bet v 1-specific ELISA. Pollen count was assessed with a Burkard pollen trap. We also measured the development of allergen in pollen during ripening. Results: About 93 ± 3% of Bet v 1 was found in the PM &gt; 10 ?m fraction, the fraction containing birch pollen. We did not measure any Bet v 1 in 2.5 ?m &gt; PM &gt; 0.12 ?m. Either in Munich no allergen was in this fraction or the allergen was absorbed to diesel soot particles that also deposit in this fraction. Pollen released 115% more Bet v 1 in 2007 than in 2004. Also within 1 year, the release of allergen from the same amount of pollen varied more than 10-fold between different days. This difference was explained by a rapidly increasing expression of Bet v 1 in pollen in the week just before pollination. Depending on the day the pollen is released during ripening, its potency varies. Conclusion: In general, pollen count and allergen in ambient air follow the same temporal trends. However, because a 10-fold difference can exist in allergen potency of birch pollen, symptoms might be difficult to correlate with pollen counts, but perhaps better with allergen exposure. © 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.",Bet v 1; Birch; PM10; Pollen; Seasonal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953107269

In flowering plants, the ambiguity of associations between traits and diversification has sparked debate since Darwin's description of angiosperm diversification as an 'abominable mystery'. Recent work has found that diversification is often diversity-dependent, suggesting that species richness depends on geographical area available more than on traits or the time available to accumulate species. Here, we undertake phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses that jointly examine the effects of age, ecoregion area and four ecological traits on diversification in 409 angiosperm families. Area explained the most variation, dwarfing the effect of traits and age, suggesting that diversity-dependent diversification is controlled by ecological limits. Within the context of area, however, traits associated with biotic pollination (zygomorphy) exhibited the greatest effect, possibly through the evolution of specialization. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Angiosperms; Biogeography; Diversification; Ecological limits; Extinction; Key innovations; Latitudinal biodiversity gradient; Lineage age; Pollination; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78149323106

We explored the association between outcrossing and floral display in a broad sample of angiosperms. We used the demonstrated relationship to test for bias against selfing species in the outcrossing rate distribution, the shape of which has relevance for the stability of mixed mating. Relationships between outcrossing rate, flower size, flower number and floral display, measured as the product of flower size and number, were examined using phylogenetically independent contrasts. The distribution of floral displays among species in the outcrossing rate database was compared with that of a random sample of the same flora. The outcrossing rate was positively associated with the product of flower size and number; individually, components of display were less strongly related to outcrossing. Compared with a random sample, species in the outcrossing rate database showed a deficit of small floral display sizes. We found broad support for reduced allocation to attraction in selfing species. We suggest that covariation between mating systems and total allocation to attraction can explain the deviation from expected trade-offs between flower size and number. Our results suggest a bias against estimating outcrossing rates in the lower half of the distribution, but not specifically against highly selfing species. © 2009 New Phytologist.",Floral display; Flower size; Mating system evolution; Resource allocation; Sex allocation; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-71249132000

The impact of variation in floral color and odor (the two are frequently associated) on reproductive success remains poorly understood. In European rewardless orchids, many species occasionally show rare white-flowered individuals within populations of the common-colored morph. In a recent study, we found that in Orchis mascula the presence of rare white-flowered morphs significantly increased the reproductive success (from 6% to 27%) of purple-flowered plants, while success of the white morph remained low. This surprising result appears due solely to floral color polymorphism, which in this species is not associated with odor polymorphism.

Before pollination, calcium formed a gradient from the top to the base of the style in the transmitting tissue and parenchyma cells. After pollination, calcium levels increased in the transmitting tissue, and the gradient distribution became stronger. The calcium gradient was also observed in the tracheae of the vascular bundle of the style.

While biocontainment might be achieved using male sterility or transgenic mitigation tools, we believe that perhaps the optimal solution might be simply to remove transgenes from pollen. Male sterility might not be ideal for many pollinators, and might not be implementable using standardized genes. Transgenic mitigation might not be useful to control conspecific gene flow (e.g. crop to crop), and relies on competition and not biocontainment per se. Site-specific recombination systems could allow highly efficient excision of transgenes in pollen to eliminate, or at least minimize, unwanted transgene movement via pollen dispersal. There are other potential biotechnologies, such as zinc finger nucleases, that could be also used for transgene excision. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper samples and explores some selected songs from the iSiXhosa cultural traditions by means of textual analysis. The paper intends to show that song genres cross-pollinate each other and that the recurrent themes in the songs contextualize and underpin the social and philosophical lives of the Xhosa people. Since the Xhosa people are differentiated in terms of age, class and gender, it follows that the themes of the songs reflect and mediate this reality. Songs can suggest new themes or can be interpreted in new ways which, when accepted in the Xhosa community, can then become dominant and recurrent ways of interpreting reality. © 2010, Unisa Press.",Functionalist and anthropological theories; Isixhosa songs; Textual analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033262040

Despite its importance, little is known about the genetic and molecular basis of this phenomenon. Heterosis has been extensively exploited in plant breeding, particularly in maize (Zea mays, L.), and is well documented in the B73 and Mo17 maize inbred lines and their F1 hybrids. In this study, we determined the dry matter, the levels of starch and protein components and a total of 24 low-molecular weight metabolites including sugars, sugar-phosphates, and free amino acids, in developing maize kernels between 8 and 30 days post-pollination (DPP) of the hybrid B73 × Mo17 and its parental lines. The tissue specificity of amino acid and protein content was investigated between 16 and 30 DPP. Key observations include: (1) most of the significant differences in the investigated tissue types occurred between Mo17 and the other two genotypes; (2) heterosis of dry matter and metabolite content was detectable from the early phase of kernel development onwards; (3) the majority of metabolites exhibited an additive pattern. Nearly 10% of the metabolites exhibited nonadditive effects such as overdominance, underdominance, and high-parent and low-parent dominance; (4) The metabolite composition was remarkably dependent on kernel age, and this large developmental effect could possibly mask genotypic differences; (5) the metabolite profiles and the heterotic patterns are specific for endosperm and embryo. Our findings illustrate the power of metabolomics to characterize heterotic maize lines and suggest that the metabolite composition is a potential marker in the context of heterosis research. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849143874

Two maize lines were hand pollinated and inoculated, using a fluorescent protein-expressing transformant of the fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, by introduction of a conidial suspension through the silk channel of intact ears. Microscopy was used to identify the infection court and document initial stages of kernel colonization and subsequent manifestation of macroscopic symptoms. The fungus entered kernels of susceptible line AD38 via an open stylar canal and spread extracellularly and over the kernel through the nucellus region, sporadically entering pericarp and filling the long thick-walled mesocarp cells. Hyphae spread within pericarp from cell to cell via pits, colonizing files of host cells by growing both up and down the kernel in a radial pattern that preceded macroscopic symptom development. The starburst symptom developed subsequently, and mirrored colonization exactly, when there was extensive dissolution of the thick walls of pericarp cells. Line HT 1 exhibited a closed stylar canal phenotype and was not susceptible-except when the pericarp surface was breached mechanically.

To date, however, few studies have assessed the effects of such processes at the limits of species' distribution ranges. In this study, we have examined the potential for hybridization between range-edge populations of the wintergreen Pyrola minor and sympatric populations of Pyrola grandiflora. Location Qeqertarsuaq, Greenland and Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Methods Genetic analysis of samples from Greenland and Canada was carried out using a combination of nuclear and chloroplast single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results Analysis of nuclear SNPs confirmed hybridization in populations of morphologically intermediate individuals, as well as revealing the existence of cryptic hybrids in ostensibly morphologically pure P. minor populations. Analysis of chloroplast SNPs revealed that this hybridization is unidirectional and suggests that hybrids originate via pollen swamping of P. minor by the more common P. grandiflora. Main conclusions Extensive unidirectional hybridization may lead to the extinction of peripheral populations of P. minor where the two species grow sympatrically. Extinction could occur as a result of genetic assimilation where F1s are fertile, or via the removal of unidirectionally pollinated sterile F1s, or by a combination of these processes. This could compromise the ability of species to respond to climate change via habitat tracking, although the final outcome of these processes may ultimately depend on the rate of global climate change and its effect on the species' distributions. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Genetic assimilation; Hybridization; Introgression; Pyrola grandiflora; Pyrola minor; Range-edge,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74549217852

Hence, a protective function against photoinhibition of photosynthesis has been suggested. However, it is unknown whether the leaf anthocyanic trait confers long term benefits to the plant and to that aim parameters related to fitness were measured. We took advantage of intra-species variation in the expression of the red leaf character displayed by the Mediterranean shrub Cistus creticus, a field of which during winter becomes a mosaic of green and red individuals under apparently similar environmental conditions. The red individuals are known to be more sensitive to winter photoinhibition of photosynthesis, hence anthocyanins might serve a compensatory function through light screening and/or detoxifying reactive oxygen species. If anthocyanins are indeed beneficial in this regard, this might be reflected in altered growth and reproductive output of red compared to green individuals. Both phenotypes displayed similar photosynthetic performance indices before and after the winter red period, yet reds suffered a considerable drop in this parameter concomitant with anthocyanin accumulation. This photosynthetic inferiority was irregularly linked to growth, since red plants produced fewer new leaves during the following spring, yet shoot relative growth rate was higher. Moreover both phenotypes displayed similar flower numbers, pollination success and seed yield, mass and germinability. As judged by the similar final reproductive output, vulnerability to the winter stress does not render the red phenotype less fit, nor anthocyanin accumulation render it more fit. Moreover, the photosynthetic inferiority of the red phenotype, although linked to slightly reduced leaf number, it was not limiting for reproductive effort and success. Regardless of function, winter leaf redness in C. creticus may indicate photosynthetically weak individuals. However, neither a fitness cost nor benefit of anthocyanins can inferred in this system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Lakeshore Dr., Houghton, MI 49931, United States","Plants of the genus Schlumbergera are popular houseplants cultivated throughout the world. While most species in the genus, including the cultivars of Schlumbergera truncata, have been found to be self-incompatible, one cultivar, S. truncata 'Thor Olga', is shown here to produce fruit containing viable seeds through self pollination. Three of seven flowers (?43%) set fruit, including two fruits from which viable seeds were collected. A total of 35 seeds from these two fruits were sown, of which nine germinated (?26% viability). The phylloclade shape for all nine progeny plants appeared similar to the S. × buckleyi type for the first year, with gently scalloped rounded edges and no teeth. After the first year, the phylloclade shape began to differentiate, with some remaining similar to the S. × buckleyi shape and others developing the typical S. truncata shape. One of the progeny resulting from the self fertilization was brought to flower, and, in addition to differing in flower color from the parent plant, the progeny plant is very dissimilar to its parent in its branching architecture and its arching pendulous habit, as well as in the size and shape of the phylloclades. The breakdown in self-incompatibility is thought to be associated with delayed pollination, since fresh mature pollen was placed on over-mature stigmas. This appears to be the first time successful self-fertilization of Schlumbergera truncata has been reported in the literature. It is reasonable to predict that other Schlumbergera cultivars/hybrids may likewise exhibit some degree of self-compatibility. The fact that the self-incompatibility mechanisms can be broken down, may lead to the development of a new range of cultivars with unique traits. © 2011 Cactus and Succulent Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952376325

The population is now in its third generation, with recurrent selection for general combining ability being the underlying approach. During the 20 years of the programme, nearly 1,000 trees have been progeny tested. An early focus on selection within open-pollinated tests has been replaced by selection within control-pollinated tests. Genetic evaluation methods along with estimates of genetic parameters (e.g. heritability, genetic correlations, and genotype-by-environment interactions), genetic gain, and genetic diversity are summarised in this paper. The third-generation crossing programme involving nearly 350 parents is almost completed and seedlings from these crosses are in the nursery. In the revised breeding strategy, three hierarchal populations are envisioned to better integrate this broad-based population with the more commercially focused cultivar breeding programme: main breeding population (MBP), elite breeding populations (EBP) and cultivar development populations (CDP). A two-subline structure and a minimum of two crosses per parent will be implemented in the MBP. EBP will focus on developing parents for breeding goals of the CDP. Forward-selected (based on estimated breeding values) candidates from the main- and elite populations will be used as parents of the CDP. Cloning of seedlings in elite populations and also in the first-stage of cultivar development, will be investigated as a tool for enhancing predictability and shortening the cycle for delivering genetic gain. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Apple; BLUP; Breeding strategy; Genetic correlation; Genetic diversity; Heritability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953325384

To understand the molecular details of such a sugar-hormone relationship, we have initiated studies on IAA biosynthesis genes in developing seeds of maize. Two tryptophan-dependent pathways of IAA biosynthesis, tryptamine (TAM) and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA), are of particular interest. We report on molecular isolation and characterization of an endosperm-specific ZmTARelated1 (ZmTar1) gene of the IPA branch; we have also reported recently on ZmYuc1 gene in the TAM branch. Comparative gene expression analyses here have shown that (1) the ZmTar1 transcripts were approximately 10-fold higher levels than the ZmYuc1; (2) although both genes showed the highest level of expression at 8-12d after pollination (DAP) coincident with an early peak in IAA levels, the two showed highly divergent (antagonistic) response at 12 and 16DAP but similar patterns at 20 and 28DAP in the Mn1 and mn1 endosperm. The Western blot analyses for the ZmTAR1 protein, however, displayed disconcordant protein/transcript expression patterns. Overall, these data report novel observations on redundant trp-dependent pathways of auxin biosynthesis in developing seeds of maize, and suggest that homeostatic control of IAA in this important sink is highly complex and may be regulated by both sucrose metabolism and developmental signals. © The Author 2010.",gene expression; IAA biosynthesis; maize; q-PCR; Seed development; tryptophan-aminotransferase 1; ZmYUCCA1,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649854605

The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design with split plot arrangements having three replications. Four maize plant spacings (15, 20, 25 and 30 cm) were kept in main plots, while weed densities (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 m-2) were allotted to sub plots. Narrow plant spacing of 15 cm produced higher grain yield of 2.85 and 2.66 t ha-1 as compared to 2.30 and 2.08 t ha-1 in wider plant spacing of 30 cm during 2006 and 2007, respectively. However, during both years, yield components of individual plants were negatively affected with a decrease in plant spacing. Similarly, control plots produced higher grain yield of 3.04 and 2.87 t ha-1as compared to grain yield of 2.14 and 2.0 t ha-1 in plots having weed density of 18 plants m-2 in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Two years research showed that narrow spacing enhanced competitive ability of maize crop and suppressed weed growth, which eventually resulted in higher yield, depicting that T. portulacastrum is a strong competitor of maize and may cause substantial yield losses depending on plant spacing and weed density. Moreover, plant spacing alone is not effective to suppress T. portulacastrum; therefore, other cultural practices should also be integrated with narrow spacing to reduce yield losses in maize crop.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949770490

The study examined 514 families collected from 17 subraces of E. globulus. Wood density was assessed on a subsample of trees indirectly using pilodyn penetration at both ages and directly by core basic density at harvest age. Significant additive genetic variance and narrow-sense heritabilities (hop 2) were detected for all traits. Univariate and multivariate estimates of heritabilities were similar for each trait except harvest-age diameter. Comparable univariate estimates of selection- and harvest-age heritabilities for diameter masked changes in genetic architecture that occurred with stand development, whereby the loss of additive genetic variance through size-dependent mortality was countered by the accentuation of additive genetic differences among survivors with age. Regardless, the additive genetic (ra) and subrace (rs) correlations across ages were generally high for diameter (0.95 and 0.61, respectively) and pilodyn penetration (0.77 and 0.96), as were the correlations of harvest-age core basic density with selection- and harvest-age pilodyn (ra -0.83, -0.88; rs -0.96, -0.83). While rs between diameter and pilodyn were close to zero at both ages, there was a significant change in ra from adverse at selection age (0.25) to close to zero (-0.07) at harvest age. We argue that this change in the genetic correlation reflects a decoupling of the genetic association of growth and wood density with age. This result highlights the need to validate the use of selection-age genetic parameters for predicting harvest-age breeding values. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Density; Eucalyptus globulus; Genetic correlation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75949125604

The paper presents a semiotic and activity based analysis of discourses of students learning to talk physics while enrolled in a pre-tertiary access programme. Prior to the access programme, the students had been exposed to a teacher-centred learning environment where minimal opportunities for talk were provided. The instruction strategy was designed using a four stage process of meaning making using a sociocultural framework. The four stages were conceptual foundation, conceptual initiation, conceptual formulation and conceptual application. The purpose of this paper is to identify elements of each stage of this process which enabled students to construct meaning of scientific concepts in electromagnetism. Three meaning making elements of instruction characteristic of the last three of the four stages were identified. At the conceptual initiation stage students explored the world of real objects for the first time and their talk was of an exploratory nature. At the conceptual formulation stage students constructed physics ideas and expressed these using words of others through ventriloquation. Finally, at the stage of conceptual application students applied their understanding of the concept to an unfamiliar situation in a manner that resulted in cross pollination of the concept between students. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Community of practice; Discourses of science; Enculturation; Language of learning and teaching; Semiotic and activity analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024596504

Thirty wild banana individuals were selected and their phenomena were recorded every two weeks. The number of seeds and seed size of ripened fruit samples were counted and measured. The survival of wild banana seedlings was also recorded every month. Wildlife diversity and its relationships to wild banana phenomena were investigated by automatic camera and live traps. The remote automatic camera traps, eight per census, were set up for two nights and three days in places that wild bananas had flowered or fruited every month. Live-traps were also used at the same time with baited banana fruit inside and eight traps were placed near the banana clumps in every census. The results showed that there was a greater seedling survival of wild bananas from clones than from seeds. The establishment of wild banana was directly from colonized clumps, which showed high efficiency by rapidly occupying the complete disturbed area. Wild bananas flowered and fruited at different times among the culms through the year and facilitated good conditions for both forest regeneration and food resources to wildlife. The results on wildlife diversity showed that 17 species from 16 genera came to utilize the inflorescences, fruits and seeds of wild banana. The roles of wildlife on wild banana could be classified as 1) pollinator by the greater short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx), the streaked spiderhunter (Arachnothera magna) and the little spiderhunter (A. longirostra), 2) seed predator by Pallas's squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus), the gray-bellied squirrel (C. caniceps), the Indochinese ground squirrel (Menetes berdmorei, Rattus spp., Mus sp.) and the common treeshrew (Tupaia glis), and 3) seed disperser by the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus).

Delineation of populations at five microsatellite loci, using an individual-based approach and Bayesian modelling, as well as clustering of individuals based on allele frequencies showed the two species to be molecularly homogeneous. Genetic structure aligned largely with geographic areas of origin, and followed an isolation-by-distance model, where proximal populations were generally less differentiated than more distant ones. At the stand level, spotted gums also generally showed little structure consistent with the high levels of gene flow inferred across the species range. Disturbances in the uniformity of structuring were detected, however, and attributed to localised events giving rise to even aged stands, probably due to regeneration from a few individuals following fire. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Genetic structure; Genic species; Isolation-by-distance; Spotted gum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74749101228

Dehydration alone slightly impaired plasma membrane integrity while a drastic increase in electrolyte leakage was observed after freezing of embryos with moisture content above 23%. Damage to cellular ultrastructure and plasmalemma integrity was negatively related to moisture content in unfrozen embryos and positively related in frozen embryos. The pattern of changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes differed from one another during dehydration and/or freezing-thawing treatment. Dehydration increased activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) but decreased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR). Freezing further decreased GR and SOD activity and resulted in extremely low DHAR activity.

Both dehydration and freezing promoted membrane lipid peroxidation which resulted in an approximately threefold increase at most in the malondialdehyde content in postthaw embryos.

Colour is produced through chemical and structural means, but structural colour has been relatively poorly studied in plants. Scope This Botanical Briefing describes the mechanisms by which structures can produce colour. In plants, as in animals, the most common mechanisms are multilayers and diffraction gratings. The functions of structural colour are then discussed. In animals, these colours act primarily as signals between members of the same species, although they can also play roles in camouflaging animals from their predators. In plants, multilayers are found predominantly in shade-plant leaves, suggesting a role either in photoprotection or in optimizing capture of photosynthetically active light. Diffraction gratings may be a surprisingly common feature of petals, and recent work has shown that they can be used by bees as cues to identify rewarding flowers. Conclusions Structural colour may be surprisingly frequent in the plant kingdom, playing important roles alongside pigment colour. Much remains to be discovered about its distribution, development and function. © 2010 The Author.",Diffraction grating; Flower colour; Interference; Iridescence; Multilayer; Photoprotection; Pollinator attraction; Structural colour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953955804

Genetic resistance is the best preventive action against fumonisin contamination, although at present no commercial maize hybrids are completely resistant. Several studies of the relationship between Fusarium and other species producing ear rot suggest that these fungal species interact in similar ways with the host plant. Consequently, host plant resistance to one pathogen could be associated with resistance to another. The aim of this study was to introduce sources of resistance to Fusarium spp. into maize inbred lines and to evaluate ear rot severity and fumonisin B1 contamination in advanced breeding lines and hybrids after artificial and natural infection with F. verticillioides. Two inbred lines (CO430 and MP420) with resistance to kernel infection by Fusarium graminearum and Aspergillus flavus, respectively, were crossed and backcrossed to susceptible inbred 1203. The BC1S 1 progenies were evaluated for plant morphology and silk date and the selected S1 plants were self-pollinated. The S2 families were evaluated under artificial and natural infection with F. verticillioides. Selected S2 progenies were grown ear-to-row until S 5-derived inbreds were developed. The S5 lines were evaluated under artificial and natural infection and used as males to produce single crosses. In both crosses, the mean ear rot of the S5 lines with the lowest ear rot was not significantly different from the resistant parent means. Significant progress was observed in the hybrids regarding ear rot performance: on average, ear rot severity decreased significantly from 23% in check hybrids to 5.3% in CO430-derived hybrids. Our results suggest that inbred lines bred for resistance to A. flavus and F. graminearum ear rot could be used to select advanced breeding lines with increased resistances to F. verticillioides ear rot. © 2011 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",fumonisin; Fusarium ear rot; genetic variability; mycotoxin; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751510418

These compounds are synthesized by salicylic acid, benzoic acid and benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferases (SAMT, BAMT and BSMT) which are members of the SABATH gene family. Both SAMT and BSMT were isolated from Nicotiana suaveolens, Nicotiana alata, and Nicotiana sylvestris allowing us to discern levels of enzyme divergence resulting from gene duplication in addition to species divergence. Phylogenetic analyses showed that NicotianaSAMTs and BSMTs evolved in separate clades and the latter can be differentiated into the BSMT1 and the newly established BSMT2 branch. Although SAMT and BSMT orthologs showed minimal change coincident with species divergences, substantial evolutionary change of enzyme activity and expression patterns occurred following gene duplication. After duplication, the BSMT enzymes evolved higher preference for benzoic acid (BA) than salicylic acid (SA) whereas SAMTs maintained ancestral enzymatic preference for SA over BA. Expression patterns are largely complementary in that BSMT transcripts primarily accumulate in flowers, leaves and stems whereas SAMT is expressed mostly in roots. A novel enzyme, nicotinic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (NAMT), which displays a high degree of activity with nicotinic acid was discovered to have evolved in N. gossei from an ancestral BSMT. Furthermore a SAM-dependent synthesis of methyl anthranilate via BSMT2 is reported and contrasts with alternative biosynthetic routes previously proposed. While BSMT in flowers is clearly involved in methyl benzoate synthesis to attract pollinators, its function in other organs and tissues remains obscure. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Anthranilic acid; Benzoic acid; BSMT; Carboxyl methyltransferase; Methyl anthranilate; Methyl benzoate; Methyl nicotinate; Methyl salicylate; NAMT; Nicotiana; Nicotinic acid; Salicylic acid; SAMT,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75949128588

The Southeast Asian orchid genus Sirindhornia comprises three terrestrial species. In Thailand, we compared demographic and reproductive characteristics between the local endemics S. mirabilis and S. pulchella and the widespread S. monophylla. The three species had similar demographic characteristics, but different reproductive attributes. In most contexts where they differed, the local endemics were more reproductively restricted than the widespread S. monophylla. Thus, the latter exhibited higher relative fruit set, higher seed production per inflorescence and more equal individual contributions of progeny. However, recruitment appeared to be more efficient in S. pulchella than in the other two species. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2010.",Conservation; Demography; Endemism; Orchids; Pollination; Recruitment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959969852

This morphology is radically different from known pollen of the Campanulaceae s.str : the Campanulaceae are treated here as a family separate from the Lobeliaceae, Cyphiaceae, Nemacladaceae, Pentaphragmataceae and Sphenocleaceae (Lammers 1992). As traditionally conceived, the Campanulaceae is very heterogeneous and, in many classifications, these families were treated as subfamilies of a much-enlarged Campanulaceae. The consistently different floral morphology, biochemistry and pollen structure of the Lobeliaceae favours the recognition of this predominantly tropical group as a separate family. The pollen grains of these species are described in comparison with other members of the Campanulaceae. Based on surface characteristics of their pollen grains, we conclude that they represent an early offshoot of the wahlenbergioid lineage in southern Africa. We suggest that this unique pollen may also be the result of a highly selective regime in the fynbos, associated with specialized pollinators, and base-poor soils, in addition to possible adaptations for ant dispersal and fire. Rhigiophyllum Hochst, and Siphocodon Turcz. are also unique in having free carpel-like structures within the ovary. These shrink to form seed pockets around the seeds and disperse as units when the capsule matures. Data from molecular studies support the contention that these taxa form a sister group to all other wahlenbergioids and that this should be formally recognized in a classification system. We treat Rhigiophyllum and Siphocodon within the Campanulaceae: Wahlenbergioideae, as a separate tribe, the Rhigiophylleae tribus nov., the species of which are distinguishable from other wahlenbergioids by unique angulaperturate pollen, epipetalous stamens, free carpel-like structures and seed pockets.",Campanulaceae; Campanuloideae; Cape flora; Carpels; Floral evolution; Fynbos; Pollen; Rhigiophylleae; Seed pockets; Tribus nov; Wahlenbergioideae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954547091

There are several nonPCNA cultivars/selections that could be cross parents; however, the probability of yielding nulliplex offspring depends on the number of recessive alleles (ast). In genotyping for the AST locus in hexaploid persimmon, in contrast to the situation in diploid plants, we need to detect the AST/ast allele dosage; this cannot be detected by common codominant markers. In this study, we detected the allele dosage of Mast, which is a marker allele strongly linked to the ast allele among cultivars, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using three reference sites, actin (DkAct), anthocyanin reductase (DkANR), and L5R, whose sequences are conserved in the genome of persimmon cultivars.

The genetic relationship and diversity among these accessions stored in the Swiss gene bank is largely unknown. Our hypothesis was that due to the unique geographic, climatic, and cultural diversity in Switzerland a diverse population of maize landraces had developed over the past three centuries. The aims were to characterize the genetic diversity of the Swiss landraces and their genetic relationship with accessions from neighbouring regions as well as reviewing their history, collection, and maintenance. The characterization and grouping was based on analyses with ten microsatellite markers. Geographic, cultural, and climatic conditions explained a division in two distinct groups of accessions. One group consisted of landraces collected in the southern parts of Switzerland. This group was related to the Italian Orange Flints. The other group contained accessions from northern Switzerland which were related to Northern European Flints in particular German Flints. Historic evidence was found for a frequent exchange of landraces within the country resulting in a lack of region-specific or landrace-specific genetic groups. The relatively large separation between the accessions, indicated by high FST (0. 42), might be explained partly by a bottleneck during the collection and maintenance phase as well as by geographical and cultural separation of north and south of the country.

In 1997, the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and Peru's National Institute for Agricultural Research (INIA) began a participatory genetic improvement programme of the species. The programme was started by collecting open-pollinated seed from 402 selected trees. We describe relationships between fruit characteristics of these trees, and between these characteristics and environmental variables of the collection sites. Significant relationships included the following: negative correlations between number of fruits raceme-1 and measures of individual fruit size and weight (-0. 34 to -0. 49); non-independence between exocarp colour and fruit size (fruits with greenish-red exocarps were the largest and heaviest); unstriated fruit tended to be smaller than striated fruit; fruits with white mesocarps had starchy, yellow exocarps and tended to be lighter (but not smaller) than fruits with creamy-orange mesocarps, although total fruit weight raceme-1 was higher for white mesocarps; starchy fruits, which included all yellow fruits, were bigger and heavier than oily fruits, and with higher total fruit weight raceme-1. Total fruit weight raceme-1 and numbers of fruit raceme-1 were affected by site variables, but measures of individual size and weight and categorical fruit variables were largely unaffected. We suggest that categorical fruit variables and measures of individual fruit size and weight are likely to have higher heritabilities than total fruit weight raceme-1 or number of fruits raceme-1, and that phenotypic correlations involving those traits that appear to be little affected by environmental variables are more likely to have stronger genotypic components than correlations involving traits that are susceptible to environmental effects. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agroforestry; Amazon; Fruit trees; Genetic improvement; Participatory domestication,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953324399

In the present study, two Central European heterotic pools (Carsten and Petkus) and five Eastern European open-pollinated varieties (OPVs, Pop-1 to Pop-5) were studied with the objectives to (1) investigate the genetic diversity in OPVs and the heterotic pools using molecular and field data, (2) evaluate the molecular diversity among OPVs, (3) examine the combining ability for grain yield of the OPVs when crossed with testers in field trials, and (4) develop a strategy for targeted introgression of OPV germplasm into the heterotic pools. In total, 610 S0 plants, 347 from OPVs and 263 from heterotic pools, were developed. Clones of the S0 plants of OPVs were crossed with two testers belonging to each heterotic pool, while clones of heterotic pools were crossed with only the opposite tester. Testcrosses were evaluated for grain yield in multi-location trials. In addition, 589 S0 plants were fingerprinted with 30 SSR markers. The data revealed that the Carsten pool has a narrow genetic base and should be the primary target for broadening the established heterotic pattern. Mean and genetic variance suggested that Pop-2 and Pop-4 are good candidates for introgression in Petkus pool and Pop-5 in Carsten pool. Nevertheless, introgression of Pop-5 in Carsten could reduce the genetic diversity between heterotic pools. Therefore, we suggest that either selected plants of Pop-5 should be introgressed or more Eastern European germplasm should be fingerprinted and field evaluated to identify promising germplasm for broadening the established heterotic pattern. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849122335

Recently, a new approach, 'breeding without breeding' (BWB), has been proposed to obtain structured pedigrees for the breeding and testing from wind-pollinated progenies; the technique uses high-resolution markers instead of conventional approaches. The BWB approach is attractive for outcrossing conifers where the breeding cycle is long and reproductive maturity is often delayed. For the application of the BWB approach, the accurate assignment of parents is essential. The first step in the application of the BWB approach is to conduct tests into the reliability of paternity and parent-pair exclusion procedures in complex situations. In this study we conducted multi-locus-based empirical and simulation analyses for a Scots pine seed orchard crop, in order to develop the appropriate parentage assignment techniques for BWB and to investigate whether pedigrees from a seed orchard crop can be determined with sufficient accuracy. The results were promising, as 93-97% of the seeds generated by mating among the seed orchard clones were correctly assigned to a parent-pair. When mating occurred with foreign pollen, the success rate of identifying mother clones was 60-78%. Based on these results, we propose three novel low input breeding strategies for forest trees. The principles of the different options and their potential benefits and costs are described and discussed using Scots pine as a case study. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Breeding strategy; DNA marker; Genetic gain; Pedigree reconstruction; Seed orchard,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849120910

The orchard has two apple cultivars: Red Chief (main cultivar) and Fuji (pollinator). Yield was measured by weighing all fruit harvested from groups of five adjacent trees and the position of the central tree was recorded by GPS. Apple quality at harvest was evaluated from samples of the two cultivars in both years for which fruit mass, flesh firmness, soluble solids content, juice pH and acidity of the juice were determined. The variation in tree flowering was also measured in the spring of the second season using a stereological sampling procedure. The results showed considerable variability in the number of tree flowers, yield and quality across the orchard for both cultivars. The number of flowers was strongly correlated with the final yield. These data could potentially be used to plan precise thinning and for early prediction of yield; the latter is important for marketing the fruit. Several quality characteristics, including fruit juice soluble solids content and acid content were negatively correlated with yield. The general patterns of spatial variation in several variables suggested that changes in topography and aspect had important effects on apple yield and quality. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Flowering; Fruit quality; Intrinsic random function-k (IRF-k) kriging; Malus domestica; Precision horticulture; Spatial variation; Stereology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956681944

Gene flow in space is well-documented, but isolation in time has not received comparable attention. Here, we report the results of a field experiment that investigated reductions in intraspecific gene flow associated with temporal isolation of flowering between T. aestivum conspecifics. Pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) between an imazamox-resistant (IR) volunteer wheat population and a non-IR spring wheat crop was assessed over a range of volunteer emergence timings and plant population densities that collectively promoted flowering asynchrony. Natural hybridization events between the two populations were detected by phenotypically scoring plants in F1 populations followed by verification with Mendelian segregation ratios in the F1:2 lines. Based on the examination of &gt;545,000 seedlings, we identified a hybridization window in spring wheat approximately 125 growing degree-days (GDD) in length. We found a sizeable reduction (two- to four-fold) in gene flow frequencies when flowering occurred outside of this window. The hybridization window identified in this research also will serve to temporally isolate neighboring wheat crops. However, strict control of volunteer populations or spatial isolation of neighbouring crops emerging within a 125 GDD hybridization window will be necessary to maintain low frequencies of PMGF in spring wheat fields. The model developed herein also is likely to be applicable to other wind-pollinated species. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Biosafety; Gene flow; Hybridization window; Plant population density; Temporal isolation; Triticum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77952236939

The percentage of viable pollen was measured in B- lines, while days to flower, flowering period, stigma and panicle lengths, florets per panicle, floral density, rate of florets opening and flowering progress, were recorded in A-lines. In handmade A×B crosses, a 1 × 106 conidia mL-1 suspension was sprayed immediately after pollination, and 18 h later in vivo pollen grains adhered and germinated in the stigma, and fertilized pistils were counted. At harvest, number and percentage of diseased florets, seed yield, and yield components per panicle, were evaluated. The early flowering A-lines, with a shorter flowering period and a faster rate of florets opening showed less infected florets than the late flowering lines or than those with longer flowering period, but the healthiest lines were those that produced more florets per panicle, so both the total number of florets and the percentage of infected florets should be considered as complementary criteria for evaluating pathogen severity. The fungus caused decreases in stigma receptivity and seed yield. Averaged over crosses, the decrease in seed yield (40%) was larger than the disease severity (11%), thus pointing out the importance to link agronomic indexes to plant pathological criteria, when evaluating pathogen resistance.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950661709

In breeding programmes, quantitative genetic studies on tropical trees have so far focused on fast-growing, light-demanding species, but no information exists on shade-tolerant, slow-growing species. For this study, 27 3-year-old open-pollinated families of the Neotropical shade-tolerant rainforest tree Sextonia rubra were measured in semicontrolled conditions for 20 morphological, growth, and photosynthesis traits; the effect of genetic relatedness, habitat of provenance, and mother tree status on seedling traits was analysed. Nine traits displayed significant genetic effects, while mother tree status and habitat effects were not significant (P > 0. 05) for an y trait. Estimated heritability varied between 0. 14 and 0. 28, with growth-related traits having the highest values. Additive genetic variation correlated positively with nonheritable variation, suggesting that ecological-evolutionary factors increasing or decreasing additive genetic variance may also affect nonheritable variation in the same direction. Our results suggest that quantitative genetic variability should be taken into account in ecological studies on, and in the management of, natural tropical rainforests; further research is needed to investigate genetic × environment interactions, in particular from the point of view of the genetic response of shade-tolerant plant species to variations in light availability. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Amazon; Ecological genetics; Ecophysiological traits; Guiana shield; Heritability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-75849125404

This is with a view to harnessing the quality attributes of the different cultivars of cashew. Parameters investigated include pH, refractive index, specific gravity, vitamin C content, juice astringency, chlorophyll and juice yield. Design/methodology/approach: The methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) are employed in assaying the physicochemical properties, while the astringency is determined spectrophotometrically according to standard methods. Findings: Results showed that percentage juice yield increases linearly with maturity for both cultivars. A maximum of 79.5 per cent is obtained for the yellow apple cultivars, while 74.1 per cent juice yield is obtained in the red apple cultivar. The pH ranged from 3.73-4.5 and 3.64-4.55 for red and yellow apple cultivars, respectively, with a marked fall between seven and eight weeks after pollination (WAPo). Specific gravity and refractive index are of the order 0.999-1.007 and 1.34-1.89 for both selected samples. Highest refractive index is obtained in red and yellow cultivars at seven and eight WAPo. The changes in ascorbic acid followed a linear pattern and the maximum values of 249.5 mg/100 ml and 185.5 mg/100 ml are obtained for yellow and red apple cultivars, respectively. Meanwhile, the juice astringency level decreased steadily with maturity and at the ninth WAPo, values obtained are 0.47 and 0.86 mg/100 ml tannin for yellow and red apple cultivars, respectively. Generally, pH, astringency, refractive index, juice content, ascorbic acid and chlorophyll contents showed marked variations between six and eight WAPo, confirming physiological maturity and ripening in the crop species. Originality/value: Cashew farmers and industrialists will know the best time to harvest the crop when the quality is at its peak. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Food products; Fruits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74349093026

The objective of this study was to determine the influence of assimilate supply from the vegetative source and utilization of assimilates by the grain sink on the final composition of maize kernels. Intermated B73×Mo17 recombinant inbred lines (IBM RILs) which displayed contrasting concentrations of endosperm starch were grown in the field with deficient or sufficient N, and the source supply altered by ear truncation (45% reduction) at 15 d after pollination (DAP). The assimilate supply into the kernels was determined at 19 DAP using the agar trap technique, and the final kernel composition was measured. The influence of N supply and kernel ear position on final kernel composition was also determined for a commercial hybrid. Concentrations of kernel protein and starch could be altered by genotype or the N supply, but remained fairly constant along the length of the ear. Ear truncation also produced a range of variation in endosperm starch and protein concentrations. The C/N ratio of the assimilate supply at 19 DAP was directly related to the final kernel composition, with an inverse relationship between the concentrations of starch and protein in the mature endosperm. The accumulation of kernel starch and protein in maize is uniform along the ear, yet adaptable within genotypic limits, suggesting that kernel composition is source limited in maize.",C/N; Carbon; Grain; Maternal; Nitrogen; Protein; Sink; Source; Starch; Transport,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74249099287

Third, bees also show behavioral mechanisms for reducing the disease risk of their nestmates. Accordingly, we discuss the dynamics of hygienic behavior and other group-level behaviors that can limit disease. Finally, we conclude with several avenues of research that seem especially promising for understanding host-parasite relationships in bees and for developing breeding or management strategies for enhancing honey bee health. We discuss how human efforts to maintain healthy colonies intersect with similar efforts by the bees, and how bee management and breeding protocols can affect disease traits in the short and long term.",Chalkbrood; Colony collapse disorder; Dicistroviridae; Foulbrood; Hygienic behavior; Innate immunity; Pollinator; Social immunity; Varroa mites,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73749086183

Twenty-one DH lines were self pollinated and tested for haploid induction in the second generation. Among the DH lines, 18 lines showed an average of 20% decrease in gynogenic responsiveness compared with the original lines, while three lines registered an average increase of 5.7%.

Only the mean seed mass in fruits of the same individual varied significantly over subsequent years. In the five populations, the number of ovules, number of seeds in the fruit and seed mass varied significantly between populations. However seed/ovule ratio did not differ in fruits in the five populations. The seed mass/number trade-off in fruits was strongly partially correlated when the effect of total seed mass was considered.

The highdensity tunnel training system increased the relative humidity, as well as reducing the temperature and the level of photosynthetically active radiation, inside the canopy, which resulted in an earlier onset of the male floral stage and in an extended maintenance of the highly-receptive female stages.

Different biomass partitioning variables, pre-dawn water potential, and isotopic discrimination of 13C in needles (?) as surrogate of long-term water use efficiency were estimated for each seedling at the end of the experiment. In response to the imposed drought, there was no change in the root biomass partitioning, but the overall ? values decreased in response to water stress.

Inter-family differences within populations were also significant for most parameters as confirmed by the heritability values estimated (higher under the well-watered treatment). The studied P. pinaster populations showed different strategies of response to drought. This may represent an important mechanism by local populations in facing future climatic change.

Damaged inflorescences have been shown to have fewer floral visitors due to changes in floral appearance/chemistry, whereas larger inflorescences attract more pollinators because of greater pollen/nectar reward. This study examined whether floral herbivory by a moth, Coleotechnites eryngiella Bottimer (Gelechiidae), and inflorescence size have any effect on the attractiveness of Eryngium yuccifolium Michaux (Apiaceae) to floral visitors. In particular, the study seeks to determine how combined effects of inflorescence size and herbivory affect overall and main composition of floral visitors groups. Twelve plants, six with one inflorescence stalk (three with and three without herbivory) and six with three inflorescence stalks (three with and three without herbivory) were observed for floral visitors in 2004 and 2007 at four remnant tallgrass prairies located in east-central Illinois, USA. Damaged inflorescences had lower flower visitation than undamaged inflorescences. Larger floral displays attracted more floral visitors. Differences between the numbers of flies, bees and beetles visiting the flowers were not independent of herbivory and inflorescence size. This study provides additional evidence that herbivory and inflorescence size can influence insect visitation. In addition, this study provides further support to recent publications regarding the more sophisticated nature of the pollinator guild associated with members of Apiaceae. Finally, it also provides the foundation for future studies to determine how differences in the composition of floral visitors are associated with the male and female inflorescence phases of E. yuccifolium and their relation to male and female fitness.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72849149498

To determine the range of animal visitors to these plants, three of the plant species were observed during day- and night-observation periods, and total visitation was compared between these times. For H. coronaria, flower-visitation rates did not differ between day and night periods. H. occidentalis and O. biennis were visited significantly more during night hours than during the day.

A total of 660 offspring from the CSO, which comprised 99 clones of Abies nordmanniana, were genotyped with 12 microsatellites. Parentage was assigned successfully to 93% and 98% of the progeny at 95% and 80% confidence, respectively. The assignment rate declined only to 90% when the number of markers was reduced to 10. The distribution of parentage to the offspring among the CSO clones was highly skewed. The most successful clone was assigned as parent in 7% of the cases, and only 92 of the 119 potential parental genotypes were assigned as parents. The obtained pedigree was used to estimate breeding values for the CSO clones for five characters relevant for Christmas tree breeding. For high-heritability traits, such as flushing, accurate breeding values could be estimated for a considerable proportion of the clones. To estimate breeding values for low-heritability traits, such as Christmas tree quality score, more genotyped offspring will be required. The largest drawback of the method is the highly skewed distribution of parentage among the parents in the seed orchards, making it difficult to calculate breeding values for all clones.

The morphology of the reproductive organs and pollen number, and changes in anther protein expression, were studied in response to high temperature at anthesis in three rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes. Plants were exposed to 6 h of high (38 °C) and control (29 °C) temperature at anthesis and spikelets collected for morphological and proteomic analysis. Moroberekan was the most heat-sensitive genotype (18% spikelet fertility at 38 °C), while IR64 (48%) and N22 (71%) were moderately and highly heat tolerant, respectively. There were significant differences among the genotypes in anther length and width, apical and basal pore lengths, apical pore area, and stigma and pistil length. Temperature also affected some of these traits, increasing anther pore size and reducing stigma length. Nonetheless, variation in the number of pollen on the stigma could not be related to measured morphological traits. Variation in spikelet fertility was highly correlated (r=0.97, n=6) with the proportion of spikelets with ?20 germinated pollen grains on the stigma. A 2D-gel electrophoresis showed 46 protein spots changing in abundance, of which 13 differentially expressed protein spots were analysed by MS/MALDI-TOF. A cold and a heat shock protein were found significantly up-regulated in N22, and this may have contributed to the greater heat tolerance of N22.

Analysis of elevational trends is at risk of suffering from two major biases: a phylogenetic bias (i. e. an elevational change in the abundance of taxonomic groups), and covariation of different environmental drivers (e. g. water, temperature, atmospheric pressure), which do not permit a mechanistic interpretation. We solved both problems in a subcontinental survey of elevational trends in key plant traits in the European Alps and the high Arctic (northern Sweden, Svalbard), using herbarium samples of 147 species belonging to the genera Carex, Saxifraga and Potentilla. We used both species and phylogenetically independent contrasts as data points. The analysis revealed enhanced reproductive efforts at higher elevation in insect-pollinated taxa (not in wind-pollinated taxa), no increase in leaf pubescence at high elevation (as is often assumed), and a strong correlation between 13C discrimination and elevation. Alpine taxa operate at a smaller mesophyll resistance to CO2 uptake relative to diffusive resistance (stomata). By comparison with congeneric low altitude polar taxa (low temperature, but high atmospheric pressure), the response could be attributed to the elevational decline in atmospheric pressure rather than temperature (a mean increase in ?13C by 1.4 km-1). The signal is consistent within and across genera and within species, suggesting rapid adjustment of leaf physiology to reduced partial pressure of CO2.

The genotypic and seasonal variation in seed filling parameters and their association with agronomic traits were investigated in field experiments conducted for 2 years. A set of 10 safflower genotypes, which included hybrids and open pollinated varieties, was used. Seed filling rate (mg head-1 day-1) and duration (days) were calculated by using the cubic polynomial model. Data obtained indicated that this model could be successfully used to simulate the seed growth and to estimate the seed filling parameters in safflower genotypes with high coefficients of determination (r2) that ranged from 0.901 to 0.999. Seasonal differences were observed only for seed filling duration that was mainly determined by the sink size, as it was specified by the number of seeds per head. Greater sink size induced by higher head fertility (number of seeds per head) resulted in a longer seed filling duration. Genotypes differed greatly in seed filling rate. Seed yield and seed oil yield were significantly correlated with seed filling rate. More than 57% of the variation among genotypes in seed yield was due to the corresponding variation in seed filling rate. Increased seed filling rate improved dry matter partitioning to the seeds contributing to a higher harvest index.

The so-called pre-Cretaceous angiosperms, including Schmeissneria, are usually clouded with doubt. To expel the cloud around the enigmatic Schmeissneria, the syntype and new materials of Schmeissneria collected previously in Germany and recently in China are studied. These materials include female inflorescences and infructescences. The latter are old materials but were under-studied previously. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscope observations indicate that the fruits in these infructescences have in situ seeds enclosed, and that the ovaries are closed before pollination. Thus the plants meet two strict criteria for angiosperms: angiospermy plus angio-ovuly. Placing Schmeissneria in angiosperms will extend the record of angiosperms up to the Early Jurassic, more compatible with many molecular dating conclusions on the age of angiosperms, and demanding a reassessment of the current doctrines on the origin of angiosperms. Although the phylogenetic relationship of Schmeissneria to other angiosperms apparently is still an open question, this study adds to research concerning the origin of angiosperms. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Angiosperm; Earliest; Evolution; Flower; Fossil; Germany; Jurassic; Origin,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958178802

A multitude of movements in plants have been revealed, showing a broad spectrum of motion sequences and underlying principles. Interestingly, many of these movements show high elasticity and flexibility of the respective structures and allow reversible deformations. With the investigation of suitable biological role models and the use of new construction materials, such as fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs), the authors are developing deployable technical structures without local hinges. In this presentation the first steps of the applied biomimetic working process are described: the selection of role models, investigation and basic abstraction of plant movements. An overall screening through the plant kingdom has led to a wide-ranged matrix comprising many different types of plant movements, which constitutes the basis for our investigations. We distinguish between autonomous and non-autonomous movements. Active autonomous movements are characterized by motor organs, e.g. pulvini driven by a change of turgor pressure. Passive autonomous movements occur due to changing physical circumstances, e.g. bending through desiccation. Non-autonomous movements are mostly reversible deformations caused by a release of stored elastic energy after an external trigger or by direct application of mechanical forces. In a case study we applied morphological and anatomical investigations on the valvular pollination mechanism of the Bird-Of-Paradise flower. A physical model as a first level abstraction step of the system is presented. In close collaboration between biologists and construction engineers this kinetic system is verified with the help of computer simulations and additional abstraction steps, which finally led to the construction of a bio-inspired demonstrator for technical applications. © 2010 WIT Press.",architecture; biomimetics; deployable structures; elastic deformation; plant movements; pliable structures,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78449280771

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine some of the main allergens implicated in the common cypress (C. sempervirens) pollen allergy. Methods: Pollen extracts were optimized by using some detergents and chaotropes in order to solubilize both water and non-water soluble proteins. C. sempervirens pollen extracts were resolved by one and two dimensional electrophoresis and assayed with sera of allergic subjects. Results: Five predominant allergens with apparent molecular masses ranging from 14 to 94 kDa were detected. Two principal IgE-binding patterns were clearly distinguishable: a first one represents patients with a heterogeneous IgE reactivity to several allergens (pI 3.5-8.5) with molecular masses ranging from 35 to 94 kDa (HMW). The second one corresponds to little less than 50 percent of tested patients with specific IgE binding to 2-3 spots (pI 10-11) of about 14 kDa and weak or no reactivity to HMW allergens. Conclusion: The extraction of water insoluble proteins allows the revelation of novel allergens as well as different allergen sensitization patterns in the C. sempervirens pollen allergy. These novel IgE reactive components may subsequently be applied to expand the panel of well-defined cypress pollen molecules for a more efficient allergen-based diagnosis and therapy.

However, wounding, pollination and exposure to exogenous ethylene or cigarette smoke may reduce the shelf-life of some orchid species rendering them unmarketable. Therefore, there is a crucial need to circumvent this problem to ensure better quality and commercial value for the sustainability of the orchid industry and competition in the world market. The advent of biotechnology has allowed for genetic engineering of senescence controlling genes in flowers like carnations, resulting in extended shelf-life. The success of this genetic approach is a stepping-stone in the development of transgenic orchids and needs to be buttressed by a strong understanding of the ethylene-related genes involved in senescence. In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of four known ethylene receptors, ETR1, ETR2, ERS1 and ERS2 from the popular tropical orchid genus Dendrobium, as part of initial steps towards using these genes (sequences) to regulate ethylene sensitivity for greater longevity of pollinated orchid flowers. Physiological studies have shown that within 24 hours, pollinated Dendrobium flowers display an increase in ethylene production, alongside distinct visual changes. The presence of these genes in pollinated and unpollinated flowers was detected using RT-PCR. Detailed analysis, with Scan Prosite, showed that the RT-PCR product of ETR1 shares more than 60% nucleotide sequence homology with the orchid, Phalaenopsis as well as tobacco, rice, petunia and carnation ERS 1 primers produced a product with more than 80% homology with delphinium, as well as a petunia hybrid and Oncidium Gower Ramsey. Sequence results for ETR2 and ERS2 as analysed and characterized using bioinformatics tools will also be presented.",Dendrobium pompadour; Ethylene receptors; Orchid; Senescence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957671754

Consequently, the reproductive success of native plants reliant on native bees for pollination may be adversely impacted, thereby altering native ecosystems. The potential pollination rate of some introduced crops might also be reduced. Overwintering prepupae of the ground-nesting colletid bee Leioproctus huakiwi Donovan, 2007, were relocated in nests in soil and in artifi cial cells to new nest sites, where they established new populations which expanded by about 8-25 times over three years (and for the two sites together by 12.75 times), showing that large populations can develop rapidly. The two transference methods should be applicable to other species of colletids, indicating that relocation of these bees to new areas for both conservation and economic values is readily achievable. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Leioproctus huakiwi; New Zealand native bee; Population relocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78249256650

We found previously that a Mediterranean ant species detects fig wasps by chemical signals. In this paper we want to test the generality of this finding by studying two tropical ants, Oecophylla smaragdina and Crematogaster sp., preying on fig wasps on the dioecious Ficus fistulosa in Brunei (Borneo). Behavioural tests in a Y-tube olfactometer showed that these two ants were attracted both to odours emitted by receptive figs and to those emitted by fig wasps (male and female of the pollinator, and a non-pollinating fig wasp) used here as a kairomone. Naïve workers were not attracted to fig wasps, suggesting that olfactory learning may play a role in prey detection. We also found that O. smaragdina was much more likely to be present on figs of male trees (where fig wasps are more abundant), and that the abundance of this ant species varied strongly with developmental phase of figs on individual trees. Moreover, its aggressiveness was also strongly influenced by the nature of the object presented in our behavioural tests, the site of the test and the developmental phase of the fig tested. Investigation on the chemical and behavioural ecology of the different interacting species provides important insights into the intricate relationships supported by the fig-fig wasp mutualism. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Through the analysis of 28 open-pollinated (OP) progenies, the SSR loci revealed Mendelian inheritance and independent assortment. Using these progenies, young and adult trees LD was mainly detected in OP progenies.
