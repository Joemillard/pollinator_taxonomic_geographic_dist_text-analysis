Since chemical treatments are inefficient, efforts should focus on the development of resistant cultivars to control the disease. Toxic culture filtrate (TCF) of F. oxysporum has affected asparagus pollen germination and tube growth. Consequently, gametophyte selection was evaluated to ascertain if the application of selective agents at this level could increase selection efficiency. Two susceptible pistillate plants and one tolerant and one susceptible staminate plants were used in controlled crosses. Before pollination, a drop of a germination vehicle with TCF or without it was applied to the stigmas. Some pollinated pistils were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy; the rest were left on the plant for seed production. Fifty to 200 seeds were obtained per treatment combination (staminate plant × pistillate plant × pollination vehicle). The derived plantlets were inoculated in vitro and evaluated for disease symptoms. The application of TCF to stigmas reduced pollen germination and tube growth compared with untreated controls, regardless of the genotypic combination. Pollen germination and tube growth was poorer for the tolerant staminate genotype than for the susceptible one. When the TCF was applied, the number of seeds per pollination in comparison with the controls diminished only when the susceptible genotype was the pollinator. The percentage of affected root area of the progenies obtained after applying the TCF was lower than in the controls only when the tolerant genotype was the pollinator. Increasing Fusarium resistance in asparagus by means of gametophyte selection seems feasible.",Asparagus; Crown and root rot; Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. asparagi; Gametophyte selection; Toxic culture filtrate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035205767

Wide variability among plants was observed in the ability of oilseed rape pollen to germinate on the wild radish stigma; the frequency of pistils showing pollen tubes ranged from 0 to 1, depending on the female plant. The ratio of fertilised ovules to the total number of ovules in ovaries where pollen tubes arrived ranged from 0.02 to 0.51. Overall, the results provide evidence for the presence of different phenotypes. In 40% of the plants, pistils had no or very few pollen tubes and few fertilised ovules. In 23%, the foreign pollen tubes grew through the style towards the ovary, but had low ovule fertilisation efficiency. The remaining 37% showed a large number of pollen tubes in the style and frequent ovule fertilisation, and two plants showed no difference between foreign and conspecific pollen. With regard to post-zygotic barriers, pollen germination and ovule fertilisation represent minor barriers to interspecific hybridisation between oilseed rape and wild radish. It is suggested that the effectiveness of these barriers could be improved through plant breeding; this could reduce the risk of gene flow from transgenic oilseed rape to populations of wild relatives.",Brassica napus; Gene flow; Interspecific incompatibility; Polymorphism; Raphanus raphanistrum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035206463

In this paper we establish that post-pollination mechanisms promote outcross and act at different temporal and spatial levels to control seed set and quality in Quercus species. Controlled pollinations were performed to investigate intraspecific crossing barriers in Q. suber and pollen-pistil interactions following interspecific pollinations with some simpatric Quercus species. Cytological data of intraspecific crosses in Q. suber and Q. ilex have shown different kinetics on pollen tube growth after self and outcross pollination, but pollen tubes were able to reach the base of the styles in both species and seed set was successful. Although some pre-zygotic interaction is occurring at the style, the most important interaction takes place at ovary. The cross between Q. ilex and Q. suber is possible only in one direction, revealing a case of unilateral incongruity. We show that the lack of seed set observed in the cross Q. suber × Q. ilex is due to the inability of pollen tubes to penetrate the transmitting tissue after germination. With Q. suber mainly as female parent, pollinations with other simpatric Quercus species have shown different levels of constraint on pollen tube progression at stigma and style levels. Eventual hybridisation between Quercus species will depend on the compatibility of pollen-pistil interactions, on the competitive ability of pollen genotypes, and, most important, on the overlapping of geographical, phenological and ecological factors. Differences in seed set and seed allocation was evident in all crosses, and was particularly outstanding in interspecific and in self intraspecific crosses, determining the ultimate level of seed production and quality in Quercus species.",Early-acting inbreeding depression; Hybridisation; Interspecific crosses; Intraspecific; Quercus; Unilateral incongruity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035206398

Petal abscission was found to depend on the type of pollination: hand pollination using outcross pollen induced an early petal abscission than the self-pollen (geitanogamy). At least six pollen grains were critical to initiate successful petal abscission in freshly-bloomed flowers, below which the petals did not abscise even at the end of the day. There exists a quantitative relationship between the number of pollen grains deposited onto the stigma and the time taken for petal abscission; greater the pollen grain deposition, quicker the rate of abscission. The time required to induce petal abscission seems to be controlled by pollen genotype, genotype of pollen recipient and the interaction between the two. By invoking the theory of sexual selection it is explained that strategies of pollen genotype and those of stylar genotype may not always coincide, while shaping the rate of petal abscission.

Polymorphisms have been detected within both classes and therefore they have been proposed as genetic markers. The objectives of the present study were to identify sunflower seed protein polymorphisms and locate them on an RFLP linkage map. Seed proteins of 68 inbred lines and four Argentinian open-pollinated populations were studied by SDS-PAGE. The helianthinins were separated into ten bands arranged in four groups of Mr of 22.5, 25.5, 32 and 38 kDa and all lines showed identical banding patterns. The albumins were separated into eight to ten bands in the Mr range 10 and 18 kDa. The lines showed either a band of Mr of 14.5 or of 15.5 kDa.

A H. bulbosum map will assist introgression and provide a basis for the identification of QTLs for crossability with barley and other potentially useful genes. The present study used a population of 111 individuals from a PB1×PB11 cross to develop a genetic linkage map of diploid H. bulbosum (2n=2x=14) based on barley, wheat and other ""anchor"" cereal RFLP markers previously mapped in other species. Because of the cross-pollinating and highly polymorphic nature of H. bulbosum, up to four alleles showed segregation at any one locus, and five different segregation types were found. This enabled maps to be developed for the PB1 and PB11 parents, as well as a combined map. In total, 136 RFLP loci were mapped with a marker coverage of 621 cM. The markers were generally colinear with barley but H. bulbosum had less recombination in the centromeric regions and similar or more in the distal regions. Cytological studies on pollen mother cells at metaphase-I showed marked distal localization of chiasmata and a frequency consistent with the genetic map length.

During this process the efficiency of the technique was evaluated and suggestions for its improvement were obtained. Several parameters were studied in the crosses: % of crossability, % of embryos per florets pollinated and % of embryos per seed set. The different genotypes of Barbela showed significant variation for the parameters analysed. When the reciprocal crosses were analysed, no differences were found, indicating that cytoplasm differences do not influence the parameters of DH production. However, different spikelet positions (lower, middle and upper) gave highly significant differences in all parameters analysed. Highest success frequencies were obtained for pollinated spikelets in the middle of the spike.

Pearl, Centralia, WA 98531, United States","Implementation of most traditional full-sib crossing and testing designs is logistically difficult, costly, and genetic gain is constrained by resource availability. An alternative to full-sib crossing and testing can ameliorate all these constraints. The alternative solution is to apply a pollen mix (PMX) of many male parents rather than a single pollen for each cross. PMX breeding is easy to implement, ensures good estimates of breeding values of the parent being pollinated, and provides for increased genetic gain opportunity because of the significantly increased number of effective parental combinations tested. However, PMX breeding has found limited use because inbreeding and pedigree control is lost. The development of relatively inexpensive molecular markers allows for the paternity analysis of progeny, thus allowing full pedigree control. We call this system PMX breeding with parental analysis (PMX/WPA). The feasibility of PMX/WPA was evaluated in a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) third-generation population of 45 select individuals, among which there was considerable relatedness. All parental trees were genotyped at seven chloroplast and three nuclear microsatellite loci. Unique fingerprints were obtained for all 45 individuals, but unambiguous paternal determinations for progeny from a complete pollen mix would not be possible due largely to relatedness in the breeding population. The inclusion of more markers and/or the creation of polmixes and breeding groups that avoid relatedness would resolve this problem. Three PMX/WPA scenarios are described and compared with conventional full-sib breeding and testing systems: (1) paternity analysis of only the forward (next generation) selection candidates in each generation, (2) paternal genotyping of all progeny test individuals in PMX crosses and using those data to construct the effective full-sib crosses for statistical analysis, and (3) like #2 except mixing seed of the several PMX crosses for ease of greenhouse rearing and progeny testing and then doing maternal and paternal analysis.",Genetic fingerprinting; Genetic gain; Genetic markers; Mating design; Polymix crossing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035210897

Our data under tropical conditions associate pollination-dependent fruiting of 'Valencia' orange with high ratios of growth promoters to inhibitors (G/I) in floral organs. Lower values of G/I were found in the parthenocarpic 'Marsh Seedless' grapefruit and 'Ortanique' tangor, the latter a self-incompatible, seedless hybrid. In all the varieties, two kind of fruitlets were identified at the early stages of fruit development: (1) normal developing fruits, with high peel chlorophyll content, firmly attached to the stem (2) non-growing fruits with lower peel chlorophyll content, prone to early abscission. G/I values of firmly attached fruitlets were higher than those of non-growing, early abscising fruits during the fruit set period. In addition, higher absicisic (ABA) and ABA-like inhibitor accumulation as well as lower growth promoting substances were found in proximal abscission zones of abscising fruits. Furthermore, higher contents of jasmonic acid-like compounds in floral organs and in developing fruits were found in the cultivars with stronger early fruit abscission, which suggest that ABA-like and jasmonic acid-like substances could play a shared role in fruit set and early fruit abscission. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We investigated flower-trap separation of Drosera and Utricularia. Short Drosera had a greater element of floral-trap separation than tall Drosera. Such a relationship is unexpected for plants whose peduncles were evolved to protect their pollinators. Utricularia can not trap pollinators but this genus still produces exceptionally long peduncles. We propose that flower-trap separation evolved because carnivorous plants are often short and need to project their flowers well above ground level to make them more attractive to pollinators.,Carnivorous plants; Flower-trap separation; Pollinator attraction; Pollinator protection; Pollinator-prey conflict,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035202088

As an example we tested the effects of variation in nectar production rates (NPR) on pollinator visitation in experimental populations of Echium vulgare with different spatial arrangements. Bumblebees discriminate between groups of plants with different NPRs only when these groups are separated by distances larger than 6 m. Within groups, plants with high and low NPR receive similar numbers of approaches. Plants with high NPR increase the average number of approaches to all plants in the group; therefore, plants with low NPR benefit from nectar-rich plants nearby. These results demonstrate that the effects of NPR on pollinator service depend on the spatial structuring of the population. We suggest that this may help to explain the large genetic differences in NPR that we find for E. vulgare at our study site.",Frequency dependent selection; Genetic diversity; Nectar; Pollinator; Spatial patterns,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035201940

This may be achieved by complex floral forms offering absolute greater rewards than the simpler forms, or by complex flowers offering a higher probability of being rewarding because fewer pollinators are able to visit them. In this paper we examine the effect of three pollinator foraging strategies on the ratio of flights within and between floral morphs and hence on the probability of a new morph establishing in a population without offering a greater reward. We incorporate pollinator behaviour based around observations of two pollinator species systems into three models of competition for pollinators. In the first model the constancy of the pollinator of the new floral morph is a function only of the foraging strategy of the existing pollinator of the original floral morph. In the next model the constancy of the second pollinator is determined by the number of rewarding flowers of each floral morph left by the original pollinator and in the third model it is determined by the ratio of rewarding flowers of each morph left by the original pollinator. The results demonstrate that under conditions of intense competition for pollinators, new, more complex floral forms are indeed able to attract high levels of constant pollinators without offering intrinsically higher rewards. However, for this to occur constancy in one of the pollinators must be a function of the ratio of rewarding to non-rewarding flowers of both floral forms. One prediction from our results is that sympatric speciation of floral complexity based on a higher probability of reward is more likely to occur in flowers offering rewards of pollen rather than nectar. This is because the cost of visiting non-rewarding flowers is usually higher where the reward is pollen rather than nectar. We also predict that complex flowers occurring at low frequency, which offer rewards of nectar, may need intrinsically greater rewards if they are to successfully attract pollinators.",Evolution; Floral complexity; Pollinator preference; Sympatric speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035730471

Stable habitats are scarcely studied, whereas dynamics in unprotected habitats are less predictable or more compromised by exotic organisms (Apis, in the case of bee surveys). An extensively replicated, long-term study of orchid-bees (Euglossini) was made in protected tropical moist forest in Panama. Over 47,000 bees were recorded in 124 monthly censuses employing 1952 counts. No aggregate trend in abundance occurred (from 1979 to 2000), although four individual species declined, nine increased, 23 showed no change, and species richness was stable. No rare or parasitic species showed decreasing trends, while the most common of the set of bee species studied gradually declined. Biodiversity therefore increased. Recorded variability included 300% (fourfold) differences in bee abundance among years, and changes in species abundance up to 14-fold. Surveys in dry and wet seasons (N = 17 and 18 years, 29 and 31 species, respectively) indicated no numerical changes in the bee assemblage over 21 years. El-Niño climatic events led to brief increases in bee abundance. This detailed survey is deconstructed to assess sampling rigor and strategies, particularly considering the recorded local differences within a single forest. Year-to-year shifts in bee abundance for three tropical and five temperate bee censuses were comparable. In short studies (2-4 years) and during longer studies (17-21 years), 59 species that included solitary, social, and highly social bees had mean abundances that varied by factors of 2.06 for temperate bees and 2.16 for tropical bees. ""Normal"" bee populations commonly halved or doubled in 1-yr intervals. Longer term data are only available for the tropics. Stochastic variation and limitations of monitoring methods suggest that minimum series of four years (i.e., three intervals) of several counts during the active season may demonstrate genuine trends. Longer term, continuous studies are still needed for meaningful insights on pollinator population shifts in nature.

Specifically, we examined the extent of colonization (compared with source areas), differential roles of seed dispersing birds and mammals, and the Ficus fruit characters influencing mode of colonization. Location Research was conducted on Long Island (5°20?S; 147°10?E), a volcanic island 55 km from Papua New Guinea, which erupted catastrophically in c. 1645 with probable extirpation of all life. Renewed volcanic activity in the early 1950s produced a series of temporary islands in the volcano's caldera lake. One island, Motmot, present since 1968 has persisted. Methods Long Island and Motmot were surveyed over 15 days for Ficus species and their vertebrate dispersers and pollinating wasps. The Ficus community was compared with that of mainland sources areas and Ficus species present were characterised according to their figs' size, colour, crop size and height. Observations of frugivory and literature records were used to determine Ficus dispersal guild membership. Results At least 31 Ficus species have colonized Long Island since its eruption. Evidence of pollinator wasp colonisation was found for all sixteen Ficus species observed fruiting. Thirty-six vertebrate species occurring on Long Island are identified as potential seed dispersers. Of these, fruit bats and pigeons are likely to have been instrumental in the island's early colonization with subsequent spread being facilitated by these frugivores as well as a number of smaller birds, and an introduced cuscus. Comparisons of fruit characters and frugivore attraction between Ficus species reveal two broad dispersal guilds. Members of the first guild produce relatively large, green figs in the lower strata of the forest and attract fruit bats. The second guild includes species that attract both birds and fruit bats with generally smaller, red figs produced throughout the vertical structure of the forest. Eight Ficus species have colonized Motmot, a 31-year-old emergent island in the volcano's crater lake. However, only one furgivore species was recorded alive on the island. Fig seeds are likely to have arrived during rare over-flights or roosting visits by frugivores, or in the bodies of prey brought to Motmot by raptors. We found no evidence of pollinator presence on Motmot. Most Ficus individuals on Motmot remain immature and the figs of the only three individuals observed with crops had not been pollinated. Main conclusions Their numerical abundance and frequency of fruiting make figs an important resource in regenerating ecosystems. Ficus species differ in their ability to colonise degraded habitats because of differences in the design and presentation of their figs. Fruit bats are likely to be of special importance early in succession. Once the Ficus species on Motmot start to produce fruit regularly we can expect a rapid increase in the numbers of fleshy-fruited plant species colonising the island.",Figs; Fruit syndromes; Pollination; Seed dispersal guilds; Succession,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035692757

Pendant flowers are common among hummingbird-pollinated plants. A downward orientation of the flower or inflorescence could represent an adaptation to avoid either flower flooding or direct pollen losses from anthers or stigmas under rainy conditions. 2. We studied the adaptive significance of this trait experimentally in Tristerix corymbosus Kuijt (Loranthaceae), a mistletoe native to the temperate forests of southern South America. We applied three treatments: (i) natural pendant inflorescences; (ii) inflorescences tethered to face up; and (iii) inflorescences tethered to face down (as a control for tethering). We also considered natural exposure to rain as a second factor. 3. The treatments did not differ significantly in either nectar volume or concentration. Flowers exposed to rain for most of their lives contained more diluted nectar than those that remained dry, but this result did not depend on either inflorescence or flower orientation. 4. We found significantly fewer pollen tubes in styles of flowers from inflorescences tethered to face up than in flowers receiving the other two treatments, but this could not be attributed to a direct effect of rain exposure. Inflorescence orientation did not affect either the number of pollen grains left in anthers or seed set. No strong evidence was found for differential visitation by hummingbirds in relation to a flower's angle. 5. The results of this work support neither the flower-flooding nor the pollen-protection hypothesis. However, a flower's orientation may affect the extent of within-flower self-pollination or the efficiency of pollen transfer from a hummingbird's bill onto a flower's stigma.",Female and male reproductive success; Flower orientation; Hummingbird pollination; Pollen tubes; Rain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035662552

The performance of 30 hybrids and 30 improved open-pollinated (OP) varieties from IITA as well as 30 farmers' local varieties from Ghana and Nigeria were evaluated under moisture deficit and well-watered condition in 1999 and 2000. Moisture deficit significantly affected the number of ears per plant, grain yield, days to silk and anthesis-silking interval. Group, genotype, test environment and interaction of genotype with test environment also affected these traits. However, genotype ranks between years were significantly correlated for almost all the traits recorded in each irrigation treatment. The genotypes in each group exhibited marked differences in drought susceptibility index (DSI) for grain yield. The relationship between DSI and grain yield under well-watered conditions was very weak. Consequently, some hybrids, improved OP varieties and farmers' local varieties with similar yield potential and days to anthesis under well-watered condition exhibited marked differences in DSI and grain yield under moisture deficit. The best genotypes with superior performance under moisture deficit were identified from this study for further use in breeding for drought tolerance. On the average, hybrids and improved OP varieties were significantly better than farmers' local varieties for grain yield and other traits both in the presence and absence of moisture deficit. Principal component analysis was effective in separating farmers' local varieties from hybrids and improved OP varieties in the two irrigation treatments. The same set of traits contributed significantly to the first two principal component axes both under moisture deficit and well-watered conditions.

We then investigated the possibility that pollinator decline can be addressed in this way, using two meta-analytical approaches on genetic data from the Hymenoptera and the Lepidoptera. First, we compared levels of heterozygosity between the orders. As has been found previously, the haplodiploid Hymenoptera had markedly lower levels of genetic variation than the Lepidoptera. Bees had even lower levels, and bumble bees, in particular, often seemed almost monomorphic genetically. However, the statistically confounding effects of phylogeny render detailed interpretation of such data difficult. Second, we investigated patterns of gene flow among populations of these insects. Hymenoptera were far more likely to show genetic effects of population fragmentation than are Lepidoptera, even at similar geographic distances between populations. The reduced effective population sizes resulting from haplodiploidy probably contributed to this result. The proportion of species with low levels of gene flow did not vary among the different taxonomic groups within the Hymenoptera.

The breeding system and fruit set were investigated in order to examine pollinator limitation for a population of a deceptive orchid, Pogonia japonica, on a floating peat mat in Mizorogaike Pond, western Japan. Fruit sets for outcross-pollinated, self-pollinated and pollinator-excluded flowers were 75%, 80%, and 0%, respectively. Thus, this species was self-compatible but neither autogamous nor apogamous. The fruit set for open-pollinated flowers was 22.9% and 17.4% in 1994 and 1995, suggesting that pollinator limitation did occur in the field. Larger flowers were more likely to develop into fruit than smaller ones in open pollination (36% vs 8%). Thus, flower size seems to affect fruiting of this species. No effective visits by major pollinators such as bees, which could carry pollinia, were observed during 16.5 h of observation during daytime. Instead, thrips were often found moving on gynostemium or pollinia and circumstantial evidence that suggests thrips may partly transfer pollen in pieces out of a granular pollinium of P. japonica was obtained.

Today it seems that pollination systems in many areas of agriculture are threatened by the inadequacy or lack of sustainable managed, indigenous, or imported pollinators. Pollinator shortages can adversely affect crop production and commodity markets. This paper presents an economic model than can be used to measure some of the economic impacts of pollinator deficits on traded commodities. This economic analysis indicates that consumers of a commodity affected by a pollinator deficit may suffer because the commodity costs more and becomes less available. At the same time, although the producers of the affected commodity may experience crop declines, they may also experience economic gains in the form of higher prices. The amount the producer gains or loses depends on the shape of the supply and demand functions, and the magnitude of these losses or gains is an empirical question. Although there are few data available to evaluate this model, those we do have indicate that serious problems for world food supply, security, and trade could be in the offing if current declines in pollinator abundance, diversity, and availability are not reversed. Various crops and cropping systems are suggested as practical starting places for economic studies of the effects of pollinator declines, with emphasis on the type of data required.

M5S 3G5, Canada","Authors examining pollinator declines frequently discuss pollination deficits, either as contemporary evidence that declines have occurred or as a possible negative consequence of future declines. Because pollination deficits can be measured in short-term studies, it would be useful if such studies could somehow replace painstaking documentation of insect population trends. I examine the legitimacy of this type of substitution with reference to evolutionary theory and natural plant populations. Operationally, pollination deficits are detected through pollen supplementation experiments. Although simple, these experiments are subject to subtleties of interpretation because of biases and nonlinear responses, which I discuss. Although it has been found that, in 62% of the natural populations studied, fruit or seed sets are at least sometimes limited by insufficient pollen, other research suggests that intact natural systems ought to arrive at an evolutionary equilibrium in which reproduction is limited equally by pollination and by maternal resources. Therefore, chronic severe pollination deficits may indicate that the pollinator service of a plant population has declined from some higher level in the past. However, there is no evidence of widespread declines, and, because of stochastic factors in nature, occasional shortfalls of pollination should be expected even at equilibrium. Although the effects of pollination deficits on plant population dynamics have been little studied, moderate declines in seed production may have relatively little effect on population growth rates because resources not expended on fruits and seeds may be reallocated to vegetative persistence or spread. It is therefore premature to conclude that pollinator declines are having strong effects on natural plant populations, but this mostly reflects a lack of data and is no cause for complacency. Theory must be supplemented by case studies; I give one example and recommendations.

Extensive losses in pollinator guilds and communities can disrupt ecosystem integrity, a circumstance that today forces most farmers to rely on honey bees for much fruit and seed production. Are North America's invertebrate pollinator faunas already widely diminished or currently threatened by human activities? How would we know, what are the spatiotemporal scales for detection, and which anthropogenic factors are responsible? Answers to these questions were considered by participants in a workshop sponsored by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in October of 1999, and these questions form the nucleus for the papers in this special issue. Several contributors critically interpret the evidence for declines of bee and fly pollinators, the pollination deficits that should ensue, and their economic costs. Spatiotemporal unruliness in pollinator numbers, particularly bees, is shown to hinder our current insights, highlighting the need for refined survey and sampling designs. At the same time, two remarkable studies clearly show the long-term persistence of members of complex bee communities. Other authors offer new perspectives on habitat fragmentation and global warming as drivers of pollinator declines. Bees and lepidopterans are contrasted in terms of their natural genetic variation and their consequent resilience in the face of population declines. Overall, many ecologists and conservation biologists have not fully appreciated the daunting challenges that accompany sampling designs, taxonomy, and the natural history of bees, flies, and other invertebrate pollinators, a circumstance that must be remedied if we are to reliably monitor invertebrate pollinator populations and respond to their declines with effective conservation measures.

However, because these results are from the greenhouse, it is difficult to know whether they would hold true in the field. Here, we performed hundreds of crosses on several maternal plants to simulate changes during the flowering season of field plants. During the experiment, maternal resource availability changed due to the costs of producing fruits, and we determined the pollination history of a plant by performing crosses in specific orders. Examination of seed paternity showed that there were small differences in pollen donor success at the beginning of the experiment when maternal resources were abundant. Differential pollen donor success was greatest slightly later in the flowering period, but declined toward the end of the experiment. Thus, maternal plants may distinguish most among pollen donors when they have both abundant resources and experience with the differences in quality of available pollen donors. In contrast, there were few significant effects of the recent pollination history of plants on pollen donor success. Finally, despite the changes in mating performance over time, there were strong overall differences in pollen donor success, suggesting that seasonal changes in the field will not eliminate the potential for nonrandom mating.",Brassicaceae; Mate choice; Pollen competition; Raphanus sativus; Seed paternity; Sexual selection; Wild radish,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037902736

Reductions in kernel set could be expected because of asynchronous pollination between earlyand late-appearing silks. We analyzed the effect of (i) selective ear heating around the time of silking, and (ii) different time gaps between early- and late-pollinated silks in an attempt to modify kernel set. Tip ear heating was expected to minimize the advantage of early silking ovaries. Lateral heating and pollination gaps were expected to exaggerate this advantage. Three pollination gaps (2, 4, and 6 d) were tested for two plant populations (3 and 9 plants m-2). Ear temperature in the heated zone averaged 4.5°C above air temperature. Temperature in the nonheated side closely followed air temperature. Treatments promoted greater differences in maize kernel number (KN) per ear (73% variation) than in the number of silks exposed 5 d after silking (6% variation). Lateral ear heating reduced KN per ear in comparison with the nonheated control, but tip ear heating did not modify KN per ear. At 9 plants m-2, synchronous pollination resulted in ?15% increase in KN per plant. Pollination gaps of 2 and 4 d reduced KN per plant drastically (up to 51%), but the reduction was smaller for the 6-d gap. This study (i) gives evidence of the negative impact of delayed pollination timing among silks on kernel set, which was not related to reduced silk receptivity, and (ii) defines the time gap for maximum interference of early- on late-pollinated ovaries, a period shorter than 4 d.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035651570

Few publications have investigated the longitudinal variability in skin reactivity, and most studies have concluded that seasonal changes in exposure to environmental allergens are paralleled by a change in skin reactivity. Our trial investigated the relationship between variations in skin reactivity and seasonal exposure to allergens in sensitized subjects, by use of a sensitive method - the end-point technique. Forty-three patients monosensitized to inhalant allergens were selected, and the skin prick end-point technique with serial 1:4 dilutions of standardized commercial allergens was used to assess skin reactivity. Twenty-two patients sensitized to pollens with a short pollination period were tested before and after the pollen season, whereas the other 21 patients sensitized to house dust mites or to a species with a long pollination period such as Parietaria were tested in the same month 12 months later. Patients tested with the end-point technique showed a large interindividual variability in skin reactivity. None of the patients in either group showed a decrease in skin sensitivity with time whereas 9 out of 43 showed no change and 34 out of 43 showed an increase (p < .0001). According to our data, skin reactivity increases in sensitized subjects over time, and this increase seems not to have a circannual rhythm related to the seasonal exposure to environmental allergens, since it can be detected both in pollen- and mite-sensitized patients after a 12-month interval.",Allergy diagnosis; End-point titration; Skin prick test; Skin sensitivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035571818

Higher fruit set of open-pollinated self-fertile genotypes indicated that the additional pollen donor was probably advantageous for fruit set in self-fertiles in the preliminary field study. However, no statistically significant differences were found between fully and self- (half compatible) pollination in caged trees in subsequent years' studies. This inconsistency may have been due to shading by cages (for self-pollination only) or to differences in bee activity in caged trees as compared with open-pollinations made during preliminary studies. Additionally, the variation in fruit setting potential was dependent on genotype. Spring frost injury reduced fruit setting potential in self-fertile sweet cherries but pollen quality was not associated with variable fruit set. The results suggest that self-pollination would produce optimal fruit set in self-fertile sweet cherry cultivars regardless of partial pollen incompatibility. However, a more detailed study including fruit setting factors other than spring frost injury, and varying setting capacity depending on genotypes, would be required for a more complete determination of the commercial utility of growing self-fertile sweet cherries in solid blocks.",Fruit set; Pollination; Prunus avium L; Sweet cherry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035700697

Bees typically live in habitats where nesting substrates and bloom are patchily distributed and spatially dissociated. Bee studies have all defined habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests, overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Several authors conclude that habitat fragmentation is broadly deleterious, but their own data show that some native species proliferate in sampled fragments. Other studies report greater densities and comparable diversities of native bees at flowers in some fragment size classes relative to undisrupted habitats, but find dramatic shifts in species composition. Insightful studies of habitat fragmentation and bees will consider fragmentation, alteration, and loss of nesting habitats, not just patches of forage plants, as well as the permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Inasmuch as the floral associations and nesting habits of bees are often attributes of species or subgenera, ecological interpretations hinge on authoritative identifications. Study designs must accommodate statistical problems associated with bee community samples, especially non-normal data and frequent zero values. The spatial scale of fragmentation must be appreciated: bees of medium body size can regularly fly 1-2 km from nest site to forage patch. Overall, evidence for prolonged persistence of substantial diversity and abundances of native bee communities in habitat fragments of modest size promises practical solutions for maintaining bee populations. Provided that reserve selection, design, and management can address the foraging and nesting needs of bees, networks of even small reserves may hold hope for sustaining considerable pollinator diversity and the ecological services pollinators provide.

K1A 0Y7, Canada","The distributions of most pollinator species are poorly documented despite their importance in providing ecosystem services. While these and other organisms are threatened by many aspects of the human enterprise, anthropogenic climate change is potentially the most severe threat to pollinator biodiversity. Mounting evidence demonstrates that there have already been biotic responses to the relatively small climate changes that have occurred this century. These include wholesale shifts of relatively well-documented butterfly and bird species in Europe and North America. Although studies of such phenomena are supported by circumstantial evidence, their findings are also consistent with predictions derived from current models of spatial patterns of species richness. Using new GIS methods that are highly precise and accurate, I document spatial patterns of Canadian butterfly diversity. These are strongly related to contemporary climate and particularly to potential evapotranspiration. An even more noteworthy finding is the fact that, for the first time, habitat heterogeneity, measured as the number of land cover types in each study unit, is proven to be an equally strong predictor of butterfly richness in a region where energy alone was thought to be the best predictor of diversity. Although previous studies reveal similar relationships between energy and diversity, they fail to detect the powerful link between richness and habitat heterogeneity. The butterflies of Canada provide a superb baseline for studying the effects of climate on contemporary patterns of species richness and comprise the only complete pollinator taxon for which this sort of analysis is currently possible.

Flowering takes place in winter. The flowers are homogamous, fragrant, and entomophilous. There was evidence of self-incompatibility and cross-incompatibility between nearby partners. Fruit set of open-pollinated flowers (13.3%) seemed pollen-limited, since low fecundity was consistently associated with small stigmatic pollen loads and with low numbers of successful pollen tubes, and fecundity increased with abundance of efficient pollinators. Reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds) was 3.6. It is hypothesized that homogamy was established in Colletia because in an impoverished pollination environment - such as the one likely prevailing when this lineage evolved - achieving pollen export and receipt in a single pollinator visit has selective advantages.

K7L 3N6, Canada","Dichogamy is one of the most widespread floral mechanisms in flowering plants and is thought to have evolved to reduce interference between pollen import and export within flowers, especially self-pollination. Self-pollination between flowers may also be reduced if dichogamy is synchronous among flowers on an inflorescence. The analysis of dichogamy at both levels requires that the sexual phases of individual flowers be defined functionally in terms of pollen deposition and removal. We conducted morphological and functional analyses to investigate the degree of dichogamy within flowers and the synchronicity of dichogamy between flowers within inflorescences in an emergent, aquatic monocot, flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Based on daily observations of the development of marked flowers, data on the schedule of anther dehiscence within flowers, and repeat surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations, individual flowers appear to be strictly protandrous. On average, each flower spends ?1 d in each of male and female phases with an intervening 1-d neuter phase during which there is no available pollen in anthers and stigmas are not yet exposed to receive pollen. Morphological criteria used to delimit the beginning and end of each of these three sex phases were validated by quantifying the temporal schedule of pollen removal from anthers and pollen deposition on stigmas. Experimental pollinations showed that the morphological changes marking the end of female phase are hastened by pollen deposition. At the umbel level, synchronous development within sequential cohorts of flowers reduced overlap of male and female sexual phases between flowers. On average (± 1 SE), 72 ± 3% of flowers completed their female phase while no other flowers on the same umbel were in male phase. Computer simulations of umbel development showed that this value is significantly higher than expected if the timing of flower development within umbels was random (30 ± 1%). Surveys of floral sex ratios in three populations revealed that 87% of umbels were either unisexual male or female at any given time. Pollinators usually visited more than one flower in sequence when foraging on umbels, suggesting that synchronous dichogamy may be an adaptation to avoid geitonogamy. The adaptiveness of both flower- and umbel-level dichogamy is also suggested because both traits are expressed to a lesser extent in obligately clonal, triploid populations, where flowers do not make seeds and hence floral adaptations are not maintained by natural selection.",Butomaceae; Butomus umbellatus; Dichogamy; Floral longevity; Flowering rush; Pollen deposition; Pollen removal; Pollen tubes; Pollination; Pollinator visitation; Temporal dioecism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001674183

The methods have the advantage that both pollen collection and its application on the shoots are made massively, which accounts for an easier and faster pollination process. In the first method pollen from a randomly sampled group of plants is collected, mixed, and then applied to a different group of the same number of plants; reciprocals also can be made. In the second method pollen from a group of plants that act as males is applied to a group with a different number of plants that act as females or vice versa (reciprocals also can be considered). In this last situation the problem is solved by adjusting the total number of plants to the inbreeding effective number by difference in the two sexes. The pollination methods produced an intermediate level of inbreeding between full-sib and half-sib pollination, but inbreeding becomes greater when the number of plants of one sex is less than the number of plants of the other sex. The pollination methods considered are those used by some Mexican maize researchers for population seed increase when population size is so large that it makes full-sib pollination (FSP) and half-sib pollination (HSP) difficult. Maize breeders that use the proposed pollination methods claim that these methods are easy because pollen collection and pollination are made massively; thus they are easier than FSP and HSP where plants are treated in pairs or in groups of three or more.

However, proximal causes of the benevolence of mutualistic species are often unknown. Monoecious fig species and their specific pollinators are in conflict on the use of fig ovaries, which can either produce one seed or host one pollinator larva. Here, I provide new data showing that, probably because of space constraints during the development of both seeds and wasps, ovaries vary in their quality as a substrate for pollinator development depending on their location within the fig inflorescence. This constraint may be responsible for the stability of the fig/wasp mutualism. Moreover, population density of pollinators and density dependent selection on the pollinators could be sufficient to explain the observed highly variable seed/wasp ratios produced by figs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035712322

This study aimed to evaluate the use of molecular markers as additional descriptors for genetic variation. The use of six AFLP primer combinations enabled the differentiation of all tested varieties. Two types of statistical analysis were applied to assess the genetic variation: (1) Analysis of Molecular Variance, and (2) computation of the average Jaccard similarity between single plants belonging to the same variety. A major part of the genetic variation (13%) could be explained by the division between new and old varieties; the division between linseed and fibre flax accounted only for 3% of the total variance. However, the variation within new and old varieties did not differ. As further tested on a subset of 17 morphologically very similar varieties, AFLP marker data were able to reveal extra sources of genetic variation. Statistical analysis using Mantel tests proved that ordinations based on AFLP marker frequency data were reproducible and independent of the resemblance measure used. This can be exploited in plant variety testing as an additional tool for determining the distinctness of new varieties that are morphologically difficult to differentiate.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035759250

The large orange flowers of E. fusca are adapted for pollination by birds and are protected from illegitimate visits by a petal that covers the nectaries and anthers until displaced by a foraging bird. Experiments with flowers bagged to exclude potential pollinators demonstrated that the flowers do not open without assistance. At Matamatá, parrots are the most frequent visitors to flowering E. fusca, and two species, Dusky-headed Parakeet (Aratinga weddellii) and Cobalt-winged Parakeet (Brotogeris cyanoptera), appear to be the main pollinators. This is only the fourth report of Neotropical parrots acting as pollinating agents. At least five other parrot species fed on the nectar or flowers of E. fusca but destroyed the flowers in the process. Orange-backed Troupials (Icterus jamacaii) were the only other species observed opening E. fusca flowers nondestructively and are likely to be pollinators. Hummingbirds were common visitors to E. fusca flowers and some species were found to carry E. fusca pollen; however, hummingbirds were unable to open the flowers themselves and relied on other visitors to open the flowers for them. The number of hummingbird visits to a flowering E. fusca tree was positively correlated with the number of visits by parrots and icterids, but not with the number of mature flowers, indicating that legitimate visitors facilitate access by hummingbirds.",Amazonia; Colombia; Erythrina fusca; Hummingbird; Oropendola; Parrot; Pollination; Tanager; Tropical rain forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035713280

We examined 17 entomophilous species in the groundlayer of a forest mosaic comprising a Querco-Ulmetum minoris, a Galio odorati-Fagetum and a Carpinion betuli in southern Germany. Besides the flower visitors and their frequency of flower visiting, all the entomophilous species have been analyzed for the pollen ovule ratio (p/o) and the extent of cross- and spontaneous self-fertilization. The p/o of 5 species was 2.63 or lower, while 12 species showed log p/o-values of 3.51 or more, which is indicative of mainly xenogamous or facultatively xenogamous species. Actually, 16 of the 17 species showed cross-fertilization, whereas only 2 species showed successful spontaneous self-fertilization. Furthermore, within the 17 species examined, a higher cross-fertilized seed-set was significantly correlated with a higher p/o which suggests the suitability of the p/o as an indicator for the outcrossing success within whole plant communities. Of all flowers in all species observed, 66.8% developed fruits by cross-fertilization and 5.6% were self-fertilized. Seed-set of all flowers in all species was 33.8% due to cross-fertilization and 1.1% due to self-fertilization. Flower visitors were abundant in all species, with a mean of 0.3 visitors/hr/flower. The most frequent and active anthophilous insects were found in the family Apidae, followed by the Coleoptera, Diptera (S.O. Brachycera), Diptera (S.O. Nematocera) and a group of small mostly parasitoid Hymenoptera with short mouthparts. Per plant species insects of 2-18 families were found. Up to 5 Apidae visited one plant species.

No statistically significant differences were found for most traits in pairwise comparisons among the three groups.

In 1996, ten clusters were harvested from 12-year-old trees, at weekly intervals, between the beginning of ovary development (March) until the end of April. Afterward, sample size was increased to twenty clusters and sampling intervals were decreased to 4 days, to better characterize the reproductive process. Samples were fixed in CRAF or Navashin's fixative for 2 days and dehydrated in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations. Standard procedures for sectioning and staining techniques were used, and the specimens were observed under an optical microscope. Vascularization, obturator, chalaza and micropyle were identified 2 weeks after ovule appearance, between 15 April and 15 May. Ovule rotation occurred during this period. At the end of May, the ovule contained mature embryo sacs. Fertilization occurred around 10 July, about 5 months after pollination. The first stage of embryo development (globular embryo), occurred around 20 June, evolving to the heartshaped stage 10 days later, and to the torpedo stage (cotyledons formed) by the end of July. The embryonic axis was clearly observed a few days later and continued elongating until nut maturity (20 August to 10 September).",Corylus avellana L.; Embryo; Filbert; Light microscopy; Ovary; Ovules; Portugal; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0013442242

Based on previous evidence that seed dormancy in maize is controlled by the vp1 gene, we used a PCR-based approach to isolate two Sorghum bicolor genomic and cDNA clones from two genotypes exhibiting different PHS behaviour and sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). The two 699 amino acid predicted protein sequences differ in two residues at positions 341 (Gly or Cys within the repression domain) and 448 (Pro or Ser) and show over 80, 70 and 60% homology to maize, rice and oat VP1 proteins respectively. Expression analysis of the sorghum vp1 gene in the two lines shows a slightly higher level of vp1 mRNA in the embryos susceptible to PHS than in those resistant to PHS during embryogenesis. However, timing of expression was different between these genotypes during this developmental process. Whereas for the former the main peak of expression was observed at 20 days after pollination (DAP), the peak in the latter was found at later developmental stages when seed maturation was almost complete. Under favourable germination conditions and in the presence of fluridone (an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis), sorghum vp1 mRNA showed to be consistently correlated with sensitivity to ABA but not with ABA content and dormancy.",Dormancy; Germination; Pre-harvest sprouting; Sorghum bicolor; vp1 gene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035317183

(Franco)) were sown in two nursery conditions, each replicated as separate experiments: Two bareroot nursery trials established in successive years in the same nursery, and two container-sown greenhouse trials sown in different greenhouses in the same year. First-year heights in the seedling trials were compared to mean stem volumes of the same open-pollinated families in eight 15-year-old field progeny tests and the same-full-sib families in eleven 12-year-old tests. Family mean nursery-field correlations (rxy) were similar for all four seedling trials for both open-pollinated (OP) and full-sib (FS) families, and generally ranged between 0.30 and 0.40. Although low, it is shown that nursery-field correlations of this magnitude can be quite useful in tree improvement programs. For example, based on the data in this study, it is estimated that a single-stage of family selection for first year seedling height would be about 50% as effective in improving 15-year volume as direct selection for this trait in field tests. Early testing, however, is probably of more practical significance as a tool for culling families prior to out-planting field tests in two-stage selection schemes. It is estimated that 25% of the OP families in this study could have been culled in an early test (first-stage selection), with gain in 15-year volume after subsequent field testing and selection of the remaining families (second-stage selection) being nearly the same as if all families had been field tested. Thus, early testing is an effective tool for reducing the size and cost of field progeny tests without sacrificing genetic gain.",Early selection; Genetic parameters; Genotype X environment interaction; Nursery-field correlations; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Two-stage selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035708449

The recovery of an increasing number of cytochrome P450 genes has enabled their use in experimentation that has revealed their extraordinary potential for engineering herbicide tolerance, biosafening, bioremediation and green chemistry. Several tobacco cultivars were successfully transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens with two mammalian cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes conferring resistance to herbicides chlortoluron and chlorsulfuron. The transgenic nature of both transgenic plants was proved by kanamycin resistance, PCR analysis and herbicide tolerance. Chlortoluron-resistant tobacco plants are self-pollinated and the segregation of resistance to herbicide was followed up to R2 generation. The herbicide chlortoluron at doses 0.1-0.5 mM decreased the percent of germination of O. ramosa seeds and the full inhibition was observed at dose 12.5 mM. The obtained transgenic tobacco plants carrying the fused rat cytochrome P4501A1/yeast reductase gene from R2 progeny were used to investigate the efficiency of chlortoluron for broomrape control in pots. According to our results the broomrape on transgenic tobacco plants treated with 0.5 mM chlortoluron developed 3-4 weeks later than did the nontreated control and transgenic tobacco plants.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0348238069

In some nectar feeding animals, the intake response to sugar concentration can be accurately predicted from simple matlic. matical models that rely on knowledge of gut morphology, in vitro rates of sugar digestion, and daily energy expenditures. Because most of the floral nectars consumed by vertebrates are dilute, these animals ingest large amounts of water while feeding. The water turnover rates of hummingbirds feeding on dilute nectar are more similar to those of amphibious and aquatic organisms than to those of terrestrial vertebrates. Dilute nectars can pose osmoregulatory challenges for nectarivores. Nectarivorous birds exhibit renal traits that are well suited to dispose of large water loads and that appear inadequate to produce concentrated urine. Nectar-feeding birds prefer concentrated over dilute sugar solutions. However, the concentration difference that they can discriminate is smaller at low than at high concentration. We hypothesize that this pattern is a consequence of the functional form of intake responses that often results in decelerating sugar intakes with increasing sugar concentration. The diminishing returns in floral attractivity that may result from increased nectar concentration may be one of the reasons why the nectars of hummingbird pollinated flowers are dilute in spite of the preference of birds for higher concentrations. The intake responses of nectar-feeding birds capture the integration of a behavioral response with the physiological processes that shape it. Because the behavior of nectar-feeding birds can have consequences for the plants that they visit, the intake response may also have coevolutionary effects.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745974596

Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) reveal a higher incidence of polymorphism and are more informative than any other DNA marker, and are therefore considered a marker of choice for self-pollinating crops with little intraspecific polymorphism. However, the availability of SSRs in bread wheat is still limited. In this study, selectively amplified microsatellite (SAM) analysis was used to develop informative SSR markers to assist in the construction of an intraspecific wheat map. Three markers were developed for under-represented regions in the genetic map, and 7 for unassigned linkage groups. The latter SSRs permitted the chromosomal origin of 4 unassigned linkage groups to be determined. These results demonstrate the utility of SAM analysis for the targetted development of informative SSR markers to genomic regions of interest, and assignment of linkage groups to chromosomes. Furthermore, SAM analysis facilitates the development of markers for relatively short (?11) dinucleotide repeat sequences, a class of SSRs generally inaccessible to traditional hybridisation-based methods used to develop these markers.",Bread wheat; Microsatellites; Molecular genetic maps; SAM; Selectively amplified microsatellite; SSRs; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035685079

This suggests that competition for assimilates among kernels only occurs at the last stages of grain filling. To test this hypothesis, two commercial hybrids of different KW were grown at two stand densities (3 and 9 plants m-2) during 1998 to 1999 and 1999 to 2000. Pollination treatments were performed in order to modify kernel number per plant (KNP) and to obtain a range of source - sink ratios. Pollination treatments altered KNP, and negative relationships were established between KW and KNP, with no differences between years. On the basis of regression analysis of the response of KW to changes in KNP, KW increased between 0.09 to 0.28 mg kernel-1 per unit decrease in KNP, depending on stand density and genotype. The theoretical potential KW was independent of parenthesis plant population effects, which affected ear growth significantly (P &lt;0.01). Kernel weight was closely related to variations in kernel growth rate during the effective grain-filling period (r2 = 0.84; P &lt;0.001), and not to modifications in the duration of this stage. Within each hybrid, the plant source - sink ratio established during the postflowering period explained KW response to modifications in KNP, independently of stand density. Hybrids differed in the capacity to transform blomass produced at the postflowering period into KW. This was in agreement with differences between hybrids in the capacity to sustain KW when the source - sink ratio was reduced. It is concluded that assimilate limitations to kernel growth occur during the whole grain-filling period.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035656594

Their emission is presumed to be costly, but this cost has seldom been quantified. Figs of Ficus carica (a dioecious species) release volatile compounds when receptive, thus attracting the agaonid wasp Blastophaga psenes. In dioecious fig species, wasps lay eggs inside male figs and pollinate female ones. For a male tree, we estimated carbon allocation to reproduction using the annual growth module (AGM) as the unit of measurement. Over the growing season, leaf and fig carbon exchange and construction costs were measured, as well as carbon investment in stamens, provisioning pollinators, and biosynthesis and release of volatile compounds. Representativity of the tree studied was evaluated by measuring some of these parameters on seven other male fig trees. The results show that 7.6-16.4% of the carbon assimilated by leaves and figs was invested in reproduction. Of the carbon invested in reproduction, pollinator attraction and feeding represented only 0.08-0.12% and 1.84-2.33%, respectively, while pollinator sheltering (fig construction and respiration) represented 97.6-98.0%. In this strict and coevolved plant-pollinator association, the main male reproductive investment was thus in the structures sheltering the associated pollinators.",Blastophaga psenes; Carbon allocation; Cost of reproduction; Ficus carica; Moraceae; Mutualism; Photosynthesis; Reproductive effort; Respiration; Volatile compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037518688

First, we monitored the fate of individuals and the flowering behavior of T. apetalon for 12 years and used a transition matrix model to analyze the demography of the population. The analysis revealed that it takes a long time for individuals to go through one-leaf stage in juveniles. Elasticity analysis showed that the survival of flowering individuals was a decisive factor in the dynamics of the population. Furthermore, we found that the average remaining lifetime of flowering individuals was high relative to the other three stages. Second, to elucidate the demographic consequences of organ preformation, we investigated the development of flower buds for future years. We observed three to six flower buds per rhizome, suggesting that flower buds for the next 3-6 years were ready in advance in this plant. Third, the results of breeding experiments clarified that although this species appears to have a substantial capacity for both inbreeding and outbreeding, inbreeding plays an important role in seed production, and that crossing experiments (direct cross-pollination and self pollination) yielded similar seed-ovule ratios to those obtained from open-pollinated individuals.

Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass) is a close relative of domesticated maize and was chosen as a natural model system to investigate gene expression patterns associated with parthenogenesis. The genome size of diploid sexual and polyploid apomictic T. dactyloides was estimated by flow cytometry to be 7.37 pg (2C), 14.74 pg (4C) and 22.39 pg (6C), respectively. The diploid genome size is thus approximately 1.35× larger than that of maize. The apomeiotic-pseudogamous pathway of seed formation was demonstrated at a rate of 92% by the flow cytometric seed screen (FCSS) with single mature seeds in tetraploid accessions. This number includes twin embryos which were detected in 13% of the seeds analyzed. Fertilization of unreduced egg cells (BIII hybrids) was measured in 10% of apomictic seeds. Autonomous (fertilization-independent) embryo development and fertilization-dependent endosperm formation were confirmed by pollination of tetraploid T. dactyloides with a diploid transgenic maize line carrying an actin::?-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter construct. GUS expression was detected after pollination in the developing endosperm, but not in the embryo. In similar intraspecific crossing experiments with maize, GUS expression was detected in both the embryo and endosperm. A protocol was established for microdissection of embryo sacs and early parthenogenetic embryos of T. dactyloides. Together, these techniques provide new tools for future studies aimed at comparing gene expression patterns between sexual maize and sexual or apomictic T. dactyloides.",Apomixis; Microdissection; Parthenogenesis; Pseudogamy; Tripsacum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035675197

This paper analyses the results, at 12 years, of the only progeny trial in Britain, established near Banchory, Aberdeenshire. Based on 'plus-tree' selections, 14 full-sib and 10 half-sib families were established in a randomized block design. Significant differences among families were found for height, diameter, stem form and forking habit and a multi-trait index designed to emphasize desirable economic traits. Phenotypic correlations between traits were positive and significant. Estimated heritabilities (family) in the half-sib and full-sib families were similar and greatest for height (h2 ?0.6) while the mean stem form of the half-sib entries which had been selected for stem quality was 14 per cent greater than those selected for vigour alone. General combining ability estimated from the controlled pollinations was only significant for height and specific combining abilities were negligible. The full-sib families were, however, superior to the half-sib generally and the five outstanding entries were derived from crosses among only four parents, which have origins spread over 10° of latitude. After thinning, the trial matches published management table values equivalent to Yield Class 10 (max m.a.i. m3 ha-1 per year) and a target diameter of 30 cm at 30 years is likely to be achieved. This level of production, combined with high stem quality, if attainable generally, would transform the economic outlook for this species in Scotland. It is concluded that this trial demonstrates the potential for improving the performance of the species. Selection of adapted 'plus-trees' on a regional basis, for inclusion in polyhouse breeding orchards, is proposed, so as to rapidly yield improved seed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035656590

While tetraploidy makes it impossible to analyze variation in R. alceifolius using classical methods of population genetics, both the patterns of genetic diversity (as revealed by AFLP [amplified fragment length polymorphism] markers) and differences between half-sib progeny and their maternal parents (revealed by microsatellite markers) show that in the plant's native range in southeast Asia, seeds are produced sexually. In contrast, in Madagascar sexual reproduction cannot alone account for the genetic patterns observed with microsatellite markers. Over 85% of the half-sib progeny resulting from open pollination gave multilocus genotypes identical to those of their respective maternal parents, despite the fact that the latter had alleles that were rare in the population. The other progeny differed in having an allele with one motif more or less than that of the maternal parent. Seeds thus appear to be produced mostly or exclusively by apomixis in Madagascar. We present findings suggesting that Madagascan populations result from hybridization of introduced R. alceifolius and native populations of R. roridus, a closely related species of Rubus subgenus Malachobatus, and suggest that apomixis was a consequence of this hybridization. In Reunionese populations of R. alceifolius (derived from Madagascan populations), seeds obtained in controlled pollination experiments were all genetically identical to maternal parents. While genetic variation (microsatellite markers) in Reunionese populations was low, it was sufficient to allow us to demonstrate that seeds could not have resulted from fertilization by the pollen donors chosen for controlled pollinations, or from autogamy, and were produced exclusively by apomixis.",Apomixis; Cytogenetics; Indian Ocean islands; Madagascar; Microsatellite markers; Reproductive biology; Rosaceae; Rubus alceifolius; Southeast Asia; SSR; Weeds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038280697

The promoters of several seed storage protein genes including the rice glutelins (Gt3, GluB-1, GluB-2), rice prolamins (PG5a, RP6), rice ?-globulin (Glb) and wheat glutenin (Bx7), were examined for their expression levels in rice immature endosperms isolated from the caryopses at 7-9 days after pollination. In this promoter comparison, the wheat Bx7 promoter showed the highest transcription activity, followed by the promoters of the Glb, GluB-2, and Gt3 genes. Based on this result, further studies were conducted using the Glb and Bx7 promoters. We examined the effects of the addition of a second promoter fragment, the alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) 5?untranslated leader sequence (UTL), and various introns and terminators from different genes. Although the addition of a second promoter fragment and the AMV 5?UTL had no effect on GUS expression levels, the insertion of the rice waxy first intron increased GUS expression of the Glb and Bx7 constructs 3 and 6-fold, respectively. The maize adh1 first intron also showed a 2-3-fold increase in the GUS expression levels of both the Glb and Bx7 reporter gene constructs. A comparison of terminator sequences revealed the nopaline synthase gene terminator from Agrobacterium and the rice waxy gene terminator were the most effective in contributing to elevated expression levels. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

However, there is little quantitative or experimental evidence for ecosystem impacts of invasive species. Justifications for control are often based on potential, but not presently realized, recognized or quantified, negative impacts. Should lack of scientific certainty about impacts of non-indigenous species result in postponing measures to prevent degradation? Recently, management of purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), has been criticized for (1) lack of evidence demonstrating negative impacts of L. salicaria, and (2) management using biocontrol for lack of evidence documenting the failure of conventional control methods. Although little quantitative evidence on negative impacts on native wetland biota and wetland function was available at the onset of the control program in 1985, recent work has demonstrated that the invasion of purple loosestrife into North American freshwater wetlands alters decomposition rates and nutrient cycling, leads to reductions in wetland plant diversity, reduces pollination and seed output of the native Lythrum alatum, and reduces habitat suitability for specialized wetland bird species such as black terns, least bitterns, pied-billed grebes, and marsh wrens. Conventional methods (physical, mechanical or chemical), have continuously failed to curb the spread of purple loosestrife or to provide satisfactory control. Although a number of generalist insect and bird species utilize purple loosestrife, wetland habitat specialists are excluded by encroachment of L. salicaria. We conclude that (1) negative ecosystem impacts of purple loosestrife in North America justify control of the species and that (2) detrimental effects of purple loosestrife on wetland systems and biota and the potential benefits of control outweigh potential risks associated with the introduction of biocontrol agents. Long-term experiments and monitoring programs that are in place will evaluate the impact of these insects on purple loosestrife, on wetland plant succession and other wetland biota. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Biological control; Invasions; Invasive plant management; Lythrum salicaria; Purple loosestrife,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000251281

'yellow sarson' (AA), black-seeded Brassica alboglabra (CC), yellow-seeded Brassica carinata (BBCC) and black-seeded B. napus (AACC). Three different interspecific crossing approaches were undertaken. Approaches 1 and 2 were designed directly to develop yellow-seeded B. napus while approach 3 was designed to produce a yellow-seeded CC genome species. Approaches 1 and 2 differed in the steps taken after trigenomic interspecific hybrids (ABC) were generated from B. carinata × B. rapa crosses. The aim of approach 1 was to transfer the yellow seed colour genes from the A to the C genome as an intermediate step in developing yellow-seeded B. napus. For this purpose, the ABC hybrids were crossed with black-seeded B. napus and the three-way interspecific hybrids were self-pollinated for a number of generations. The F7 generation resulted in the yellowish-brown-seeded B. napus line, No. 06. Crossing this line with the B. napus line No. 01, resynthesized from a black-seeded B. alboglabra × B. rapa var. 'yellow sarson' cross (containing the yellow seed colour genes in its AA genome), yielded yellow-seeded B. napus. This result indicated that the yellow seed colour genes were transferred from the A to the C genome in the yellowish-brown seed colour line No. 06. In approach 2, trigenomic diploids (AABBCC) were generated from the above-mentioned trigenomic haploids (ABC). The seed colour of the trigenomic diploid was brown, in contrast to the yellow seed colour of the parental species. Trigenomic diploids were crossed with the resynthesized B. napus line No. 01 to eliminate the B genome chromosomes, and to develop yellow-seeded B. napus with the AA genome of 'yellow sarson' and the CC genome of B. carinata with yellow seed colour genes. This interspecific cross failed to generate any yellow-seeded B. napus. Approach 3 was to develop yellow-seeded CC genome species from B. alboglabra × B. carinata crosses. It was possible to obtain a yellowish-brown seeded B. alboglabra, but crossing this B. alboglabra with B. rapa var. 'yellow sarson' failed to produce yellow seed in the resynthesized B. napus.

We concentrated on collecting nonparasitic bees (and excluded Apis and Bombus) visiting 24 plant species that bloomed at various times of the year, and upon which Charles Robertson found many bee species. For example, we collected most intensively on spring-blooming Claytonia virginica and fall-blooming Aster pilosus, upon which Robertson reported 58 and 90 bee visitors, respectively. Bees were also collected on an opportunistic basis at some other plants. We updated the species names used by Robertson for revisions and synonymies. This paper summarizes a comparison of the two collections, made about 75 years apart at the same small geographic location. The study considers 214 valid bee species that Robertson collected plus an additional 14 species found by us but not by Robertson. Of these 214, we collected 140 species. The absence of most of the remaining 74 species that we did not collect can be explained by examining their plant preferences. Robertson did not record 47 of these 74 species on the 24 plant species where we collected intensively, and he observed 19 more species on only one or two of the 24 plant species. Additionally, he observed 21 of them on only one of the 441 plants he studied. Of the bee species found by Robertson on the 24 plant species, we collected 82% on the same plant species. The land uses and land cover on Macoupin County's 225,464 ha (558,080 acres), which bear directly on the type and availability of habitat for bees and their host plants, varied considerably over two centuries. For example, in the early 1800s, land cover was about 73% prairie and 27% forest. The estimated 59,792 ha (148,000 acres) of forested land in 1820 diminished to 24,644 ha (61,000 acres) by 1924. It then grew to 34,340 ha (85,000 acres) by 1962. Agriculture is the predominant land use; in 1967, 59% of the land was in harvested crops (primarily row crops) and 15% was in pasture. Despite habitat changes and the passage of 75 years, our 1970 and 1972 Carlinville collections show a high degree of similarity with those of Robertson, possibly because diverse habitats within the agricultural matrix contained the host plants and nesting sites required by the bees. We recommend that a third survey of this area be undertaken as part of a long-term study made possible by the meticulous 19th century records of Charles Robertson, which must be preserved.

The objective of this research was to determine the vulnerability of various germplasm sources and publicly bred sorghum lines to sugary disease (Claviceps africana) in the United States. Flower characteristics associated with sugary disease resistance were also studied. A-/B-line pairs, R-lines, putative sources of resistance and their hybrid combinations with an A3 cytoplasmic male-sterile source were evaluated using a disease incidence, severity, and dual-ranking system. Trials were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications and repeated in at least two planting dates. Planting dates and pedigrees had significant effects on overall ranking for resistance. A-lines were most susceptible to sugary disease. R-lines were more susceptible than B-lines with respect to incidence and severity of the disease. Newer releases of A- and B-lines were more susceptible to sugary disease than older releases. Sugary disease reaction of A-lines was a good indicator of disease reaction of B-lines. Tx2737, a popular R-line, was highly susceptible to sugary disease in spite of being a good pollen shedder because the stigma emerged from glumes 2-3 days before anthesis. The combination of flower characteristics associated with resistance were least exposure time of stigma to inoculum before pollination, rapid stigma drying after pollination, and small stigma. An Ethiopian male-fertile germplasm accession, IS 8525, had good levels of resistance. Its A3 male-sterile hybrid had the highest level of resistance in the male-sterile background, IS 8525 should be exploited in host-plant resistance strategies.",Claviceps africana; Ergot; Germplasm; Honeydew; Resistance; Sorghum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035665336

Plants expressing the transgenic proteins were then analysed by PCR using CMV-CP gene-specific primers. Two plants from each field were found to express the transgenes. These plants, however, proved to be homozygous for transgenes, indicating that they did not originate by cross-pollination between transgenic and 'wild-type' parents, but probably derived from transgenic seeds that accidentally contaminated untransformed seed stocks during harvesting.

The breeding of apple cultivars resistant to Podosphaera leucotricha could be much improved by marker-assisted selection. This investigation focuses on the identification of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to the major genes for mildew resistance in a selection U 211 ('Primula' open pollinated). The analysis was carried out on 107 plants from progeny 'Idared'xU211 and parental plants. The cultivar Primula was also analysed. The selection U211 was found to be highly resistant to mildew in field conditions and transmitted a high level of resistance to the majority of its progeny. Moreover the Vf gene from Malus floribunda, conferring resistance to scab, is present in this selection. As the RAPD marker for the Pl1 gene from M. robusta (Markussen et al., 1995) is not present in the DNA of U 211, it is probable that a selection U 211 is a new source of mildew resistance. The RAPD marker technique was combined with a bulked segregant analysis (BSA). About 270 random decamer primers were tested by PCR analysis on the basis of resistant and susceptible DNA pools. Many polymorphisms between two pools were identified.

Nethertheless, they have beneffited since the 1960's from the gathered scientific knowledge mainly concerning the sexual reproduction physiology of the species. Thus, good pollination and germination conditions have been precised. Furthermore, selection procedures corresponding to new objectives, such as e.g. low temperature and disease tolerance or increased shelf life, have been used. Although some techniques such as induced mutation breeding did not lead to convincing achievements in roses, some biotechnologies have been successfully applied by a few breeders. Conventional genetic results have been scarce and seldom up to the 1980's, probably because of the high heterozygositic and low sexual reproduction status of the species. Since the last decade, molecular markers have been used to explore the rose genome. No doubt that marker assisted selection will soon be available to breeders. Together with the recently started use of still unexploited wild species genes, and considering the already high genetic variability of the actual cultivars, this could lead in the next decades to the creation of revolutionary varieties, especially in terms of resistance to diseases, pests, cold, drought, and plant and flower shapes and growth habits.

Variety attributes are their performance characteristics as evaluated by farmers who have grown them for many years, and generally they cannot be observed in the shelled grain found in marketplaces. By stratifying the analysis according to the potential productivity and infrastructure development of regions within the study area, we are able to test qualitative hypotheses related to the dynamics of development. The second purpose of the study is to investigate empirically the relationship between farmers' demand for variety diversity and the genetic diversity of maize landraces in the farmers' communities. The theory of impure public goods shows why farmers will generally choose to grow varieties with less crop genetic diversity than is viewed as desirable by society. Even if farmers were aware of changes in the supply of distinct maize materials in the community and considered in their own decisions the decisions made by other farmers in their communities, they could not completely control the level of genetic diversity among the maize populations that they grow. Maize is predominantly a cross-pollinating species, and unless fields are isolated or flowering times are distinct, the pollen of one maize population may reach any nearby population. Growing maize inevitably generates an ""externality"" in terms of crop genetic diversity. The framework we use also explicity recognizes that the set and structure of genetic resources grown by farmers in any region or at any given point of time reflects a complex process of interaction between biophysical, biological, and socioeconomic factors, each operating at different levels of aggregation or ""scales"" of analysis. The importance of scale has been well established in ecology and environmental sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035734561

Eucalyptus and Acacia, that dominate the vegetation on a continent-wide scale. The recent shift in plantation forestry away from exotic Pinus radiata to native Eucalyptus species has resulted in much more extensive exchange of biota between native forest and plantation ecosystems than exchange in the past with plantations of exotic species. Growing numbers of hectares are being planted to Eucalyptus globulus across Australia, and plantations are providing resources and corridors for native biota. The present paper focuses on both the benefits and risks of having large-scale forestry plantations of native species that are closely related to dominant native taxa in local forests. At least 85 species of insects have been recorded as pests of Eucalyptus plantations around Australia; the vast majority of these have been insects using the same host species, or closely related taxa, in native forests. Plantations of native species may also benefit from closely related local forests through the presence of: (i) the diverse array of ectomycorrhizal fungi favourable for tree growth; (ii) natural enemies harboured in native habitats; and (iii) recruitment of other important mutualists, such as pollinators. Exchanges work in two directions: plantations are also likely to influence native forests through the large amount of insect biomass production that occurs in outbreak situations, or through the introduction or facilitation of movements for insects that are not native to all parts of Australia. Finally, older plantations in which trees flower may exchange genes with surrounding forest species, given the high degree of hybridization exhibited by many Eucalyptus species. This is an aspect of exchange for which few data have been recorded. In summary, because of Australia's unique biogeography, plantation forestry using eucalypt species entails exchanges with natural habitats that are unparalleled in scale and diversity in any other part of the world. More exchanges are likely as plantations occupy greater area, and as the time under cultivation increases.",Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Eucalyptus; Managed ecosystems; Myrtaceae; Plant-insect interactions; Plantations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012850547

We conducted cytoembryological studies in 3 species of the group Plicatula (Paspalum limbatum, Paspalum lenticulare and Paspalum guenoarum) in order to understand the breeding systems of 9 accessions which are currently under selection and being bred for forage purposes in our institution. Both accessions of P. limbatum were diploid (2n = 2x = 20), showed bivalent chromosome pairing at meiosis and were allogamous due to self-incompatibility. Five accessions of P. lenticulare and 2 of P. guenoarum were tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40) with mainly bivalent and quadrivalent chromosome pairing at meiosis. The high frequency of quadrivalents suggests autoploidy as the most probable origin for these tetraploids. All these tetraploid accessions showed complete degeneration of the megaspores. The embryo sacs, one to several per ovule, always developed from somatic nucellar cells. These non-reduced embryo sacs produced embryos through parthenogenesis, and were hence genetically identical with the mother plant. Notwithstanding, pollination was required for the development of the endosperm. Only one accession of P. lenticulare has some reduced potential for sexual reproduction. Our results indicate that P. limbatum is a sexual allogamous diploid species while P. lenticulare and P. guenoarum reproduce by means of aposporous obligate apomixis.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035738064

The species is self-compatible, but self-pollination is possible only when there is overlap of male and female inflorescences (38% of the cases). Only 28 percent of the stigmas of 1020 flowers received pollen grains and 20 percent developed pollen tubes in the styles. Of all the flowers produced by an inflorescence, 14 percent initiated fruit development but only 3 percent develop into mature fruits. Seventy-six percent of the initiated fruits were aborted.",Bet-hedging; Dichogamy; Fruit abortion; Geonoma epetiolata; Monoecy; Palm phenology; Pollen limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035709919

Calcium influences cell-wall and membrane structure and function. Cytosolic calcium is considered as second messenger in regulation of important cellular events. We present three cases in which calcium was shown to regulate processes of postharvest life of flowers. 1.Rose petal senescence In whole rose cut flowers and in detached petals, CaCl2 treatment promoted bud opening and delayed senescence. The treated flowers stayed turgid and continued their initial postharvest growth for longer periods of time. Calcium treatment delayed the decrease in membrane proteins and phospholipids (PL) with time and increased ATPase activity in the aging petals. Electrolyte leakage was postponed in calcium treated flowers. We suggest that the calcium-induced delay in rose petal senescence involves the protection of membrane proteins and PLs from degeneration. 2.Pollination-induced senescence of Phalaenopsis. Pollination increased ethylene production and sensitivity to ethylene. Treatment of both pollinated and unpollinated flowers with calcium ions increased the sensitivity of the flowers to ethylene and promoted ethylene production and senescence, while EGTA - A chelator of calcium, decreased these processes. 3.Gravitropic bending of flowers. Calcium chelators and the calcium channel blocker LaCl3 inhibited the gravitropic bending of several flower stalks. These modulators had no deleterious effect on the flowering shoots, indicating that they inhibit the gravitropic bending by interfering specifically with the gravitropism related processes. An ethylene gradient was developed across the flowering shoot prior to the bending response, with high levels of ethylene production at the lower side. This ethylene gradient was abolished by treatment with the calcium antagonists.

Theoretical models predict that the level of FA should increase as a result of inbreeding, but empirical results are ambiguous. Moreover, the relationship between fitness and FA is still debated. In the current study, plants from a population of Scabiosa canescens, a locally rare species in southern Sweden, were raised under uniform growth conditions to examine the effects of one-generation of selfing and outcrossing on FA in flower morphology. The level of flower FA was significantly higher (p = 0.038) for inbred progeny than for offspring derived from outcross pollinations. Given that earlier studies of this species have found no negative relation between hetcrozygosity and FA, the results support the conclusion that expression of deleterious recessive alleles are responsible for the increase of FA. There was no correlation between FA and estimates of five fitness-related traits when estimated at the individual level. However, a companion study found significant inbreeding depression for all fitness traits, and a negative association between FA and fitness could therefore be asserted at the treatment level (inbred/outbred progeny). Hence, FA seems to be useful to predict inbreeding depression in S. canescens, but specific individuals with high fitness cannot be identified based on their FA levels.",Deleterious alleles; Developmental instability; Fitness; Inbreeding depression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035709380

In 1999 we surveyed the plants and vertebrates of Long and the entire biota of Motmot for comparison with previous surveys of Long (1932, 1972, birds only) and Motmot (1969-88). Results: The known flora of Long is 305 vascular plants (thirty-two pteridophytes, 273 spermatophytes), including thirty-one Ficus species, the sixteen fruiting all having pollinating wasps, and there were eleven species of effective fig dispersers. There were two frog species, a crocodile, a monitor, seven skinks, four geckos, a boid snake, fifty species non-migrant land birds, seven bats, two rats, a cuscus (probably introduced) and feral pigs, dogs, cats and chickens. Most of Motmot's surface was barren or sparsely vegetated ash, cinder and lava fields. There were seven pteridophyte and thirty-eight spermatophyte species, including eight Ficus, and the cumulative known flora comprises eleven pteridophytes and fifty-one spermatophytes, mainly zoochorous and anemochorous, with sedges, grasses and herbs predominating. All Ficus individuals but one were small; three plants of two species bore syconia but had not been pollinated and had not set seed. Motmot's known invertebrate fauna comprises thirty-five species, mainly predators and scavengers; two spider and one ant species dominating. An insectivorous bat and eight land bird species (three breeding) were the only vertebrates. Main conclusions: Long's biota comprised mainly widely distributed species with broad ecological tolerances, well-adapted for colonizing species-poor islands. The mid-level caldera plateau, as in 1932, was covered in fairly open forest of similar-sized trees with a few much larger individuals and little or no understorey. Primary rain forest tree species from the region were under-represented or absent but secondary forest species were common. There were few regional endemic Ficus species. The avifauna comprised species with good dispersal ability, lacked endemic subspecies and probably for at least the past seven decades has been held at a quasi-equilibrium of fifty species, fourteen below the theoretical number. More than half the fifty-four resident land birds known from Long (and three of the seven bats) are high class tramps in the sense of Diamond; only two birds are high-S species. Turnover has been low and none of the bird supertramps has been replaced. The non-avian fauna comprised mostly high-category tramp-type species with relatively broad habitat requirements and extensive geographical ranges. Non-volant vertebrates comprised a number of highly vagile species associated with humans. Several groups, especially snakes and amphibians, were depauperate compared with the fauna of other islands in the area. Long's biota is evidently held at an arrested stage of development by some physical factor, possibly the extremely porous substratum and relatively dry climate. The allochthonous input of lake insects to Motmot evidently provides the major energy source for its animal communities, with a very minor contribution from organic flotsam. Reflecting Motmot's very isolated situation, plant colonization has been slow, but when more fig individuals mature and fig-wasp populations become established fruit production should attract frugivores and start a positive feedback process which will accelerate the growth of Motmot's community. Long's colonization shows similarities with that of Krakatau (Sunda Strait, Indonesia) after the 1883 eruption, and species shared by the two include a high proportion of pioneer species. Motmot's triple isolation (sea, land and fresh-water barriers) means that its colonization differs markedly from those on two marine emergent islands of the region, Tuluman (Admiralty Group) and Anak Krakatau.",Community assembly; Dispersal; Establishment; Island colonization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035695560

A combined morphological and cytogenetic approach was used to investigate this phenomenon in two geographically separated populations of natural birch woodland in Iceland. The results not only confirmed introgressive hybridization in birch, but also revealed bidirectional gene flow between the two species via triploid interspecific hybrids. The populations showed continuous morphological variation connecting the species, but karyotypically they consisted of only three types of plants: diploids, triploids, and tetraploids. No aneuploids were found. Some of the tetraploid plants had B. pubescens morphology as expected, but most of them had intermediate characters. Most of the diploid plants were B. nana, but some were intermediates and a few had B. pubescens morphology. The triploid plants were either intermediates or they resembled one of the two species. Similar introgressive variation was observed among the diploid and triploid progeny of open-pollinated B. nana in a garden.

Flower number, seed set, abortion, and anatomical observations of egg sacs and proembryos were analyzed. Although flowers formed continuously for 7 wk, the period of maximum seed set under controlled conditions was brief (1-2 wk). Competition within the same nutritional unit (raceme) did not account for low average seed set per raceme. Neither the number of flowers nor frequency of seed set was decreased when developing seeds were on the same raceme. Abortion (=10%) was not a major factor limiting seed set. Eighty percent of the flowers failed to initiate seeds even under controlled growing conditions when hand pollinated. Approximately 20% of megagametophytes appeared to be defective at anthesis. The proportion of ovules containing a proembryo at 24 h after pollination (HAP) paralleled the proportion initiating seeds, indicating that fertilization is a limiting process. Pollen tube remnants were observed near the micropyle in 65% of the unfertilized ovules at 24 HAP. Lack of fertilization accounts for most of the reduction in seed set, appears to be caused by failure of the pollen tube to grow into the micropyle, and increases with plant age at pollination.

Eleven selective primer combinations generated a total of 508 amplification products. The average number of scorable fragments was 23 per primer combination. A total of 251 polymorphic markers was detected. The polymorphisms obtained ranged from 36% to 61% with an average of 49%. The final phenetic trees were constructed using Nei and Li's coefficient of similarity with UPGMA. Other clustering algorithms were examined and all had high co-phenetic correlations, indicating the goodness of fit for the resulting phylogenetic trees. The phenetic tree as well as principal component analysis (PCA) separated the 40 velvetbean accessions into two main clusters. Bootstrap and Jackknife analyses were completed and their values indicated strong to moderate support for the two main clusters. This grouping confirmed the existing phenological difference with regard to maturity. The high values of the similarity coefficients observed (0.87 to 0.97) imply that the accessions used in this study are similar.

Upon subsequent exposures to the same protein, the proteins (allergens) bind to and cross-link cell bound IgE stimulating the release of mediators (histamine) that lead to an allergic reaction (Immediate Hypersensitivity). Seed proteins represent one important class of proteins that can induce a variety of allergic syndromes. Aerosolized particles released during pollination, harvest, transport and storage of grains and seed crops can cause inhalant allergy in susceptible individuals. Increased use of cereal grains, legumes and nuts in the diet has been suggested to contribute to the rise in the prevalence of food allergies. Plant biotechnology affords unique opportunities to identify individual components of seeds or seed products that may cause allergies and to remove or alter allergens from the food source, so that the food can be consumed safely by allergic individuals.

The selection was performed for ear size in haploid plants. The mean gain in productivity in the synthetic populations SP and SA the per cycle was 16.48 and 20.98%, respectively. It is suggested that the high value of this index is related to the fact that haploid plants reveal useful genes with additive and epistatic effects. Natural selection may have played a part, too.

The traits examined were time and duration of the flowering period, flower life span, and duration of male and female flower phases. Floral attributes, such as number of flowers per plant, flower biomass, flower size, were also studied in order to examine whether they change with elevation or influence flower phenology. Flowering of Campanula species started in mid-May and ended in late September. The average duration of flowering of the genus was ca 27 d and the average floral longevity 4 d. In all but one species, the female phase lasted longer than the male. Campanula versicolor differed remarkably from all others in flower phenology and other floral traits. Nearly all Campanula populations studied had right or positively skewed flowering distributions indicating that flowering begins more abruptly than it ends. At the genus level, the time of flowering increased with elevation by 2-3 d for every 100 m. Floral longevity also increased with elevation, by 0.2 d for every 100 m. Neither duration of flowering nor duration of the flower phases showed any consistent change with elevation. The same is true of the non-phenological floral traits examined. No trade-off between duration of flowering and flower life span or between structure and maintenance of flowers was apparent. The pattern of increasing floral longevity along the elevation gradient suggests a mechanism of compensation for reduced pollinator availability.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035700910

Marandu is a natural tetraploid aposporous apomict widely cultivated in Brazil. Pseudogamy was detected in this species by observation that seed set is suppressed in plants that have had the stigmas excised from the flowers. The egg cell develops parthenogenetically in the apomictic plants, meaning that fertilisation is necessary for the formation of the endosperm. A thorough knowledge of all the events of seed formation in natural apomictic plants is essential for a complete understanding of this mode of reproduction. In this paper, we show direct evidence of pseudogamy in B. brizantha through the cytological analysis of polar nucleus fertilisation and the determination of triploid level of the endosperm tissue. The development of the male gametophyte gives rise to a reduced tri-celled pollen, the viability of which varies throughout the year, reaching 88% in the peak of the flowering period. Discharge of the male gamete takes place around 10 h after pollination and monospermy is the predominant system observed. Precocious embryony was also observed in these plants; embryos arise from egg cells. Endosperm development followed the free nucleus model and was associated with the presence of an embryo. Cellularisation and reserve uptake occurred 2 days after pollination (DAP) and mature endosperm was observed 8 DAP. The triploid level of the endosperm in the apomictic accession confirmed the 2:1 maternal:paternal ratio of genome contribution in the tissue.",Endosperm; Parthenogenesis; Pollen; Pseudogamy; Seed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035668738

Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are one group where a decline has been documented, and it is thought to be attributable to a decrease in forage resources and potential nest sites. As bumblebees play an important role in the pollination of many entomophilous crops, this decline could impact on agricultural productivity. We examined the role of naturally regenerated field margins in providing forage plants on land where nectar resources are otherwise impoverished. The following question was addressed - Are naturally regenerated unsprayed field margins more attractive to foraging bumblebees and honeybees than cropped field margins managed as conservation headlands? Significantly more bees visited naturally regenerated field margins than cropped field margins. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), Bombus terrestris, and Bombus lapidarius were the most commonly observed bee species. Different wildflower species within the naturally regenerated margins varied greatly in relative number of visits received, and bumblebee species were found to prefer different flower species to honeybees.

This study investigated the occurrence of gene flow from transgenic rice to non-transgenic rice plants under agronomic conditions using a herbicide resistance gene as a tracer marker. Two field experiments were established in the paddy fields of two main Mediterranean rice-growing areas of Spain and Italy. In both locations analyses of phenotypic, molecular and segregation data showed that pollination of recipient plants with pollen of the transgenic source occurred at a significant frequency. A gene flow slightly lower than 0.1% was detected in a normal side-by-side plot design. Similar results were found in a circular plot when the plants were placed at 1-m distance from the transgenic central nucleus. A strong asymmetric distribution of the gene flow was detected among this circle and highest values (0.53%) were recorded following the direction of the dominant wind. A significant lowest value (0.01%) was found in the other circle (5 m from the transgenic plants) as was expected according to the characteristics of rice pollen. Such circular-field trial designs could also prove to be very useful in studying the gene flow to other commercial cultivars of rice with the aim of establishing strategies to prevent pollen dispersal from commercial transgenic fields to the neighbouring conventional fields.",Gene flow; Herbicide resistance; Oryza sativa; Risk assessment; Transgenic rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035678945

The role of non-flying mammals as pollinators of four species of Banksia was investigated in north-eastern New South Wales. Nine species of non-flying mammals were captured amongst flowering Banksia and all carried variable amounts of Banksia pollen on their fur or in their faeces. Although not captured, feathertail gliders (Acrobates pygmaeus) were observed foraging at Banksia inflorescences. Squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) visiting B. integrifolia and pale field-rats (Rattus tunneyi) visiting B. ericifolia, carried substantial loads of pollen. Fur pollen loads for these species were of a magnitude similar to those of nectarivorous birds that were sampled closer to the time of foraging. Assessment of newly opened flowers indicated that considerable amounts of pollen were removed at night. The results of a pollinator exclusion experiment were inconclusive but B. ericifolia inflorescences exposed to nocturnal pollinators had consistently high fruit-set.

Canopy observations indicated that African honeybees (Apis mellifera scutellata) were the predominant floral visitors in fragmented habitats and replaced native insects in isolated pasture trees. Trees in habitat fragments produced, on average, over three times as many seeds as trees in continuous forest, and microsatellite assays of seed arrays showed that genetic diversity was maintained across habitats. A paternity analysis further revealed gene flow over as much as 3.2 km of pasture, the most distant pollination precisely recorded for any plant species.

Deceptive species do not provide any reward to their pollinators, which thus visit few flowers per plant. Therefore, deceptive species are predicted to experience high outcrossing. In agreement with the prediction that species with high outcrossing rate should possess a heavy genetic load, we demonstrated inbreeding depression in one of the populations we studied. More surprisingly, we found some evidence of inbreeding depression at a small geographic scale. This was not expected, as deceptive orchids generally disperse their pollen and their seeds over long distances. We also demonstrated that the position of a flower within an inflorescence interacts with the type of cross. This indicates that resource availability might modify how severely deleterious mutations affect reproductive success. This could also explain why the intensity of inbreeding depression seems, in the populations we studied, to be determined more by environmental factors than by inbreeding level, as estimated from molecular markers.

Rhythmic emission of methyl benzoate displays a ""free-running"" cycle in the absence of environmental cues (in continuous dark or continuous light), indicating the circadian nature of diurnal rhythmicity. Methyl benzoate is produced in upper and lower snapdragon petal lobes by enzymatic methylation of benzoic acid in the reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT). When a detailed time-course analysis of BAMT activity in upper and lower petal lobes during a 48-hr period was performed, high BAMT activity was found at night as well as in continuous darkness, indicating that the BAMT activity is not an oscillation-determining factor. Analysis of the level of benzoic acid during a 24-hr period revealed oscillations in the amount of benzoic acid during the daily light/dark cycle that were retained in continuous darkness. These data clearly show that the total amount of substrate (benzoic acid) in the cell is involved in the regulation of the rhythmic emission of methyl benzoate.

Little attention is paid to the role of green water, or vapour flows, in sustaining the generation of terrestrial ecosystem services, including biomass production. Ecosystem services (such as carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, pollination and pest control) are generated by ecological processes in different biomes of the World and essential for socio-economic development. In this paper we critically assess the limitations of the past blue water bias for future ecohydrological landscape management. We present results from an effort of quantifying continental green water fluxes for major terrestrial biomes indicating that the large biomes, generating essential ecosystem services depend on more than 90 % of the total average terrestrial return flow of green water to the atmosphere. The paper discusses the future implications of such large dependence on green water fluxes, and options of improving efficiency in water resources management. It points at the need of avoiding sectoral management and calls for an ecohydrological landscape management based on both ecological and hydrological knowledge.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034764721

To test the effects of floral morphology on pollen deposition on the stigma and other floral parts by means of electrostatic forces, metal replicas of almond (Amygdalus communis) flowers were constructed and then dusted with electrostatically charged and uncharged almond pollen. The pollen was applied to the flowers with a specially designed electrostatic powder-coating device. Pollen deposition on the flower was found to be higher when the pollen was electrostatically charged than when it was not. Most of the charged pollen grains were deposited on the corolla extremities and on the stigma, whereas uncharged pollen grains were evenly distributed on the entire flower. Stigma exsertion was the most important morphological feature of the flower promoting pollen deposition on the stigma when electrostatic charge was used. Large flowers with corollas showed higher electrodeposition on the corolla than smaller, narrower ones. These results collectively imply that morphological features of a plant might be adaptations to take advantage of electrostatic forces.

Detailed molecular markers confirmed the isogenic nature of this recovered mutant and the original cultivar Igri. A comparative study of the anther culture response of this six-rowed induced mutant vs. diploid 'Igri' was performed to assess whether the two- or six-rowed gene influences anther culture response in barley through a pleiotropic effect or via linkage disequilibrium. No significant differences for any of the recorded variables throughout the in vitro regeneration process were detected between the 'Igri' six-rowed mutant and any of their two-rowed isogenic lines.

The main objective of this study was to detect predictors associated with high grass allergen concentration in settled house dust during and outside the grass pollination season. Methods: We detected group 5 grass-pollen allergens in dust samples from randomly selected homes of three counties in the region of Sachsen-Anhalt: Hettstedt (n = 183), Zerbst (n = 152), and Bitterfeld (n = 119). Dust samples were collected from the floors of living rooms (LR) and children's rooms (CR) from April 1996 to March 1998. Results: Ph1 p 5 was detected in settled house dust in 91% of the homes. The range was between undetectable (&lt; 30 ng/m2) and 4300 ng Ph1 p 5/m2 sampling area during grass pollination, and 1300 ng Ph1 p 5/m2 outside the pollination season, respectively. We observed a partially higher concentration of indoor allergenic activity several weeks after the grass-pollen peak. A positive association was found between Ph1 p 5 levels and total dust amounts throughout the year. Thus, we assume that grass allergens accumulate in settled house dust. During pollination, the Ph1 p 5 levels are 1.8 times higher in homes where vacuuming of carpets takes place only once a week or less than in those vacuumed daily. Furthermore, higher concentrations of Ph1 p 5 in settled floor dust can be expected in homes located within suburban areas (mean ratio [MR] 1.74) and prefabricated slab buildings (MR = 1.54). Conclusions: Quite high levels of Ph1 p 5 accumulate in settled house dust even during periods when no grass pollen is present in the atmosphere. The removal of dust by frequent cleaning reduces the indoor exposure to grass allergens.

Furthermore, the spatial genetic structure of the Trillium populations was examined in light of the outcrossing results. In field experiments, recipient plants were pollinated with either self pollen or with pollen from donors growing 1 m, 10 m, 100 m, and 1500 m away. These distances represented crosses between individuals growing within the same population (1 m, 10 m, and 100 m crosses) and between individuals growing in different populations (1500 m crosses). Self-pollinated T. erectum and T. grandiflorum produced 71% and 89% fewer seeds, respectively, than all other outcrossing treatments. However, there were no significant differences among outcrossing treatments for fruit or seed production. As neither T. erectum nor T. grandiflorum exhibited an optimal outcrossing distance for fruit or seed production, it was predicted that populations of the two would not demonstrate strong spatial genetic structure or isolation by distance. The allozyme results only partially supported the patterns revealed in the outcrossing treatments. Populations of T. erectum and T. grandiflorum showed moderate spatial genetic differentiation based on F-statistics, and only T. grandiflorum exhibited significant isolation by distance based on spatial autocorrelation analyses. The lack of optimal outcrossing distances and the patterns of allozyme variation in T. erectum and T. grandiflorum populations may be attributed to a number of factors, including active seed dispersal by ants, rare long-distance gene-flow events, post-pollination and post-fertilization selection, and/or the severity of inbreeding depression.",Genetic structure; Inbreeding depression; Optimal outcrossing; Spatial autocorrelation; Spring ephemerals; Trillium erectum; Trillium grandiflorum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034784028

Bidens received significantly more pollinator visits per floral unit per unit time and attracted significantly larger insects than Solidago. The significant patch size effect seen in the MANOVA was driven by the strong impact of patch size on the size of insects visiting the experimental patches: the size (mass) of insects visiting large patches was significantly greater than the size of insects visiting small patches of a given plant species, but visitation rates to large and small patches of a given plant species were similar. MANOVA indicated that hunting success of a flower-dwelling crab spider, Misumenoides formosipes, was also significantly affected by species composition and size of flower patches. Three measures of spider hunting success (rate of mass gain and its components, total prey mass captured per spider per day, and number of prey captured per spider per day) were evaluated, and the experimental treatments exerted similar effects on all three measures. Spiders occupying Bidens patches experienced greater hunting success than spiders occupying Solidago patches, and in patches of a given plant species, spiders occupying large patches experienced greater hunting success than spiders occupying small patches. The pattern of spider hunting success most closely paralleled the pattern described by the size of insects visiting the patches (BL>BS=SL>SS), suggesting that the size of visiting pollinators, rather than frequency of visitation, exerted a greater influence on spider hunting success. Taxonomic composition of a spider's diet varied with the plant species occupied. The size of insects captured by spiders was significantly greater than average size of insects visiting the patches, indicating that spiders selectively captured larger pollinator taxa. Spider movements among patches revealed a pattern of migration from Solidago to Bidens.",Crab spiders; Direct and indirect effects; Patch size; Pollinators; Predation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034772214

Seed samples were analysed from 9 to 23 days after pollination (DAP) as well as mature seeds. The relative amount of oleate was higher and the amount of the polyunsaturated fatty acids was lower in the seeds of the transgenic plants expressing the fatty acid modifying genes than in seeds from the control plants. The degree of the changes was more pronounced in phosphatidylcholine (PC) than in the neutral fraction and varied considerably between the transgenic plants carrying the different genes. The unusual fatty acids (acetylenic, epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids) produced in the transgenic A. thaliana plants accumulated in significant amounts in seed phospholipids during seed development. Despite that the percentage of the unusual fatty acids accumulated in neutral lipids in the transgenic plants were 5-35 times less than in the wild plant species accumulating these acids, the relative levels of these acids in PC were approximately the same (epoxy and hydroxy fatty acids) or much higher (acetylenic fatty acids) than in that lipid in the wild plants. Since ricinoleic, vernolic and crepenynic acid are formed from precursor fatty acids esterified in PC catalysed by delta 12-desaturase like enzymes, it can be concluded that A. thaliana seeds have less efficient mechanisms for the specific channelling of these fatty acids from PC to triacylglycerol (TAG). © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

However, few studies have shown this relationship under conditions of natural pollination. Using the tropical dry forest tree Pachira quinata, we evaluated the relationship between the number of microgametophytes per pistil and the number of sires with respect to the production of fruits and seeds in a natural population of Pachira quinata. Our study demonstrates that fruit and seed production are directly related to the number of microgametophytes per pistil in natural populations of P. quinata. Only 6% of the marked flowers developed into mature fruits and 10% of the marked flowers initiated fruits but later aborted them. A mean of 23 pollen grains were required to produce a seed. Flowers with >400 pollen grains on the stigma always developed into mature fruits, whereas flowers that received <200 grains never matured fruits. Half of the pollen grains transferred to a flower stigma germinated and developed pollen tubes to the base of the style. The number of pollen grains on a stigma explained 34% of the variation in seed number per fruit, and the number of seeds produced per fruit is positively correlated with the size of the seeds. The population of P. quinata studied is predominantly outcrossing, and seeds within fruits are sired by one or a few donors. The total seed crop within trees was sired by three to five donors. Our study examined the implications of the variation in size of microgametophyte loads per pistil with respect to the breeding system and the paternity of progeny under natural conditions. The competitive ability of pollen and pollen tube attrition are important factors regulating fruit production in P. quinata.",Bombacaceae; Pachira quinata; Paternity; Pollen competition; Pollen-pistil interactions; Self-incompatibility; Tropical dry forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000094275

There were no significant differences in the number of inflorescences visited per bee or the number of flowers visited per inflorescence per bee when robbed and unrobbed treatments were compared. Of the parameters measured, only distance flown between inflorescences differed in the robbed and the unrobbed treatments. Bees flew significantly further between inflorescences in the robbed plots than in the unrobbed plots.

We hypothesized that rate of flower production (birth rate), number of open flowers per day (population size) and flower duration (longevity) should be related to plant resource status. With dioecious species, resource demands of male or female function would contribute to sex-specific floral demographics. For example, fruit production in females imposes a resource cost that is absent in males. We recorded individual flower dynamics for 1200 flowers on 85 female plants and 11,179 flowers on 94 male plants in the dioecious species Silene latifolia. For males, resource availability was manipulated by defoliating a subset of plants (1587 flowers on 18 plants). For females, resource availability and usage was manipulated as follows: 0% pollinated (401 flowers on 16 plants), 50% pollinated (118 non-pollinated and 131 pollinated flowers on 17 plants), 100% pollinated (470 flowers on 46 plants) and 100% pollinated and defoliated (80 flowers on 6 plants). Populations of flowers on individual plants showed a good fit to the logistic population growth model. Estimated carrying capacities for flowers decrease with decreasing resource availability (males > defoliated males > 0% pollinated females > 50% pollinated females > 100% pollinated females > 100% pollinated and defoliated females). Pollinated flowers had shorter longevity than non-pollinated flowers. Non-pollinated flowers on plants with 50% pollination had shorter longevity than non-pollinated flowers on plants with 0% pollination. Thus, flower population dynamics within plants do show evidence of resource-based dynamics.",Demography; Exponential growth; Floral longevity; Logistic growth; Phenology; Resource allocation; Silene latifolia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011190079

Deforestation of the tropical dry forest has fragmented the habitat and resulted in the isolation of the only four extant populations of B. vazquezii. In this study, we assessed the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation by comparing the genetic variability (allelic richness and expected mean heterozygosity, He), gene flow and population differentiation in both adult (before fragmentation) and seedling (after fragmentation) populations. Six polymorphic enzymatic loci were used to estimate genetic parameters. F-statistics revealed a deficiency of heterozygous plants in both adults and seedlings in all populations. This probably results from geitonogamous selfing. Genetic diversity was lower in adult than in seedling populations (He = 0.201 and 0.357, respectively). Significant genetic differentiation among populations and of similar magnitude was detected for the adult and seedling populations (Fst = 0.1013 and 0.0705, respectively). Average gene flow between pairs of reproductive populations was high (Nm = 2.23). The genetic structure of adult and seedling populations of B. vazquezii suggests that habitat fragmentation has not reduced, as yet, allelic richness and genetic diversity, nor has it increased genetic differentiation.

We performed hand-selfed and hand-outcrossed pollinations in the field, conducted detailed floral observations within individual flowers and plants, and assayed adult tissue from flowering plants for a genetic estimate of population outcrossing rate. We quantified the opportunity for geitonogamy as the proportion of days each plant exhibited simultaneous male and female function, i.e., asynchronous expression of male- and female-phased flowers. Expression of cumulative inbreeding depression based on germination rate and total flower production in the glasshouse was ?40% and was congruent with the estimated high outcrossing rate of 0.89. Floral observations demonstrated strong temporal protandry within each flower (dichogamy) as well as complete spatial separation between male and female function within each flower (herkogamy). On average, 29% of the time there were both male- and female-phased flowers present on an individual plant. We conclude that our estimate of inbreeding depression is compatible with a largely outcrossing mating system and the amount of selfing observed, likely results from geitonogamy. This study illustrates the utility of examining both the causes and the consequences of inbreeding via selfing to provide additional insights into the evolution of plant mating systems.",Breeding system; Caryophyllaceae; Geitonogamy; Hummingbird; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Perennial; Silene virginica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038042556

In heterocarpic Asteraceae, non-dispersing fruits (achenes) are produced at the periphery of the capitulum (outer florets) whereas dispersing achenes are produced by inner florets in the same capitulum. Since all the florets are protandrous, the outer floret developing first are in female phasis when anthesis of inner florets takes place. Thus, outer florets can be potentially selfed by the inner florets of the same capitulum whereas the latter must be pollinated by flowers of other capitula. Therefore outer florets should be more inbred than inner florets. To test this hypothesis, we measured the natural outcrossing rate in outer and inner florets using allozymes in three populations of the heterocarpic Crepis sancta. The results showed that the outcrossing rate was highest for non-dispersed achenes. Moreover, among the outcrossed achenes within a capitulum it was observed that the number of paternal parents of non-dispersing achenes was higher than for dispersing achenes. The pattern observed was therefore the opposite to the pattern of cleistogamous plants and contradicts the putative pollination mechanism we proposed for Asteraceae. The results agree with the predictions of sib competition theory which considers that outcrossing may minimize competitive interactions among relatives (sibs) falling near the mother plant. Higher outcrossing rate in outer florets could also occur because pollinators are more attracted to these florets.",Asteraceae; Crepis sancta; Dispersal; Heteromorphic; Outcrossing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034776366

This method is quicker and more precise than the existing methods. The genotype of the S-allele for 20 S-haplotypes of cabbage and 20 S-haplotypes of broccoli was determined by a pollination test. In order to identify the S-alleles, we performed PCR-RFLP with a mixture of the primers that are related to the S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) gene, which corresponds to the results of the pollination test. The selected primers amplified all of the single bands of about 1,150 bp in all 40 lines of cabbage and broccoli. Three out of 20 lines of cabbage were amplified by class I SLG specific primers, whereas all of the lines of the cabbage were amplified by class II SLG specific primers.

The remaining 5 lines were amplified with the class II SLG specific primers. We then digested the amplified PCR products with various restriction endonucleases and chose a restriction endonuclease, which accords exactly with the results of the diallel cross. The best one was Hinfl. Its RFLP result was the same as that of the nucleotide sequence analysis. The 40 lines of cabbage and broccoli consisted of 16 different S-haplotypes. Therefore, the PCR-RFLP analysis was quicker and more precise in identifying the characteristics of S-haplotypes that are used in breeding.

It is defined as the number of days during which pollination is effective in producing a fruit and is determined by the longevity of the ovules minus the time lag between pollination and fertilisation. Over 30 years have elapsed since this concept was first introduced and, during this time, a good number of experiments have been carried out to study the EPP in different species and cultivars and under different environmental conditions. The results obtained indicate that the EPP plays a clear role controlling cropping in fruit trees and, consequently, it is a useful parameter to dissect and locate the factors limiting fruit set. In this paper, the information built up around the EPP is reviewed in temperate fruit trees. Since EPP is conditioned by three main processes - stigmatic receptivity, pollen tube kinetics and ovule development - the role played by each of them is examined. Finally, the influence of a number of factors - temperature, flower quality and chemical treatments - that affect those parameters is evaluated. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Effective pollination period; Fruit set; Fruit trees; Ovule longevity; Pollen tube; Stigmatic receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037555412

To help evaluate the worth of alternative pollinators in agriculture, we present a theoretical framework for comparing the effectiveness of two or more pollinators by measuring pollen removal and deposition. 2. We report pollen removal and deposition data by Apis mellifera and Bombus spp. during single visits to four cultivars of apples (Golden Delicious, Starkrimson Delicious, Empire/MacIntosh and Rome) and Mission almond. 3. Apis and Bombus removed similar amounts of pollen from apple flowers but Bombus deposited more pollen on stigmas. Pollen-collecting bees removed more pollen from apple anthers than nectar-collecting bees. Apis that approached nectaries laterally deposited substantially less pollen than other visitors. 4. Apis and Bombus removed and deposited similar amounts of pollen on almond flowers. Apis tended to remove more during pollen-collecting visits than nectar-collecting visits. The type of resource sought did not significantly influence deposition. 5. Based on removal and deposition data, additions of Bombus may increase pollen delivery in apple orchards but reduce pollen delivery in almond orchards if Apis already serve as primary pollinators.

Compared to other plant taxa, this cactus is rich in polymorphic loci (Ps = 89.5%), with high numbers of alleles per polymorphic locus (APs = 3.82), but moderate levels of heterozygosity (Hes = 0.145). Substantial levels of inbreeding were detected across loci and populations at macrogeographic (FIS = 0.348) and regional levels (FIS = 0.194-0.402). Moderate levels of genetic differentiation among populations were detected at macrogeographical (FST = 0.193) and regional (FST = 0.084-0.187) scales, suggesting that gene flow is relatively restricted, but increases within regions without topographic barriers. The population genetic structure observed for this cactus was attributed to, at least, three factors: short-distance pollination and seed dispersal, the mixed-mating condition of the species, and genetic drift. High genetic identities between populations (I=0.942) supported the conspecific nature of all populations surveyed.

Manipulation of the two lower sepals led to a pollination efficiency that was the same as no manipulation. Pollination efficiency was lowered significantly after lateral sepal manipulation, and this was caused by the absence of the arch structure normally formed by two lateral sepals changing the posture of the pollinator.

Except for beetle pollinated species, many palms lack major anthecological adaptations that apparently promote visits of a particular taxonomic group of insects. To address the question whether these palms have evolved insect-specific pollination systems, the interaction of the monoecious, protandrous palm Hyospathe elegans Mart. and visiting insects was studied in Amazonian Peru during an entire flowering period. At least 27 taxa of the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera were recorded regularly visiting both types of flowers. To test whether flower visitation is taxonomically skewed, two sets of visitor samples from staminate and pistillate flowers were compared. There is no evidence to support the working hypothesis that there is a single optimal pollinator or a systematically bounded group of principal pollinators, based on the frequency of visits or the relative dominance within the visitor spectrum. Visitation rates suggest a mixed-species guild of nectar-feeding insects to be the commonest and most dependable pollinator group, along with an analogous guild of generalist-feeding copollinators. Hyospathe elegans and closely related species of Euterpe and Prestoea show common traits in their interaction with pollinators, such as phenological pattern, flowering behavior and allocation of rewards, and they also share a corresponding feeding guild. Given a preponderance of low taxonomic pollinator specificity in palm reproductive systems, pollination by a mixed-species guild may be widespread and the classification of 'mellitophilous' and 'myophilous' palms should be reconsidered.",Adaptation; Euterpe; Insect-plant interactions; Mixed species guild; Palms; Pollination syndrome; Pollinator specificity; Prestoea; Temporal dioecism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034800063

We analysed the longevity of individual flowers with respect to the effects of the floral display size of a plant (number of flowers open at one time) and spatial arrangement of flowers in Iris gracilipes (A. Gray). We found that the actual floral longevity of this species (about 2 days) was much shorter than that predicted by the model of Schoen and Ashman (about 7-10 days). 2. A large display size and an overlap of flowering periods within a shoot facilitated successive pollinator probes within a plant, though the frequency of pollinator visits per flower was independent of display size: Consequently, the cost of geitonogamous selfing increased with an increase in display size and an overlap of flowering periods within a shoot. The short floral longevity of this species would be effective in such situations because shorter floral longevity leads to a smaller display size and a smaller overlap of flowering periods within a shoot. 3. A small display size and small overlap of flowering periods within a shoot could also be realized by the strategy that staggers the flowering period of each flower without floral longevity being shortened (extended blooming). However, a mutant plant with an extended blooming schedule would be unlikely to invade the population because of the stabilizing selection pressure on the flowering date. This may be why such a short floral longevity, rather than extended blooming, has evolved in this species.",Blooming schedule; Display size; Spatial arrangement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034800716

Dispersal of fluorescent dyes in the field confirms that pollinators (bumble bees and honey bees) transfer pollen between species. To determine the potential effect of such interspecific pollen transfer on seed set of the native, we pollinated 773 flowers on 20 plants with one of three treatments: legitimate conspecific pollen, a mixture of conspecific and foreign pollen, and foreign pollen. The mixed-pollen treatment resulted in 28.8% lower seed set relative to conspecific pollination. Foreign crosses resulted in extremely low seed set.

Although its allergenicity has been recently reported, little is known of its involvement in pollinosis. Aerobiological study and sensitization in pollinotics were measured using a Hirst volumetric trap. We have measured the atmospheric concentrations of this pollen and other allergenic pollen types in our region, between March 1993 and March 1997. Z. fabago pollen was collected for a morphometric study of the pollen grain, and a lyophilized extract was prepared for skin prick tests. We have conducted skin tests with different pollen types from our region and with Z. fabago in 1736 patients with symptoms suggesting pollinosis. The size of the pollen grain averages 15.17 × 17.35 ?m. The pollination period extends from May to August, with a mean accumulated concentration of 448 grains/m 3. Out of 1736 pollinotics, 263 (15.15%) showed a positive skin test for Z. fabago, 6 were monosensitized and 257 were sensitized to other common pollen types from our region. Specific IgE to Z. fabago was equal or higher than 0.35 ku/l in 86.56% of sensitized patients. Chenopodiaceae pollinate during spring and autumn and sensitize a larger number of patients; Urticaceae reach the highest pollen concentrations and for a longer period but are not the primary cause of pollinosis. This study shows that Z. fabago pollen becomes airborne, elicits an IgE response and, like other pollens, contributes towards triggering allergic symptoms. It should therefore be considered a relevant allergen and accordingly be included in skin test procedures.",Aerobiology; Allergenicity; Pollen calendar; Pollinosis; Zygophyllum fabago,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034778295

The stylar matrix secreted by the TTE can be isolated and used in an in vitro adhesion assay for pollen tubes. This bioassay was used to isolate two stigma/stylar adhesion molecules in lily: a pectic polysaccharide and a small cysteine-rich, basic protein we named SCA (stigma/stylar cysteine-rich adhesin). Both molecules were purified and used in an adhesion assay. Adhesion in the assay can be disrupted by treatment of the pectin with polygalacturonase and of SCA with proteinase K. The two molecules bind to each other in a pH-dependent fashion, and this binding is necessary for the adhesion assay to work. Antibodies to each of the molecules show their localization at the sites of pollen tube adhesion in the style. Pollen does not produce SCA but does bind this protein in vivo and in vitro.

This incompatibility led to reduced pollination potency, explaining the low yield obtained from 'Topred' rows adjacent to 'Jonathan'. Hence, the importance of identifying the level of compatibility for all 'Topred' pollinators became apparent. By analysing S-allele by PCR with primers for the various S-alleles of the cultivars in the 'Topred' orchard, including S10 and S28, which were cloned in this study, it was evident that apart from 'Jonathan', the common pollinators for 'Topred' are fully compatible with it. The ability to identify all S-alleles in the 'Topred' orchard was also utilized to resolve the observation that, although 'Topred' is considered self-incompatible, self-pollinated, net-caged, 'Topred' flowers set some fruit. Applying PCR-analysis of S-alleles to the progeny of the suspected self-pollinated 'Topred' fruit revealed that the fruit-set was the outcome of cross-pollination, perhaps the consequence of fertilization by wind carried pollen. Hence, the notion that 'Topred' is totally selfincompatible was confirmed and the efficiency of progeny PCR S-allele analysis for the determination of the pollen donor was exhibited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034813294

At least two mechanisms contribute to S-RNase dependent rejection of pollen from self compatible species such as Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and N. tabacum. Cloned S-RNases from self incompatible N. alata expressed in styles of self compatible N. tabacum cause rejection of N. tabacum pollen through a factor-independent mechanism. However, rejection of N. plumbaginifolia pollen occurs only when S-RNases are expressed in conjunction with non-S-RNase factors from N. alata (factor-dependent pollen rejection). Here, we compared the pollen rejection activity of four RNases in these two systems. Recombinant RNase expression levels in the factor-dependent N. plumbaginifolia system were insufficient to cause pollen rejection. However, three S-RNases were active in the factor-independent N. tabacum pollen rejection system. This system shows the broadest specificity of any system so far examined. However, RNaseI from E. coli could not cause N. tabacum pollen rejection. Thus, RNase activity alone is not sufficient for pollen rejection.

There was no evidence for genetic erosion in the small Hällestad population (?25 individuals) relative to the large Åhus population (?5000 individuals). In fact, slightly higher heritabilities were found in the Hällestad population. The additive genetic variance was statistically significant for all traits in both populations, but only a few additive covariances reached significance. The Hällestad population also had higher mean levels and more traits with significant dominance variance than the Åhus population. The variance attributable to maternal effects was too low to be considered significant.

Individuals of six species (A. beccariana, A. crasna, A. filaria, A. hirta, A. malaccensis and A. microcarpa) in cultivation in Indonesia were investigated to assess reproductive phenology, pollination, seed production and germination. Seed production and seedling dispersion were also assessed in natural populations of A. beccariana, A. malaccensis and A. microcarpa in Kalimantan. Most of the selected trees flowered during the dry season, fruits requiring between 36 and 72 days to develop, depending on the species. Twenty different species of insect were recorded visiting flowering trees. The probability of flowers developing into fruit varied between species from 0.04 to 0.43, although flowers from which pollinators were excluded never produced fruit. Seed production of A. malaccensis and A. microcarpa peaked at a dbh of approximately 40 and 50 cm, respectively, individual trees producing up to 19,000 seeds in a single season. Germination under nursery conditions was initiated 7-15 days after sowing; seeds of A. crasna had the highest probability of germination success (92%) whereas those of A. filaria had the lowest (53%). In natural forest, most seedlings (>65%) occurred within 5 m of an adult tree, suggesting limited dispersal. These results indicate that Aquilaria spp. have high reproductive potential, but suggest that seed dispersal might be limited in natural forests.

Experiments were conducted to investigate the duration of pollen viability and the effectiveness of isolation distance for controlling gene flow. Pollen longevity was tested by collecting pollen at dehiscence and exposing it in a thin layer in the open air and sunshine for prescribed time periods before assessing pollen viability by measuring seed set after pollination and scoring visual appearance. Isolation distance efficacy was evaluated by growing 12.8-m2 plot of maize at various distances from a 4000-m2 pollen source. The pollinator contained either a genetic leaf or seed marker that allowed pollen flow to be measured. Pollen maintained viability for 1 to 2 h after dehiscence depending on atmospheric water potential. The theoretical, maximum distance viable pollen could move was 32 km, assuming pollen was transported linearly at the maximum average afternoon windspeeds for our location, viability was maintained for 2 h, and pollen settling rate was ignored. Cross pollinations occurred at a maximum distance of 200 m from the source planting, and only a limited number of cross pollinations occurred at the shortest distance (100 m). No cross pollinations occurred at 300 m from the source planting. The results are consistent with conclusions that maize pollen is desiccation intolerant and has a high settling rate. The results indicate isolation distance can be a useful tool for controlling gene flow via pollination in research scale plantings.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034808595

Water stress imposed during the development of flowers is a major factor increasing the rate of abortion, and long-term or frequent water deficits during this period might decrease yield. The physiological mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. The objectives of this study were (i) to discover whether a water deficit imposed on a soybean genotype IX93-100 prior to anthesis could cause the abortion of the proximal flowers, which are destined to produce seed-bearing pods at a high rate under optimal conditions, and (ii) to determine whether the abortion was due to the impairment of the pistil (ovule) or stamen (pollen) function. Water stress caused by restriction of watering for 3 d during the preanthesis stage significantly increased the abortion of the proximal flowers. The pistils of well-watered plants, pollinated with either stressed or nonstressed pollen, produced pods at a considerable rate, whereas only a small percentage of water-stressed pistils developed into pods, even when crossed with nonstressed pollen. These results suggest that flower abortion caused by a preanthesis water deficit is not attributed to an impairment of pollen, but was probably due to impairment of ovule function.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034808492

Both water and light deprivation, at both stages, decreased kernel set primarily in apical ear regions. Treatments decreased leaf photosynthesis similarly; however, sugar concentrations in reproductive tissues increased in water deficit while they decreased 20 to 50% in shade. During treatments, nonstructural carbohydrate accumulation was nearly halted in both apical and basal florets at the pre-pollination stage, whereas it was decreased to a greater extent in apical than basal endosperm/nucellus at the post-pollination stage. Both water deficit and shade increased ABA concentrations in reproductive tissues, but only at the post-pollination stage was ABA greater in apical than basal ear zones, thus corresponding to effects on kernel set. Treatments did not consistently alter zeatin-like cytokinin concentrations.

To understand the process of anthesis, several variables were observed on five plants of each of five cultivars under greenhouse and growth chamber conditions during the summer of 1994. The efficiency of the crossing technique described was evaluated based on seed set from emasculated but non-pollinated checks, seed set from more than 6400, and percent hybrid plants among 30 F1 plants from each of 21 cross-combinations. During the summer, anthesis of foxtail occurred between 1800 h and 0700 h, starting the third day, after the emergence of the spike. Few flowers opened and there was practically no anthesis between 0800 h and 1800 h. Anthesis initiated at or about one third down the spike and progressed up to the apex and down to the base. Each spike required from 10 to 13 d to complete anthesis. The number of florets opening on the second day averaged 36, which was an optimum for successful emasculation.

However, an unusual mechanism causes asymmetric competition between two species of yucca moths, with the asymmetry being based upon differential retention/abscission of flowers. Flowers containing eggs of yucca moths that oviposit through the carpel wall (= deeps) are more likely to abscise when other flowers on the same plant contain only the eggs of yucca moths that oviposit into the surface of the carpel wall (= shallows). The advantage of shallows over deeps suggests that shallows should be able to invade sites occupied by deeps, and outcompete deeps. However, proportions of deeps and shallows on Yucca kanabensis have been relatively stable for the last 12 years, and shallows have failed to invade sites with only deeps. We examined four factors that could affect the ability of deeps to coexist with shallows. 1) The competitive advantage of shallows over deeps was greatest on plants with intermediate levels of visitation. With low visitation few pollinated flowers abscised, competition was weak, and the differential success of shallows was weak. With high visitation intra- and interspecific competition was strong, but the differential success was low because most flowers received eggs from both deeps and shallows. 2) There was a partial seasonal segregation of deeps and shallows, with deeps emerging earlier than shallows, thereby increasing the probability of some deeps occurring on plants with relatively few shallows. 3) Although independent aggregation of deeps and shallows at the level of plants could promote coexistence by generating plants where deeps encounter few shallows, association of deeps and shallows was positive. 4) Deeps aggregated among flowers within plants much less than did shallows, which decreases the number of flowers with only shallow ovipositions and decreases the opportunity for asymmetric competition.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034802962

I tested the prediction that the presence of a co-flowering plant species influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in five populations. Three contained only conspecifics (I only) and two also contained the co-flowering species Penstemon barbatus (P + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant on corolla length and width differed in both strength and direction between P + I and I only populations. On average, selection on corolla length and width (1) was stronger in P + I than I only populations and (2) was consistently negative in P + I populations, but consistently positive in I only populations. However, these differences in selection on I. aggregata between P + I and I only populations were not caused by interactions for pollination with P. barbatus. Although plants in P + I populations received approximately 31% less conspecific pollen/flower than plants in I only populations, this difference in pollination did not translate into differences in reproductive success, which indicates that P. barbatus and I. aggregata do not strongly compete for pollination. In addition, selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower was not congruent. For example, selection on corolla length via pollen/flower was uniformly positive and did not differ between P + I and I only populations. These data suggest that the presence of P. barbatus does influence selection on floral traits of I. aggregata, but not by influencing pollination. Instead, differences in selection between P + I and I only populations appear to be the result of post-pollination modification of selection by a factor correlated with the presence of P. barbatus.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034802884

Figs also host numerous non-pollinating wasps belonging to other chalcidoid families. We show that six species of Ficus that are passively pollinated by the agaonid genus Waterstoniella also host specific wasps belonging to the chalcidoid genera Diaziella (Sycoecinae) and Lipothymus (Otitesellinae). Both belong to lineages that are considered as parasites of the fig/fig wasp mutualism. We show that these wasps are efficient pollinators of their hosts. Pollen counts on wasps of a species of Diaziella hosted by Ficus paracamptophylla show that Diaziella sp. transports more pollen than the associated pollinator when emerging from its natal fig, Further, the number of pollinated flowers in receptive figs is best explained by the number of Diaziella plus the number of Waterstoniella that had entered it. Figs that were colonised by Diaziella always produced seeds: Diaziella does not overexploit its host. Similarly, figs of Ficus consociata that were colonised solely by a species of Lipothymus produced as many seeds as figs that were colonised only by the legitimate pollinator Waterstoniella malayana. Diaziella sp. and Lipothymus sp. seem to pollinate their host fig as efficiently as do the associated agaonid wasps.

The maple has a steeper gradient on northeastern islands and the bird cherry on the western islands; the values of standard deviation have a similar spatial pattern.

Numerical analysis shows that the system in general evolves towards a time of flowering different from the time favoured by the abiotic environment. The equilibrium towards which the system evolves is a local fitness maximum (an ESS) with respect to mutational variation in flowering time but, for the insect, it can be a local fitness minimum at which selection on mutational variation in the time of insect emergence is disruptive. A consequence of evolutionary convergence to a fitness minimum is that pollinators having an earlier phenology can coexist with pollinators having a later phenology. Since late emerging insects are more likely to encounter and oviposit within previously pollinated flowers, their effect on the plant is more exploitative, leading them to function as cheaters within the system. Thus, in the long term, pollinators and exploiters are likely to be found in stable coexistence in pollinating seed-parasite systems. © 2001 Academic Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035823696

In Brassica self-incompatibility, recognition between pollen and the stigma is controlled by the S locus, which contains three highly polymorphic genes: S-receptor kinase (SRK), S-locus protein 11 (SP11) (also called S-locus cysteine-rich protein; SCR) and S-locus glycoprotein (SLG). SRK encodes a membrane-spanning serine/threonine kinase that determines the S-haplotype specificity of the stigma6, and SP11 encodes a small cysteine-rich protein that determines the S-haplotype specificity of pollen. SP11 is localized in the pollen coat. It is thought that, during self-pollination, SP11 is secreted from the pollen coat and interacts with its cognate SRK in the papilla cell of the stigma to elicit the self-incompatibility response. SLG is a secreted stigma protein that is highly homologous to the SRK extracellular domain. Although it is not required for S-haplotype specificity of the stigma, SLG enhances the self-incompatibility response; however, how this is accomplished remains controversial. Here we show that a single form of SP11 of the S8 haplotype (S8-SP11) stabilized with four intramolecular disulphide bonds specifically binds the stigma membrane of the S8 haplotype to induce autophosphorylation of SRK8, and that SRK8 and SLG8 together form a high-affinity receptor complex for S8-SP11 on the stigma membrane.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035807386

However, the short floral longevity and the production of mostly one inflorescence per plant make its pollination potentially dependent on strong flowering synchrony and on external factors not controlled by the plant (the pollination context). The flowering period in both sites lasted >3 mo. Day-to-day variation in simultaneous antheses was high, and 11-50% of antheses occurred on days during which no pollen donor was present.

In one large population, infructescence initiation was positively related to inflorescence traits; in a smaller population infructescence initiation increased with the number of donor inflorescences. In both sites, percentage of fruits initiated per infructescence was dependent on a combination of inflorescence traits, flowering synchrony, and between-plant distance.

A corollary is that self-pollinating populations are expected to be superior colonizers of mate- and pollinator-scarce environments. The California annual Clarkia xantiana includes outcrossing populations (ssp. xantiana) and autogamously self-pollinating populations (ssp. parviflora). Outcrossing is ancestral, and the subspecies have parapatric distributions with a narrow contact zone. We tested aspects of the reproductive assurance hypothesis by examining geographic and subspecies variation in the densities of mates and pollinators (native bees) and the density dependence of pollinator visitation and pollen receipt. Plant and flower densities, pollinator density, and pollinator visitation rates were lowest in the region of exclusively self-pollinating populations. Pollinator assemblages there lacked Clarkia-associated pollinator taxa that were common elsewhere. Self-pollinating populations in the contact zone generally had densities and visitation rates intermediate between allopatric self-pollinating populations and outcrossing populations. Visitation rate and pollen receipt increased significantly with plant density. These findings suggest that selection for reproductive assurance influenced the origin of self-pollination and/or that reproductive assurance influenced the geographic distribution of self-pollination.

This allocation pattern contrasts with that of Arisaema dracontium, in which 70% of biomass was allocated to scape, considered to be a unilateral fixed cost. The importance of attractive structures in A. italicum was further supported by a disproportionate increased allocation, in larger inflorescences, to the appendix (an attractive structure) compared to fertile flowers. In addition, an increase in inflorescence mass involved a disproportionate increase in mass allocation to male, rather than female, flowers. This pattern also contrasts with a size-related gender change from male to female in Arisaema species.

The species obligatorily relies on pollinators to effect fruit-set and in this study the effect of fragmentation and the presence of the introduced honeybee on fruit-set was examined at two locations. Over two seasons Dillwynia juniperina was not pollen-limited indicating that flowers were saturated with pollen and that adequate bee servicing was occurring. Two native bee species (Leioproctus sp. l and Lasioglossum sp.) and the introduced honeybee, Apis melhfera L., were the most common visitors to flowers. Bee abundance varied between sites with honeybees being more common than native bees at one site. Native bees were never the most dominant pollinator. Visitation data show that native bees spend more time at flowers than introduced bees, although on average honeybees visit slightly more flowers on a bush than do native bees. Visitation data also revealed that native bee presence at bushes is negatively correlated with the presence of honeybees at the same bushes. At one of the study sites, honeybees were very abundant, but very few native bees were ever recorded over the 3 years. Results show that flowers can be pollinated from a single visit by a honeybee or native bee. Extrapolation of visitation data showed that native bees could on their own adequately service flowers in some years at some sites while at other times introduced honeybees may be necessary to augment pollination services. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The least spotted families (top 1/6) were predominantly from the standard, cankered and bark-reaction phenotypes. Resistance of individual seedlings was detected by annual inspection and recording slow-canker-growth responses up to 7 yr post-inoculation. None of the progeny from bulk seedlots or the control exhibited slow canker growth. There was no significant difference among the progeny of the other eight parental phenotypes in the incidence of slow-canker-growth resistance. Of these eight, only normally cankered candidates failed to have any families rank in the top one-sixth for the most slow-canker-growth resistance. However, since the sample size was small for normally cankered, high cankered, and tolerant phenotype, the results are considered preliminarily. Since we consider slow-canker-growth resistance to be most useful, we recommended that future selection programs for parents include relaxed rule bark reaction and no lower branch phenotypes. West.

Although the ovules occur in rocks in which glossopterids are the only gymnosperms represented, there is insufficient evidence to assign them to a taxonomic group.

It has been assumed that, in relatively long styles, competition among genetically diverse pollen grains will be more intense than in relatively short styles. However, very few empirical studies have examined the influence of style length on differences among pollen donors in siring success. We developed a model of pollen tube growth based on measures of in vivo pollen performance and style length of an annual herb (Clarkia unguiculata) to examine the relationship between style length and the percentage of seeds sired by two competing donors with differing pollen performance parameters. We found that there is no increase in the siring success of a superior donor as style length increases under a range of conditions. Moreover, there was a positive relationship between style length and style filtering ability only in styles shorter than those found in wild populations of C. unguiculata, suggesting that variation in style length has little influence on filtering ability in natural populations of this species. We conclude that both male and female reproductive success can be influenced by style length, but under a restricted set of conditions.",Flower morphology; Gametophytic competition; Sexual selection; Style length,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042818388

It is distinctive by its longevity, good growth abilities and by quite a large ecological amplitude in relation to soil moisture. It is a light-demanding tree, which produces fine timber with an interesting colour. Therefore the wild pear should be widely plant not only in the countryside but also in the mixed oak forests. Within the research project of the wild pear variability in Slovak Republic, 21 experimental plots with wild pear were established and 364 pear individuals were evaluated. In the paper the growth of the open pollinated wild pear progenies was evaluated and the purpose was to find differences in the growth abilities of the wild pear progenies from different environmental conditions. During two years height growth of 18 pear provenances was evaluated. Already in the first year statistically significant differences in seedling heights were found between the progenies of different origin. It was possible to identify provenances with significantly different height growth. It was found that sowing in the open seedbeds and transplanting of seedlings at the end of the vegetative period are convenient planting methods for the successful growing of wild pear seedlings.",Height growth; Progeny testing; Provenances; Seedlings; Wild pear,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342624057

Mycorrhizal infection and high soil P conditions significantly increased in vitro pollen tube growth rates but not percentage of germination. In addition, pollen from NMP3 and MPO plants sired significantly more seeds than pollen from NMPO plants in pollen mixture studies. In the second study, plants were grown initially in a greenhouse under two treatment combinations: NMPO and MPO. After all plants began to flower, they were placed in experimental arrays in the field. Under open pollination, pollen from MPO plants sired significantly more seeds than pollen from NMPO plants. This result was primarily attributed to increased flower production (and thus pollen production) in MPO plants. Thus, mycorrhizal infection and high soil P conditions can increase pollen quality (in vitro and in vivo pollen performance) as well as pollen quantity, thereby enhancing fitness through the male function.

Bn-FAE1 gene expression was studied during seed development using two different cultivars: Gaspard, a high erucic acid rapeseed (HEAR), and ISLR4, a low erucic acid rapeseed (LEAR). The mRNA developmental profiles were similar for the two cultivars, the maximal expression levels being measured at 8 weeks after pollination (WAP) in HEAR and at 9 WAP in LEAR. Differential expression of Bn-FAE1.1 and Bn-FAE1.2 genes was also studied. In each cultivar the same expression profile was observed for both genes, but Bn-FAE1.2 was expressed at a lower level than Bn-FAE1.1. Secondly, VLCMFA synthesis was measured using particulate fractions prepared from maturating seeds harvested weekly after pollination. The oleoyl-CoA and ATP-dependent elongase activities increased from the 4th WAP in HEAR and reached the maximal level at 8 WAP, whereas both activities were absent in LEAR. In contrast, the 3-hydroxy dehydratase, a subunit of the elongase complex, had a similar activity in both cultivars and reached a maximum from 7 to 9 WAP. Finally, antibodies against the 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase revealed a protein of 57 kDa present only in HEAR. Our results show: (i) that both genes are transcribed in HEAR and LEAR cultivars; (ii) that they are coordinately regulated; (iii) that Bn-FAE1.1 is quantitatively the major isoform expressed in seeds; (iv) that the Bn-FAE1 gene encodes a protein of 57 kDa responsible for the 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase activity. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present study, development of exineless pollen in the obligately submersed species Callitriche truncata was examined, with particular emphasis on the tetrad stage. Pollen ontogeny occurred rapidly and non-synchronously; tetrads, free microspores, and two-celled pollen grains were identified within the same anthers. Formation of the intine also occurred relatively early, during the tetrad stage. Tetrads were surrounded by a structurally distinct envelope, and its ultrastructure and histochemistry indicate that this callose-like envelope is in a transitional state. Reduction or complete loss of the exine has evolved at least twice in Callitrichaceae, and the new ontogenetic data indicate that exine loss evolves more quickly than the loss of callose.

A surprisingly large amount of variability has been reported in this apomictic crop for traits such as plant height, width, resin, rubber, and latex contents. This study was designed to calculate the proportion of the total measured variability due to the environment and the proportion due to genetic influences within and between three-released germplasm lines. Plant heights were measured at 1, 2 and 3-years-of-age; plant width, and latex contents at 2 and 3-years-of-age; and resin and rubber content at 2-years-of-age. Broad-sense-heritabilities were estimated for each trait and year by dividing the genotypic by the total variance. To estimate the genetic component of the measured variance for each trait, the environment effects (variance from clonally propagated plants) were subtracted from the total variance (variance from open-pollinated (OP) seed propagated plants). In general, the variances of the means for the measured traits were lower in the clonally propagated plants compared with the apomictic OP seed propagated plants. The heritability estimates calculated for each trait differed from year to year. For instance, heritability for plant height was estimated in line AZ-2 to be 0.84 at 1 year of age; 0.47 at 2 years of age; and 0.0 at 3 years of age. These values imply that a large portion of the observed variation in this line is attributed to genetic effects in the first 2 years of growth. As the plant grows over several seasons, the environment effects compound, masking the genetic effects, making effective selection choices more difficult. Heritability for latex content for the same line was estimated to be 0.97 for the second year and 0.55 for the third year. Selections for the measured traits in this study appear to be most effective during the first and second years of growth, with effectiveness diminishing during the third year. Most selections previous to this study were performed between 3 and 5 years of growth, thus suggesting one reason for the lack of significant progress in most breeding programs. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

This strategy allows pollen to be shed before stigmas become receptive, minimizing geitonogamous pollinations and maximizing outcrossing. I studied this condition using Eryngium yuccifolium Michx., a tallgrass prairie perennial species. As a temporaly dioecious species, E. yuccifolium exhibits the following characteristics: 1) an extended pistillate phase, with stigmas becoming receptive only after the anthers have shed pollen and dehisced, 2) synchronized flower heads, 3) numerous flower heads visited by generalist pollinators, and 4) some degree of self-compatibility as indicated by hand pollinations. Finally, results from open and bagged pollinations and high pollen-ovule ratios indicated that the species is xenogamous. This study also found high fruit and seed sets (close to 90%) for E. yuccifolium. However, intense herbivory by the larva of a Gelechiidae moth significantly reduced the reproductive output of the species by destroying 40-60% of flowers and fruits. The results of this study indicate that temporal dioecism can enhance outcrossing and potentially can explain the high fruit and seed set for E. yuccifolium.",Eryngium yuccifolium; Gelechiidae; Herbivory; Pollen-ovule ratios; Prairies; Rattlesnake master; Temporal dioecism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034862579

The aim was to examine the consistency in donor pollen performance across temperatures and to see whether variation in performance was random or due to individual differences in the plastic response to temperature. Pollen tube growth rate in vitro was investigated in two greenhouse temperatures (on the day pollen was collected) and in four germination temperatures. In addition, pollen tube growth rate was assessed in vivo (in one temperature) to examine the relationship between in vivo and in vitro growth. A temperature difference of 5 K - corresponding to natural variation in time and space detected in the field - affected pollen tube growth rate. For both temperature components, significant pollen donor by temperature interactions were found and rank order of pollen donors changed across treatments. Although pollen competitive ability in violets was strongly influenced by both temperature components, the occurrence of pollen donor by temperature interactions indicates that donor siring ability varies with temperature. This, in turn, may suggest a means to maintain pollen competitive ability despite selection for this trait.",Gametophytic selection; Genotype by environment interactions; Phenotypic plasticity; Pollen competition; Pollen tube growth rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034877706

Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been found useful for assigning inbreds to heterotic groups. Our objectives were (i) to determine whether simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers lead to clear groupings of white corn inbreds and (ii) to examine the consistency between SSR groupings and genetic backgrounds of white corn inbreds. We analyzed 18 white corn inbreds derived from five white corn populations (Pride of Saline, Jellicorse, Neal's Paymaster, Johnson County White, and Boone County White), four yellow corn inbreds derived from Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic (BSSS), and six non-BSSS yellow corn inbreds with 82 random SSR marker loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to 11, with an average of five. Single crosses between white corn inbreds from different populations were nearly as diverse as the BSSS × non-BSSS yellow corn single crosses, i.e., the predominant heterotic pattern in yellow corn. Cluster analysis led to five groups of inbreds. The four BSSS inbreds (i.e., B14, B37, B73, and B84) were clustered in one group. But the four other groups comprised yellow and white corn inbreds from different populations. The first three principal components accounted for only 22% of the SSR variation among inbreds. The molecular marker data, therefore, underscored the lack of clear heterotic groupings among inbreds derived from open-pollinated cultivars of white corn. We speculate that white-endosperm conversions of BSSS inbreds could comprise one broad heterotic group, whereas non-BSSS white corn inbreds could comprise an opposite heterotic group.",Alleles polymorphisms; Cluster analysis; Genetic variability; Heterotic groups; Molecular markers; Simple sequence repeats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034878370

Three sites were sampled and all sample trees were also assessed for diameter and wood basic density. Genetic parameters for predicted pulp yield, pulpwood productivity (basic density multiplied by predicted pulp yield) and pulp production index (pulpwood productivity multiplied by tree diameter) were estimated together with the degree and practical importance of genotype by environment interactions for each trait. Predicted pulp yield was under moderate genetic control (h2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.58), pulpwood productivity was under strong genetic control (h2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.84) and pulp production index generally under weak genetic control (h2 ranging from 0.17 to 0.33).

Yuccas and yucca moths are an example of an obligate mutualism in which cheaters are frequently present. Larvae of both pollinators and cheaters eat developing yucca seeds, but cheaters no longer pollinate and rely on the mutualist species for seed availability. In this study we focus on interactions between the cheater Tegeticula intermedia and the pollinator T. yuccasella in fruits of the host Yucca filamentosa. We examined the effect of pollinator and cheater density on larval mass and larval mortality, the effect of fruit mass on larval interactions, and the degree of variability in pollinator-cheater interactions across 3 years. This study was done in a natural population to determine whether these two larval species affect each other under natural conditions. Genetic markers (both protein electrophoresis and DNA sequencing) were used to identify the larvae to species. We found no correlation between larval number and mortality for either pollinators or cheaters. Furthermore, pollinator mass was not correlated with number of cheater larvae per fruit in any year. Mass of cheater larvae was not correlated with number of pollinator larvae per fruit in two of three years; in one year, there was a negative correlation between number of pollinator larvae on mass of cheater larvae only in small fruits. Our results suggest that larval competition between species is weak and asymmetric; when it occurs, cheater larvae incur the cost. The number of cheaters and pollinators per fruit was negatively correlated in two of three years. The lack of a positive correlation in number of cheater and pollinator larvae per fruit may contribute to lowering the potential for seed competition among larvae. In addition, larval density per fruit differed across years by as much as 30%. However, this degree of difference was apparently not enough to cause seed limitation because no effect of pollinator larvae on either mass or mortality of cheater larvae was detected in years with the highest larval densities per fruit. In contrast to the weak effects of pollinator-cheater interactions, fruit mass accounted for much of the variation in number and mass of both pollinator and cheater larvae within and across years. Larger fruits generally had heavier and higher numbers of larvae compared to smaller fruits. Overall, in this population at least within the time period studied, pollinators and cheaters coexisted with little conflict in fruit. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the recent rapid radiation of species in the T. yuccasella complex may be explained in part by the ability of multiple pollinator species (some of whom have become cheaters) to use fruits without severe competition.",Antagonism; Mutualism; Plant-pollinator interactions; Species coexistence; Stability of cheaters,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034890479

The objective of the study was to determine if there were differences in tolerance of two inbred lines (B73 and Mo17) to exposure to brief high temperature treatments (HTTs). Beginning 5 d after pollination (DAP), kernels were exposed to a continuous 35°C temperature for either 4 or 6 d. The effects of HTTs on kernel development, ultrastructure, and sink capacity were evaluated under both in vitro and field conditions. In B73, the 4 and 6 d HTT reduced final kernel dry weights >40 to 60% under in vitro and 79 to 95% under field conditions, compared with the controls. The HTT-induced reduction in kernel mass was due mainly to reduction in starch granule number, since by 16 DAP the endosperm cell number had recovered and was not significantly different from the controls. In contrast, in Mo17 both the number of endosperm cells and starch granules were reduced by >45 to 80% by the 4 and 6 d HTT imposed under the two growing conditions. Hence, these data and kernel ultrastructure evidence confirm that kernel development is more tolerant to high temperature in B73 than in Mo17. The difference appears to be due mainly to the ability of B73 to maintain a higher kernel sink capacity after exposure to HTT during endosperm cell division. Exploiting the differential response of these genotypes appears to be a viable approach to further elucidate the physiological basis for heat tolerance during early kernel development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034891417

DNA endoreduplication has been shown to be negatively affected by high temperature treatments (HTTs) imposed during early kernel development in maize; however, the specific period of endosperm development at which the process is most sensitive to HTT has not been determined. To address this issue, HTTs (4 and 6 d at 35°C) were applied to in vitro-grown maize kernels starting at 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 d after pollination (DAP). Our approach was to isolate endosperms to determine the effect of elevated temperature on endosperm fresh weight (FW), number of endosperm cells, mitotic index, and DNA endoreduplication. The 4-and 6-d HTTs imposed during the mitotic phase of the endosperm cell cycle (4, 6, and 8 DAP) reduced nuclei number and kernel FW, delayed cell division, decreased average DNA content, and reduced the percentage of nuclei in the 24, 48, and 96 C classes (C is the DNA content of a haploid nucleus in maize). In contrast, delaying the imposition of the 4- or 6-d HTTs until 10 or 12 DAP (during the endoreduplication phase of the endosperm cell cycle) did not affect nuclei number, average DNA content, and DNA endoreduplication compared to the control. Thus, HTTs are most deleterious to DNA endoreduplication, endosperm FW, and nuclei number when applied during the mitotic phase of the endosperm cell cycle. These data further show that 4 to 10 DAP is the period during maize endosperm development that is most sensitive to high temperature, and that prolonged exposure restricts entry of mitotic cells into the endoreduplication phase of the cell cycle.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034888950

Pollination limitation was investigated in three Missouri populations of Oenothera macrocarpa, a hawk-moth-pollinated, perennial herb. The populations represented extremes in size and habitat quality. Following supplemental pollination, mean fertilization success (proportion of ovules fertilized) across populations increased from 24.3 to 44.8% and mean seed set (proportion of ovules that matured into seed) increased from 14.7 to 27.9%. These increases were statistically significant in two of the three populations. Failure to achieve 100% fertilization and seed set following supplementation indicates that other factors, in addition to pollination, were limiting to female reproductive success. Fruit set was pollination limited in only one population. Fruits matured with as few as one seed, suggesting that fruit set was not resource limited. The degree of pollination limitation was greatest in the most disturbed population. The population located in the highest-quality habitat was not significantly pollination limited. This suggests that pollination limitation is occurring, at least in part, because of reduced pollinator activity in degraded habitats.",Glades; Habitat fragmentation; Hawk moth pollination; Oenothera; Onagraccae; Pollination limitation; Sphingidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000708215

Among the androecious species reported so far, Castilla elastica (Moraceae) is unique in that flowers are unisexual and staminate and pistillate flowers on cosexual plants are produced on different inflorescences. In addition, inflorescence structure of staminate inflorescences on males and staminate and pistillate inflorescences on cosexes is markedly different. Staminate inflorescences on males are bivalvate, while staminate inflorescences on cosexes are ""fig-like"" and urceolate. Pistillate inflorescences are discoidal. The difference may reflect different roles and requirements of the three inflorescences in pollination and protection from herbivores. This study reports thrips pollination of C. elastica, demonstrated by a pollinator introduction experiment. Thrips pollination of the species may be an example of mutualism originating from plant-herbivore interactions. In the Moraceae, shifts from simple herbivores on flowers to pollinators might have occurred many times, evolving into diverse pollination systems including the fig-fig wasp mutualism.

However, D. barbeyi has multiple, large inflorescences while D. nuttallianum has a single, small inflorescence. These differences in floral display should result in greater intraplant pollen transfer in D. barbeyi, leading to higher rates of self-pollination through geitonogamy. Reduced gene flow by pollen should in turn produce greater population differentiation among populations of D. barbeyi relative to D. nuttallianum. We tested these predictions by comparing pollinator behavior, breeding systems, outcrossing rates, and population genetic structure of sympatric populations of the two species in Colorado. Bumble bee and hummingbird pollinators visit more flowers and inflorescences per foraging bout in D. barbevi than in D. nuttallianum.

Experiments with cultivated plants have shown that water droplets can collect in the centers of flowers of this species. These sometimes draw a sheet of massulae out of an anther sac either onto the surface of the droplet or into its interior. As the droplet evaporates, the massulae are deposited as a continuous layer from the anther sac onto the stigma.

The study took place in Burgundy from 1996 to 1998, during the pollination of the birch (Betula), which is the most important arborean allergen in this region.

These data were analysed by multiple-component analysis. The results show that pollen dispersal is favoured by windy conditions, low relative humidity, precipitation below 2 mm and temperatures above 6°C. Such weather also favours pollinosis, but other particular meteorological situations, even if they do not assist pollen dispersal, can act directly on the development of symptoms: a decrease of temperature (3°C) led to the development of rhinitis and conjunctivitis, while strong winds were associated with many cases of conjunctivitis and asthma, owing to the irritant effect of cold or wind; asthma was favoured by temperature inversions with fog, probably because such weather corresponds to high levels of pollution, which act on bronchial hyperreactivity. Because the weather types favouring pollination and pollinosis are predicted by the meteorological office, this can constitute a tool for reducing the effect of high-risk allergenic days.",Allergenic risk; Betula pollen; Pollinosis; Weather types,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035458481

The system was studied in terms of the seasonal changes in (i) specific composition and abundance of hummingbird pollinators, their hosts, and the nectar robbers, (ii) use of resources by the nectarivorous birds and flowers, and (iii) prevalence of flower piercing by the cinnamon flowerpiercer, Diglossa baritula. The guild consisted of 17 species of hummingbirds, 2 species of nectar robbers, and 21 plant species that were visited by nectarivorous birds (robbers and pollinators). The relative abundance of birds and available flowers showed two peaks, one in winter and the other in the rainy season. Some plant species were used more than expected from their abundance. Overlap in the use of flowers among hummingbirds and also between hummingbirds and the nectar robbers was high.

A BC1 population (N = 792) of a cross between a moderately salt-sensitive Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. breeding line (NC84173, maternal and recurrent parent) and a salt-tolerant L. pimpinellifolium (Jusl.) Mill. accession (LA722) was evaluated for ST in solution cultures containing 700 mM NaCl + 70 mM CaCl2 (electrical conductivity, EC ? 64 dS/m and ?w ? -35.2 bars). Thirty-seven BC1 plants (4.7% of the total) that exhibited the highest ST were selected (referred to as the selected population), grown to maturity in greenhouse pots and self-pollinated to produce BC1S1 progeny seeds. The 37 selected BC1S1 progeny families were evaluated for ST and their average performance was compared with that of the parental BC1 population before selection. A realized heritability of 0.50 was obtained for ST in this population. The 37 selected BC1 plants were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using 115 markers, and marker allele frequencies were determined. Allele frequencies for the same markers were also determined in an unselected BC1 population (N = 119) of the same cross. A trait-based marker analysis (TBA), which measures differences in marker allele frequencies between selected and unselected populations, was used to identify marker-linked QTLs. Five genomic regions were detected on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 11 bearing significant QTLs for ST. Except for the QTL on chromosome 3, all QTLs had positive alleles contributed from the salt tolerant parent LA722. Of the five QTLs, three (those on chromosomes 1, 3, and 5) were previously identified for this trait in another study, and thus were validated here. Only one of the major QTLs that was identified in our previous study was not detected here. This high level of conformity between the results of the two studies indicates the genuine nature of the identified QTLs and their potential usefulness for ST breeding using marker-assisted selection (MAS). A few BC1S1 families were identified with most or all of the QTLs and with a ST comparable to that of LA722.

The system was tested by the elimination of a negative selectable marker, codA, which is flanked by two directly oriented lox sites (&gt;codA&gt;). Highly efficient elimination of &gt;codA&gt; was triggered by introduction of a nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted CRE by Agrobacterium transformation or via pollen. Excision of &gt;codA&gt; in tissue culture cells was frequently accompanied by a large deletion of a plastid genome segment which includes the tRNA-ValUAC gene. However, the large deletions were absent when cre was introduced by pollination. Thus pollination is our preferred protocol for the introduction of cre. Removal of the &gt;codA&gt; coding region occurred at a dramatic speed, in striking contrast to the slow and gradual build-up of transgenic copies during plastid transformation. The nuclear cre gene could subsequently be removed by segregation in the seed progeny.

However, nectar robbers may have played a role in selection acting on corolla length. This study evaluated whether hummingbirds are more likely to rob flowers with longer corollas from which they cannot efficiently extract nectar with legitimate visits. We compared two hummingbird species with similar bill lengths (Lampornis amethystinus and Colibri thalassinus) visiting floral arrays of artificial flowers with exaggerated corolla lengths, and also evaluated how the birds extract nectar rewards from medium to long corollas of three hummingbird-pollinated plants (Salvia mexicana, S. iodantha and Ipomoea hederifolia). The consequences of foraging for plant fitness were evaluated in terms of seed production per flower. Variation in seed production after legitimate visits of hummingbird-pollinated plants was mostly explained by differences in pollinator effectiveness. Seed production did not increase with the number of legitimate visits to a flower, except in I. hederifolia. We found that birds were more likely to rob both artificial and natural flowers with long corolla tubes. Nectar robbing was not observed on short-corolla flowers of Salvia spp., but robbing negatively affected seed production of long-tubed flowers of I. hederifolia. Significant differences between hummingbird species in the use of this behavior were observed, but males and females behaved alike. We suggest that short-billed hummingbirds with enlarged bill serrations (the edge of both tomia finely toothed) may have an advantage in illegitimately feeding at long-corolla flowers. This raises the possibility of counter-selection on increasing corolla length by nectar robbers.",Colibri thalassinus; Corolla length; Lampornis amethystinus; Nectar robbing; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034889098

Both the number of flower-visiting bees and the proportion of flower heads damaged by seed predators increased with landscape complexity, which was measured as the proportion of semi-natural habitats. The mean number of seeds per flower head did not increase with the proportion of semi-natural habitats, presumably because of the counterbalancing effects of pollination and seed predation. For a subset of undamaged flower heads, the number of seeds per flower head was positively correlated with the number of flower visits. Further reasons for the unexpected failure to detect a correlation between landscape complexity and seed set appeared to be changes in flower-visitor behaviour and the contrasting responses of honeybees and wild bees to habitat context. Landscape analyses at eight spatial scales (radius of landscape sectors, 250-3000 m) showed that different groups perceived the landscape at different spatial scales. Changes in pollinator numbers could be explained only at small scales (up to 1000 m), while the seed predators also responded to large scales (up to 2500 m).",Bees; Biotic interactions; Foraging behaviour; Habitat fragmentation; Landscape structure; Spatial scale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035934295

An analysis of variance across the six years' tests confirmed highly significant effect of year and of families; however, the year by family interaction was significant also. Phenotypic and genetic variances estimated from each year's result were fitted to a quadratic regression using their mean survival ratio as an independent variable. The variances were greatest at around 0.5 of the mean survival ratio. Estimated heritability showed a similar trend of change, whereas the peak of the expected amount of improvement shifted toward the lower survival range: around 0.4, where a greater selection differential was anticipated. It was concluded that a useful amount of genetic improvement that may he reduced by 30% due to the interaction, would be expected by prescreening seedlings where the mean survival ratio after inoculation was around 0.25 to 0.6.",Binomial data; Japanese black pine; Pine wilt disease; Resistance breeding; Trend of heritability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035899136

Post-mitotic replication of nuclear DNA (endoreduplication) may also play a role in stress effects. To gain a better understanding of the extent to which cell proliferation and endoreduplication are affected by water deficit, nuclear numbers and size were examined in endosperms of maize (Zea mays L.) by flow cytometry and the transcript levels of genes which have recognized roles in the cell cycle were quantified. Water deficit from 5-13 d after pollination (DAP) decreased the rate of endosperm cell division by 90% and inhibited [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA from 9-13 DAP. The proportion of nuclei engaging in endoreduplication and nuclear DNA content increased steadily from 9-13 DAP in controls, but water deficit initially increased the proportion of endoreduplicating nuclei at 9 DAP, then halted further entry into endoreduplication and S-phase cycling from 9-13 DAP. Transcript levels of ?-tubulin, and the S-phase gene products histone H3 and PCNA were not affected by water deficit until 13 DAP, whereas those of ZmCdc2, a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) with regulatory roles in mitosis, were inhibited substantially from 9-13 DAP. Cell proliferation and associated processes were inhibited at initial stages of the stress episode, whereas endoreduplication and associated S-phase processes were not inhibited until the stress was more advanced.

Although several insertions appeared to be ancient and shared between species, there is strong evidence for recent activity of this element family in both species. Sequences of the regions flanking insertions indicate that all Ac-III transposons segregating in natural populations are in noncoding regions and provide no evidence for local transposition events. Transposon display analysis suggests the presence of slightly higher numbers of insertion sites per individual but fewer total polymorphic insertions in the self-pollinating A. thaliana than A. lyrata. Element insertions appear to be segregating at significantly lower frequencies in A. lyrata than A. thaliana, which is consistent with a reduction in transposition rate, reduction in effective population size, or reduced efficacy of natural selection against element insertions in selfing populations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034924455

The pollination syndrome approach was used because it integrates characteristics of flowers and their pollinators into an evolutionary framework that allowed experimental testing of predictions. The flowers of A. vulgate displayed traits that were typical of both beetle and wind pollination syndromes. The protogynous inflorescences produced heat and odour during nocturnal anthesis, had numerous stamens with copious, light pollen, and were visited by hordes of beetles that used the inflorescences as feeding, mating and oviposition sites. In contrast, some of these features, such as numerous stamens with copious, light pollen, a high pollen to ovule ratio, and no obvious production of visitor rewards, were also typical of the wind pollination syndrome. However, floral rewards appeared to be tissues of the fleshy staminate petals and pollen that were readily devoured by the beetles. In addition to the Coleoptera, insect visitors to A. vulgare inflorescences included several species of Hymenoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera. However, only Nitidulidae and Curculionidae beetles were effective insect pollinators. Pollination treatments showed that wind pollination was possible, but fruit set was significantly higher for female flowers visited by beetles. Although a pollen/ovule ratio of 50 000:1 and outcrossing index confirmed an outcrossing breeding system, pollination experiments suggested that A. vulgate had the potential for self pollination. Therefore, the breeding system might be best classified as facultatively xenogamous (cross fertilizing). The predictive value of potential pollinator agents for A. vulgare was inadequate because its floral traits were indicative of both cantharophilous and anemophilous pollination syndromes.",Anemophilous palm; Cantharophilous palm; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Nitidulidae; Outcrossing index; Pollination syndrome; Xenogamous breeding system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034927196

We analysed the longevity of individual flowers and the effect on pollination success with respect to floral display size of racemes (number of flowers open at one time) for the sequentially blooming plant Narthecium asiaticum (Liliaceae). The longevity of lower- and middle-positioned flowers (about 7 days in 1998 and 6 days in 1999) was much greater than the length of time required for the completion of male (about 3 days) and female (within 3 days) functions. 2. We suggest that such prolonged longevity benefits the plant in terms of pollinator attraction, because prolonged longevity in lower and middle flowers leads to large display sizes of racemes. Increased display size would not have resulted in an increase of geitonogamy in this species, because most pollinators left racemes after probing only one flower. Rather, large displays attracted more pollinators and increased pollen dispersal from individual flowers. 3. The longevity of upper-positioned flowers (about 4 days in 1998 and 3 days in 1999) was less than that of lower- and middle-positioned flowers - almost the same as the length of time required for the completion of male and female functions. This difference is possibly because upper flowers open later within racemes: if there were no subsequent flowers, prolonged floral longevity would not benefit the plants and would only consume resources used to maintain the flower. 4. Floral longevity within inflorescence should be understood in relation to the effects of floral display size and floral positions, in addition to the accrual rates of male and female functions and the maintenance cost of individual flowers.",Display size; Floral longevity; Individual flowers; Inflorescence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034920410

GIC19 expression is temporally and spatially regulated, with transcripts mainly found in growing carpels and young fruit. Similar to GIC19, GIC4 expression is developmentally regulated during carpel and fruit development. However, GIC4 transcripts are found in other growing tissues throughout the plant. Analysis of their sequences and localization of fusion proteins with GFP indicate that both GIC19 and GIC4 are extracellular proteins. While GIC19 is a small proline-rich protein with no overall homology to other reported proteins, GIC4 belongs to a novel family of proteins.

Mammals and birds were censused simultaneously along transects in 'Miombo' woodland or 'Dambo' grassland/mixed woodland, with and without targets. Mammals were also monitored by surveys of their spoor on experimentally cleared plots (5 m in diameter) and a target relocation experiment was conducted when the targets were removed from the test transects and transferred to the controls. Significantly fewer small antelopes (e.g. common Duiker Sylvicapra grimmia) were detected in plots along transects with targets (tests) than along control transects. The presence of targets affected the frequency of occurrence of antelopes, suids and large herbivores in the experimental plots, but small carnivores, monkeys, rodents and hares were unaffected. A conclusion of the relocation experiment was that the deltamethrin-impregnated cloth was responsible for the observed effects and not the acetone.

Franco). Seedlings from 40 open-pollinated families from each population were grown in raised nursery beds and subjected to two soil-moisture regimes (well-watered and mild drought) to evaluate the influence of summer drought on ranking of families for cold hardiness. Artificial freeze testing (AFT) of detached shoots, followed by visual scoring of injury, was used to evaluate needle, stem and bud cold hardiness on three dates in the fall (September, October and November) after the second growing season, and once in the following spring (March). The Cascade population suffered significantly less cold injury than the Coast population in fall AFT. However, in spring AFT the Cascade population was less cold hardy, although population differences were seldom significant. Families within both breeding zones varied significantly in cold hardiness, with mean estimates of individual heritabilities greater in spring (h?i 2 = 0.57) than fall (h?i 2 = 0.37), greater in the Coast (h?i 2 = 0.52) than in the Cascade (h?i 2 = 0.42) population, and greater in the wet (h?i 2 = 0.54) than in the dry moisture regime (h?i 2 = 0.40) (fall means based on October tests). A single test date seems adequate to assess fall cold hardiness, because estimated genetic correlations for cold injury between fall test dates were strong (r?A = 0.80). Genetic correlations between spring and fall cold injury, however, were moderately negative (r?B = -0.66 and -0.21, Coast and Cascade, respectively), indicating that cold hardiness needs to be managed as two traits (i.e. fall and spring cold hardiness). Selection for cold hardiness based on a single shoot tissue is expected to increase cold hardiness in the other tissues as well, because genetic correlations between tissues in cold injury were moderately-to-strongly positive in both fall (r?B = 0.67) and spring (r?B = 0.84). Seedlings grown under summer drought incurred significantly less cold injury in the fall than those that were well-watered; nevertheless, strong genetic correlations in fall cold injury between moisture regimes (r?B= 0.91) indicate that summer moisture conditions had little influence on family rankings for fall cold hardiness. Correlations of injury resulting from a natural frost event in November of the first year with injury from AFT in the fall of the second year (r?A = 0.72 and 0.78 for needle and bud injury, respectively) confirmed that AFT reliably predicts cold hardiness to natural frost events. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Acclimation; Drought; Early testing; Frost hardiness; Genetic variation; Pseudotsuga menziesii,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035426361

The distribution of two chloroplast haplotypes showed that 15 of the 29 populations were polymorphic. Using both nuclear and organelle FST estimates, a pollen to seed flow ratio of 1.43: 1 was calculated.

We examined the effects of abundance on plant-pollinator interactions by observing the pollinator service and subsequent reproductive output of a mostly outbreeding, but self-compatible, plant, Lychnis viscaria, in experimental populations of different sizes (number of individuals) and densities (distance between individuals). 2 Bumblebees, the main pollinators of L. viscaria, preferred larger populations, but visitation rates were higher in sparser populations. Pollinators were attracted to the larger inflorescences in sparse populations, which were also more visible due to their larger area for a given size. 3 Bumblebees probed more flowers within plants in sparse populations, probably due to the larger inflorescences and longer flight distances between individuals. 4 Subsequent reproductive success (capsule production) was higher in sparse populations, due to differences in pollination success and resource competition, and their interaction. In self-compatible species, such as L. viscaria, reproductive success may be determined more by resource availability, whereas self-incompatible plants may be more sensitive to changes in pollinator abundance. 5 We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions are sensitive to changes in both the size and spatial arrangement of plant populations, which can affect their demography and genetics. In this study, species density had a greater effect than size and the unexpectedly beneficial effects of low density may be due to greater resource availability.",Geitonogamy; Habitat fragmentation; Lychnis viscaria; Plant-pollinator interaction; Population density; Population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034914260

The variation of floral sex allocation with flower position within inflorescences was investigated in the spring ephemeral, Corydalis ambigua. Investment in female function (pistil), attraction (corolla) and nectar production decreased from bottom to top flowers, whereas male investment (stamen) did not differ. 2. This self-incompatible species appears to set seeds as a result of visitation by nectar robbing bumblebee queens. The tendency of bees to visit lower flowers first and then move upwards within an inflorescence should result in directional pollen flow from bottom to top flowers. 3. Naturally pollinated upper flowers set fewer seeds than intermediate and lower flowers due to pollen limitation. The lack of differences in seed set and seed mass per pod following artificial outcrossing indicated that resource limitation did not explain the variation in seed production of flowers in different positions. Pollen viability also did not differ significantly between flower positions. 4. A model of pollination was developed that incorporated the visitation pattern of bumblebees and observed variations in nectar distribution between flower positions. This predicted that receipt of outcross pollen would decrease from bottom to top flowers, but that pollen export to other plants would not differ between flower positions provided that the pollen exchange rate of pollinators was either small or positively correlated with nectar content of each flower position. The observed pattern of floral sex allocation would then be parallel to relative success of pollen export and import between flower positions within inflorescences.",Bumblebee pollination; Flower position; Geitonogamy; Pollen flow; Pollen limitation; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034913478

Wind-pollinated progenies, factorial and incomplete diallel mating designs were used to compare two natural populations of Scots pine (Haguenau, France, and Taborz, Poland) and their hybrids (Haguenau × Taborz). Families from Taborz were significantly (P < 0.001) less susceptible to twist rust than those from Haguenau. Inter-population hybrids were as susceptible as the Haguenau population. No clear relationship between severity of infection, shoot length and phenological stage at time of inoculation was observed in intra- and interpopulation crosses. Differences observed between the two natural populations for their response to twist rust are suggested to be the consequence of local adaptation simultaneously for climatic conditions and pathogen pressure. Within each of the two populations, the effects of general combining abilities (GCA) for rust susceptibility were predominant, although estimation of individual heritabilities remained at a moderate level (0.30-0.54). In interpopulation crosses, GCA effects of Haguenau and Taborz populations were still predominant.

T2N 1N4, Canada","Vestigial organs arise commonly during morphological evolution, but they need not be destined for elimination. Instead, vestigial organs may facilitate functional innovation because their freedom from functional constraints allows them to assume novel roles that their functional progenitor could not perform. We illustrate this vestigial transition between functions with an experimental study of the staminode of Penstemon flowers. Previous phylogenetic and developmental studies indicate that this staminode represents a stamen that was lost phenotypically, but not genetically, and then reappeared in the tribe Cheloneae, to which Penstemon belongs. To assess whether the Penstemon staminode has adopted a novel function(s), we compared pollination of flowers with and without staminodes for two bee-pollinated species, P. ellipticus and P. palmeri, and two hummingbird-pollinated species, P. centranthifolius and P. rostriflorus. The staminode acts differently in the two bee-pollinated species. For P. ellipticus, which represents the basal Penstemon lineage, the staminode hinders pollinator access to nectar, which increases visit duration and pollinator contact with sexual organs, thereby increasing pollen receipt by stigmas and controlling pollen removal from anthers. In contrast, in P. palmeri, the staminode acts as a lever that enhances stigma contact with the pollinator, so that staminode removal reduced pollen receipt, but did not affect pollinator attraction, visit duration, or pollen removal. Unlike in bee-pollinated species, staminode removal from hummingbird-pollinated species did not affect any measured aspect of pollination, indicating that the staminode serves no function in this derived pollination system. These results illustrate several features of vestigial organs: loss of function can be temporary; loss of function facilitates the evolution of novel roles; and functional reinvention will often involve only a single role, thus increasing the chance of both secondary loss of function (bird-pollinated penstemons) and functional switches (P. palmeri).",Adaptive radiation; Floral evolution; Functional evolution; Penstemon; Pollen deposition; Pollen removal; Pollination; Staminode; Vestigial organs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034918572

Bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests, yet studies specific to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration and restoration of the rapidly disappearing lowland forests of this region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need for forest bee data at the community level. 2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and Singapore were surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at the below-canopy level. These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed primary lowland dipterocarp forests to late secondary forests and exotic forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted to elucidate the environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees. 3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher in larger primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee species richness was higher in disturbed forests. 4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables closely related to forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as the density of big trees (diameter at breast height 30-40 cm), temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs. 5. More stingless bees (Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger and ambient conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower. 6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban Singapore and primary forests in Johor may indicate that ecological processes in the forests of Singapore, in particular pollination, may be changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact in the primary forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate. 7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term survival of tropical lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study indicates that we urgently need more thorough understanding of pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to be disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests.",Apidae; Ecological processes; Habitat disturbance; Malaysia; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034923472

Male plants produce many short-lived flowers, whereas females produce few flowers that remain connected with the plant after fertilization. We investigated how variation in flower production and flower longevity affects the infection risk for males and females. 3 In glasshouse experiments, we varied the number of flowers inoculated (4 vs. 16 per plant) with spores and the time until these flowers were removed (1 or 2 days for both sexes, 14 days for females only). We also measured the longevity of male flowers receiving simulated visits, with or without spores, to test for an abscission response to visitation and/or contamination. In a field survey, we measured male and female disease prevalence in 17 natural populations. 4 Varying the number of inoculated flowers did not affect infection probability, but females retaining inoculated flowers for 14 days became diseased more often (20.0%) than did plants with flowers removed within 2 days (7.3%). 5 Males that had dropped more inoculated flowers prematurely were more likely to remain uninfected. Spore-bearing visits shortened male flower longevity (38.4±2.8 h) relative to non-spore visits (47.9 ± 5.2 h). 6 Female field disease prevalence (19.7±3.5%) was higher than that of males (14.3 ± 2.6%), especially in populations with a high disease incidence. 7 Continuing physical connection during fruit ripening appears to increase invasion time and thus the per-contact infection risk in females. This is consistent with higher female field prevalences, although other explanations, unrelated to disease transmission, are possible. These results illustrate how interactions between plant reproductive behaviour and pollinator activity may affect disease spread. Female mating behaviour may evolve towards lower attractiveness to pollinators to minimize infectious contacts, while males can afford to be more promiscuous with an attractive, but disposable, floral display.",Flower life span; Mating behaviour; Microbotryum violaceum; Sexual selection; Sexually transmitted disease,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034924302

Eight to 10 open-pollinated progeny arrays of 16 individuals, together with their mother tree, were sampled per population. Mating system parameters were estimated under the mixed mating model, implemented by the software MLTR. The single-locus outcrossing rate (ts) varied among loci and populations, but multilocus outcrossing rates (tm) were equal to one for all four populations. Nevertheless, biparental inbreeding (tm - ts) was different from zero for all populations, indicating that outcrossing events may occur between relatives. Our results also indicate that the high polymorphism of microsatellite markers provide an extraordinary resolution to discriminate precisely selfing events from outcrossing events between close relatives. Our results indicate that, although highly outcrossed, C. brasiliense shows high levels of biparental inbreeding, most likely due to the limited flight range of pollinators and restriction in seed dispersal.

I examined the pollination and fruit set of a common shrub, Bourreria succulenta, after hurricanes on San Salvador island, Bahamas. Contrary to the assumption of resource limitation, B. succulenta showed unusually prolific flowering after Hurricane Lili stripped leaves from most of the plants in October 1996. I predicted that the abundant flowering would saturate pollinators and that fruit set would be pollination-limited. Fruit set was strongly pollination-limited by 71 percent. Butterflies are probably the major pollinators and were present at the site, but they rarely visited B. succulenta flowers even though flowers were brimming with nectar. Nectarivorous birds (Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars) visit B. succulenta flowers, but their populations were decimated by Hurricane Lili and they rarely visited flowers during this time. Fruit set was also severely predation-limited; a moth caterpillar (Gelechiidae) was extremely abundant and ate buds, flowers, and fruits, causing a further 68 percent reduction in fruit set. Together, pollination limitation and predation limitation reduced fruit set to only 7 percent or less. Predation was also intense in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd and resulted in 11 percent fruit set or less. Whether or not hurricanes were the cause of limited pollinators or abundant predators, the resulting low fruit set could have population effects because hurricanes can provide opportunities for the recruitment of new plants. These results emphasize that understanding plant-animal interactions may be necessary for predicting the effects of hurricanes on plant reproductive success, which may affect subsequent recruitment. Species on small islands like San Salvador (150 km2) with relatively few species may be especially vulnerable to environmental disturbances such as hurricanes.",Bahamas; Bourreria; Flower predation; Fruit predation; Fruit set; Hurricane effets; Island pollination; Plant-animal interactions; Pollination limitation; Scrublands,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034960403

It is produced in upper and lower lobes of petals by enzymatic methylation of benzoic acid in the reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT). To identify the location of methylbenzoate biosynthesis, we conducted an extensive immunolocalization study by light and electron microscopy at cellular and subcellular levels using antibodies against BAMT protein. BAMT was immunolocalized predominantly in the conical cells of the inner epidermal layer and, to a much lesser extent, in the cells of the outer epidermis of snapdragon flower petal lobes. It was also located in the inner epidermis of the corolla tube with little BAMT protein detected in the outer epidermis and in the yellow hairs within the tube on the bee's way to the nectar. These results strongly suggest that scent biosynthetic genes are expressed almost exclusively in the epidermal cells of floral organs. Immunogold labeling studies reveal that BAMT is a cytosolic enzyme, suggesting cytosolic location of methylbenzoate biosynthesis.

Isozyme markers have been used to study the multilocus outcrossing rate in five cultivars under field conditions and in two locations. The study was carried out at Córdoba (Spain) and at Rennes (France). These two locations were chosen because previously studies showed strong differences in cross-pollination. Multilocus outcrossing rates at both locations, Córdoba and Rennes, were 0.65 and 0.33 respectively. Local differences in pollinator abundance and foraging activity were 26 and 32 times higher, respectively, at Córdoba than at Rennes which could explain an outcrossing rate twice at Córdoba compared with Rennes. So, pollinators may play a prominent role in determining the differences in outcrossing between locations. However, at a local level, there is a highly significant positive correlation between foraging activity and outcrossing only at Rennes (where the number of pollinators is scarce) but not at Córdoba (where pollinators are abundant). We suggest that although pollinators have a major impact on the level of outcrossing, in circumstances where there are a lot of pollinators the differences in outcrossing between cultivars depends on other factors among which is the ability of the genotype itself to outcross. No type of floral display seems to be clearly important in the determination of the outcrossing level in such a case. The implication of our results for faba bean breeding strategies is discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034953353

Urea-soluble proteins both from bulked samples (20 seeds) of particular cultivars, and samples which were obtained by mixing together cultivars of each species were extracted. To estimate the outcrossing rate, the proteins were extracted from each of 100 seeds of cultivar A10 (A. caudatus). In this case seeds were collected both from isolated inflorescences and from flowers exposed to open-pollination. The electrophoretical separations of proteins (SDS-PAGE) were performed. The protein pattern of 56-64 bands was detected. The samples were classified to three groups: 1- A. caudatus and A. cruentus, 2- A. tricolor and A. mantegazzianus and 3- A. hypochondriacus, A. hypochondriacus x A. hybridus and A. paniculatus. All species can be distinguished from each other. The protein pattern of A. tricolor (leafy type of amaranths) is considerably different from other species. The present study suggests a closer similarity between A. caudatus and A. cruentus than between the pairs of species A. hypochondriacus / A. caudatus and A. hypochondriacus / A. cruentus. Only small differences were seen between cultivars, nevertheless they were sufficient for distinguishing all the cultivars. It is possible to detect outcrossing between cultivars, by observing that 30% of 'A10' seeds performed other patterns of proteins.

The fwf mutant is fertile and has normal plant growth and stature. It sets fertile seed following self-pollination and fertilization needs to be prevented to observe parthenocarpy. The initiation of parthenocarpic siliques (fruit) was found to be dependent upon carpel valve identity conferred by FRUITFULL but was independent of the perception of gibberellic acid, shown to stimulate parthenocarpy in Arabidopsis following exogenous application. The recessive nature of fwf is consistent with the involvement of FWF in processes that inhibit fruit growth and differentiation in the absence of fertilization. The enhanced cell division and expansion in the silique mesocarp layer, and increased lateral vascular bundle development imply FWF has roles also in modulating silique growth post-fertilization. Parthenocarpy was inhibited by the presence of other floral organs suggesting that both functional FWF activity and inter-organ communication act in concert to prevent fruit initiation in the absence of fertilization.",Arabidopsis thaliana; Asymmetric cell division; Auxin; Carpel; Fertilization; Gibberellin; GRAS gene; Ovule; Parthenocarpic fruit development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034932791

An objection to the existence of selection on pollen competitive ability is that individual variation should quickly vanish if selection is strong. A balance between selection for local adaptation of sporophytes within sites and pollen flow between sites could maintain variation in pollen competitive ability. A prerequisite is that variation in male competitive ability is condition dependent, i.e., influenced by sporophytic adaptation to a patch. This further means that selection on pollen competitive ability can occur both directly on the gamethophytic level and indirectly on the sporophytic level. Our dynamic model shows that maintenance of variation in male competitive ability is more probable when differences in pollen competitive ability influence male fitness, i.e., in cases with pollen competition, than when differences in this trait only is a side effect of selection for more viable individuals. Since there is a connection between the gamethophytic and sporophytic life-phases, the incidence of pollen competition between donors should make it more probable that variability also in sporophyte fitness is preserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034929248

Such plants profit from their similarity to rewarding plants and should develop signals that hinder discrimination. We use artificial rewarding model flowers and nonrewarding mimicking flowers that present similar visual cues. We test how additional scent cues change flower choice of the mimic by bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) in two situations: (1) both flower types are simultaneously present and can be compared by the pollinator, and (2) both flower types are encountered successively in the absence of each other. We find that in situation 1, discrimination learning is greater if scents are used as cues for identifying the mimic, whether the mimic has a different scent or if it is scentless while the model is scented. In situation 2, a generalization task, a scented mimic is avoided faster than a scentless one. Discrimination of the mimic is poorest if it has the same scent as the model, thus demonstrating a potential for scent mimicry, which has not yet been proved to exist among differently rewarding flowers. Thus, the best strategy for a mimic would be to have the same scent as the model, but this strategy may not be used due to evolutionary constraints. Alternatively, if there are several potential models, then having no scent would be a better strategy than mimicking just one of the models. In situation 1 flower discrimination by color cues is enhanced in the mere presence of scent, compared to unscented controls, even if the scent does not provide a distinguishable cue itself.

In a 4-year study, we evaluated relationships among stand density, pollen availability, and seed production in a thinned and fragmented population of blue oak (Quercus douglasii). Geographic coordinates were established and flowering interval determined for 100 contiguous trees. The number of neighboring trees within 60 m that released pollen during each tree's flowering period was calculated and relationships with acorn production explored using multiple regression. We evaluated the effects of female flower production, average temperature, and relative humidity during the pollination period, and number of pollen-producing neighbors on individual trees' acorn production. All factors except temperature were significant in at least one of the years of our study, but the combination of factors influencing acorn production varied among years. In 1996, a year of large acorn crop size, acorn production was significantly positively associated with number of neighboring pollen producers and density of female flowers. In 1997, 1998, and 1999, many trees produced few or no acorns, and significant associations between number of pollen-producing neighbors and acorn production were only apparent among moderately to highly reproductive trees. Acorn production by these reproductive trees in 1997 was significantly positively associated with number of neighboring pollen producers and significantly negatively associated with average relative humidity during the pollination period. In 1998, no analysis was possible, because too few trees produced a moderate to large acorn crop. Only density of female flowers was significantly associated with acorn production of moderately to highly reproductive trees in 1999. The effect of spatial scale was also investigated by conducting analyses with pollen producers counted in radii ranging from 30 m to 80 m. The association between number of pollen-producing neighbors and acorn production was strongest when neighborhood sizes of 60 m or larger were considered.

Instead of fluid nectar the flowers produce sweet gelatinous secretion in form of pellets. The glandular complex of the flower is composed of the inner wall of the receptacle and its tubular extension, being equivalent to the nectariferous disk of the nectar-producing species within the genus. The jelly is produced at night, contains mannan and is imbibed by free hexoses. It originates by swelling and disintegration of the inner wall, after contact with the nectar generated concomitantly in the mesophyll. Combretum lanceolatum is unique within the genus in its production of jelly pellets instead of liquid nectar. A new term, the jelly-flower, is proposed for flowers with this kind of reward. The pellet is not replaced once removed by a bird, and thus resembles a fruit in its availability to consumers, another unique feature that distinguishes this species within the genus. The jelly pellets offered by the many flowered branches attract a great diversity of bird visitors (28 species from eight families), which feed on this copious food resource and pollinate the flowers. The most effective pollinators probably are thrushes, tanagers, and orioles. Flocking parakeets and macaws sometimes feed on the petals, thus acting as flower plunderers. Combretum lanceolatum presents a high fruit set under natural conditions, which likely favours its spreading and becoming a weed species.",Bird pollination; Combretum lanceolatum; Floral biology; Floral reward; Gelatinous nectar; Jelly-flower; Neotropical flora; Pollination ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034935834

Improved populations of well-chosen diverse germplasm (domestic or foreign) can serve as alternative sources of inbred lines for hybrid maize improvement. Our research objective was to evaluate the direct, indirect, and correlated responses of inbred progeny selection in two U. S. domestic maize landraces. Three cycles of S 1-S 2 recurrent selection were performed in Leaming and Midland Yellow Dent, two open-pollinated varieties. S 0 (F = 0) and S 1 generations (F = 0.5) were evaluated in five Iowa environments. Response to selection was effective in both varieties. For grain yield, average increases cycle -1 of selection of 0.28 Mg ha -1 (10.1%) in Leaming and of 0.22 Mg ha -1 (14.9%) in Midland Yellow Dent were highly significant (P ? 0.01). Favorable correlated responses were observed in other agronomic traits. Root lodging decreased 7.0% cycle -1 in Midland Yellow Dent, while stalk lodging decreased 3.8% cycle -1 (P ? 0.01) in Leaming. S 1-S 2 recurrent selection improved both populations, suggesting an adequate balance between the selection among S 1 and S 2 progenies.

However, maize breeders rarely consider the genetics of pollen yield and pollen yield components. The objectives of this study were to: (1) compare the magnitude of response of yield and yield components of pollen and grain and (2) evaluate heterosis and gene action relationships. Four inbred lines were used. Two were poor pollen producers (Corn Belt lines Hex301 and Wf9) and two were good pollen producers (exotic lines Nex306 and LN9638). The inbred lines, the F 1s and their reciprocals, and the F 2s were planted on an early and late planting date in 1995. Number of total male flowers per plant, number of flowers per tassel branch, flowers in a central spike, and tassel branch number were considered as pollen yield components. Ear length, rows per ear, kernels per row, and kernels per ear were considered as grain yield components. The amount of pollen from both crosses had increases that should be sufficient to ensure complete pollination. The Corn Belt single cross Hex301 × Wf9 expressed good combining ability for pollen yield with a heterosis value of 328%, whereas, grain yield had a heterosis value of 129%. The exotic single cross of Nex306 × LN9638 had heterosis values of 131% for pollen yield and 250% for grain yield. Dominance gene effects were the more important contributors to inheritance of most of the pollen and grain components. Information from this study guides understanding of the relative importance of genetic effects and the need to obtain specific genetic information about the inbred lines used as parents, especially with respect to pollen. Presence of both additive and nonadditive genetic effects indicate the need for additional genetic studies to develop appropriate breeding methodologies.",Additive and dominance effect; Corn; Heterosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034929840

The main purposes of this study were to determine the main factors that affected reproductive success and whether these factors were influenced by differences in the two contrasting microhabitats. In both microhabitats, fruit set was low, and seed abortion rates were very high. Lithosol plants were larger and had higher flower, fruit, and seed production than rock plants. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the effects of plant size, phenological variables, competition, and flowering synchrony on fecundity and to compare path coefficients among microhabitats. In both microhabitats reproductive success was strongly predicted by plant size and to a lesser extent by flowering synchrony. Flowering moment and intensity did not have a significant effect on fruit set, suggesting that pollinator availability is not a limiting factor in total seed production. This was further corroborated by hand-pollination experiments. Resource limitations, inbreeding depression, and environmental restrictions may be responsible for the high rates of seed abortion. Multisample comparison of path coefficients for the two microhabitats rejected the possibility that reproductive patterns could be described by one single model. The main divergences in both microhabitat models were related to competition. Reproductive data from 1995, a year with below-average rainfall, showed remarkably lower seed production at the lithosol microhabitat and similar values at the rock microhabitat as compared to 1996. The variation of the reproductive parameters between the two years was evaluated by multisample analyses in which 1995 data were fed into the 1996 models. At the lithosol microhabitat, two constrained paths involving seed production produced a significant decrease in fit, whereas at the rock microhabitat, significant differences were found in three paths involving only phenological variables. Thus, the lithosol microhabitat may contribute to greater seed production in favorable years while the rock microhabitat may provide more stable conditions over time.",Erodium paularense; Female reproductive success; Microhabitat variability; Path analysis; Structural equation modeling; Threatened plant conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034952479

Entomophilous plants of H. pogonocalyx are mostly pollinated by honeybees. Gene flow between populations is constrained by the migratory capacity of the pollinators. A survey based on RAPD fingerprinting using 50 random primers revealed the distribution of genetic variation following an ""isolation by distance"" model. A hierarchical AMOVA analyses indicated significant differentiation between geographical regions (?ct = 0.934; P = 0.048), among populations (?st = 0.945; P &lt; 0.001), and among populations within region (?sc = 0.169; P &lt; 0.001).

These areas support a distinctive flora with numerous uncommon or rare endemic species. I studied the reproductive ecology of two endemic plant species on large and small serpentine outcrops. The perennial herb, Calystegia collina, exhibited significantly lower reproductive success on small outcrops, partly because compatible pollen was not available from other, nearby populations. Local populations are more likely to produce seeds, and therefore potential colonists, when they occur in clusters of populations. Number of alleles and average heterozygosity were not significantly different between C. collina patches in small versus large outcrops. Vegetative reproduction enables small patches to persist for many years and apparently maintains genetic diversity despite low levels of seed production. Pollinators and insect herbivores of C. collina were not significantly less numerous on small outcrops than on large outcrops, suggesting that species interactions are not directly responsible for reproductive failure on small outcrops. The annual herb, Helianthus exilis, was entirely absent from small outcrops. This locally distributed serpentine endemic is restricted to moist seeps, a specialized microhabitat found only within large serpentine outcrops. Transplant experiments showed that H. exilis survives poorly or not at all outside these narrow conditions. Results from these investigations illustrate the need to protect serpentine landscapes that contain multiple local populations and the full range of microhabitats that are inhabited by serpentine endemic plants. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",Endemic plants; Habitat fragmentation; Patchy population; Pollination ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034957803

The species is self-incompatible, pollinated by generalist insects and produces two different types of achene in the capitula: peripheral and central achenes. Peripheral achenes are heavier (1.63 mg) and exhibit virtually no pappus and short-range dispersal, whereas central achenes are lighter (0.45 mg), possess a well-developed pappus and are produced in greater numbers. The morphological differences between the two types of achene result in differences not only in dispersal, but also in germination, seedling vigour and the ability of seedlings to emerge from different achene burial depths. Central achenes germinate more rapidly and in higher proportions under a broad spectrum of conditions. On the other hand, germination in peripheral achenes is much more restricted, partly as a result of their thick pericarp; a high proportion of this type of achene does not germinate and remains in a dormant state on the ground, forming a temporary seedbank. Because of the increased size of the embryo, seedlings from peripheral achenes can emerge from greater depths and are initially more vigorous than those from central achenes. Central achenes represent a strategy that facilitates settling in new areas; peripheral achenes represent a strategy that ensures in situ persistence. These biological characteristics are advantageous for colonizing species.",Dimorphic achenes; Germination; Leontodon longirrostris; Weed biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034956276

Pollen tubes are easily visualized by staining with decolorized aniline blue, a stain specific for callose. We identified a mutant, raring-to-go, in which pollen grains stained for callose before anther dehiscence. When raring-to-go plants are transferred to high humidity, pollen tubes dramatically elongate within the anther. As early as the bicellular stage, affected pollen grains in raring-to-go plants acquire or retain water within the anther, and precociously germinate. Thus, the requirement for contact with the female is circumvented. We used pollen tetrad analysis to show that raring-to-go is a gametophytic mutation, to our knowledge the first gametophytic mutation in Arabidopsis that affects early events in the pollination pathway. To aid in identifying raring-to-go alleles, we devised a new technique for screening pollen in bulk with decolorized aniline blue. We screened a new M 1 mutagenized population and identified several additional mutants with a raring-to-go-like phenotype, demonstrating the usefulness of this technique. Further, we isolated other mutants (gift-wrapped pollen, polka dot pollen, and emotionally fragile pollen) with unexpected patterns of callose staining.

In this work, we present data to address two of the competing hypotheses that fuel this controversy. In particular, we examine the relationship between the presence of web decorations and spider survivorship (predator-protection hypothesis) and the relationship between the presence of prey and spider decorating behavior (the prey-attraction hypothesis). Our laboratory studies reveal that the decorating behavior of the spider A. argentata has a genetic component but that the expression of decorating behavior tends to be elicited only when a spider is well fed. Furthermore, our field studies show that in the presence of abundant stingless bees, spider decorating behavior is induced. Nevertheless, our field surveys also suggest that spiders that decorate their webs show reduced survivorship. We propose that the high correlation between web decorating in the presence of stingless bees supports the hypothesis that A. argentata engage in decorating behavior when attracting or targeting specific prey types. However, we also propose that web decorations attract the predators of A. argentata because high-frequency decorators suffer lower survivorship than spiders that decorate moderately or rarely. These findings suggest that spider web decorating behavior is affected by conflicting selection pressures: the positive effect of prey attraction versus the negative effect of predator attraction. Due to the heritable component of decorating behavior, web decorating among A. argentata is likely to be particularly sensitive to the spider's local ecology as well as local patterns of gene flow.",Bees; Lineage effects; Pollinator; Polymorphism; Spider; Survivorship; Web decoration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034978734

Unfortunately, the fertility and function of ovules formed on bisexual cones of Gnetales have remained unclear. Some reports indicate that the ovules are sterile while others indicate that they may develop into seeds. This study demonstrates three different developmental patterns of ovules formed on bisexual cones of Gnetum gnemon. Type I ovules did not develop at all after pollination and represented the majority of ovules on each cone. Type II ovules enlarged slightly after pollination due to the enlargement of nucellar tissue. Type III ovules were typically found on the terminal whorl and developed into seed-like structures. The enlargement was due to proliferation of megagametophyte tissue. Sectioned material revealed that megagametophytes show altered development compared to those found in functional female ovules. None of the ovules studied contained embryos, and thus all were sterile.

This is associated with increased ethylene production and early epinasty. These effects are also produced by application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) on the stigma. Pollen (one anther each) from Ruellia tuberosa L. (Acanthaceae) and Caesalpinia pulcherrima (L.) Sw. (Fabaceae) also increased ethylene production and caused early epinasty and fading. Pollen of Hibiscus schizopetalus (Mast.) Hook.f. (Malvaceae), in contrast, had no effect. R. tuberosa pollen increased ACC concentration and ACC synthase activity of the orchid flowers. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) pretreatment prior to R. tuberosa pollination prevented early fading, epinasty and the increase in ethylene production. It also prevented the increase in ACC concentration, and ACC synthase activity. Ovary growth was stimulated by Dendrobium 'Pompadour' pollinia, not by any of the incompatible pollen. Applied ACC did not promote ovary growth. It is concluded that incompatible pollen can hasten senescence and epinasty by increasing ACC synthase activity and ethylene production.

Many rare plant species are restricted to small isolated populations in which fitness may be reduced because of inbreeding, environmental and demographic stochasticity, and reduced pollination. However, specialist herbivores are less likely to be present in such populations because of higher probabilities of herbivore extinction and lower rates of colonization, and may therefore affect fitness only in larger plant populations. 2. We studied the relationships between the size of populations of the endangered grassland plant Gentiana cruciata and the probability of occurrence and population size of its specialist herbivore, the endangered butterfly Maculinea rebeli, and their effects on plant size, fruit herbivory and seed production. 3. The 29 G. cruciata populations studied ranged in size from 1 to 337 genets and 18 of them supported a M. rebeli population. M. rebeli populations were both more likely and larger in larger G. cruciata populations. Estimated adult herbivore populations were small, ranging from 1 to 42 individuals, with a median of 11. We conclude that the conservation of M. rebeli requires the conservation of large G. cruciata populations. 4. Although large populations of G. cruciata produced more flowers, a greater proportion of their fruits were attacked by herbivores. Fruit herbivory, which considerably decreased the number of seeds per fruit, appears to have been caused largely by Maculinea. The number of seeds both per fruit and per genet significantly decreased with the number of M. rebeli eggs per genet. The overall independence of G. cruciata seed production from population size may result from the opposing effects on fruit production and herbivory. 5. Our study suggests that complex interactions between different trophic levels may determine the population dynamics of rare species. Furthermore, small population size may have both negative and positive effects on the fitness of endangered species.",Biotic interactions; Conservation biology; Habitat fragmentation; Herbivory; Population size; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034967503

In flowering plants the balance between sexual and clonal, asexual reproduction can vary widely. We quantified variation in sexual reproduction in a tristylous, clonal, aquatic plant, Decodon verticillatus, and investigated the role of ecological and genetic factors in causing this variation. 2. We surveyed components of sexual fertility and vegetative growth in 28 populations distributed along a 500-km latitudinal transect in New England, USA. Northerly populations tend to be monomorphic (M) for style length, and probably therefore have reduced sexual reproduction compared with southerly, trimorphic (T) populations. 3. Compared with T populations (n = 10), M populations (n = 18) exhibited large reductions for all components of sexual reproduction, including flower production, pollen deposition, pollen tube growth, fertilization, fruit set and seeds per fruit. Seven M populations produced no seed at all, and the other 11 very little (mean = 24 vs. 1139 seeds per plant in trimorphic populations). Clonal propagation was also greatly reduced in M populations. 4. A survey of three polymorphic allozyme loci detected only single, usually heterozygous, genotypes in 15 M populations, whereas all T populations were genotypically diverse. The other three M populations contained three or fewer genotypes and one always predominated. Sexual recruitment is therefore extremely rare. 5. Comparison of the sexual fertility of M and T populations in a concurrent common glasshouse experiment with our field data revealed that reduced sexual performance in northern M populations is principally due to genetic factors, but is also caused by ecological factors that covary with latitude. 6. This abrupt shift away from sexual reproduction in populations at the northern periphery of the geographical range in D. verticillatus may greatly limit their evolutionary potential and restrict further northward expansion.",Clonal reproduction; Genotypic diversity; Peripheral populations; Pollination; Sexual sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034978857

The objective was to identify germplasm that could consistently express and transmit enhanced fiber strength to their progeny.

Its biosynthesis originates from L-aspartate- -semialdehyde and requires three enzymes: L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid aminotransferase (gene: ect B), L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid acetyl transferase (ect A) and L-ectoine synthase (ect C). Transgenic tobacco lines expressing the three genes, cloned from Marinococcus halophilus, were generated. HPLC, MS and NMR, indicated variation in amounts of ectoine in the transgenic lines ranging from 0.25 to 25 nmol/g fresh weight. Ninety-eight to one hundred percent seeds of T1 generation of both transgenic and SR1 progenitors germinated at NaCl concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 mM in the growth medium. Growth of transgenic seedlings was enhanced at all additional NaCl concentrations as compared to SR1 progenitor lines. Forty to forty-five percent germination at 250 and 25-30% germination at 300 mM NaCl in the growth medium, was seen in transgenic lines as compared to 2% germination at 250 mM and absence of germination at 300 mM NaCl of SR1 controls. Leaves of the seedlings growing at these NaCl concentrations were bleached and deformed. Transfer of these seedlings to media having 100 and 200 mM NaCl, 20 weeks after germination restored growth in 90% of the trans-genic seedlings. Cation and amino acid analyses indicated higher amounts of Na+K+Ca2+Pro, Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Ser and Thr in the transgenic seedlings in concert with increasing NaCl concentrations as compared to controls.

We used the maize (Zea mays) floury-2 (fl2) mutant and soybean (Glycine max) suspension cultures treated with tunicamycin (Tm) to investigate the ER stress response as it relates to phospholipid metabolism in plants. Four key phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, including DG kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-phosphate 5-kinase were up-regulated in the fl2 mutant, specifically in protein body fractions where the mutation has its greatest effect. The third up-regulated enzyme, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, was regulated by fl2 gene dosage and developmental signals. Elevated accumulation of the fourth enzyme, PI 4-kinase, was observed in the fl2 endosperm and soybean cells treated with Tm. The activation of these phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes was accompanied by alterations in membrane lipid synthesis and accumulation. The fl2 mutant exhibited increased PI content in protein body membranes at 18 d after pollination and more than 3-fold higher triacylglycerol accumulation in the endosperm by 36 d after pollination. Incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into phospholipids in soybean culture cells increased by about 30% with Tm treatment.

In contrast, the transcript levels of Phal-ACS2 and Phal-ACS3 induced by OA were much lower than those induced by pollination. Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, on the other hand, inhibited the OA-induced Phal-ACS1 expression in the stigma and delayed flower senescence.

Earlier reports had indicated that S. caseolaris flowered for one night and was exclusively night-pollinated. But flowers of this species were found to be in bloom both at night and during the day, and diurnal visitors to the flowers were more diverse and frequent than nocturnal ones. This was related to the higher volume and energy value of nectar in the morning. The effects of time of day and temperature on visitation rates were quantified. The importance of visitors to plant reproductive success was investigated via controlled visitor-exclusion experiments. Pollinators were expected to be more important for the outcrossing species than for the selfing species, and this was confirmed by the results of the exclusion experiments.

Heterophragma quadriloculare is a self-incompatible hermaphroditic tree solely pollinated at night by the carpenter bee Xylocopa (Mesotrichia) tenuiscapa Westwood, whose pollinating flights were lunar insensitive and unaffected by low nighttime temperatures (2-14°C). The number of carpenter bees visiting a tree per minute and the number of flowers visited per foraging bout were positively related to the size of the floral display.

To assess resident hummingbird use of forest fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station in southwestern Costa Rica, we mist-netted birds in five fragments (0.3-20 ha; ca 1300 m elev.) and the station's 226-ha forest preserve (ca 900-1280 m elev.). From January 1994 through mid-March 1999, we recorded 1069 captures of 21 hummingbird species during 49,900 net hours. Species richness, diversity indices, and capture rates increased asymptotically with patch size, as expected. We captured 16 hummingbird species in both the largest fragment (20 ha) and in the nearby forest preserve. Non-forest hummingbirds did not occur more frequently in the fragments than in the preserve, and all fragments supported a mixture of forest-interior and canopy-dwelling hummingbird species, along with a diverse group of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Phaethornis guy was common at all sites and visited ?13 plant species in the fragments during the 1998 dry season (based on analyses of pollen collected from the birds' heads). In contrast, Eutoxeres aquila was found at only the largest three sites (10, 20, and 226 ha) and carried pollen from only one plant species during the 1998 dry season. Lampornis castaneoventris, a high-elevation hummingbird species, was far more common in the fragments than in the preserve, while three species typically found at lower elevations were rare in the fragments and common in the preserve. These distribution patterns could be influenced by local climatic differences because the fragments are higher and receive more cloud mist and annual precipitation than the preserve. Our data show that pollen loads on hummingbird species vary, and this has implications for gene flow among hummingbird-pollinated plants. Although our results are consistent with previous reports that hummingbird species may be less affected by deforestation than insectivorous avian species such as army ant followers, it is important to note that from the perspective of the genetics and demographics of hummingbird-pollinated plants, the important issue is whether appropriate pollinator species are able to move plant propagules among subpopulations of plants in fragmented landscapes. We conclude that the biodiversity of tropical forest fragments as small as 10 to 20 ha is high enough to warrant long-term preservation of these areas, especially if they are located near larger tracts of forest.",Biodiversity; Cloud forest; Costa Rica; Hummingbirds; Pollination; Pre-montane; Rain forest; Species diversity; Tropical forest fragments,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034980828

Previous work carried out in our laboratory showed that 7S globulins accumulate in the oil palm zygotic embryo mostly between the 14 and 17 weeks after pollination. To investigate further the regulation of 7S globulin gene expression in both zygotic and somatic embryos of oil palm, we isolated a cDNA clone, GLO74, for use as a probe in northern hybridization studies. The nucleotide sequence of the GLO7A cDNA reveals that it encodes a polypeptide of 572 amino acids (66 kDa) sharing significant sequence similarities with various vicilin-like proteins of both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. Northern hybridization analysis shows that 7S globulin mRNA accumulation in zygotic embryos is temporally regulated with a profile essentially the same as that observed at the protein level. In somatic embryos, 7S globulin proteins were found to occur in amounts approximately 80 times lower than those in zygotic embryos. This lack of 7S globulin protein accumulation in somatic embryos is mirrored by a low accumulation of the GLO7A mRNA. The in vitro production of 7S globulins (and more generally salt-soluble proteins) is improved by the addition to the culture medium of arginine, sucrose and ABA, the effects of these 3 components being additive. To investigate further the action of the 3 molecules of interest, we performed parallel studies on mRNA and protein abundance. Our studies of transcript accumulation suggest that ABA and sucrose act directly on mRNA synthesis or stability; however, it appears that there are also translational or post-translational regulatory factors which act to limit protein accumulation in somatic embryos.

With floral morphology and pollen-ovule ratios as indicators of pollination syndrome and breeding system, the floral biology of dry rainforest was compared with that of adjacent savanna woodland and with rainforest elsewhere. Contingency tables and analysis of variance were used to examine and compare breeding system, flower diameter, floral display and putative pollination syndrome for 156 dry rainforest and 33 savanna woodland taxa. Most (91 of 97) dry rainforest species had pollen-ovule ratios indicating obligate outbreeding. Similar levels of dioecy (21%) and patterns of flowering phenology were observed to those reported for rainforests elsewhere. For dry rainforest canopy trees, flower diameter and morphology indicated pollination by small, generalist insects. Canopy trees tended to flower in the wet season and have low ovule numbers. Taxa assigned to the wind-pollination syndrome had the highest pollen-ovule ratios, suggesting less efficient pollen transfer. Sclerophyll savanna taxa (and some emergent dry rainforest trees) tended to flower in the dry season, have large flowers, high ovule numbers and a high level of floral display.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034982649

Progeny from different trees were planted in half-sib tests in different years. It took an 11-year period involving numerous sites of differing quality to complete the test establishment. The estimation of parental breeding value was restricted to across-sites analysis involving the mean performance of open-pollinated progeny collected from each plus tree planted over a maximum of three representative sites; in each case the data from each site were weighted by the family heritability for the trait and site. Standard parameter estimates for family heritability and phenotypic and genetic correlations, and standard values of the control common to all experiments, were calculated by averaging estimates over all across-sites analysis. Ranking of re-selected parents to form the GBP was based on index values calculated using multi-trait index selection. Two hundred and forty reselected parents have been allocated to one of four sub-lines of equal mean index value. Plus trees have been ranked within each sub-line based on index value. Full-sib controlled pollinations according to an amended assortative mating procedure are now planned between selections within each sub-line.

Some of these wasp species pollinate figs actively, while others are passive pollinators. Based on direct observations of mode of pollination in 88 species, we show that mode of pollination can confidently be predicted from fig traits only (anther-to-ovule ratio) or from wasp traits only (presence of coxal combs). The presence of pollen pockets is not a predictor of mode of pollination. Data, direct and indirect, on 142 species, demonstrate numerous cases of the loss of active pollination and suggest one or few origins of active pollination. Hence, active pollination, an impressive example of the sophisticated traits that may result from mutualistic coevolution, depends on selective forces that can be overcome in some species, allowing reversions.

As could be expected from its early flowering period, pollinator visitation rates to both plants and flowers of H. foetidus were very low at all sites. Pollinator composition remained consistent among regions, but there was significant variation among regions in pollinator service. Despite the low visitation rates, fruit set did not appear to be pollen limited in any of the study areas, which may be explained by the long duration of flowers (up to 20 d). When pollinators were excluded experimentally, fruit set decreased significantly, but substantial levels of self-pollination occurred at all regions. Autonomous self-pollination levels were lowest in the two regions with lowest pollinator service and highest in the region with highest pollinator service.

An extensively replicated, long-term study of orchid-bees (Euglossini) was made in protected tropical moist forest in Panama. Over 47,000 bees were recorded in 124 monthly censuses employing 1952 counts. No aggregate trend in abundance occurred (from 1979 to 2000), although four individual species declined, nine increased, 23 showed no change, and species richness was stable. No rare or parasitic species showed decreasing trends, while the most common of the set of bee species studied gradually declined. Biodiversity therefore increased. Recorded variability included 300% (fourfold) differences in bee abundance among years, and changes in species abundance up to 14-fold. Surveys in dry and wet seasons (N = 17 and 18 years, 29 and 31 species, respectively) indicated no numerical changes in the bee assemblage over 21 years. El-Niño climatic events led to brief increases in bee abundance. This detailed survey is deconstructed to assess sampling rigor and strategies, particularly considering the recorded local differences within a single forest. Year-to-year shifts in bee abundance for three tropical and five temperate bee censuses were comparable.

This compensation can result from higher fecundity, vegetative outperformance, and/or lower inbreeding depression. In this study we compared vegetative and reproductive parameters of female and hermaphrodite Daphne laureola individuals in two southeastern Spanish populations and estimated the magnitude of inbreeding depression up to the seedling emergence stage by conducting controlled pollinations and experimental sowings of seed progenies in the field. Reproductive shrubs of both sexes did not differ significantly in size, leaf production, leaf size, leaf growth, nutrient allocation to leaves, and production of flowers and fruits. Seed set and seed size of cross- and self-pollinated flowers of hermaphrodites and cross-pollinated females were also similar. Seedling emergence rates of self- and cross-pollinated seeds from hermaphrodites under natural field conditions were similar, suggesting a minor role of inbreeding depression up to that reproductive stage. Seeds from females produced more seedlings than selfed seeds from hermaphrodites. In 21 populations surveyed in the study region over a broad geographical and elevational gradient, the proportion of females ranged between 20.6 and 56.1% and was inversely related to elevation. The establishment and maintenance of females in southeastern Spanish populations of D. laureola seem to be mainly mediated by ecological factors.",Altitudinal gradient; Daphne laureola; Gynodioecy; Inbreeding depression; Sex ratio; Sexual dimorphism; Thymelaeaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000563349

We concentrated on collecting nonparasitic bees (and excluded Apis and Bombus) visiting 24 plant species that bloomed at various times of the year, and upon which Charles Robertson found many bee species. For example, we collected most intensively on spring-blooming Claytonia virginica and fall-blooming Aster pilosus, upon which Robertson reported 58 and 90 bee visitors, respectively. Bees were also collected on an opportunistic basis at some other plants. We updated the species names used by Robertson for revisions and synonymies. This paper summarizes a comparison of the two collections, made about 75 years apart at the same small geographic location. The study considers 214 valid bee species that Robertson collected plus an additional 14 species found by us but not by Robertson. Of these 214, we collected 140 species. The absence of most of the remaining 74 species that we did not collect can be explained by examining their plant preferences. Robertson did not record 47 of these 74 species on the 24 plant species where we collected intensively, and he observed 19 more species on only one or two of the 24 plant species. Additionally, he observed 21 of them on only one of the 441 plants he studied. Of the bee species found by Robertson on the 24 plant species, we collected 82% on the same plant species. The land uses and land cover on Macoupin County's 225,464 ha (558,080 acres), which bear directly on the type and availability of habitat for bees and their host plants, varied considerably over two centuries. For example, in the early 1800s, land cover was about 73% prairie and 27% forest. The estimated 59,792 ha (148,000 acres) of forested land in 1820 diminished to 24,644 ha (61,000 acres) by 1924. It then grew to 34,340 ha (85,000 acres) by 1962. Agriculture is the predominant land use; in 1967, 59% of the land was in harvested crops (primarily row crops) and 15% was in pasture. Despite habitat changes and the passage of 75 years, our 1970 and 1972 Carlinville collections show a high degree of similarity with those of Robertson, possibly because diverse habitats within the agricultural matrix contained the host plants and nesting sites required by the bees. We recommend that a third survey of this area be undertaken as part of a long-term study made possible by the meticulous 19th century records of Charles Robertson, which must be preserved.",Agricultural habitats; Apoidea; Bees; Biodiversity; Carlinville (Illinois); Conservation; Fauna survey; Historical ecology; Hymenoptera; Land use changes; Pollinators; Robertson (Charles),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012109981

Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation indicated that the two subspecies are in separate clades, but there was also an equally deep split within subspecies maculata. There was no evidence for gene flow among regions and there was considerable substructure within clades. The phylogeographic structure of moth populations among and within subspecies can be explained in part by historical biogeographic boundaries and increasingly patchy postglacial distribution of the exclusive host plant, Hesperoyucca whipplei. Local specialization and co-adaptation would be possible in the absence of apparent gene flow, yet gross morphological divergence is limited to the very old split between the subspecies.

Laboratory experiments have suggested that behavioral responses by pollinators to lack of reward availability might result in a reproductive advantage for rare-color morphs. Consequently, we performed an experiment varying the relative frequency of the two color morphs of D. sambucina to test whether rare morph advantage acted in the natural habitat of the species. We show here clear evidence from this manipulative experiment that rare-color morphs have reproductive advantage through male and female components.

To eliminate confounding effects of these factors on disease evaluation and h2 estimation, plants that were self-incompatible, indeterminate and/or late-maturing were eliminated.

In this study, the pollination mechanism of Najas marina L. was observed in two freshwater lakes as well as in aquaria. A unique mechanism of rapid pedicel elongation and curvature in the male flower of N. marina that brings the anther to lie opposite to the branches is reported for the first time. This process occurs before anther dehiscence and facilitates dispersal of pollen by water currents. A large number of pollen grains are dispersed in dense ""clouds"" for 5-10 min after anther dehiscence. Microscopic examination of pollen grains revealed the presence of numerous starch grains in the cytoplasm. These increase the gravity of the pollen grains and provide energy for pollen tube growth to a length of 2 mm in the water. The development of pollen tubes before contact with the stigma enhances the chances of the pollen to be captured by the branched stigmas. In addition, the pollen grains undergo a marked elongation of their polar axes just prior to release. The relatively long period of viability of both precocious and ungerminated pollen grains further enhances pollination. The high pollen loads observed on stigmas could account for the high seed yield in this submerged plant. The precocious pollen grains may be functionally equivalent to the filiform pollen occurring in submarine-pollinated seagrasses. This provides an example of convergent evolution in response to the pollination environment created by strong water currents. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Convergent evolution; Hydrophily; Najas marina; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035051915

The bap genes mapped to two loci on chromosomes 4 and 10. So far, bap-homologous sequences have been detected only in maize, teosinte and sorghum, and are not present in grasses outside the Andropogoneae tribe. BAP2 is synthesized as a pre-proprotein, and is processed by successive removal of a signal peptide and a 29-residue prodomain.

We examined such effects in Listera cordata R. Br., a north temperate terrestrial orchid, in a subalpine population in Colorado, USA. Hand pollinations showed that L. cordata was self-compatible as all pollinations produced fruits. Cross-pollinations differed significantly from self-pollinations, and had a higher number of seeds per capsule and higher % of fertilized ovules. Together they could compensate for the transmission advantage of self-pollinations. Average number of flowers per inflorescence was 4.2-4.4 and average fruit set was 20.7-23.7%. By establishing 36 plots with varying plant densities (1, 4, 8 and 16) and emasculating all flowers in target plants of a set of 20 plots, we estimated density effects on fruit and seed production. Plant density had no effect on the amount of reproduction except in reduced seed production of highly dispersed plants. Our results suggest that inbreeding depression may be an important selective factor in L. cordata.

Genetic polymorphisms of flowering plants can influence pollinator foraging but it is not known whether heritable foraging polymorphisms of pollinators influence their pollination efficacies. Honey bees Apis mellifera L. visit cranberry flowers for nectar but rarely for pollen when alternative preferred flowers grow nearby. 2. Cranberry flowers visited once by pollen-foraging honey bees received four-fold more stigmatic pollen than flowers visited by mere nectar-foragers (excluding nectar thieves). Manual greenhouse pollinations with fixed numbers of pollen tetrads (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) achieved maximal fruit set with just eight pollen tetrads. Pollen-foraging honey bees yielded a calculated 63% more berries than equal numbers of non-thieving nectar-foragers, even though both classes of forager made stigmatic contact. 3. Colonies headed by queens of a pollen-hoarding genotype fielded significantly more pollen-foraging trips than standard commercial genotypes, as did hives fitted with permanently engaged pollen traps or colonies containing more larvae. Pollen-hoarding colonies together brought back twice as many cranberry pollen loads as control colonies, which was marginally significant despite marked daily variation in the proportion of collected pollen that was cranberry. 4. Caloric supplementation of matched, paired colonies failed to enhance pollen foraging despite the meagre nectar yields of individual cranberry flowers. 5. Heritable behavioural polymorphisms of the honey bee, such as pollen-hoarding, can enhance fruit and seed set by a floral host (e.g. cranberry), but only if more preferred pollen hosts are absent or rare. Otherwise, honey bees' broad polylecty, flight range, and daily idiosyncrasies in floral fidelity will obscure specific pollen-foraging differences at a given floral host, even among paired colonies in a seemingly uniform agricultural setting.",Apis; Apoidea; Bees; Behavioural genetics; Cranberry; Foraging; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator; Vaccinium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035037162

Within field collections of self-pollinating T. pusilla, differential responsiveness to DMBQ was seen in distinct maternal families. Assaying haustorium development in subsequent generations of self-pollinated T. pusilla showed that DMBQ responsiveness was heritable.

To investigate whether these enzymes can contribute to the high levels of Asp family amino acids, we measured their specific activity and feedback inhibition properties, as well as activities of several other key enzymes involved in Lys metabolism. We did not find a significant difference in total activity of dihydrodipicolinate synthase, HSDH, and Lys ketoglutarate reductase between these inbreds, and the feedback inhibition properties of HSDH and dihyrodipicolinate synthase by Lys and/ or Thr were similar.

After pollination the majority of PELPIII are translocated into the callosic layer and the callose plugs of the pollen tubes, which could suggest a function of PELPIII in pollen tube growth. PELPIII may represent one of the chemical and/or physical factors from the female sporophytic tissue that contributes to the difference between in vivo and in vitro pollen tube growth. PELPIII glycoproteins were purified and biochemically characterized. Because of their high proline (Pro) and hydroxy-Pro (Hyp) content, PELPIII proteins belong to the class of Pro/Hyp-rich glycoproteins. The carbohydrate moiety of PELPIII is attached through O-glycosidic linkages and comprises more than one-half the total glycoprotein. Deglycosylation of PELPIII revealed two backbones, both reacting with PELPIII-specific antibodies. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of these backbones showed that PELPIII is encoded by the MG14 and MG15 genes. Two heterogeneous N-terminal sequences of MG14 and MG15, both starting downstream of the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, seem to be present, which indicates a novel N-terminal processing.

A series of intercrosses and test crosses were used to determine the inheritance and relationships. CMS-D2 lines crossed with D8R resulted in all sterile F1 plants, confirming that the D8 restorer gene does not suppress D2 cytoplasmic dysfunction. A segregation ratio of one fertile to one sterile in three testcross combinations revealed that D2R contained one restorer gene, Rf, for both CMS-D8 and CMS-D2. The Rf gene functioned sporophytically, whereas the D8R gene is known to function gametophytically. However, Rf pollen with the D8 or D2 cytoplasm was preferentially effective in fertilization based on the low number of sterile plants obtained when alloplasmic F1 plants were self-pollinated or used as the pollen-parent in crosses with CMS-D8. In tests for allelism only 8 sterile plants out of 1921 were obtained in two testcrosses of (D8R × D2R)F1 × normal cotton.

The objective of this investigation was to determine the mode of inheritance of D8R restoration to CMS-D8. The experimental approach involved a series of crossing schemes involving nuclear permutations among the AD1 and D8 alloplasms. Eighteen normal genotypes did not restore fertility to the CMS-D8 (A line) and could be used as maintainer (B) lines. D8R crossed as female with B lines yielded F1 and F2 populations with all fertile plants. F1 pollen also produced all fertile progeny in crosses on A lines. Thus, the D8 restorer functions at the gametophytic level. When heterozygous restored plants were pollinated with B lines, or when reciprocal F1's with normal cytoplasm were crossed as male with the A line, the progeny ratio was one fertile to one sterile. A 3:1 ratio was obtained when restored F1 plants with D8 cytoplasm were pollinated by their reciprocal F1's with normal cytoplasm. Accordingly, restoration of CMS-D8 by the D8R restorer is conditioned by a single dominant gene (Rf2). The genotypes for A, B, and D8R lines in the CMS-D8 system are designated S (rf2rf2), N (rf2rf2), and S (Rf2Rf2), respectively. This gametophytic restoration system is potentially useful for utilizing F2 heterosis in cotton.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035050734

We also tested its ability to pollinate flowers on the tree from the distal to the proximal part of the branches. We found that when individual branches were pollinated, fruitlet set was in accordance with the expected deposition rate of pollen grains on the stigma: electrostatic + open pollination > non-electrostatic + open pollination > open pollination > electrostatic pollination > non-electrostatic pollination > spontaneous self pollination. Fruit set results showed the same pattern but were not as precise. Electrostatic pollination of individual trees resulted in an insignificant increase in pollen germinability on the stigma. The highest germinability was on the distal part of the branch and the lowest was on the proximal part of the branch, in all pollination treatments. Electrostatic pollination increased yield as compared with non-electrostatic and open pollination. Nut weight, however, decreased slightly with increased yield.

Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) is widely used an amenable model for the study of plant biology, including plant-pathogen interactions. Bringing the two plants together in a controlled system will enable the study of the molecular and genetic basis involved in host-parasitic plant interactions and should provide tools for the detection of genes responsible for incompatibility and resistance responses. The objective of this study was to screen Arabidopsis lines for reduced germination of Orobanche seeds. A 96-cell well bioassay was developed to test the potential of lines, ecotypes and mutants of Arabidopsis to induce germination of Orobanhe. Screening of 50 A. thaliana ecotypes did not reveal non-inducing ecotypes. Screening of 13 000 A. thaliana fast neutron mutated M2 plants detected 94 non-inducing mutant plants of which 34 were rescued, self pollinated, and M3 seeds collected. M3 seedlings from five lines were reduced in their ability to induce germination. In a separate assay, we determined that the reduced germination rates corresponded with reduced distance from the roots at which germination occurred.

In the experimental variants the upper half of the style of F1 hybrids was cut off at 40, 60, and 120 minutes, in the control styles being native. It was shown that F2 population structure essentialy changed for some morphological traits in dependence of competition intensity between the microgametophytes. The percentage of early flowering genotypes increased with shortening the period from pollination till style excision. In the treatment where styles were cut off 40 min after pollination the frequency of early flowering plants was highest while the frequency of those plants in 120 min treatment approached the control. Moreover, some treatments considerably influenced the phenotypic ratio in the F2 population for such traits as petal colour and number of side shoots.

However, few studies have documented reciprocity among individual plants; instead, mean anther and stigma heights for floral morphs are usually reported, masking interindividual variation. We measured eight floral dimensions for individuals in five populations of three heterostylous Rubiaceae. The three methods used to quantify reciprocity yielded different conclusions regarding the degree to which populations conformed to expectations for heterostylous plants. Only Psychotria poeppigiana had stigma and, to a lesser degree, anther heights in discrete classes. Variation among plants of Bouvardia ternifolia and Psychotria chiapensis yielded a continuum of anther and stigma heights across populations. Comparison of distances between stigma and anthers indicated that only flowers of B. ternifolia had, as expected, a constant value for this distance. Finally, regression relationships between anther and stigma heights and corolla length showed that only in one population each of B. ternifolia and P. poeppigiana, and in P. chiapensis, was distance between anthers and stigmas the same across the range of corolla sizes for both floral morphs. Variation among these species in expression of heterostyly was not clearly linked to phylogenetic relationship or pollinator syndromes. Two approach herkogamous (AH) species were studied for comparison. Flowers of Psychotria brachiata were consistently AH, but flowers of P. pittieri were highly variable.

As a response to elevated CO2, ?-pinene and total phenolic concentrations in needles increased significantly, while bornyl acetate concentration in needles and palustric + levopimaric and neoabietic acid concentrations in stems decreased significantly. Some terpenes and resin acids were found at lower concentrations in the combined O3 and CO2 treatment than in O3 exposure or elevated CO2.

There was a lot of between-tree variation in terpene and resin acid concentrations, which is typical of open-pollinated populations. The results of this study suggest that, at least in short-term experiments, Scots pine secondary metabolites are relatively insensitive to climate change factors. Total phenolics in the needles were the most responsive group showing about 25% increase in elevated CO2, and O3 exposure did not mitigate this CO2 effect. Terpenes and resin acids were less responsive, although some individual compounds showed notable responses, e.g. a-pinene in needles, which increased about 50% in response to elevated CO2. As a consequence, although there were only slight effects on total pools of needle secondary metabolites, considerable O3 and CO2 effects on certain individual compounds might have ecological significance via trophic amplification, e.g. in decomposing processes of needle litter.",Climate change; Resin acids; Terpenes; Total phenolics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035044986

The basic model takes into account the features associated with cleistogamous self-pollination (e.g. the greater economy and assurance of cleistogamous fertilization) and the inability of cleistogamous flowers to contribute to the outcrossed pollen pool. The basic model predicts that only one of each strategy (i.e. chasmogamy or cleistogamy) is favoured. However, when seasonal fluctuation of the fruit-to-flower ratio of chasmogamous flowers is considered, an evolutionarily stable strategy favours either cleistogamous or chasmogamous flower production. This fluctuation in fertility may explain the seasonally discrete production of dimorphic flowers in natural populations of some facultative cleistogamous plants. The simultaneous production of both of the dimorphic flowers is explained only when the effect of geitonogamous selfing of chasmogamous flowers is included in the model.",Chasmogamy; Evolutionarily stable strategy; Facultative cleistogamy; Geitonogamy; Resource allocation model; Seasonal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042691222

One argument predicts that when sex is determined by a combination of nuclear and cytoplasmic factors, the frequency of females will be determined by genetic rather than ecological factors. An alternative argument suggests that the relative seed fitness of the female and hermaphroditic morphs will control female frequency. Hence, sex-ratio variation can be influenced by any factor that affects relative seed fitness, including ecological factors such as variation in pollination or site quality. In this study, we investigated sex-ratio variation in the gynodioecious species Silene acaulis, which has nuclear-cytoplasmic sex determination. We determined whether the frequency of females in 10 sites on Niwot Ridge, in the Front Range of Colorado, was correlated with the quality of the site or the relative seed fitness of the two morphs. Furthermore, we determined whether the two morphs differed consistently in investment in flowers, ovules, seeds and fruits. We found significant variation in sex ratio, site quality and relative seed fitness of the two morphs across sites. Although ovule number was greater in flowers on females, seed number per fruit did not vary in a consistent manner between morphs. The morphs differed consistently only in their propensity to produce fruit, with hermaphrodites exhibiting highly variable, and relatively low, fruit set compared to females. Female frequency was not significantly correlated with site quality. However, the relative seed fitness of the morphs was significantly correlated with site quality and the frequency of females. These results suggest that ecological factors do play a role in determining female frequency in S. acaulis and, consequently, can impact breeding-system evolution in this long-lived species.",Fruit set; Gynodioecy; Sex-ratio variation; Silene acaulis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000723119

Despite the common utilization of this method, any molecular and cellular studies on how the self-incompatibility is removed from the Chinese cabbage plant have not been done. In this study, we show that the increased CO2 gas causes a structural alteration of the papillae cell and thereby the self-incompatibility is removed from the Chinese cabbage plant, allowing the self-pollens to germinate and penetrate the papillae cell. Also, gene expression in the pistil treated with CO2 gas was studied by DD/RT-PCR and reverse northern hybridization experiments.

The genetic and environmental factors affecting female and male phenology, and reproductive synchronisation were studied. The between-year variation in the timing of flowering was more than three weeks. However, when it was defined on the basis of the effective temperature sum, the variation was smaller. No phenological reproductive isolation was found between the seed orchard and surrounding natural forests. The duration of the receptive period of the seed orchard varied from 5 to 8 days, and anthesis determined on the basis of airborne pollen from 5 to 10 days. The receptive period started about one day earlier than anthesis, except in one abnormally warm flowering period when female and male flowering started simultaneously. In general, the flowering periods of the different clones overlapped. The clonal differences in the phenology of receptivity were in most cases statistically significant, but in pollen shedding they were not. The broad-sense heritability estimates were higher for female than for male phenology. Environmental factors, conversely, had a stronger effect on male phenology.

Fourteen 'Langdon' (LDN) D-genome disomic substitution lines, a LDN Ph mutant (Ph1b ph1b), and normal 'Langdon' were pollinated with maize pollen. After pollination, hormonal treatment was given daily for up to 14 days. Haploid embryos were obtained from all lines and were aseptically cultured. From a total of 55 358 pollinated florets, 895 embryos were obtained. Only 14 of the embryos germinated and developed into healthy plants. Different substitution lines showed varying degrees of success. The most successful was the substitution 5D(5B) for both embryo formation and haploid plantlet production. These results indicate that the substitution of 5D for 5B confers on durum wheat a greater ability to produce haploids. Fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) showed that the substitution haploids consisted of 7 A-genome chromosomes, 6 B-genome chromosomes, and 1 D-genome chromosome. Triticum urartu Tum. genomic DNA was efficient in probing the 7 A-genome chromosomes, although the D-genome chromosome also showed intermediate hybridization. This shows a close affinity between the A genome and D genome.

We present evidence supporting broad-level co-cladogenesis with respect to most but not all of the corresponding groups of figs. Using fossil evidence for calibrating a molecular clock for these data, we estimated the origin of the fig-wasp mutualism to have occurred ca. 90 million years ago. The estimated divergence times among the pollinator genera and their current geographical distributions corresponded well with several features of the break-up of the southern continents during the Late Cretaceous period. We then explored the evolutionary trajectories of two characteristics that hold profound consequences for both partners in the mutualism: the breeding system of the host (monoecious or dioecious) and pollination behaviour of the wasp (passive or active). The fig-wasp mutualism exhibits extraordinarily long-term evolutionary stability despite clearly identifiable conflicts of interest between the interactors, which are reflected by the very distinct variations found on the basic mutualistic theme.",Biogeography; Coevolution; Fig wasp; Gondwana; Mutualism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035820283

Under a subsequent cooler climate, and probably increased competition from trees, the species became restricted to steep, south-facing cliffs and scree slopes with a particularly sunny and warm microclimate. Thus, the small relict populations in central Europe have been isolated for about 5000-6000 years. To investigate whether or not reproductive traits of P. mahaleb are affected by isolation and population size, several flower and fruit characteristics were sampled in ten populations in Switzerland. A Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) based on these reproductive characteristics differentiated the populations. The first CCA axis was determined by flower size, pollination frequency, pulp and seed mass. This ran parallel to increasing precipitation and decreasing altitude. The second axis correlated with the number of fruits per raceme and seed viability, and ran parallel to increasing sunshine. None of the six flower and fruit variables correlated with population size or with the degree of isolation. However, flower size, pollination frequency, pulp and seed mass showed a negative correlation with altitude. The results suggest that, in populations of P. mahaleb in central Europe, climatic conditions explain more of the observed variation in flower and fruit characteristics than population size or degree of isolation.",Altitude; Flower size; Pollination frequency; Population size; Prunus mahaleb; Pulp and seed mass; Seed viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035076524

It has c. 4000 individuals and is classified as vulnerable following the IUCN categories. Pollination ecology results demonstrated that it is strictly dependent on pollinator activity (mainly bumblebees) to set seeds. Genetic diversity estimated by allozyme variation at 7 loci showed quite high levels of variation related to its polyploidy. Predation by Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra pyrenaica), first detected in 1993, caused a continuous loss of > 90% of seed set in a protected area. The maintenance of high genetic diversity suggests the buffer effect of polyploidy and seed bank strategy to counter animal grazing, but long-term effects on conservation are expected.

In 14 isolated, remnant populations of the short-lived Leucochrysum albicans subsp. albicans var. tricolor (Asteraceae), where reproductive population size differed from 74 to over 50,000 flowering plants, seed set and germinability was determined for one flowering season. The breeding system was determined in a hand-cross versus self-pollination experiment in the glasshouse, whilst mating system parameters were determined by molecular methods for four sites spanning the range of reproductive population sizes. Leucochrysum albicans subsp. albicans var. tricolor is a self-incompatible species and outcrossing rates were uniformly high (> 90%) in the populations observed. Seed production was not linearly associated with log (population size), although there was substantial within and between-population variability. Seed germinability was rapid and substantial (> 80%) in all populations and not linearly associated with log (population size). This study suggests that (previously identified) short-term factors, such as the maintenance of habitat and safe sites for regeneration, are of immediate importance to the persistence of all L. albicans subsp. albicans var. tricolor populations.

This floral phenology ensures that outcrossing strongly predominates. Fig populations may thus be expected to possess deleterious recessive alleles that lead to inbreeding depression when selfing does occur. However, whether monoecious figs are self-compatible and whether selfing results in inbreeding depression have never been investigated. Using wasps as ""pollination tools"" and exploiting infrequent overlap in male and female phases on the same tree, we conducted controlled selfed and outcrossed pollination experiments in Ficus aurea. Our results show that this species is totally self-compatible. No negative effects of selfing could be demonstrated on syconium retention, number of vacant ovaries, seed set, or seed germination. However, wasp production had a tendency to be higher after self-pollination. While it is possible that inbreeding depression is expressed at later developmental stages, its absence at the early stages we examined is nonetheless surprising for a plant expected to be highly outcrossed.

Studies on pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and natural and manual pollinations in nonmutilated and mutilated flowers were undertaken to discover the causal factors for failure of fruit-set. Although pollen adherence on stigma seemed adequate, in vivo pollen tube development was inhibited and flowers withered 3-5 days after anthesis. However, fruit-set could be induced if flowers were mutilated by clipping the corolla lobes and pollinated 16 hr after mutilation; nearly one third of the mutilated flowers set fruits and seeds consequent to pollination. Seed germination was used as a viability test for seeds. Aqueous, cell-free extract of stigma from unpollinated and pollinated flowers added to pollen culture medium markedly inhibited pollen tube growth even in low concentrations, whereas the stigmatic extract from mutilated flowers inhibited pollen tube growth only slightly.

Unpollinated WT ovaries degenerated but GA3 application induced parthenocarpic fruit growth. On the contrary, parthenocarpic growth of pat-3/pat-4 fruits, which occurs in the absence of pollination and hormone treatment, was not affected by applied GA3. Unpollinated pat-3/pat-4 fruit growth was negated by paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of ent-kaurene oxidase, and this inhibitory effect was negated by GA3. The quantification of the main GAs of the early 13-hydroxylation pathway (GA1, GA8, GA19, GA20, GA29 and GA44) in unpollinated ovaries at 3 developmental stages (flower bud, FB; pre-anthesis, PR; and anthesis, AN), by gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring, showed that the concentration of most of them was higher in pat-3/pat-4 than in WT ovaries at PR and AN stages. The concentration of GA1, suggested previously to be the active GA in tomate, was 2-4 times higher. Unpollinated pat-3/pat-4 ovaries at FB, PR and AN stages also contained relatively high amounts (5-12 ng g-1) of GA3, a GA found at less than 0.5 ng g-1 in WT ovaries. It is concluded that the mutations pat-3/pat-4 may induce natural facultative parthenocarpy capacity in tomato by increasing the concentration of GA1 and GA3 in the ovaries before pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034742765

Based on maize transposable elements Activator (Ac) and Dissociation (Ds), we developed a method to generate large numbers of transgenic barley (Hordeum vulgare var Golden Promise) plants, each carrying a single transgene copy at different locations. Plants expressing Ac transposase (AcTPase) were crossed with plants containing one or more copies of bar, a selectable herbicide (Basta) resistance gene, located between inverted-repeat Ds ends (Ds-bar). F1 plants were self-pollinated and the F2 generation was analyzed to identify plants segregating for transposed Ds-bar elements. Of Ds-bar transpositions, 25% were in unlinked sites that segregated from vector sequences, other Ds-bar copies, and the AcTPase gene, resulting in numerous single-copy Ds-bar plants carrying the transgene at different locations. Transgene expression in F2 plants with transposed Ds-bar was 100% stable, whereas only 23% of F2 plants carrying Ds-bar at the original site expressed the transgene product stably. In F3 and F4 populations, transgene expression in 81.5% of plants from progeny of F2 plants with single-copy, transposed Ds-bar remained completely stable. Analysis of the integration site in single-copy plants showed that transposed Ds-bar inserted into single- or low-copy regions of the genome, whereas silenced Ds-bar elements at their original location were inserted into redundant or highly repetitive genomic regions. Methylation of the non-transposed transgene and its promoter, as well as a higher condensation of the chromatin around the original integration site, was associated with plants exhibiting transgene silencing.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035099968

Despite its relatively restricted geographic distribution, Leptodactylon californicum exhibits morphological variation that has been recognized at the infraspecific level. Five subspecies have been recognized within this California endemic, each adhering to specific geographic limits and reportedly exhibiting distinguishing morphological features. We investigated geographic divergence among populations of L. californicum through examination of patterns of divergence in morphology, allozymes, and ribosomal DNA profiles. Geographic trends in morphology have previously been reported, with clines running from north to south and from the Pacific coast inland. Correlations between genetic (i.e., allozymic) divergence and morphology, genetic divergence and geographic location, and morphology and geographic location were detected. Gene flow among populations appears to be restricted, most likely due to geographic barriers, permitting the divergence of populations. Divergence may be further enhanced by self-pollination. Unique alleles are fixed in the most geographically isolated populations; these populations are also the most divergent morphologically. No variation in rDNA restriction sites was detected among populations. The allozyme data, coupled with morphology support a model of geographic divergence in L. californicum and provide the basis for reassignment of subspecific designations within the species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035100802

We studied the fig pollinator mutualism in 14 functionally dioecious fig species and one monoecious species from tropical lowland rainforests near Madang, Papua New Guinea. Observations and experiments suggest that (i) pollinating wasps are monophagous and attracted to a particular host species; (ii) pollinating and non-pollinating wasps are equally attracted to gall (male) figs and seed (female) figs in functionally dioecious species; (iii) differing style lengths between gall figs and seed figs may explain why pollinators do not develop in the latter; (iv) negative density dependence may stabilize the interaction between pollinating wasps and their parasitoids; and (v) seed figs may reduce the search efficiency of non-pollinators.

Competition for pollination services may lead to interspecific segregation of the timing of flowering among plants. This, in turn, sets limits on the pollination services, which restrain the population growth of a competitively superior species, thereby allowing an inferior species to sustain its population in the habitat.

Flower and fruit production were significantly higher on large serpentine outcrops than on small outcrops. Fruit production also was positively correlated with the soil's ratio of calcium to magnesium. Successful pollination was positively affected by flower density and the number of other flowering patches within 100 m of a C. collina patch. The number of nearby flowering patches was considerably higher on large than on small Outcrops. Flowers on large outcrops did not receive significantly more bee visitors than flowers on small outcrops, suggesting that pollination success is related to the quality rather than the quantity of pollen deposited. Fruit production by plants on both small and large outcrops was enhanced by the experimental addition of pollen from other patches, but not by the addition of pollen from the same patch. These findings demonstrate that the size of habitat may have strong effects on the reproductive success of locally endemic plants by enhancing opportunities for successful sexual reproduction.

Our recent analysis of the mod mutation of Brassica, which results in a breakdown of the self-incompatibility response, led to the isolation of a gene linked to the MOD locus which is expressed at low levels in mod mutants. The gene is predicted to encode a plasma membrane-localized aquaporin-like protein and has been designated MIP-MOD. We utilized reporter gene analysis to demonstrate that the MIP-MOD promoter is active in Brassica papillar cells as well as in some vegetative tissues. The encoded protein is also likely to be plasma membrane-localized based on the observation that all plasma membrane-intrinsic aquaporin-like proteins in Brassica leaves are enriched in plasma membrane fractions. The MIP-MOD protein results in a low but measurable enhancement in osmotic water permeability of Xenopus oocytes and hence represents a functional aquaporin.

Stored Products Res. 10 (1974) 183-197) and Urrelo et al. (J. Stored Products Res. 26 (1990) 100). The two methods gave similar assessments of maize susceptibility to S. zeamais. The Dobie method is preferred due to the lower total time required for assessment of relative susceptibility of maize varieties. The greatest disadvantage of the Urrelo method is the intensive labour requirements in the early stages of a trial, when numbers of eggs have to be counted, although it has the advantage that the assessment may be terminated upon emergence of the first F1 adult. Two explanatory variables, kernel size and hardness, were investigated to determine whether they may be used as indicators of resistance. Results suggested that kernel size is the more important in determining resistance to attack by S. zeamais, with large kernels appearing to show greater resistance than small ones. Contrary to expectations, of the varieties tested, including local, hybrid and improved open pollinated (IOP) varieties, the local varieties were generally more susceptible. This may be related to kernel size, as all IOPs and hybrids tested had large kernels, whereas the majority of the local varieties had small ones. No clear relationship between weevil susceptibility and kernel hardness could be detected, although there was an indication that differences associated with kernel size varied depending on kernel hardness.

The trans-membrane S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), a member of the receptor-like kinase superfamily in plants, mediates recognition of self-pollen on the female side1, whereas the S-locus cysteine-rich protein (SCR) is the male component of the self-incompatibility response2,3. SCR is presumably located in the pollen coat, and is thought to be the SRK ligand. Although many receptor-like kinases have been isolated in plants, the mechanisms of signal transduction mediated by these molecules remain largely unknown. Here we show that SRK is phosphorylated in vivo within one hour of self-pollination. We also show that, in vitro, autophosphorylation of SRK is prevented by the stigma thioredoxin THL1 in the absence of a ligand. This inhibition is released in a haplotype-specific manner by the addition of pollen coat proteins.

Spatial separation of male and female organs within a flower (hercogamy) is a common character traditionally interpreted as an adaptation to reduce intrafloral self-fertilization, one potential cost of hermaphroditism. Another possible cost that may lead to selection for hercogamy is physical interference between male and female floral functions. Here, I present evidence demonstrating the role of a floral character in reducing female interference with male function. The bi-lobed stigma of the bush monkey flower closes after receiving pollen, causing increased spatial separation of the anthers and stigma ('movement' hercogamy). Experimental manipulations show that flowers with closed stigmas export more than twice as much pollen to other flowers as those in which the stigma is prevented from closing. However, stigma closure only minimally reduces the potential for intrafloral self-pollination. This study provides the first experimental evidence that selection to reduce intrafloral male-female interference can be a strong selective force and can drive the evolution of floral characters usually interpreted as mechanisms to reduce self-fertilization.",Floral evolution; Hercogamy; Hermaphroditism; Mimulus; Self-ollination; Stigma-pollen interference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035819818

The number of pollen grains received by a flower depended most on the number of pollinator visits to the flower, whereas the number of grains exported was best predicted by the total time pollinators spent inside the flower. The pattern of mating generally was assortative with respect to color, as bees tended to overvisit one color or the other within a foraging bout. In arrays where nectar was augmented in one color, the augmented color received both more visits and longer visits.

We suggest that self-incompatibility, inbreeding depression, and mechanical barriers that prevent self-pollination in these species are responsible for the maintainance of the high genetic variability. These traits are uncommon in Orchidaceae, but have been observed in these and some other species pollinated by flies or other pollinators with behavior that facilitates self-pollination. The genetic similarity among conspecific populations is also high for species with very short-range flying pollinators. Only one population of P. teres presented values of genetic similarity lower than usually observed in allopatric conspecific populations. Morphology, however, does not support its segregation as a new taxon. All species can be recognized by their enzymatic patterns, and the results agree with recently proposed taxonomic realignments.

Natural variations in display size, flowering phenology, and fruit set were monitored in 1997. A hand-pollination experiment was also conducted to check whether pollen limitation was a factor in fruit set in the field. Increases in floral display size did not affect fruit set; the proportion of flowers that set fruit was almost constant irrespective of the total number of flowers per inflorescence, the total number of inflorescences per plant, and the total number of flowers per plant. The hand-pollination experiment showed that fruit set was not pollen limited despite the low mating probability that resulted from the combination of dioecism and the species' dependence on opportunistic pollinators. This was due, in part, to the fact that female flowers did not have a predetermined period of receptivity, but instead remained receptive until they received pollen. In contrast, flowering phenology did affect fruit set. Fruit set was most abundant when male and female flowering was most abundant. This suggests there was some degree of pollen limitation during the part of the flowering season when male flowers were scarce.",Aucuba japonica; Cornaceae; Dioecy; Flowering phenology; Fruit set; Resource limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009537943

But such systems are really only good at distributing explicit knowledge, the kind that can be captured and codified for general use. They're not very good at transferring implicit knowledge, the kind needed to generate new insights and creative ways of tackling business problems or opportunities. The authors suggest another approach, something they call T-shaped management, which requires executives to share knowledge freely across their organization (the horizontal part of the ""T""), while remaining fiercely committed to their individual business unit's performance (the vertical part). A few companies are starting to use this approach, and one--BP Amoco--has been especially successful. From BP's experience, the authors have gleaned five ways that T-shaped managers help companies capitalize on their inherent knowledge. They increase efficiency by transferring best practices. They improve the quality of decision making companywide. They grow revenues through shared expertise. They develop new business opportunities through the cross-pollination of ideas. And they make bold strategic moves possible by delivering well-coordinated implementation. All that takes time, and BP's managers have had to learn how to balance that time against the attention they must pay to their own units.

It is established on the principle of gene transmission from the parental to progeny generation during which the linkage between different markers is broken down due to meiotic recombination. The strategy has power to simultaneously capture the information about the linkage of the markers (as measured by recombination fraction) and the degree of their linkage disequilibrium created at a historic time. Simulation studies indicate that the statistical method implemented by the Fisher-scoring algorithm can provide accurate and precise estimates for the allele frequencies, recombination fractions, and linkage disequilibria between different markers.

After sowing in spring the plants were left until flowering in late summer. Nectar was extracted using 5-?l glass microcapillary tubes. The material was frozen and sampled at a later date. The samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the AccQtag (Waters Corp.) system. Analysis showed that the total concentration of amino acids increased significantly with increasing fertilizer treatment (P &lt; 0.05). Of the amino acids present glutamine showed a large and significant increase (P &lt; 0.01), proline showed an increase (P &lt; 0.05) and ?-amino butyric acid (GABA) showed a decrease (P &lt; 0.05). No others showed a significant change. It is interesting to note that a common biosynthetic pathway (from ?-ketoglutarate) links the amino acids that altered in concentration. Due to these changes the relative abundance of about half of the amino acids in the nectar was significantly altered. Glutamine showed a significant increase (P &lt; 0.001) in percentage of the total with most of the remaining amino acids declining in relative abundance. The results show that, in contradiction to earlier work, soil conditions can affect the amino acid complement of nectar. This may have implications for plant-insect interactions, as local populations of pollinators may benefit from the increased amino acid content of the nectar and preferentially visit plants growing in high nutrient conditions.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035137441

In obligate plant/seed parasite-pollinator mutualisms, the plant is exclusively pollinated by an insect whose larvae are specific seed predators. Hence, outcomes of the interaction for the plant can vary with the number of eggs laid and the number of seeds eaten per larva. 2. In the work reported here, predation by Chiastocheta larvae on seeds of Trollius europaeus was analysed as a function of the number of eggs laid on the flower. Flowers with an increasing number of eggs were bagged in three populations and seeds were counted after the end of larval predation, in order to assess whether there was competition among larvae. 3. Seed predation on single-egg flowers was high and variable (mean per population ranging from 15 to 40% of the developed seeds). Seed predation increased weakly with increasing egg load and was lower than gross seed production (always < 85%) whatever the number of eggs laid. This corresponds to a strong decrease in seed consumption per larva with increasing egg load, i.e. severe larval competition for resources. 4. The results suggest that both interference among Chiastocheta larvae and carpel dehiscence may protect T. europaeus seeds from total predation. Estimates of seed predation based on egg load observed in 20 natural populations in the French Alps typically ranged from 30 to 60%. The interaction was always beneficial for the plant and there was no risk of total seed destruction by Chiastocheta larvae, favouring stability of the mutualism.",Chiastocheta; Competition; Mutualism; Pollination; Seed predation; Trollius europaeus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035128801

Mites (Acari: Mesostigmata: Ascidae) that live and feed in the flowers of about 100 plant species are transported in the nares of hummingbirds (Trochilidae). Mites may compete with hummingbirds for nectar secreted by the host plants, and this could affect the dynamics and reproductive outcomes of the mutualism between plants and their pollinating hummingbirds. 2. Here we combined field observations and experimental manipulations to assess the role of hummingbird flower mites (Tropicoseius sp. nov.) on nectar secretion and reproductive output of protandrous Moussonia deppeana (Schlecht. & Cham.) Hanst. (Gesneriaceae) during their flowering period in a cloud forest remnant. 3. During the 4 days that the flowers of M. deppeana last, flowers were visited exclusively by hummingbirds (Lampornis amethystinus). Bud production per inflorescence peaked in December. There were few open flowers per inflorescence in November, but numbers increased as the flowering season progressed (December and January). 4. The availability of each flower phase differed over the flowering season. Staminate-phase flowers were more abundant over the flowering season than pistillate-phase flowers. These differences were statistically significant over time. 5. Nectar availability was reduced by up to 50% in the presence of hummingbird flower mites. Over the 4 days of observation, significantly more nectar was secreted to flowers from which mites were excluded than to flowers with no mite exclusion. The same effect was observed during flowering, but mites consumed a greater percentage of the total nectar secreted in December. 6. Significantly more nectar was secreted during the staminate phase than in the pistillate phase, independent of time and treatment. 7. A manual pollination experiment suggested that mites act like secondary pollinators in this self-compatible, non-autogamous plant, at least in flowers that were not pollinated manually and had no access to pollinating hummingbirds. 8. Although seed production was not reduced significantly by flower mites, our results suggest that the presence of floral mites can affect pollen transmission, as the amount of nectar available to hummingbirds was reduced drastically. This can directly affect hummingbird foraging patterns and reduce the fitness of the host plants.",Hummingbirds; México; Nectar secretion; Pollination biology; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035129160

A high level of selfing may seriously bias estimates of breeding value of parents and affect the reliability of family means for identifying superior crosses. However, there is no reliable information reported indicating the level to which selfing is occurring in sugarcane crosses. The level of selfing was evaluated in eight Australian sugarcane crosses using RAPD markers. The crosses were selected as exhibiting variable levels of performance, as judged by measurements of commercial cane sugar (CCS), cane yield (TCH) and sugar yield (TSH) in plots consisting of random progeny clones. Five to eight male-specific RAPD bands were identified for each cross and used to screen twenty-eight to thirty-eight progeny from each cross. Selfed progeny were identified in each cross on the basis of absence of any male-specific RAPD bands after screening with at least 5 such RAPDs. Levels of selfing ranged from 0 to 17.6%, with most of the crosses exhibiting zero or low levels of selfing.

Wilkiea huegeliana is a small, unisexual, annually flowering tree or shrub of rainforest and associated ecotones in eastern Australia, and is a larval food plant for the Regent Skipper butterfly Euschemon rafflesia rafflesia (Hesperiidae). At this latitude W. huegeliana is pollinated solely by a species of thrips, Thrips setipennis, but T. setipennis is not restricted to W. huegeliana and was recorded from flowers of 13 rainforest plant species. It appears to be the obligate pollinator also for Rapanea howittiana and R. variabilis (Myrsinaceae). Pollinator exclusion experiments were inconclusive but W. huegeliana may be facultatively agamospermous. The recruitment pathway to unrewarding female W. huegeliana flowers is uncertain but attraction may function by automimicry. Both male and female flowers serve as brood sites for T. setipennis larvae. Although the pollination ecology of W. huegeliana is specialized, the family Monimiaceae exhibits a broad diversity of pollination strategies. A number of these are discussed. The apparent obligate and restricted pollinator requirements of W. huegeliana may make it, and any associated phytophagous fauna, vulnerable to the impacts of habitat fragmentation.",Conservation; Monimiaceae; Pollination; Subtropical rainforest; Thrips; Thysanoptera; Wilkiea huegeliana,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035147666

The PCMS line is maintained by self-pollination under short-day conditions (?14.5 h light period), and F1 seeds can be produced by outcrossing of the PCMS line with a pollinator under long-day conditions (?15 h light period). As the levels of male sterility in PCMS lines under the long-day conditions is a crucial factor in determining hybrid purity of the F1 seeds, a study was conducted into the effect of seeding rate on male sterility in PCMS lines. Three different density levels were tested using an alloplasmic line of Japanese wheat cultivar 'Norin 26' which exhibits PCMS. Levels of male sterility of the PCMS line increased at sparse planting, because tiller (ear) number per plant increased at low seeding density and late-appearing ears tended to exhibit higher levels of male sterility than early-appearing ears. On the other hand, male sterility levels of the PCMS lines depended on genotype, e.g., the PCMS 'Fujimikomugi' was completely male sterile, whereas the PCMS 'Norin 26' showed partial male sterility. A PCMS line showing complete male sterility, such as the PCMS 'Fujimikomugi', should produce F1 seeds with high purity. However, the PCMS 'Fujimikomugi' showed a lower female fertility. For practical use, it is necessary to produce PCMS lines having high male sterility with high female fertility under long-day conditions.",Aegilops crassa; Hybrid wheat; Male sterility rate; Photoperiod-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterility; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035144929

Based on Southern analysis and segregation, the transformants contained a single gene copy. In the T3 generation, one line was immune and one line showed resistance to AMV N20. The immune line contained no detectable virus when plant sap from either inoculated or systemic leaves was bioassayed on Phaseolus vulgaris. This line was also immune to the heterologous AMV S40 isolate A line with the coat protein gene in antisense orientatlon (CP-) showed delayed systemic infection but was not immune.

Box 249118, Coral Gables, FL 33124, United States","Mutualistic interactions almost always produce both costs and benefits for each of the interacting species. It is the difference between gross benefits and costs that determines the net benefit and the per-capita effect on each of the interacting populations. For example, the net benefit of obligate pollinators, such as yucca and senita moths, to plants is determined by the difference between the number of ovules fertilized from moth pollination and the number of ovules eaten by the pollinator's larvae. It is clear that if pollinator populations are large, then, because many eggs are laid, costs to plants are large, whereas, if pollinator populations are small, gross benefits are low due to lack of pollination. Even though the size and dynamics of the pollinator population are likely to be crucial, their importance has been neglected in the investigation of mechanisms, such as selective fruit abortion, that can limit costs and increase net benefits. Here, we suggest that both the population size and dynamics of pollinators are important in determining the net benefits to plants, and that fruit abortion can significantly affect these. We develop a model of mutualism between populations of plants and their pollinating seed-predators to explore the ecological consequences of fruit abortion on pollinator population dynamics and the net effect on plants. We demonstrate that the benefit to a plant population is unimodal as a function of pollinator abundance, relative to the abundance of flowers. Both selective abortion of fruit with eggs and random abortion of fruit, without reference to whether they have eggs or not, can limit pollinator population size. This can increase the net benefits to the plant population by limiting the number of eggs laid, if the pollination rate remains high. However, fruit abortion can possibly destabilize the pollinator population, with negative consequences for the plant population.",Benefits; Costs; Fruit abortion; Functional response; Mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035026381

We recorded data on flower features, pollen and ovule number, pollen/ovule ratio, pollen size, self-compatibility, floral visitors, and pollination. Flowers are mostly hermaphrodite, inconspicuous, small, and green. Six species are dioecious. Over 80% of the cosexual species are self compatible. However, many species are dichogamous (mostly protandrous); thus, even the self-compatible species may require pollen transfer. Selfing through geitonogamy seems to be the most common system, and several species express mixed breeding systems. Floral visitors are uncommon to rare, except for two hummingbird species (one native and one endemic) that visit five species we studied. In more than 300 h of observation of flowers over three field seasons, we detected only 23 native insect visits representing ten species (Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera). One species each of an introduced ant and an introduced bee were also observed on some flowers, all near the single human settlement of San Juan Bautista. Wind directly moving pollen, or indirectly via shaking the flowers, is the most important pollen distribution mechanism. The majority of the wind-pollinated species bear some typical anemophilous features, but also others not characteristic of wind pollination, that presumably represent the condition of their biotically pollinated ancestors. Floral features often reflect ancestral reproductive systems, so floral biology studies of oceanic islands in particular must be done with cognizance of presumed ancestral forms, because the observed characters can be misleading.",Angiosperms; Breeding system; Floral biology; Floral visitors; Hummingbird pollination; Island biology; Self-compatibility; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002357176

Headspace odor samples of O. sphegodes flowers showed a significant increase in absolute and relative amounts of all-trans-farnesyl hexanoate after pollination. Flower extracts also indicated an increase of farnesyl hexanoate after pollination. The total amount of the other physiologically active odor compounds decreased slightly. Farnesyl hexanoate is a major constituent of the Dufour's gland secretion in females of the pollinator bees, A. nigroaenea, where it functions in the lining of the brood cells. Furthermore, this compound lowers the number of copulation attempts in males. In dual-choice tests, we showed that flowers artificially scented with an amount of farnesyl hexanoate equal to the increased amount after pollination were significantly less attractive than flowers treated with solvent only. We propose that the increased production of farnesyl hexanoate in pollinated flowers is a signal to guide pollinators to unpollinated flowers of the inflorescence, which represents a new mechanism in this pollination system.",Andrena nigroaenea; Farnesyl hexanoate; Ophrys sphegodes; Pollinator behavior; Post-pollination odor changes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035031757

First, we will assess the state of the art and the trends in thermal-hydraulics (T-H) technology, within the context of replicating and non-replicating information systems. Four T-H examples are used to illustrate that an ever-increasing complexity in formulating and analyzing problems leads to inefficiency, obsolescence and evolutionary failure. By contrast, simplicity, which allows for parsimony, synthesis and clarity of information, ensures efficiency, survival and replication. This comparison (complexity versus simplicity) also provides the requirements and guidance for a success path in T-H development. The second objective of this paper is to demonstrate that scaling provides the means to process information in an efficient manner, as required by competitive (and, thereby, replicating) systems. To this end, the lecture summarizes the essential features of the Fractional Change, Scaling and Analysis approach, which offers a general paradigm for quantifying the effects that an agent of change has on a given information system. The paper will further demonstrate that a single concept and a single method may be used to scale and analyze all transport processes in a given field of interest (fluid mechanics, heat transfer, etc.) and/or across fields and disciplines (mechanics, biology, etc.) Therefore, the paradigm: (1) ensures economy and efficiency in addressing and resolving technical or scientific problems; and (2) enables a 'cultural cross-pollination' between different information systems (disciplines). By means of a simple example in the Appendix, we shall: (1) demonstrate the efficiency to be gained through scaling; and (2) illustrate the inefficiency and wastefulness of computer-based safety studies as presently conducted. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035248442

In self-pollinations of self-incompatible cultivars, pollen tubes were perfectly arrested in the stigmas and styles by 6 days after pollination, while in three self-compatible and 19 cross-compatible pollinations pollen tubes penetrated into the ovaries by 4 to 8 days after pollination. Various abnormal behavior and morphology of pollen tubes were observed in both incompatible and compatible pollinations, but were less common in the compatible ones.

However, numbers of pollen tubes penetrating the ovaries were different in different cultivars. In the pistils of self-incompatible cultivars self-pollinated 4 days after anthesis, pollen tube growth was enhanced to some extent, while in those self-pollinated 6 and 8 days after anthesis pollen tubes could not detected probably because of the degeneration of the styles.

In some cases, parthenocarpic fruit development proceeds without either pollination or fertilization. Parthenocarpic fruit without seed has higher commercial value than seeded fruit. Several apple (Malus domestica) mutants (Rae Ime, Spencer Seedless and Wellington Bloomless) are known to produce only apetalous flowers that readily go on to develop into parthenocarpic fruit. Through genetics, a single recessive gene has been identified to control this trait in apple. Flower phenotypes of these apple mutants are strikingly similar to those of the Arabidopsis mutant pistillata (pi), which produces flowers where petals are transformed to sepals and stamens to carpels. In this study, we have cloned the apple PI homolog (MdPI) that shows 64% amino acid sequence identity and closely conserved intron positions and mRNA expression patterns to the Arabidopsis PI. We have identified that in the apetalous mutants MdPI has been mutated by a retrotransposon insertion in intron 4 in the case of Rae Ime and in intron 6 in the case of Spencer Seedless and Wellington Bloomless. The insertion apparently abolishes the normal expression of the MdPI gene. We conclude that the loss of function mutation in the MdPI MADS-box transcription factor confers parthenocarpic fruit development in these apple varieties and demonstrates another function for the MADS-box gene family.

Research on the effects of soil amendments on the quality of millet straw and grain is scarce, comparative studies of possible quality differences in traditional landraces versus improved varieties and hybrids are lacking.

At similar yield levels, landraces showed a 2.9 and 3.5% higher protein concentration compared with improved varieties and hybrids without a detrimental effect on protein quality as determined by the relative amount of lysine and threonine. Landrace populations also had the highest fat concentrations and the largest micronutrient densities. However, in-vitro digestibility and ME were (79.8% and 12.2 MJ kg-1 respectively) larger for both groups of hybrids. The concentration of ?-carotene was (0.13 ?mol kg-1) highest in the improved varieties, but appeared overall too low to significantly contribute to vitamin A nutrition in local diets.

Arthropods are abundant in urban settings, but little is known about how these animals respond to urbanization. We systematically monitored the structure of ground arthropod communities for 12 months at 16 sites representing the four most abundant forms of urban land use (residential, industrial, agricultural, and desert remnant) in a rapidly growing metropolitan area (Phoenix, AZ). Although taxonomic richness was comparable among land-use types, community composition differed, with certain taxa being uniquely associated with each form of land use. Three taxa (springtails, ants, and mites) were extremely widespread and abundant, accounting for over 92% of captures; when these three taxa were excluded from analysis, however, differences were revealed in arthropod community composition with urban land use. Trophic dynamics also varied with land use: predators, herbivores, and detritivores were most abundant in agricultural sites, while onmivores were equally abundant in all forms of land use. These community-level differences resulted from taxon-specific responses to habitat structure, which varied with land use. Because arthropod community structure is affected by habitat structure and land use, and because arthropods play key roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollination, and soil aeration, the spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems therefore may affect ecosystem functioning. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Arizona; Canonical correspondence analysis; Diversity; Morisita's index of community similarity; Phoenix; Urban,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035847137

The three species are self-compatible but are pollinator-dependent. These three orchid species offer nectar as a reward to pollinators and flower visitors. The two Aspidogyne spp. have a dorsally-adhesive viscidium, a feature which precludes pollinators other than bees. Erythrodes arietina flowers are protandrous and show a ventrally-adhesive viscidium. Aspidogyne argentea is visited by halictid bees (here ranked as probable pollinators) and Hesperiidae butterflies. Aspidogyne longicornu is pollinated by females of Euglossa (Euglossini) and visited by the hummingbird Phaethornis ruber and by the euglossine bees Eulaema seabrai (females) and Eulaema cingulata (males). The pollinarium adheres to the ventral surface of the bee labrum, a very difficult place for bees to clean. The dorsally adhesive viscidium in Aspidogyne parallels that of the Spiranthinae genera of the so-called 'Pelexia alliance'. This condition seems to be particularly adaptative under conditions of low-frequency pollinator visits. Erythrodes arietina is pollinated by bees of the genera Paratetrapedia and Osiris which carry the pollinarium on the dorsal surface of their proboscis. Occasionally, these bees remove pollinaria from their mouthparts using their forelegs.

Historically, one pollinator moth species, Tegeticula yuccasella, was believed to pollinate most yuccas. Recent phylogenetic studies have revealed that it is a complex of at least 13 distinct species, eight of which are specific to one yucca species. Moths in the closely related genus Prodoxus also specialize on yuccas, but they do not pollinate and their larvae feed on different plant parts. Previous research demonstrated that the geographically widespread Prodoxus quinquepunctellus can rapidly specialize to its host plants and may harbor hidden species diversity. We examined the phylogeographic structure of P. quinquepunctellus across its range to compare patterns of diversification with six coexisting pollinator yucca moth species. Morphometric and mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I sequence data indicated that P. quinquepunctellus as currently described contains two species. There was a deep division between moth populations in the eastern and the western United States, with limited sympatry in central Texas; these clades are considered separate species and are redescribed as P. decipiens and P. quinquepunctellus (sensu stricto), respectively. Sequence data also showed a lesser division within P. quinquepunctellus s.s. between the western populations on the Colorado Plateau and those elsewhere. The divergence among the three emerging lineages corresponded with major biogeographic provinces, whereas AMOVA indicated that host plant specialization has been relatively unimportant in diversification. In comparison, the six pollinator species comprise three lineages, one eastern and two western. A pollinator species endemic to the Colorado Plateau has evolved in both of the western lineages. The east-west division and the separate evolution of two Colorado Plateau pollinator species suggest that similar biogeographic factors have influenced diversification in both Tegeticula and Prodoxus. For the pollinators, however, each lineage has produced a monophagous species, a pattern not seen in P. quinquepunctellus. © 2001 Academic Press.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034775423

At the shrubby habitats preferred by the hummingbirds, the available nectar is reduced by nectar-robbing flowerpiercers by some 60%. The low visiting frequency of hummingbirds may be compensated by the high degree of self-compatibility, the long anthesis and the sticky viscin threads that last on the birds for a long time. Additionally, the flowers are very attractive to bumble bees, which show much higher visiting frequencies than hummingbirds and seem to be the plants' most effective pollinators at the site. Hummingbirds, however, may still play an important role for long-distance pollination.

Characteristics less related to pollination (e.g. pedicel length and stem diameter) were roughly twice as variable between individuals as petal or calyx dimensions. The coefficients of variation were in the range 16-19% vs. 7-10%, respectively. Standard and keel petal size varied in parallel, not only in conspecific individuals but also across species and genera, suggesting a tight developmental relationship between these organs and a low potential for evolutionary modification. The remaining characteristics covaried in different ways within and between species and thus appeared much less mutually constrained (particularly so for calyx size). Multivariate analyses of variance revealed significant population divergence in five out of six species. Overall, 28% of all variation in flower size occurred among populations and 72% within populations, but the proportion of variance accounted for by population membership varied extensively across species (from 1 to 64%) and was highest in two selfing annuals (Lupinus). Outcrossing perennials may show either high (Stauracanthus, Genista) or low (Cytisus) population differentiation. In addition to contributing to the increasing amount of data on quantitative floral variation in plants, results of this study may help understand how pleiotropic effects limit the evolutionary modification of some flower traits more than others in diverse plant groups. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Calyx; Corolla; Genisteae; Individual variation; Legumes; Mediterranean; Pollination; Population divergence; Shrub,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035706356

The collection of original data was extensive, based on our own fieldwork, and was combined with data from existing literature. Data recorded include habit, sexual system, flower size, shape, and color, and the hypothesized pollination system of the first colonizers. In addition, the data on compatibility, presence and type of dichogamy, observed floral visitors, presence of floral rewards, and currently known pollination systems are summarized. Pairwise comparisons of different features are tested for statistical association. The flora is typically composed of perennials. The majority of the species have very small or small flowers. Inconspicuous flowers (i.e., a shape character describing flowers with no optical attraction) are widespread, as are dish-shaped flowers. Green is the most frequent flower color, followed by white and yellow. Most species are hermaphroditic, 9% are dioecious, and 9% are monoecious. Some 30% of the species are protandrous and 7% protogynous. Detailed studies of compatibility of about 14% of the flora indicate that 85% of these species are self-compatible (SC). Although most species studied are SC, their level of autogamy is low. Nevertheless, selfing mediated via geitonogamy is the most frequent mechanism of pollen transfer. Outcrossing is mainly achieved through dioecy and self-incompatibility (SI), promoted by dichogamy in the hermaphroditic flowers, and facilitated by wind pollination. About 55% of the species offer nectar rewards, and only 2% offer pollen rewards. Floral visitors are rare to uncommon. Two hummingbird species, one of them endemic, are considered as pollinators for 14 plant species. Flies, moths, and beetles are the native insect visitors to flowers, but they have been documented on only 11 plant species (7%). Even insect visits to these few species were rarely observed. Given the infrequent, irregular, and imprecise nature of native insect association with flowers, there is no certainty that any of the species are truly insect pollinated. Two species of introduced ants and a new endemic bee were recorded as well; however, neither is likely currently important to the pollination of the native flora species. About 9% of the extant flora is currently bird pollinated, and we hypothesize that 47% is wind pollinated. However, we propose that most of the colonizers were ancestrally either insect or wind pollinated. There is association between a number of current floral features and the hypothesized pollination of colonizers. Therefore, to a large extent the flower color, shape, and size of the extant flora may express the pollination syndromes of colonizers rather than representing extant pollination. In addition, the presence of nectar in many species of extant flora does not necessarily indicate biotic pollination. Thus, studies of the reproductive biology on oceanic island plants need to be conducted species by species before broad generalizations can be made, because the observed features can be misleading. Possible changes in the pollination system were assessed by comparison of species for which there are reliable data with the hypothesized pollination of their colonist progenitors. The wind-or bird-pollinated species have retained the pollination system of the colonizers. In other instances, species seem to bear a different pollination system: from ancestral insect systems to current hummingbird- or wind-pollination systems. The lack of alternative means of biotic pollination seems to have led in a number of instances to anemophily - in essence a default pollination system. The lack of strong selection pressure for wind pollination and the relative youth of the archipelago may help explain why the features associated with wind pollination in these species are not so obvious. Because there are many recorded extinctions of vascular plants from islands versus those from continental areas, it is imperative to invest additional effort in protecting the remaining island species. Conservation or restoration programs cannot be effective without a deep and broad understanding of the reproductive biology of the plants. In order to conserve these plants, programs must involve a combination of reproductive and environmental measures. The ultimate fate of some species may depend on preserving the plant-hummingbird relationship, including the web of organisms that affect both plant and pollinator. The populations of introduced animals and weeds must be controlled. Experimentally produced allogamous seeds would enhance diversity in restoration programs. In addition, the preservation of habitat seems to be the central challenge to indirectly protect the unique island species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035715881

We reported previously that seed set in sparse natural populations of Delphinium nuttallianum and Aconitum columbianum was lower than in nearby dense populations, whereas quantity of pollination service was equivalent. To explore the hypotheses that environmental quality or pollination quality are lower in sparse natural populations, leading to lower seed set, we manipulated density using arrays of potted plants. In three replicate experiments with D. nuttallianum, pollinator visitation rate and seed set were indistinguishable in sparse and dense arrays, consistent with the interpretation that environmental quality contributed to the earlier result in natural populations of this species. In three replicates with A. columbianum, visitation rate tended to increase with density, and seed set increased significantly, in contrast to our earlier result. One element of pollination quality, the degree of within-plant selfing, did not vary between sparse and dense arrays.

Flower shape in P. viscosum is the product of an isometric relationship between genetically correlated (rA = 0.70) corolla flare and length. Bumblebee pollinators preferentially visit flowers that are more flared and have longer tubes, selecting for a funnel-shaped corolla. However, flower shape also influences nectar-foraging ants that sever the style at its point of attachment to the ovary. Surveys of ant damage show that plants having flowers with flared, short corollas are most vulnerable to ant predation. Consistent with this result, the ratio of corolla length to flare is significantly greater in a krummholz (high predation risk) population than in a tundra (low predation risk) population. To explicitly test whether the evolution of a better defended flower would exact a cost in pollination, we created tubular flowers by constricting the corolla during development. Performance of tubular flowers and natural controls was compared for defensive and attractive functions. In choice trials, ants entered control flowers significantly more often than tubular ones, confirming that the evolution of tubular flowers would reduce the risk of predation. However, in a bumblebee-pollinated population, tubular flowers received significantly less pollen and set fewer seeds than controls. A fitness model incorporating these data predicts that in the absence of the genetic correlation between corolla length and flare, intermittent selection for defense could allow tubular flowers to spread in the krummholz population. However, in the tundra, where bumblebees account for nearly all pollination, the model predicts that tubular flowers should always confer a fitness disadvantage.",Ecological conflict; Flower predation; Flower shape; Polemonium viscosum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035543313

Orchis boryi is food deceptive and obligatorily insect pollinated. Primary pollinators were Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., which foraged on rewarding plant species nearby and visited O. boryi in between. To analyse floral colour similarity among rewarding plants and O. boryi as perceived by bees, a model of bee colour vision was employed. For each food plant an index was calculated that described the probability of a bee foraging on it to subsequently choose an orchid flower. This choice probability correlated to colour distance according to the model of bee colour vision, indicating that bees chose the deceptive orchid more frequently if they foraged on more similarly coloured species. At different sites different plant species served as models. Bees foraging on food plants from which a high choice rate to the orchid was observed visited the orchid less often after approaching it than other bees, which is likely to reflect avoidance learning. In general, the pollination syndrome appears to be a generalized form of Batesian mimicry, in which similarity to rewarding plants determines reproductive success. As expected by negative density-dependent selection, individual fruit set and pollinia export rate correlated negatively with orchid density, but were unaffected by food plant density, orchid frequency, individual variation of labellum colour, labellum size, or mouth width of the flowers. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Batesian mimicry; Bee colour vision; Generalist bees; Greece; Orchidaceae; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034954811

We studied the diet, time-budget, and densities of its principal pollinator, bellbirds (Anthornis melanura, Meliphagidae), at Craigieburn to find out what aspect of bellbird ecology may be limiting pollination. Direct observations of bellbird diets showed that they are annual generalists on invertebrates (diet range 22 - 85% of food items) and honeydew (diet range 2 - 45%), and concentrate seasonally on mistletoe fruit (18 - 60%) and mistletoe nectar (27 - 58%) when available. The bellbirds at Craigieburn are more insectivorous than New Zealand's other two honeyeaters (tui and stitchbirds). In general, bellbirds are most similar to the short-billed guild of Australian honeyeaters in their beak morphology, foraging behaviour, and diet choice, but with a greater importance of fruit in the bellbird diet. The annual mean number of bellbirds recorded per 5-minute count (1.05) at Craigieburn was relatively low, even compared to other eastern South Island sites, which have lower counts of bellbirds than the western South Island and offshore islands. As mistletoe fruit and nectar were preferred foods when in season, and bellbird counts were low at Craigieburn, we conclude that it is the probable low number of bellbirds in the area, and not their choice of diet, which limits mistletoe pollination and dispersal. The bellbird population at Craigieburn did not appear to be food limited as bellbirds spent less than 20% of their time feeding, and the number of hours per day bellbirds spent feeding and foraging did not change significantly from winter to summer while food resources became more plentiful. Other pressures that limit the bellbird population size, particularly predation from introduced mammals, would appear more likely explanations for poor pollination and disperser services to mistletoes at Craigieburn.",Alepis flavida; Anthornis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035096340

All species required pollinators to produce fruits: P. alata was pollinated by bees, P. speciosa by hummingbirds, and P. galbana and P. mucronata by bats. Pollinators consumed nectar as a food source. The activity of vertebrate pollinators reflected resource availability: they foraged when large amounts of nectar were available and when quantitative resource predictability was greater. The nectar of the vertebrate-pollinated species was richer in cholesterol and phospholipids, and had a potassium-sodium ratio higher than 1.0.

Colony activity was measured as bee trips per ha/d using electric powered photodiode monitors inserted into the hive entrance. Levels of pollination were positively correlated with bee activity levels, up to a mean of ?400 pollen grains per stigma per day, after which greater activity did not result in further increases in daily pollination levels.

We found that an average activity of 2,000 bee trips per hectare per day was more than adequate to ensure sufficient pollination, and that this level of activity could be achieved with 7-15 colonies per hectare, depending on greenhouse conditions. Greenhouses requiring >15 colonies per hectare to achieve this level of pollination may be able to increase bee activity through alteration of greenhouse conditions.

The phylogenetic relationships of fig wasps pollinating functionally dioecious Ficus were inferred from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene sequences (mtDNA) and morphology. Separate and combined analyses indicated that the pollinators of functionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic. However, pollinator relationships were generally congruent with host phylogeny and support a revised classification of Ficus. Ancestral changes in pollinator ovipositor length also correlated with changes in fig breeding systems. In particular, the relative elongation of the ovipositor was associated with the repeated loss of functionally dioecious pollination. The concerted evolution of interacting morphologies may bias estimates of phylogeny based on female head characters, but homoplasy is not so strong in other morphological traits. The lesser phylogenetic utility of morphology than of mtDNA is not due to rampant convergence in morphology but rather to the greater number of potentially informative characters in DNA sequence data; patterns of nucleotide substitution also limit the utility of mtDNA findings.

We found that Eastern Mediterranean orchids do not represent a monophylum, as they belong to all of the three genera into which Orchis s.l. has recently been divided. Although no general geographic distribution pattern may be inferred, some sister terminals either show a broad East/West distribution pattern across the Mediterranean or represent peripheral isolates from a more extended range. The evolution of some sibling species pairs seems to be related to the evolution of different pollination strategies. Anacamptis israelitica represents one of the rare cases of the existence of floral Batesian mimicry, while the endemic Orchis galilaea is the only species among the investigated taxa to be pollinated by sexual deceit, a strategy also implemented in the distant genus Ophrys. Differences in spur features occur between the Eastern Mediterranean Orchis anatolica and Anacamptis dinsmorei and their Western Mediterranean sister species; Anacamptis caspia closely resembles the eroica morphotype of the widespread Anacamptis papilionacea. These patterns of relationships suggest that differences in pollination strategies or in pollinator communities among geographically distant populations or other ecological conditions may lead to changes in floral morphology and biology and eventually to speciation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034824012

Representative species of the hummingbird, bee, bat and moth pollination syndromes were sampled in relation to their numeric importance in the tribe. In hummingbird and bee flowers, which represent 95% of the species in Sinningieae, nectar was sucrose-dominant (ratio [sucrose]/[hexose] > 1).

The main issues considered were 1) the relative importance of various insect taxa as Campanula pollinators, 2) the patterns of pollinators' size and activity as a function of altitude, 3) the effect of pollinator exclusion on floral longevity, and 4) the extent to which the morphological difference of C. versicolor from the other Campanula species on Mt Olympos is expressed in its pollinating fauna. The vast majority of Campanula pollinators were solitary bees. Andrenidae and Megachilidae bees (mainly Chelostoma campanulorum) dominated the pollinating fauna of most species. Melittidae and bumblebees were the commonest pollinators of high altitude species. Campanula versicolor differs from the other Campanula species in that its corolla is not bell-shaped but flat. Mainly Apis mellifera, syrphid flies, and carpenter bees, unlike all other Campanula species on Mt Olympos pollinated it. At the species level, rather large altitudinal differences of Campanula populations did not result into large diversification of their pollinating fauna. The insect visitation rate to flowers decreased with altitude. When pollinators were excluded, the floral longevity of the species examined increased three to five times. Neither flower phase (male of female) was consistently favoured in the absence of pollinators. The pollen loads of the different insect taxa (Apis mellifera included) were of variable purity. The majority of Megachilidae bees carried pollen loads of high purity. Pollen loads from insects visiting Campanula species at high altitudes did not differ significantly in their purity from those visiting lowland species.

The stigma is trilobed, wet and papillate. The branched papillae are confined to a narrow linear zone on each stigmatic lobe. Each stigmatic lobe harbours a deep stigmatic groove, which runs adaxially along the surface. The stigmatic groove is bordered by a well-defined layer of glandular cells, each of which has a pectinaceous cap on the inner tangential wall. The style is hollow. The canal cells show thickenings on the inner tangential wall. The stigmatic groove and stylar canal contain an extracellular matrix secreted by the canal cells which is rich in proteins, acidic polysaccharides and pectins. The canal cells at the base of the style are papillate and loosely fill the stylar canal. The stigma becomes receptive when the stigmatic lobes separate, and remains so for 24 h. Pollination is mediated by weevils as well as by the wind. Under natural conditions the pollination efficiency was 100 %. Pollination induces additional secretion in the stigmatic groove and stylar canal. During post-pollination secretion, the pectinaceous caps of the cells lining the stigmatic groove are degraded. Pollen grains germinate on the stigmatic papillae and tubes grow on the surface of the papillae, entering the stigmatic groove and advancing along it into the stylar canal to eventually gain access to the locules.

We explored pollination success in experimental isolates of the bumblebee- and hummingbird-pollinated wildflower Delphinium nuttallianum. We established a total of 15 arrays of potted plants isolated by 50-400 m from ten natural ""source"" populations, as well as control arrays embedded within each source. Flowers on potted plants were emasculated, so any pollen received could be assumed to come from source populations. A total of 69 h of observation suggested that pollinators were somewhat less abundant in isolates than in controls, but visited more plants and flowers once within an isolate. Consistent with this, 82.1% of all flowers in isolated arrays received pollen, versus 87.7% in controls. Mean receipt was more than 100 pollen grains per flower in most arrays, and seed set in isolates and controls respectively averaged 69.8% and 74.3% of ovules. Furthermore, pollen receipt in isolates declined relatively slowly with distance from the source. We conclude that pollinators of D. nuttallianum often will fly up to 400 m among populations, and that substantial pollination ensues. Thus isolated populations of this species often belong to metapopulations in terms of pollen dispersal, with important consequences for genetic differentiation, and potential implications for the management of endangered plant species.",Conservation; Fragmentation; Gene flow; Isolation; Metapopulation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035033996

Workers of Bombus dahlbomii accounted for >90% of all visits to A. aurea flowers and were the most efficient pollinators on a per-visit basis. As the season progressed, pollen loads carried by bumble bees decreased by almost one order of magnitude, and the amount of pollen deposited per visit decreased as well from >40 to <4 pollen grains from the beginning to the end of the flowering season. As flowering patches became more female, the number of male-phase flowers visited uninterruptedly during each bumble bee foraging bout decreased, while the number of sequential visits to female-phase flowers increased. A laboratory experiment of manipulating dried bumble bees showed that the number of male- and female-phase flowers visited in uninterrupted sequence strongly influences the amount of pollen deposited on a flower's stigma. Pollen deposition in this experiment closely mimicked the relationship between sex ratio and the observed seasonal decline in per-visit pollen deposition in the field. Because overall rate of bumble bee visitation increased monotonically over the flowering season, total pollen receipt per flower also increased during the first half of the season. Nevertheless, pollen deposition decreased during the second half of the season when visitation rates saturated pollen removal, and low pollen availability associated with an increasingly female-biased sex ratio apparently became the limiting factor in pollen transfer. Despite pronounced seasonal changes in pollinator and pollination levels, comparisons of seed output between open- and hand-pollinated flowers showed no evidence that seed production was ever limited by total pollen receipt. Because flower sex ratio influenced pollinator visitation and pollination patterns, and pollinator availability did not limit seed output, protandry should favor the evolution of female and male specialists flowering at the tails of the flowering season. Neither unisexuality nor any other form of sexual polymorphism is found in A. aurea, however. Likewise, I found no evidence that plants might be compensating for a seasonal shift in sex ratio through differential allocation into pollen and ovule production within flowers or to relative duration of male and female sexual phases. These results suggest that a seasonal shift in operational sex ratio within a dichogamous species can profoundly affect pollination without necessarily driving the evolution of floral polymorphism.",Alstroemeria aurea; Bumble bees; Flowering phenology; Pollination dynamics; Pollination efficiency; Protandry; Seed output; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035135771

Controlled pollinations were performed in: (1) fully receptive styles; (2) immature cut styles at or after flower dehiscence; and (3) immature cut styles before flower dehiscence. We show here that pollen germination and tube growth to the ovule occurred in all three treatments, and all produced viable seeds. Remarkably, tubes growing on immature sliced styles of non-dehisced flowers reached the ovules by day 7, 1-2 d faster than tubes growing on normal receptive stigmas. Moreover, more tubes entered the ovary in this kind of pollination and, consequently, more viable seeds were produced. We established histochemically that tube growth in immature sliced styles is concomitant with the presence of lipid secretion. These results fully support the efficiency of the so-called 'one-step pollination' method in Eucalyptus globulus, which we now prove can be applied more successfully to immature non-dehisced flowers. General application of this procedure is likely to have beneficial impacts on the planning and efficiency of large-scale genetic improvement programs. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Eucalyptus globulus; Fertilization; Lipids; One-step pollination; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034957313

In addition to a single species known before as producing floral oil and being pollinated by oil-dependent bees, the present paper documents 11 further species of Sections Sisyrinchium and Echthronema (including Sect. Cephalanthum), which share this ecological status. The oil is secreted by one-celled, headed glandular trichomes which form in many species dense carpets (elaiophors) covering the staminal column basally, rarely parts of free filaments or tepals. Based on literature, 23 additional species possessing columnar hair carpets, presumable elaiophores, are listed. The principal and in some taxa exclusive visitors of oil-bearing S. are species of Lanthanomelissa (Anthophoridae-Tapinotaspidini), a southern genus that appears to have coevolved with its oil hosts. The females bear special scrapers on the forelegs by which they disrupt the oil-filled cuticular blisters of the hairs to forage the fluid. The oil then becomes mixed with pollen passively taken up from the same flower. Species of Tapinotaspis and Chalepogenus (Tapinotaspidini) also forage oil in S. species. The oil-harvesting and pollinating procedure is described in detail for S. arenarium, chilense, pachyrhizum, and laxum. Sympatric S. species may display divergent day-times of flower opening. - Altogether, seven flower types including taxa lacking elaiophors are discriminated in S. The latter - pollen flowers exploited by polylectic bees - are distributed over the genus and predominate in the related genera. The oil-based partnership of S. is so tar only known from the southern Neotropics, the probable centre of origin of both partners. The North America members of S., presumable derivatives from the Neotropical stock, bear vestigial elaiophors no longer used and are pollinated by pollen-collecting bees or are autogamous.",Chalepogenus; Elaiophores; Lanthanomelissa; Oil-collecting bees; Oil-flowers; Pollination biology; Sisyrinchium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035104250

I examined the effect of the spittlebug Philaenus spumarlus on the reproductive output of the monocarpic forb Rudbeckia hirta. Herbivores may effect reproductive output either by reducing resources available for flower and seed production, or by affecting floral and vegetative plant characters, which in turn affect visitation rates by pollinators. For this purpose. I examined the effects of four densities of spittlebugs on plant stature, floral characters, pollination rates, and seed production of R. hirta. I then used path analysis to compare the relative importance of the resource and pollinator limitation pathways. The results indicate that Philaenus reduces both pollinator visitation rates and the number of flowers per flower head, which in turn reduces the number of viable seeds. However, the main route whereby Philaenus affects seed production is by reducing the number of flowers, whereas there seem to be only limited consequences from reducing pollinator visitation rates. The reduced pollinator visitation rates may still affect total plant fitness by reducing male reproductive success.",Male and female fitness; Philaenus spumarius; Plant height; Pollination rates; Pollinator behaviour; Rudbeckia hirta; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035034470

Scent, dominated by Jasmine lactone and (E, E)-Farnesol, is emitted in the evening. A breeding system experiment established that self pollination results in inferior quality fruits. Field observations at three sites in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa, in 1998 and 1999 showed that hawkmoths were frequent visitors to the orchid shortly after dusk, and carry pollinaria along the length of their tongues. No evidence for directional selection on spur length was found at any of the three sites. Results showed that flower longevity is strongly reduced by pollination, while pollinaria removal had only a small effect.

In the unpollinated style, esterified pectins occurred mainly in the cell walls of cortex tissue, while unesterified pectins were present mainly in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the transmitting tract. After pollination no remarkable differences were found in pectin distribution in the ground tissue of the style. On the other hand, in the transmitting tract a reduction in the quantity of unesterified pectins was observed. Unesterified pectins in the extracellular regions of the transmitting tissue decreased before the penetration of the pollen tubes, indicating that pollination induces a reduction in the amount of unesterified pectins in the transmitting-tract ECM. The correlation between the degradation of strongly Ca2+-binding pectins and the growing level of those ions in the extracellular regions of the transmitting tract in the pollinated pistil of P. hybrida (M. Lenartowska et al. 1997) suggests that this process may constitute a mechanism for creating an optimum calcium medium for in vivo-growing pollen tubes.

We looked for the expected positive correlation between quantity and quality of visits in Ipomopsis aggregala, whose red, tubular flowers are considered to be adapted to hummingbirds. Hummingbirds were indeed the most common floral visitors in 5 years of observation. However, long-tongued bumblebees deposited on average three-times as much outcross pollen per visit to virgin flowers, and elicited four-times as much seed production, as did hummingbirds. Hence visitors that are relatively infrequent, and unexpected given the 'pollination syndrome' of the plant, can be surprisingly good pollinators. One interpretation of this observation is that natural selection favours a specialized floral morphology that excludes all but a single type of visitor, but that there are constraints on achieving this outcome. An alternative is that selection favours some degree of floral generalization, but that flowers can retain features that adapt them to a particular type of pollinator in spite of this generalization. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Bumblebees; Floral evolution; Hummingbirds; Ipomopsis aggregata; Pollination syndromes; Pollinator effectiveness; Scarlet gilia; Seed set; Specialization; Temporal variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034769899

All pollinators were females; they laid eggs in flowers of the two nectarless species, but never in the flowers of nectar-presenting species.

Cunn. ex R.Br., their foraging behaviour and their effects on fruit-set were studied at Malava, western Kenya. Grevillea robusta is a popular tree for farm plantings in the eastern and central African highlands. Yield of seed has been disappointingly low in some areas and a lack of appropriate pollinators has been suggested as a possible cause. Investigations involved the monitoring of visitors on active inflorescences, assessment of the rewards available to potential pollinators, and exclusion experiments to establish the effects of various visitors on fruit-set. The flowers are visited mainly by birds and insects. The likely pollinators of G. robusta are sunbirds (Nectarinia amethystina, N. cyanolaema, N. olivacea, N. superba and N. venusta) and white-eyes (Zosterops kikuyuensis and Z. senegalensis). Very little aggressive behaviour between birds was recorded. No nocturnal pollinators were observed. Nectar was the major floral reward for pollinators, but is likely depleted by ants and honey bees, the foraging behaviour of which confirmed them to be nectar-robbers. These insects hardly ever touched stigmas during their visits. Eighty-nine per cent of bird visits were in the morning (07.00-10.00 hours) when nectar volume was highest. Inflorescences bagged to exclude birds set no fruits, and unmanipulated flowers and flowers bagged with self-pollen set no fruits, indicating a self-incompatibility mechanism. Control cross-pollinated flowers displayed greatly increased fruit-set (25.1%) compared with natural open-pollination (0.9%). All these findings confirm the importance of cross-pollen transfer to flowers and the necessity of pollinators for fruit-set. Effective seed production requires activity of pollinators for self-pollen removal and cross-pollen deposition. Seed production stands for G. robusta should be established where flowering is prolific and bird pollinators are abundant.",Breeding system; Grevillea; Nectar; Pollination; Proteaceae; Seed production; Sunbirds; White-eyes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2142667557

A small sticky trap at one female cone caught 3844 adults on a single afternoon; large numbers of thrips were observed entering this cone.

Some species of fig-pollinating wasps are active pollinators, while others passively transfer pollen. In dioecious fig species, the ovules of male figs produce wasps but no seeds. By observations and experiments on four dioecious Ficus species we show that (i) passive pollinators distribute pollen haphazardly within figs, but fertilization of female flowers in male figs is inhibited. Consequently, wasp larvae will develop in nonfertilized ovules: they cannot benefit from pollination; (ii) active pollinators efficiently fertilize flowers in which they oviposit. Lack of pollination increases larval mortality. Hence, fig pollinators are not obligate seed eaters but ovule gallers. Active pollination has probably evolved as a way to improve progeny nourishment.

In this study I quantify variation in visitation rates and foraging behaviour of different insect types (1) in space and time and (2) in relation to variation in floral design (flower size and form) and floral display (number of open flowers) for the distylous clonal shrub Jasminum fruticans. Mean visitation rate showed a significant interaction between insect type and population for seven populations in one year, and between insect types and years for a single population over 3 years. There was also a significant interaction between insect type and population for the proportion of flowers visited. In general the number of visits was positively related to the number of open flowers in a patch, but analyses by insect type showed that this was only true for bee flies and butterflies. Short-tongued bees showed a positive relationship between visitation rate and the number of open flowers on the focal stem, and hawkmoths and butterflies made more visits to plants with larger flowers. Hawkmoths were the only insect type to show a positive relation between the number of flowers visited per foraging bout and flower size. The significant differences between different insect types in patterns of variation in visitation rates in response to floral design and display may act to diversify selection on floral traits, and thereby constrain specialisation of the plant to particular pollinators.",Clonality; Floral traits; Heterostyly; Mediterranean; Oleaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035026522

Don) growing at a coastal and an interior seed orchard in British Columbia. Pollen cones were preformed and overwintered at the sporogenous cell stage before resuming development in early April. Meiosis occurred in May, and pollen was mature by late May or early June. Potential seed-cone buds resumed development in mid-April, and all bracts and ovuliferous scales were initiated before seed-cone buds burst. Comparable stages of development occurred about 2 weeks earlier at the coastal orchard. Numerical phenological stages were assigned to both pollen-cone and seed-cone development. Pollen-cone and seed-cone phenology were very dependent on temperature, whereas pollen release was dependent on both temperature and drying. Degree-days are a useful way to predict seed cone receptivity and to a lesser extent pollen shed at one site in successive years but not between sites. Receptivity and pollen release were fairly synchronized at both sites in both years of the study. The pollination mechanism is described and was similar to other pines studied in a similar manner. Seed cones were erect at receptivity and ovules inverted. Lipid microdrops were secreted on the micropylar arms to which the saccate pollen adhere. After several days of pollen collection on the arms and other cone surfaces, a pollination drop was secreted from the ovule, and if it was large it filled the space between the micropylar arms. Many large pollination drops were observed in cones at the coastal orchard, and the drops scavenged pollen from the arms and nearby cone surfaces. Few and small pollination drops were observed in cones at the interior orchard where low humidity may cause rapid evaporation of the drop. Water applied as a spray at the interior site increased the size of pollination drops or created artificial drops between the arms. At both sites water applied as a fine spray after pollen shed carried pollen from the hairs on the margins of the bracts and scales into the cone and to the ovules.

Plants of three populations of Egyptian origin (local population: Giza 10 and two breeding populations: Multifoliate and Synthetic variety) and three populations originating from southern Italy (Population 14, Population 22 and Sacromonte) were both naturally cross pollinated and inbred by selfing, each under isolation, for four generations (S0, S1, S2 and S3) from 1991 to 1994. Investigations were also conducted to seek efficiency in determining self-fertility after two modes of self-pollination [spontaneous with no manipulation (S) and hand-tripping flowers by toothpicks (ST)]. Head-fertility and seed weight showed a gradual decline with selfing, decreasing by 44% and 14% from S0 to S3, respectively. Giza 10 and Sacromonte appeared to be the most and least affected, respectively, by selfing. Results indicated that the two modes of determining self-fertility were not equally effective and the percentage of seed-set obtained under ST conditions was very high (mean=92%) and absence of the tripping mechanism led to a drastic reduction in self-fertility, Inbreeding resulted in an increase in the number of completely self-incompatible plants, although differences based on geographical origin were obtained. Egyptian populations were the least self-fertile. Berseem populations studied were allogamous, but selection for highly self-fertile plants was possible at the advanced selfing generations.",Breeding; Head-fertility; Inbreeding depression; Open pollination; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035175378

(Gentianaceae) in a greenhouse experiment was studied. The species is self-compatible, not apomictic, and rarely self-pollinates spontaneously. On average, flowers lived for 11.4 days, starting with a male stage of 3.6 and continuing with a female stage of 7.9 days. Pollen viability was highest during the first two days of the male stage, but never exceeded 50%. Seed-set from cross-pollination was higher earlier in the flowering period (77%) than later (63%). For self-pollinations, no significant difference was observed. The success of hand-pollinations declined dramatically after the fourth day of the female stage. Self-pollination yielded lower seed-set on the first day of the female stage than on the following three days. Also, there was a significant difference in seed-set between self- and cross-pollinations (25% vs 55%, respectively) only on the first day. This suggests that selection against self pollen was stronger during the first stage of the female phase and weakened as the stylar tissue aged. In conclusion, two different ways to enhance outcrossing were observed: (1) within the population's flowering period, and (2) within an individual flower's lifespan. Both may have important effects on the genetic variability of G. pneumonanthe offspring under unfavourable conditions. These include small population size (associated with reduced pollinator service), general pollinator scarcity, or rainy summers. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Fecundity; Floral longevity; Pollen viability; Reproductive success; Seed-set; Sexual selection; Stigma receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035118428

The characteristics of these independently evolved mutualisms have resulted from long-term processes, the first stages of which are unknown. A fundamental question in the study of mutualism is how these interactions evolve. Seed predator/pollinator and host plant interactions, which may initially be considered as mainly antagonistic, have the potential to provide good model systems for the study of the first stages of evolution towards mutualism. We present here theoretical models assessing the consequences of interactions between specialized seed predator insects and their host plants. These models describe the parameters that affect the fitness of an individual female seed predator and her influence on the fitness of the host plant. In an optimal strategy for the seed predator, the number of eggs laid in each flower depends on the interaction between the adult and larva survival. Along with a growing predation pressure on adults and larvae several eggs must be laid in each flower by the female seed predator to enhance her fitness. However, in a situation where the host plant selectively aborts flowers with a high number of eggs the fitness of the seed predator will seriously decrease. If the cost of selective abortion is less than the cost of seed predation the host plant will maintain fitness. In a mutualistic relationship a balance between the cost and the benefit of the parameters in the fitness models of the seed predator and the host plant has to occur so that the net seed output is larger than zero (0). Any unselfish behaviour or quality of the seed predator that would benefit the host plant in such a way that the net seed output increases might be a first stage in an interaction becoming mutualistic. The models presented here will not only provide a platform for empirical studies on interactions that may swing from parasitism to mutualism, but also for seed predator/pollinator and host plant interactions in general.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035213106

In three consecutive season it was found that sequentially increasing the density of colonies in the apple orchards from 2.5 colonies per ha., as recommended previously, to 5.0 colonies per ha, and introducing them sequentially (half at the 10% full bloom (FB) and half at FB), increased the number of bees per tree, their mobility among the rows, and the proportion of ""topworkers"" compared with ""sideworkers"".

We determiried how spatiotemporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions affects the evolution of generalized pollination systems. We conducted pollinator exclusion and hand pollination experiments to document annual variability in pollinator reliability and to determine whether pollination systems were redundant (different species are partially or totally substitutable) or complementary (different species have an additive effect on fruit set). The cacti we studied included three species with generalized pollination systems involving bats, birds, and bees (cardon, Pachycereus pringlei; saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea; and organ pipe, Stenocereus thurberi) and one specialized moth-pollinated species (senita, Lophocereus schottii). We predicted that the migratory lesser long-nosed bat, Leptonycteris curasoae, is a less reliable pollinator than birds and bees, and that cacti with generalized pollination systems have more variable flowering phenologies than the specialized species. Annual time of peak flowering and mean size of flower crops were relatively invariant in saguaro and organ pipe. Time of peak flowering in cardon varied by as much as six weeks, and mean flower crop size varied three-fold over six years. In senita, peak flowering varied by as much as 5-8 wk among years. Peak numbers of the nectar bat L. curasoae varied among years, and bat density (0.9/ha) was an order of magnitude lower than that of cactus-visiting birds at both study sites. The abundance of migratory hummingbirds was also highly variable among years. Pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that bats were major pollinators of cardon, whereas diurnal visitors accounted for most fruit set in saguaro (except in 1995 when bats were most important) and organ pipe at our Mexican site; honeybees accounted for 64-87% of diurnal fruit set in these species. Annual variation in the contribution to fruit set by bats was substantially higher than that of diurnal pollinators in saguaro and organ pipe, but not in cardon. There was little geographic variation in the relative importance of nocturnal vs. diurnal pollinators in saguaro and senita, but bats were much more important for fruit set in organ pipe in Arizona than in Mexico. We generally detected no effect of different pollinators on number of seeds per fruit in any species. Annual variation in fruit set was lowest in saguaro, the species with the most diurnal pollination system, and highest in organ pipe, the species with the most generalized pollination system. Fruit set was strongly pollen limited only in females of cardon (a trioecious species) and in organ pipe (at both sites). The ""missing"" pollinators in both species are likely Leptonycteris bats. The pollination systems of saguaro and cardon were partially redundant, whereas that of organ pipe was complementary. The four species of cactus that we studied occur at the northern geographic limits of Mexican columnar cacti where many vertebrate pollinators are seasonal migrants. In the Sonoran Desert, variation in rainfall and spring temperatures affects timing of flowering and the extent of competition between cacti for pollinator visits and causes the relative importance of particular pollinators, especially Leptonycteris bats, for fruit set to vary annually. Under such conditions, selection has favored generalized pollination systems (as seen in organ pipe) or shifts from reliance primarily on nocturnal pollinators (as seen in cardon) to reliance primarily on diurnal pollinators (as seen in saguaro). Nonetheless, as exemplified by the senita - senita moth system, highly specialized pollination mutualisms can also evolve in this habitat in plants that rely on sedentary insects rather than migratory bats and birds for pollination.",Bat pollination; Bird pollination; Columnar cacti; Flowering phenology; Fruit set; Functional redundancy and complementarity; Generalized pollination systems; Geographic variation; Sonoran Desert; Specialized pollination systems,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035198744

We also compared single with double variants of Lotus corniculatus, Saponaria officinalis, Petunia x hybrida and Calendula officinalis. All the British species studied are nectar-rich and are recommended for pollinator-friendly gardens. They showed maximal secretion rates of about 10-90 ?g sugar per flower h?1, and most had mean standing crops of about 5-60 ?g sugar per flower. In all British species studied, the corolla was deep enough for the relatively long-tongued bumblebee Bombus pascuorum, but the shallower flowers of Lythrum salicaria were also much visited by shorter-tongued bees and hoverflies, as well as by butterflies. The exotic Salvia splendens, presumably coevolved with hummingbirds in the Neotropics, has such deep flowers that British bees cannot reach the nectar except by crawling down the corolla. With a secretion rate approaching 300 ?g sugar per flower h?1 and little depletion by insects, S. splendens accumulated high standing crops of nectar. S. splendens, and single and double flowers of the two probably moth-pollinated species Petunia x hybrida and Saponaria officinalis, received few daytime visits despite abundant nectar but Calendula was well visited by hoverflies and bees. We compared single and double variants of Lotus corniculatus, Petunia x hybrida and Calendula officinalis, and also Saponaria officinalis, the last being probably introduced in Britain (Stace, 1997 New flora of the British Isles. 2nd edn. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). In Petunia, Saponaria and Lotus, double flowers secreted little or no nectar. In Calendula, where doubling involved a change in the proportion of disc and ray florets rather than modification of individual flower structure, double and single capitula had similar standing crops of nectar. Except in Calendula, exotic or double flowers were little exploited by insect visitors. In the exotics, this was probably due to the absence or scarcity of coevolved pollinators, coupled, in double flowers, with the absence of nectar. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Anthidium manicatum; Apis; Bombus; Bumblebees; Butterflies; Calendula officinalis; Double flowers; Gardens; Honeybees; Hoverflies; Linaria vulgaris; Lotus corniculatus; Lythrum salicaria; Nectar; Petunia x hybrida; Pollinators; Salvia pratensis; Salvia splendens; Saponaria officinalis; Secretion rate; Stachys officinalis; Stachys palustris; Standing crop; Wild flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034963781

Yet, plants and their pollinators currently face a variety of threats including habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and poisoning by pesticides. As land is increasingly converted to human uses, the diversity and abundance of plants and pollinators is likely to decline. Plants with small or low-density populations, including many rare species, can receive fewer pollinator visits, which could lead to fewer seeds, higher selfing rates, and more inbreeding depression. Recent research indicates that introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) can competitively displace native pollinators, and because honeybees are often poor pollinators compared to native bees, the reproductive success of native plants might decline. Application of chemical pesticides can have adverse effects on pollinator populations and reduce natural pollination and subsequent seed set in wild plants. Insecticide-free buffer zones might be needed around some rare plant populations. Plant species that are most vulnerable to pollinator loss are those that depend on a single pollinator species. Many species reduce their risk of pollinator loss via compensatory mechanisms such as multiple pollinators, self-pollination, or by decreasing their dependence on seeds via vegetative reproduction or long life spans. These traits, however, are unlikely to compensate in the long term for a continuous decline in pollination services. Key to slowing the rate of species loss and keeping natural pollination systems intact is habitat preservation. For rare species that depend on pollinators, conservation managers may need to consider factors that influence the welfare of pollinators. Moreover, the size of preserves is important because pollinator nest sites, larval food plants, and foraging sites may be spatially separated and occupy different habitats. Given that pollination interactions often involve multiple species assemblages and large landscapes, a community or ecosystem-based management perspective is needed.",Biodiversity; Habitat fragmentation; Pesticides; Pollination services; Rare species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035122135

To investigate this possibility, we hand pollinated flowers on plants at two sites on Banks Peninsula and compared their reproductive success with unmanipulated flowers on the same plants. In the 1999 season at Buckleys Bay, fruit initiation was 3.3 times higher on hand-pollinated flowers (66.6% of flowers) than unmanipulated flowers (20.0%), and fruit set was 2.7 times higher (47.9% versus 18.0%, respectively). In developed fruit, seed set per fruit was higher for hand-pollinated (70.9% of ovules) than unmanipulated flowers (48.0%). The results indicate that 34% of ovules from hand-pollinated flowers, but 9% of ovules from unmanipulated flowers, set seed. Germination rates did not vary significantly among treatments. In the 2000 season, at both sites, fruit set of hand-pollinated flowers was at least 1.7 times higher than unmanipulated flowers (P = 0.028), and fruit set of unmanipulated flowers did not differ significantly from that of bagged flowers from which all pollinators were excluded (P = 0.98).

A pollinarium-carrying insect visiting another flower will brush the stigmatic surface and leave clumps of pollen, thus effecting pollination.

Box 69, Lincoln, New Zealand","We developed a conceptual model for evaluating the benefits of wind pollination to mast-flowering species. The benefit that a plant population gains from mast flowering via increased wind pollination efficiency was predicted from how far pollination efficiency at mean seed crop size falls below the maximum. Species were most likely to benefit from mast seeding if mean reproductive effort in the field gave an intermediate level of pollination efficiency, regardless of the cost of unpollinated female structures. To quantify the benefits of different degrees of mast flowering, a simulation model was used to alter the seed production coefficient of variation (cv) and to calculate its effects on weighted mean pollination efficiency. The model was applied to seven real data sets for five species with pollination benefits from masting that ranged from relatively small (Chionochloa pallens), to moderate (Dacrydium cupressinum, Betula alleghaniensis), to large (Nothofagus solandri, N. menziesii). Many studies have reported higher seed production coefficients of variation at higher altitudes and latitudes within a species. Our model showed that higher coefficients of variation are favored by reduced mean seed output per plant at higher altitudes. Data for N. solandri at three altitudes in one site showed much higher pollination benefits from masting at higher altitudes. Reduced plant density (e.g., through fragmentation), which also lowers mean flowering effort per unit area, resulted in large increases in masting benefits in N. solandri, but only small increases in C. pallens. These contrasting results were primarily due to differences between the two species in mean reproductive effort vs. wind pollination efficiency, rather than to differences in the effects of fragmentation and altitude. The relative effects of masting on pollination, insect seed predation, and bird seed predation were modeled in B. alleghaniensis. Masting produced a small economy of scale from insect predator satiation, but an almost equivalent diseconomy of scale resulted from increased levels of bird seed predation. Efficiency of wind pollination improved moderately with increasing cv, providing some overall benefits from masting in this species. Accordingly, we propose that masting can be favored by either one dominant economy of scale (such as wind pollination efficiency in N. solandri or predator satiation in C. pallens), or a balance among several factors (such as pollination, predator satiation, and predator attraction in B. alleghaniensis). We predict that, in the absence of any selective benefits or disadvantages of masting, plants would be expected to have coefficients of variation in the range 0.85-1.35.",Economies of scale; Fragmentation; Mast flowering; Mast seeding; Modeling; New Zealand; Predator satiation; Seed set; Selective advantage; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035136518

Net selection on plant traits, such as defensive chemistry, may be difficult to predict from studying either of these interactions in isolation. In this study, alkaloids were manipulated experimentally in the hemiparasitic annual plant Castilleja indivisa (Scrophulariaceae; Indian paintbrush) by growing these parasites with bitter (high-alkaloid) or sweet (low-alkaloid) near-isogenic lines of the host Lupinus albus (Fabaceae) in the field. To evaluate the effect of herbivores, half of the Indian paintbrush plants were randomly assigned to a reduced-herbivory treatment using insecticide, and the other half to a natural-herbivory treatment. Floral traits, bud and fruit herbivory, pollination, alkaloids, and plant performance were measured. These variables were used in a path analysis to dissect the direct and indirect effects of herbivory and pollination on lifetime seed set, and the direct and indirect effects of alkaloids on seed set via herbivory and pollination. Bud herbivory and fruit herbivory directly decreased seed production, whereas pollination had a direct positive effect. In addition, bud herbivory had negative indirect effects on seed set by reducing the number of open flowers, which reduced pollinator visits. Alkaloids directly reduced bud herbivory but did not significantly affect pollination or fruit herbivory directly. However, because bud herbivory indirectly reduced seed set by reducing pollinator visits to flowers, alkaloids also had additional indirect benefits for plants by increasing pollination. Overall, the net benefit of alkaloid uptake was due to both reduction in herbivory and an increase in pollinator visits to flowers. This study demonstrates the importance of considering multiple interactions simultaneously when attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying correlations between plant traits and fitness.",Alkaloids; Castilleja indivisa; Direct effects; Floral herbivory; Fruit predation; Hemiparasitic plants; Indian paintbrush; Indirect effects; Lupinus albus; Path analysis; Pollinators; Secondary compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034918337

The theory underlying this biotic pollination hypothesis contradicts more generally accepted evolutionary theory. Furthermore, various lines of empirical evidence falsify the biotic pollination hypothesis: (a) several lineages of plants were insect pollinated - angiosperms, Gnetales, Bennettitales, Cheirolepidiaceae, Medullosales, and Cycadales - yet only the first four were ever diverse or underwent radiations; (b) the predicted rise in insect diversity, which was coupled with angiosperm radiation, does not appear in the fossil record; (c) the family Poaceae (grasses) are wind pollinated, yet are exceptionally diverse and species-rich; and (d) the family Formicidae (ants) were not pollinators, yet are exceptionally species-rich and ecologically dominant. I enumerate many alternate (and seldom investigated) hypotheses for these patterns of seed plant diversity, keeping in mind that although I show that insect pollination was neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for large numbers of species, it may have played a substantial role in both plant and insect speciation.

Flowering is not continuous during the season and mass bloom recurs only on certain days with 2-5 days interval or sometimes there may be little flowering in between two days of massive bloom. A tree may have five such occasions of mass bloom. At the inflorescence level such intermittent flowering occurs also. The flowers open at the mid of night and are bright yellow in colour. They are typically papilionaceous flag blossoms and thus zygomorphic. They are homogamous and are visited by the rockbee Apis dorsata at moonlit nights: or otherwise at dawn and up to 0730 h. The flowers permit several effective visits by the rockbee and as long as the pressure of the bee continues the stamens and stigma project from the keel and permit sternotribic pollination. Controlled pollinations show fruit formation after autogamy (25%), geitonogamy (60%) and xenogamy (85%). Staggered anther dehiscence minimises pollen discounting. Flower bud, flower and fruit abortions occur on a large scale. Natural fruiting is yew low compared to the mass bloom. Compatibility to geitonogamy and autogamy may function as a reproductive assurance mechanism. The natural habitat of P. santalinus has a hot dry climate, and the nocturnal flowering and foraging of the rockbee at that time during moonlit nights appear to be an adaptation to avoid the adverse effects of daytime high temperatures.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035693575

Although no general geographic distribution pattern may be inferred, some sister terminals either show a broad East/West distribution pattern across the Mediterranean or represent peripheral isolates from amore extended range. The evolution of some sibling species pairs seems to be related to the evolution of different pollination strategies. Anacamptis israelitic are presents one of the rare cases of the existence of floral Batesian mimicry, while the endemic Orchis galilaea is the only species among the investigated taxa to be pollinated by sexual deceit, a strategy also implemented in the distant genus Ophrys. Differences in spur features occur between the Eastern Mediterranean Orchis anatolica and Anacamptis dinsmorei and their Western Mediterranean sister species; Anacamptis caspia closely resembles the eroica morphotype of the widespread Anacamptis papilionacea. These patterns of relationships suggest that differences in pollination strategiesor in pollinator communities among geographically distant populations or other ecological conditions may lead to changes in floral morphology and biology and eventually to speciation. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025346684

In recent years, genes coding for the expression of insecticidal proteins in Bt have been transferred into the genomes of several crop plants by means of genetic engineering. The resulting Bt lines are able to autonomously produce toxins in order to kill relevant herbivore species. 2 Based on previous tritrophic laboratory trials that showed negative effects on nontarget organisms (e.g. the economically important predator Chrysoperla carnea), concerns have been raised regarding the environmental safety of transgenic Bt crop plants. They include biodiversity issues as well as the maintenance of functions in agro-ecosystems, like pollination and biological control of pests. 3 The EU project Bt-BioNoTa will study non-target effects of different transgenic crop plants (maize, oilseed rape, potato, eggplant) expressing various Bt toxins through multidisciplinary cooperation of five European research institutions. As part of the project, we will investigate possible effects on diversity as well as bi- and tritrophic interactions between transgenic plants, pollinators, non-target herbivores, and their predacious natural enemies in laboratory and field experiments. 4 We will conduct greenhouse feeding experiments with selected plant-pollinator, plantherbivore, and plant-herbivore-predator systems on transgenic and non-transgenic varieties. Life history parameters will be analysed on an individual basis. Differences in insect species diversity between Bt and non-Bt crops will be studied in field trials in Italy and Hungary. 5 The set-up of the project meets the increasing demand for a better understanding of the environmental impacts of insect resistant transgenic plants. Its outcome will contribute to the establishment of EU policies and regulations for approval and use of Bt crops in Europe.",Agro-ecosystems; Bacillus thuringiensis; Biodiversity; Non-target effects; Transgenic plants; Tritrophic interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034851651

The mechanisms that prevent pollinating wasps from exploiting all the flowers inside a fig are not understood. In this study, hypotheses about flower use by pollinating fig wasps were tested by investigating egg deposition patterns in three species. Either one or three wasps were introduced into figs. The figs were then harvested. Serial sections allowed assessment of the presence or absence of a wasp egg in a sample of flowers in each fig. The overall proportion of flowers with eggs and the spatial distribution of eggs were then compared in single wasp figs and three foundress figs. In all species, the proportion of flowers with a wasp egg increased with foundress number but less than three-fold. In all species, at least in single foundress figs, flowers near the fig cavity were more likely to receive a wasp egg than were flowers near the fig wall. In two species, when the number of foundresses was multiplied by three, there was an increase in the use of flowers near the fig wall, while in the third species, the increase was spread evenly among flowers.

Here we show that pollination is typically cleistogamous and the species is an obligate inbreeder. The flowers lack petals and sepals. The essential organs are covered by a spathe, surrounded by 2 or 3 pairs of bracts. The two anthers that are borne on a forked filament are placed adjacent to the globular ovary. A pair of staminodes arise from the base of the anther filament. The style is absent and the ovary bears two spoon-shaped stigmatic lobes at the apex. Pollination occurs before anthesis. This is affected by close proximity of the stigmatic lobes and the anthers and en masse transference of pollen grains (that occur in pairs, dyads) to the stigma. A large number of pollen grains germinate on the stigma and the pollen tubes enter the ovules 16-18h after pollination. Fruits are anisolobous, stalked and rounded and dehisce by means of an oblique slit. The average number of seeds per fruit is 115 ± 43.4.

Progeny resulting from tip pollination was compared with that resulting from entire pollination. Significant increase in several growth parameters of progeny resulting from tip pollination indicated enhanced vigour compared to that resulting from entire pollination.

Although the effects of population size have frequently been examined, the contributions of regional gene flow to levels of genetic variation are less well known. Here I examine the effects of population size and the number of neighboring populations (metapopulation density) on the distribution and maintenance of genetic diversity in an endemic herbaceous perennial. Reductions in the proportion of polymorphic loci and the effective number of alleles per locus were apparent for many populations with a census size of less than 100 individuals, but no effects of population size on levels of inbreeding were detected. I assess the effects of regional population density on levels of diversity and inbreeding using stepwise regression analysis of metapopulation diameter (i.e., the size of a circle within which population density is estimated). This procedure provides a spatially explicit evaluation of the effects of metapopulation size on population genetic parameters and indicates the critical number of neighboring populations (fragmentation threshold) for the regional maintenance of genetic diversity. Stepwise regression analyses revealed fragmentation thresholds at two levels; at a scale of 2 km, where small metapopulations resulted in greater levels of selfing or sibling mating, and at a scale of 8 km, where metapopulation size was positively associated with higher levels of genetic diversity. I hypothesize that the smaller fragmentation threshold may reflect higher levels of selfing in isolated populations because of the absence of pollinators. The larger threshold probably indicates the maximum distance over which pollen dispersal rates are high enough to counteract genetic drift. This study demonstrates that the regional distribution of populations can be an important factor for the long-term maintenance of genetic variation.",Dispersal; Genetic erosion; Inbreeding; Metapopulation density; Population size; Specialized pollination syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034794750

We estimated the magnitude of pollen dispersal across rows (pollinator cultivars: Idared, Vista Bella, Granny Smith), and along rows, (pollinator cultivars Fuji, Paulared, Golden Russet), in two high-density orchards in Ontario, Canada. Fruit were sampled from trees at regular intervals along transects that extended beyond (either across or along row) each pollinator cultivar and the percentage of seeds that were sired by the pollen donor was estimated using allozyme markers. Seeds sired by the pollinator cultivar were found from seven ('Granny Smith') to 18 rows ('Idared') from the nearest pollinator tree and from seven ('Fuji', 'Paulared') to five trees ('Granny Smith') down the same row. Measured in metres, the maximum pollen dispersal distance was greater across rows (62.4 m) than along rows (13.7 m). However, the average dispersal distance across rows, expressed in metres or trees, (17.4 m ± 3.6, ± + 0.7 trees) did not differ from that along rows (5.8 m ± 4.1, 2.7 ± 0.8 trees).

After studying the basic aspects of the floral morphology and reproduction of Macleania bullata (Ericaceae) in a tropical montane wet forest in southwest Colombia, I examined the percent of flowers robbed and the effect of nectar robbery on fruit set. The flowers of this species are typical for plants pollinated by long-bill hummingbirds. They are protandrous and open for four days. Fruit production requires a pollinator visit; fruit set following pollinator exclusion was zero. Fruit set following xenogamous pollen transfer (36.8%) differed significantly from that of population controls (11.9%) and of autogamous pollen transfer (6.3%). Nectar volume, sugar concentration and sugar production were measured at daily intervals from bud opening until the fading of flowers. Daily nectar production (both volume and amount of sugar) varied considerably with flower age. Sugar production peaked on the second day, coinciding with the male phase. The frequency of nectar robbing in the studied population was very high (75% of examined flowers) and was positively correlated with reduced fruit set. I discuss the probability of a relation between reduced fruit set on robbed flowers and an energetic investment.

Honey bees were the most common visitors at each of three transects established at three study locales in California: University of California at Davis, Cosumnes River Preserve, and Santa Cruz Island. A significant correlation existed between honey bee visitation levels monitored in all these transects and the average number of viable seeds per seed head for the same transects. Selective exclusion of honey bees at flower heads using a 3 mm diameter mesh significantly reduced seed set per seed head at all locales. Seed set depression was less dramatic at the island locale because of high visitation rates by generalist halictid bees Augochlorella pomoniella and Agapostemon texanus that penetrated the 3-mm mesh. The introduced megachilid bee Megachile apicalis occurred at all three locales as well (though in much lower numbers) and may contribute to pollination. In an ancillary study, seed set of plants with bagged heads was compared with that of plants without any bagged heads to test for resource shunting effects. These results showed that seed set differences observed between treatments within a single plant were not exaggerated due to resource shunting induced by the bagging technique. Yellow star-thistle may have low or variable levels of self-compatibility (as reflected by low seed set levels in small-mesh bags), increasing the importance of pollination in its breeding system. These results suggest that honey bees and yellow star-thistle may act as invasive mutualists, an association that may extend to other nonnative plant and pollinator species from Eurasia.","Apis mellifera; Centaurea solstitialis; Channel Islands, California; Invasions; Mutualism; Pollination, honey bees and alien plants",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035658949

The development of monosymmetry in the family can be observed as a stepwise process linked with displacements of organ primordia and selective losses of petals and stamens. Flowers are weakly (Bersama) to strongly (Melianthus) monosymmetric. Sepal initiation is divided into two time sequences: the three outer sepals arise simultaneously with the anterior sepals behaving as a shielding unit before the two inner sepals emerge. Similarities and differences between the two genera are shown to be related to the trend to monosymmetry and are linked to specific pollination strategies. In Melianthus, an abaxial petal primordium is initiated, but it aborts at an early stage of development; in Bersama, all petals are present, but the incipient monosymmetry is visible at the onset of initiation. In Bersama, four stamens are the rule, but flowers pentamerous in all whorls are occasionally found. The nectary develops in a pouch formed between the adaxial sepal and the androecium. There is little ontogenetic evidence for a staminodial nature of the ""beak"" formed between the posterior stamens; it develops as a protective extension of the filament tube. A reduction sequence in the number of ovules can be seen by the progressive size limitation of the placentas. In Bersama, only one ovule arises on a marginal placenta and becomes displaced in a central position during development. The vasculature of different species is compared. The development of vascular traces is strictly linked with the initiation and external development of the floral organs. In both Melianthus and Bersama, the nectary is partly supplied by an odd adaxial trace. Our data support a relationship of Melianthaceae with Greyiaceae and Francoaceae, concordant with macromolecular results. It may be suggested that polysymmetric flowers of Bersama are secondarily derived from monosymmetric ones.",Abortion; Developmental morphology; Francoaceae; Greyiaceae; Melianthaceae; Molecular data; Monosymmetry; Nectaries; Pollination mechanism; Sapindales; Systematics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035150289

Regression analyses of phenotypic data from a large, segregating hybrid population, established in a semi-natural (garden) environment and studied over a 2-year period, revealed a negative relationship between the size of the rays and the average germination rate of the maternal seed crop, a pattern that can be attributed to the reduced germination speed of achenes from ray florets. There was no effect of ray size on the amount of cross-pollination achieved, the proportion of heads infested by larvae of seed flies (Pegohylemyia) and the amount of resources retained for the next flowering season. The lack of resource costs was also apparent in a manipulation experiment with greenhouse-grown plants of the rayed phenotype: artificial removal of all rays at the early bud or flowering stage had no detectable effect on subsequent flower and fruit development, regardless of whether the plants experienced high or low water stress. Given these and other observations, I hypothesize that plant-animal interactions and resource costs sometimes play a minor role in exerting selection on flower morphology and that spatially varying selection on germination behaviour accounts for some of the morph frequency variation in S. jacobaea. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Floral display; Fruit dimorphism; Phenotypic evolution; Pollinator attraction; Resource allocation; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034803825

In this study we quantified floral damage of Aconitum lycoctonum in high (>2000 m) and low (c. 500 m) elevation populations in Switzerland. At high elevation, floral damage was frequent and was caused by nectar-robbing short-tongued bumblebees. Nectar robbers make a hole in the flower when they collect nectar. A nectar robber exclusion experiment showed that nectar robbery by short-tongued bumblebees had no effect on the female reproductive success of plants; robbing bees rarely damaged the nectaries, and damage to the petals probably does not decrease flower longevity. In addition, nectar robbers tended to collect pollen during about 10% of their visits. Thus, these bees may act as low-efficiency pollinators and may, at times, be mutualistic associates. At low elevation, the holes in the flowers were caused by beetles (Meligethes viridescens) and not by short-tongued bumblebees. The beetles eat pollen and might also consume nectar. Since the beetles gain access to pollen and nectar by entering the flower through its opening, and later chew holes while foraging on floral tissue, the beetles are pollen eaters rather than nectar robbers. Overall, our results show that not all floral damage is caused by nectar robbers and that there can be strong altitudinal variation in the causes and consequences of floral damage.",Beetles; Bumblebees; Mutualism; Nectar robbery; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035039795

These theories were evaluated in Ecballium elaterium, which contains two subspecies, elaterium (monoecious) and dioicum (dioecious). Our results show that flowers of the dioecious subspecies are larger and allocate more to reproductive organs than do flowers of the monoecious subspecies. Both subspecies are sexually dimorphic (male flowers larger than female flowers). Variance in flower size among populations is greater in the dioecious subspecies. Finally, there is sufficient genetic variation to enable ongoing response to selection; genetic correlation constraints on independent response of female and male flowers may be stronger in the monoecious subspecies.

An aerobiological sampler recorded airborne pollen concentrations and deposition at the sample site from mid-December 1998 to the end of January 1999. Grid-based weather data was used to model the movement, position, and elevation (air mass trajectories) across the region. While a normal concentration distribution is expected for a pollination event at a single site, ""very high"" concentrations (> 1500 pollen grains per cubic meter) creating ""peaks"" in the deposition record were identified using bi-hourly sample analysis of the pollen registrations in the sampler. These occurrences happened over a 2 1/2 week period beginning January 11 and are coincident with the occurrence of southerly winds throughout the region. Modeled trajectories indicate that the air masses associated with those occurrences traveled at ground level through the J. ashei population on the Edwards Plateau, some 200 kilometers to the south in Texas, then gained altitude prior to crossing the sample site, thus introducing a long-range pollen component at the sample site. Peaks with ""high"" concentrations (90 to 1500 pollen grains per cubic meter) were evaluated using the same methodology. Those peaks associated with trajectories having the potential of introducing a long-range component to the pollen deposition record were removed from the aerobiological record. The resulting adjusted aerobiological record shows a more normal pollen concentration distribution, reduced hourly variability, and a marked shift in the pollination initiation date.

The phylogeny suggests the existence of two well-circumscribed clades composed, respectively, of species with poricidal pollen locules (Boschia) and species with pollen locules that open with longitudinal slits (Durio s.str.). The latter clade is subdivided into two strongly supported clades: /Tubulidurio, with highly fused filaments and free calyx lobes, and /Palatadurio, with largely free filaments and connate calyx lobes. We provide phylogenetic definitions for the names of these well-supported clades. Reconstruction of floral evolution is consistent with the hypothesis that vertebrate pollination is ancestral for Durio s.lat. and Cullenia. However, there have been further shifts in pollination system within Durio s.lat., which may account for some of the current diversity of floral characters. The correlation of fruit and aril characteristics suggests that there are two major dispersal syndromes, involving either birds (fruits opening on trees; aril red/yellow and odorless) or terrestrial mammals (fruits opening only after falling to the ground; aril pale colored and pungent). The distribution of extant taxa implies a Malesian origin and radiation of the study group, with a single dispersal of Cullenia to India and Sri Lanka. However, the fossil pollen record raises the possibility that Durio and relatives may have migrated to Southeast Asia from the Indian subcontinent after it collided with Asia. A molecular clock analysis suggests that the earliest divergence within the study group occurred about 20 to 32 mya and, hence, does not favor either biogeographic scenario.",Boschia; Cullenia; Dispersal biology; Durio; Flower evolution; Fruit evolution; Historical biogeography; Molecular systematics; Phylogenetic nomenclature; Pollination biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011275955

The seller population experienced much lower inbreeding depression (?=0.05 ± 0.02 SE) than the outcrossers (?=0.19 ± 0.02 SE). The negative association between genetic load and selfing rate suggests that purgable partially recessive alleles are the primary source of inbreeding depression, as does its late expression in both populations. Inbreeding depression in the seller population, which naturally consists of highly inbred lines, was used to calculate the mean dominance (h=0.33) and incidence rate (U=0.30) of deleterious mutations. In the outcrosser population, significant variation among individuals in the expression of inbreeding depression may reflect lineage-specific differences in inbreeding history or, more probably, random variation in mutational load. The low (?0.5) inbreeding depression of outcrossers suggests that the maintenance of a mixed mating system in some A. uniflora populations and the evolution of nearly cleistogamous self-pollination in others may reflect local pollinator-mediated selection for selfing rather than the constant 3:2 genetic advantage invoked by many models.",Arenaria uniflora; Genetic load; Inbreeding depression; Mating system; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034964865

Outcrossed and selfed progeny mothered by the trees and those dispersed from other trees were distinguished by genotypes of three polymorphic microsatellite loci. The mean outcrossing rate of mature fruit embryos in S. leprosula pollinated by thrips (0.91) was not lower than those previously reported from Shorea species pollinated by bees, even though thrips seem to be less efficient pollinators than bees. Although four of the five trees showed high and stable outcrossing rates during fruit maturation, the outcrossing rate increased in one tree with highly selfed embryos of immature fruits. These results suggest that inbreeding depression during fruit maturation as well as self-incompatibility reduce the proportion of inbred embryos. The proportion of fruits dispersed from neighbor trees in fruits trapped under a tree crown had a mean value of 0.20 and was lowest under the tree with highly selfed embryos of immature fruits. This low fraction of dispersed fruits under this tree suggests long distances from this tree to reproductive neighbors, which may reduce cross pollination.",Fruit abortion; Malaysia; Outcrossing rate; Pasoh; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035145359

Species-month curves indicate that the sampling effort resulted in capture of most of the flower-visiting animal species in the park. A total of 143 insects and 1 bird species were recorded. Diptera were the most diverse group (55 spp.), followed by Lepidoptera (42 spp.) and non-apoid Hymenoptera (34 spp.). The majority of species were rare (56% of species were found on fewer than five trips). The highest diversity of species was found from January to May during the peak flowering period in some plant communities. The greatest total diversity was found in Long Pine Key and Shark Valley had the lowest diversity. Chekika and Flamingo were intermediate in diversity. Animals visited 178 plant species, ?26% of the potentially animal pollinated Angiosperm diversity of the park. Twenty-five species of plants had only non-apoid flower visitors; the majority of these species had only visits by Lepidoptera. Potentially important pollinator species include members of the Syrphidae, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. However, many of the flower-visiting species may not be effective pollinators.

In each pot, the following attributes of individual flowers were quantified: petal length; petal width; stamen length; pistil length; pollen production; diameter of pollen grains; and nectar production. Certain plants contained a transgenic marker that enabled the vigour of their pollen to be quantified by screening the progeny from post-pollination trials against conventional male competitors. Plant size was strongly affected by plant density; plants in the lowest density pots comprised ten-times more dry biomass than individuals in the highest density pots. However, none of the attributes of individual flowers varied with density. In contrast, the number of flowers per plant declined rapidly with density. In the face of resource scarcity, the plants apparently conserved flower size rather than flower number. There was no difference in the response to density between transgenic and conventional plants, but transgenic plants obtained more fertilizations than expected in post-pollination competition against conventional competitors. A separate experiment demonstrated that B. napus is, nevertheless, capable of plasticity in certain flower attributes (petal size, stamen length) in response to defoliation.

The species was protogynous and self-compatible, but self-deposition of pollen was inefficient. Hand-pollination increased capsule mass significantly, indicating that reproductive success was severely pollen limited. An experiment designed to test the relative importance of insect pollination in comparison to water availability (precipitation) and shelter (temperature and wind), revealed that exclosure of insects decreased capsule mass significantly, as did watering, whereas shelter tended to increase capsule mass. Pollination was the most important determinant of reproductive success, and the study suggests that pollen limitation may be particularly severe for early-flowering species, i.e. pollen-riskers, in exposed locations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035694118

Such a strategy is highly unusual in the plant kingdom. We conducted experiments in order to manipulate the reward strategy of the rewardless bumble-bee-pollinated orchid Barlia robertiana by adding sucrose solution to inflorescences. We found that supplementation decreased the probability of a pollinator removing pollinia by approximately ten times. Despite pollinators visiting many more flowers per inflorescence on supplemented plants, eight times fewer pollinia were removed from supplemented inflorescences during each visit. Pollinia deposition patterns were not significantly affected by supplementation and no geitonogamous deposition was recorded. In populations where inflorescences were supplemented for 20 days, pollinia removal was reduced by over half for supplemented inflorescences, whereas fruit set was unmodified by supplementation. We conclude that rewardlessness would increase total seed paternity, but not change either total seed maternity or the probability that offspring were outcrossed in this species.

Linanthus parviflorus, a self-incompatible species, was found to be pollen limited for some measures of reproductive success in all populations in 1 yr and in two populations in the other. In contrast, no significant pollen limitation was detected in Linanthus bicolor, a highly selfing species, and in two populations of Linanthus jepsonii, a partially outcrossing but self-compatible species, indicating that autogamous selfing is providing reproductive assurance in most populations of these species. Significant spatial and temporal variation in pollen limitation was found in L. parviflorus and L. jepsonii. Although variable pollinator abundance is likely to have been one cause of the observed variation, it appears that a number of other factors, including resource availability, wind pollination, and pollen inviability, also contributed to variation in the magnitude of pollen limitation.

Path coefficient analyses were performed to partition genotypic correlation coefficients between essential oil yield and other remaining eight quantitative and qualitative component traits. Moderate to high estimates of heritability and genetic advance were observed for plant height, leaves number/plant, total herbage yield, and geraniol and geranyl acetate contents.

The negative correlation coefficient of geraniol content with total essential oil content was attributed to its negative indirect effect through plant height. High heritability associated with high genetic advance for the three quantitative traits (plant height, total leaves/plant and total herbage yield) revealed the involvement of additive gene actions in the inheritance of these traits. Direct selection for reduced plant height, greater leaves/plant and high herbage yield with thin and yellow stem at individual plant selection level would be seemingly more effective in view of their goverance by additive or cumulative gene effects in giving rise to enhanced essential geraniol and elemol rich oil yield with desired fragrant quality.",Cymbopogon martinii; Genetic advance; Geraniol; Herbage yield; Heritability; Induced mutagenesis; Monoterpine essential oil; Palmarosa; Path -coefficient; Trait association,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034773665

Male flowers have five receptacular nectaries, with no special vascular bundles, that consist of a uniserial epidermis with stomata subtended by a secretory parenchyma. Female flowers bear two different types of nectaries: inner (IN) and outer (ON) floral nectaries. IN, five in all, are structurally similar to the nectaries of male flowers. The five ON are vascularized, stalked, and composed of secretory, column-shaped epidermal cells without stomata subtended by secretory and ground parenchyma. In addition, ON act as post-floral nectaries secreting nectar during fruit ripening. Extrafloral nectaries (EFN) are located on petioles, stipules and leaf margins. Petiolar EFN are patelliform, stalked and anatomically similar to the ON of the female flower. Nectar sampled from all nectary types is hexose dominant, except for the ON of the female flower at the post-floral stage that is sucrose dominant. The species is self-compatible, but geitonogamous fertilization is rarely possible because male and female flowers are not usually open at the same time in the same individual, i.e. there is temporal dioecism. Flowers are visited by 22 insect species, wasps being the most important group of pollinators. No significant differences were found in fruit and seed set between natural and hand pollinated flowers. This pattern indicates that fruit production in this species is not pollen/pollinator limited and is mediated by a wide array of pollinators. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Extrafloral nectaries; Floral nectaries; Insect pollination; Nectar chemical composition; Post-floral nectaries; Self-compatibility; Temporal dioecism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034932269

Box 5014, N-1432 Ås, Norway","Phenotypic selection on flower size in animal-pollinated plants can only occur when fitness is limited by pollinator visitation and when there is a relationship between flower size and pollinator attraction. The purpose of this study was (a) to examine how abiotic environmental conditions affect pollen limitation on female reproductive success and pollinator flower visitation and (b) to reveal whether phenotypic selection on floral traits in an alpine flowering species varied across an abiotic environmental gradient. In alpine populations of the perennial herb Ranunculus acris, I found that female reproductive success in a low-altitude population was significantly increased by experimental pollen addition, while plants at a higher altitude population did not respond to this treatment, presumably because low temperatures limited their seed production. At the low altitude, pollinators (muscoid flies) preferred to visit relatively large flowers, while no sign of flower discrimination occurred at the high altitude. Phenotypic selection regression analysis found that selection on flower size traits was more intense and frequent at the low-altitude compared to the high-altitude population. This result is consistent with the findings of stronger pollen limitation on seed set and the existence of pollinator discrimination on flower size at the low altitude compared to the high altitude. Pollinator visitation rates to flowers were nearly three times higher at the low altitude, compared to the high altitude. Thus, this study shows that the commonly assumed pathway from low pollinator availability to strong pollen limitation is not always correct but supports the view that selection on floral traits is positively related to the degree of pollen limitation. In R. acris environmental factors interact with pollen availability in determining the reproductive success of plants, and this interrupts the pathway from low pollinator availability via significant pollen limitation to selection on floral traits.",Alpine plant; Flower size; Phenotypic selection; Pollen limitation; Pollinator flower preference; Pollinator visitation rates; Ranunculus acris; Spatial variation; Temperature conditions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034891677

Mechanisms influencing outcrossing were investigated in T. grandiflorum and T. erectum, two widespread species native to eastern North America. In southern Ontario, Canada, the two species are often sympatric; they flower in early May, and are pollinated by different assemblages of insects. Controlled cross- and self-pollinations and structural observations of pollen germination and pollen tube growth were conducted to determine whether the two species possess a self-incompatibility (SI) system and, if so, the specific site(s) of self-rejection. Controlled pollinations indicated that both species set significantly more seeds from cross-pollination than self-pollination, implicating the action of SI. This was confirmed by structural studies which demonstrated that self-recognition and rejection reactions occurred on dry-type stigmatic papillae. Observations of pollen hydration revealed that self-rejection was rapid, being initiated within 10 min of pollination and prior to pollen tube emergence. Final self-rejection resulted in failure of pollen tube growth at the base of stigmatic papillae. SI was expressed more weakly in T. erectum and thereby resulted in considerable self-seed set in some individuals. Estimates of outcrossing rates using allozyme markers indicated that T. erectum displayed a mixed-mating system whereas T. grandiflorum was more highly outcrossed. Structural studies of pollen traits indicated that the two species differed with respect to the size of grains and their aggregation with implications for pollen dispersal and mating. The ecological and evolutionary implications of the variable expression of SI in Trillium are discussed. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Mating; Self-incompatibility; Trillium erectum; Trillium grandiflorum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035194028

Nine japonica rice varieties were subjected to 35.0, 37.5 or 40.0°C day- temperature conditions (1000-1600) for six consecutive days using sun-lit phytotrons, and the percentage of fertility, pollination and germinated pollen grains on the stigmas were examined. The temperature that caused 50% sterility varied with the variety, and a difference of approximately 3.0°C was observed between the most tolerant and susceptible varieties. Under the 37.5°C day-temperature condition, the percentage of florets with 10 or more germinated pollen grains was roughly coincident with the percent fertility, but under the 40°C day-temperature condition, it was higher than the percent fertility. Many of the florets with less than 10 germinated pollen grains had less than 20 total pollen grains on their stigmas under both temperature conditions. From these results, we concluded that sure pollination under high-temperature conditions is an important factor and that the high-temperature tolerance of the processes following pollen germination is also required for fertility under excessively high temperature conditions.",Flowering period; High temperature; Japonica rice; Pollen; Pollination; Sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034936425

The perianth organs arise from a ring primordium. The two adaxial sepals appear first, followed by the petal primordia. This contrasts with monandrous orchids, in which the median petal primordium is the first organ of the inner perianth whorl to develop. Stamens are only formed on the abaxial side of the flower. However, in Neuwiedia veratrifolia and Apostasia nuda, vestiges of stamen primordia are present on the adaxial side of the flower. In Apostasia only, the lateral stamens are fully developed, whereas the median organ is a staminode; in A. nuda the staminode is suppressed. At anthesis the anthers are free in Neuwiedia, but they are postgenitally connected in Apostasia. In both genera, stamens and style are congenitally fused at the base. The inferior ovary is at first unilocular and then becomes trilocular by postgenital fusion of the ovary septa and the development of a short synascidiate zone. The three carpels of both genera are equal from the beginning, but in A. nuda only, the median carpel dominates during early development. The stigma is convex and papillate. Conspicuous raphide idioblast accumulations occur in staminode and style and in the tips of anthers and filaments. In contrast to all other orchids, both genera offer pollen as a reward. Neuwiedia has lip flowers, which are pollinated by Trigona bees; Apostasia has ""Solanum-type"" flowers with recurved perianth and united anthers.

In addition to wide variation in cupule and fruit morphology, polymorphism in pollination syndrome (wind vs. generalistic insect) also contributes to the uniqueness of the family. Phylogenetic relationships were examined using 179 accessions spanning the taxonomic breadth of the family, emphasizing tropical, subtropical, and relictual taxa. Nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences encoding the 5.8S rRNA gene and two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were used to evaluate phylogenetic hypotheses based on previous morphological cladistic analysis and intuitive schemes. Parsimony analyses rooted with Fagus supported two clades within the family, Trigonobalanus sensu lato and a large clade comprising Quercus and the castaneoid genera (Castanea+Castanopsis, Chrysolepis, Lithocarpus). Three DNA sequence data sets, 179-taxon ITS, 60-taxon ITS, and a 14-taxon combined nuclear and chloroplast (matK), were used to test a priori hypotheses of reproductive character state evolution. We used Templeton's (1983) test to assess alternative scenarios of single and multiple origins of derived and seemingly irreversible traits such as wind pollination, hypogeal cotyledons, and flower cupules. On the basis of previous exemplar-based and current in-depth analyses of Fagaceae, we suggest that wind pollination evolved at least three times and hypogeal cotyledons once. Although we could not reject the hypothesis that the acorn fruit type of Quercus is derived from a dichasium cupule, combined analysis provided some evidence for a relationship of Quercus to Lithocarpus and Chrysolepis, taxa with dichasially arranged pistillate flowers, where each flower is surrounded by cupular tissue. This indicates that a more broadly defined flower cupule, in which individual pistillate flowers seated within a separate cupule, may have a single origin.",Fagaceae; ITS; Lithocarpus; matK; Phylogeny; Pollination syndrome; Quercus; Systematics; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034753736

Here we show that F. ericifolia is self-compatible and autogamous. Its flowers last only four to eight hours and produce a small amount of pollen and ovules. Self-pollination depends on changes in the relative position of the stigma and the anthers, triggered by the abscission of the petals; this in turn causes closing of the sepals, which push the anthers onto the stigma. Pollen remains highly viable and germinable, and the stigma keeps its receptivity several hours after the loss of the petals. Hand pollination treatments revealed that fruits are produced both in selfed and crossed flowers. The germination of pollen grains on the stigma, the rate of pollen tube growth along the style, and the penetration into the ovules were similar in self- and cross-pollinations; also, there were no significant differences in fruit set, seed set and weight of seeds. Thus, we report the first evidence of autogamy in a woody Cistaceae and suggest that selfing may ensure reproductive success when pollinators are limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035743503

Variations in atmospheric concentration of Plantago pollen were analysed between locations, and annual, daily, and hourly variations recorded for each location. The highest concentrations of pollen were recorded at Cáceres, while the Mérida and Badajoz values were similar. This is explained by the nature of the surroundings of each city. Interannual variations in pollination levels were significantly correlated with autumn rains, which determine the extent of development of the populations. The hourly patterns of pollen capture were well-defined and similar for all three study sites. Maximum levels were reached between 1000 and 1200 h. Nocturnal concentrations were very low. Furthermore, this pattern was maintained throughout the flowering period, impling a very close link with the patterns of anthesis of the species. The three stations showed similar patterns of daily variation, which were significantly correlated with certain meteorological parameters. Pollen concentrations were affected positively by temperature, but negatively by relative humidity. The influence of wind direction also seemed to be explicable in these terms since the easterly winds, which are dry and hot in this region, had a positive influence, and the westerly winds which are moist and cool had a negative effect. The most relevant factor influencing levels of Plantago pollen in the atmosphere was wind speed, which was negatively correlated with pollen levels. © 2000 Annals of Botany Company.",Aerobiology; Anemophily; Plantago; Pollen; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035138336

Self-fertilized seeds of S. svalbardensis and S. cernua were viable and developed into normal, vigorous plants. Saxifraga rivularis and its close relative S. hyperborea were strongly autogamous. The bulbil-reproducing S. svalbardensis and S. cernua showed extreme variation in fertility, probably because of frequent aneuploidy. Many plants or S. cernua were fully fertile, suggesting that although natural seed set rarely has been observed, sexual reproduction is frequent enough to maintain its previously reported high levels of clonal diversity. Some plants of S. svalbardensis were also fairly fertile. This species may have considerable evolutionary potential; sexual events can lead to increasingly fertile genets with euploid chromosome numbers. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Clonal plants; Fertility; P/O ratios; Polyploidy; Seed set; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034886436

Both Castilleja miniata in subalpine Colorado and C. indivisa in central Texas have reduced herbivory when obtaining alkaloids from the hosts Lupinus argenteus and L. texensis (Fabaceae), respectively. However, pollinators were not deterred from visiting Castilleja parasitizing alkaloid-containing hosts. To determine if alkaloids are present in all tissues of plants parasitizing lupins, we analyzed floral tissue as well as leaves of both Castilleja species. Leaves, bracts, calices, corollas, gynoecium and nectar of both Castilleja species were examined for quinolizidine alkaloid presence using a Dragendorff reagent, and alkaloids were identified in vegetative tissue and nectar by capillary GLC and GLC-MS. Lupanine and alpha-isolupanine were the principal alkaloids in C. indivisa parasitizing L. texensis, while principal alkaloids of C. miniata parasitizing L. argenteus were 5,6-iso-dehydrolupanine, alpha-isolupanine, thermopsine, and 17-oxolupanine. Except for 17-oxolupanine, which was probably synthesized by biotransformation in the parasite, all other alkaloids correspond to those present in the host plants. Alkaloids were present in the leaves of both Castilleja species, and in the bracts, calices and gynoecium of some plants, but never in the corollas. Alkaloids from L. texensis and L. argenteus were not detected in nectar of either Castilleja species. The presence of alkaloids in leaves and outer floral tissue of both Castilleja species, but not nectar, may explain why alkaloid uptake and storage affected herbivores but not pollinators. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",Dragendorff reagent; Herbivory; Mass spectrometry; Parasitic plants; Pollination; Quinolizidine alkaloids; Secondary compounds; Toxic nectar,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035042326

PP parents (P1) and non-parthenocarpic (non-parth.) pp parents (P2) were used to study the effects of parthenocarpy on yield and fruit quality. Comparison of parth. and non-parth. plants from generations BC2 and F2, which segregate for parthenocarpy, showed that gene P induced an increase in yield between 46% and 62% but did not affect the quality characters studied. The effects of seeded/seedless fruit set on fruit quality was studied on parth. plants of both families. Seedless fruit weighed between 15% and 30% less than seeded fruit; no differences were found for the other fruit characters. The behaviour of one parth. and two non-parth. clones was studied under different training systems. The parth. clone was always the most productive and showed a lower variation between training systems than non-parth. clones.

This species has pentameric flowers with two whorls of stamens: an inner whorl of five long stamens and an outer whorl of short stamens. We studied the development of stamens from buds to mature flowers (measurement of the filament, anther, and style lengths at five successive phonological stages) and compared the size and position of reproductive organs at maturity in control and partially emasculated flowers (removal of long-level stamens) to determine whether the presence of long-level stamens constitutes a constraint for the development of the short-level ones. Stamen dimorphism can be observed early in stamen development, from the bud stage of the year prior to flowering. At this early stage, meiosis had already occurred. Emasculation of the long-level stamens induced the short-level ones to grow longer than in normal conditions. We also performed seven pollination treatments on ten randomly chosen individuals in each population, and the number of seeds following each treatment was recorded. Results from these treatments showed that R. ferrugineum produced spontaneous selfed seeds in the absence of pollinators. However, no seed was produced when short-level stamens were emasculated and pollinators excluded, suggesting that long-level stamens are not responsible for selfing in the absence of pollinators and that reproductive assurance is promoted by short-level stamens.",Ericaceae; Pollination system; Reproductive assurance; Rhododendron ferrugineum; Stamen development; Stamen size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242424891

Normally forest trees are raised through seed route origin seedlings, which have lot of variation because of cross-pollination. This variation is desirable from the point of view of the pest and disease resistance, but the variation results in lower yields. If selected phenotypes are multiplied asexually, the yields can be increased. If enough care is taken to widen the genetic base of plants raised through vegetative means, risk of pest and disease can be controlled simultaneously with increasing yields. Recently, vegetative cuttings have also been tried in the plantations by Eucalyptus and Acacia in several countries and increase in yield up to 100% have been obtained. The various methods of vegetative propagation are adopted for different species; but prove to be costly because of investments in infrastructure and chemical etc. The paper describes about the cost effective, user-friendly technology for vegetative propagation of Acacia hybrid, which will help the farmer in enhancing the yield when grown on their unproductive agricultural land.

Pilosocereus lanuginosus started budding immediately after rainfall, whereas Stenocereus griseus responded negatively with abortions and cessation of bud production within 2-3 weeks after rain. Subpilocereus repandus showed no response to rain within one month. Despite a long period of temporal overlap (81% overlap) between the budding/flowering activity of Subpilocereus repandus and that of Stenocereus griseus, buds and/or flowers on Stenocereus griseus appeared more than a month earlier than on Subpilocereus repandus.

To design an adequate conservation strategy able to avoid the extinction of this species, various aspects of its reproductive biology were studied. The extreme rarity of C. carthaginensis is not related to problems of development and/or fertility of pollen or ovules produced by the few existing specimens. Meiosis in the pollen mother cells is always regular and chromosome segregation is completely equilibrated in the male gametes. Pollen and ovule production is high and similar to that reported for other related species of Cistus. Pollen grains have high viability and germination rates, and the ovules are well-developed and functional. However, hand pollination treatments and microscopic observation of pollen tube growth along the style revealed that the species, like many others of this genus, shows gametophytic self-incompatibility. The isolated Valencian plant cannot, therefore, reproduce and regenerate a population. The conservation strategy of C. carthaginensis in the territory of Valencia should be based on the recovery of the reproductive capacity of the Valencian plant through pollen transfer from the unique population found in Murcia, once the viability of the crosses and the seed productivity have been assessed. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024520694

In pistils excised from these species, transcripts were detected in the stigma and in the transmitting tissue where they accumulated in an ovary-oriented increasing concentration gradient. We studied the cellular localization of the SF21 protein during various stages of pistil development as well as in pollen grains of tobacco and sunflower. Here we demonstrate that in young tobacco pistils (from stage 2 onwards) this protein is expressed exclusively in the papillae and secretory cells of the stigma where it is located first in the nucleus and subsequently also in the cytoplasm. Only several stages later (stage 10) does it appear in the transmitting tissue cells of the style Where it exhibits a similar, but temporally-delayed, dual nuclear and cytoplasmic localization pattern. SF21 is no longer present in either the stigma or style at the time of pollination, indicating that it is not directly involved in the pollination process. In tobacco pollen grains, SF21 appears just prior to pollen germination and localizes to the apical region of growing pollen tubes, suggesting a possible role in pollen tube growth. This temporal and spatial expression pattern as well as the dual nuclear/cytoplasmic localization suggest that SF21 could be involved in several molecular functions during pistil development and pollen tube growth. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Helianthus annuus; Immunohistochemistry; Nicotiana tabacum; Pollen; Stigma; Transmitting tissue,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034952151

Overall, 75% of flowers with purple corollas produced blue pollen, while yellow flowers tended to produce white pollen. Despite the potential for having an effect on reproductive success, the style length and color polymorphisms were not associated with individual flower size, flower number, fruit and seed production, or seed mass.

Using published sources and herbarium material, flower attractiveness to pollinators was measured in terms of capitulum size and ray/disc length ratio. Dispersibility was measured in terms of seed dry weight, seed terminal velocity, pappus/seed length ratio, and scape/leaf length ratio. Altitude (minimum and maximum) and geographic ranges (number of 1° latitude × 1° longitude squares occupied) were obtained from published sources. A multivariate principal components analysis using 12 morphological characters revealed the presence of five groups of species differing in capitulum size, seed weight, pappus length, number of pappus bristles, leaf length and scape length. Linear regressions showed that altitude was significantly and negatively related to seed dry weight and capitulum size, and positively to scape/leaf length ratio. Geographic range is negatively related to capitulum size, and positively to ray/disc ratio and altitudinal range. Amongst the seed features measured, seed weight was the best predictor of terminal velocity (an inverse measure of dispersability), but lighter seeds also had a higher pappus/seed length ratio. The frequency distribution of the geographic ranges of the species is highly skewed, with many local species (86% occurring in 15 or fewer one-degree squares) and very few common ones. Two species (C. gracilenta and C. graminifolia) are notably more common than all the others. A comparison of these species with the others shows that, on average, they have lighter seeds with more bristles, taller scapes and higher ray/disc ratios, but have smaller capitula.

Resources for female reproductive traits may also originate from current photosynthesis. Orchid mycorrhiza may also influence fruit and seed production.

Plants were hand-pollinated in two populations to assure successful fertilization. Photosynthesis in the main leaves and in the green parts of inflorescence was prevented and/or mycorrhizal function inhibited by applying thiabendazole to plants. None of the treatments affected relative capsule production, but all treatments resulted in significant decreases in capsule dry weight and the number of seeds produced. The fact that seed production remained high in spite of the experimental treatments indicates that resources stored in the underground corms were used in fruit development and seed production. Inhibition of photosynthesis decreased leaf area in the year following treatments, while the other treatments had no effect on subsequent growth. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Dactylorhiza; Defoliation; Inflorescence; Mycorrhiza; Photosynthesis; Resource storage; Rosette leaves; Shading; Terrestrial orchid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034964618

(lesquerella, Brassicaceae), native to the southwestern United States, is a potentially useful industrial oilseed crop. The seed oil contains hydroxy fatty acids, similar to castor (Ricinus communis L.) seed oil. The unique properties of the oil, along with coproducts, allow additional applications that would not compete with castor oil. Plants with vestigial anthers (male-sterile) were discovered in a greenhouse-grown, nonselected population in 1993. The inheritance of the trait was investigated through four crop seasons. Crosses were made among male-sterile and male-fertile plants from an open pollinated population, thus, they were heterozygous for many traits. Statistical analysis indicated that male sterility is expressed as a result of two nonlinked nuclear genes with epistatic relations and different cytoplasms, which cause partial or total fertility restoration. These ratios fit a 13:3 epistatic ratio, indicating that male sterility is controlled by homozygous recessive alleles at one locus in combination with at least one dominant allele at the second locus, i.e., ms1ms1 Ms2_. Some cross results were skewed in favor of fertile phenotypes presumably due to cytoplasmic effects causing partial fertility restoration.

We tested this prediction in a gynodioecious (females and hermaphrodites) wild strawberry by manipulating plant size in clonally replicated genotypes, by hand-pollinating with pollen from unrelated donors, and by measuring sex allocation response at two levels: among flowers and within flowers. These methods avoided potential confounding factors that can occur in studies of size-based allocation under natural conditions, such as genotype-based variation in size, and size-based variation in pollen limitation or self-pollination. They also allow us to determine if inflorescence architecture represented a constraint on the response to plant size. We found that a 75% increase in the vegetative size of hermaphrodites resulted in 78% more flowers, 91% more fruits, 10% more pollen per flower, and 16% more ovules per flower. These responses to plant size represent a significant modification of phenotypic gender at the within-flower level (pollen: ovule ratio) but not at the among-flower level (fruit: flower ratio). We also found that while female plants enhanced flower and fruit allocation with plant size to the same degree as hermaphrodites, they increased ovule number per flower to a greater degree. Sex differential effects of plant size such as those just described could influence breeding system evolution if they alter the relative seed fertility of the sex morphs. We also found that inflorescence architecture modified the response to plant size. Specifically, the effect of plant size on ovule number was strongest in basal positions and was absent at the most distal position. This, combined with a trend in the opposite direction for pollen production, resulted in position-dependent pollen : ovule ratios. Small plants had higher pollen : ovule ratios than large plants at the primary (basal) position, equivalent ratios at intermediate positions, and lower ratios at the quaternary (distal) position. We suggest that this architectural variation in response to plant size may result from structural limitations or physiological trade-offs within the inflorescence.",Fragaria virginiana; Intra-inflorescence variation; Pollen : ovule ratio; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035068130

Open-pollinated families from five selected trees plus a checklot from each of four seed zones were planted at each location. Seed zones tested were southeastern Texas, southern Louisiana, northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas, all in the USA. Heterogeneity of regressions was significant for height and volume at age five and for volume at age 10. Data suggest that G X E interactions could be managed by stratifying environments. Significant concurrence was detected for volume at ages 5 and 10 indicating a significant portion of G X E interaction was due to changes in family rank. Family differences were significant at ages 5 through 15. Regression estimates of slope and standard deviation for volume through age 10, indicated northern Louisiana and southeastern Texas families were intermediate in stability while southern Arkansas and southern Louisiana families were equally unstable. Families from southern Arkansas were least responsive to changes in site quality while those from southern Louisiana were most responsive. At age 15, northern Louisiana and southeastern Texas families remained intermediate in stability but southern Arkansas families exhibited increased responsiveness and southern Louisiana families showed decreased responsiveness to site quality. All zones exhibited a linear trend with respect to site quality. Perhaps greater drought tolerance of southern Arkansas families enabled them to continue growing in dense stands where competition for water could be great. The rapid early growth and reduced subsequent growth of southern Louisiana families may highlight a consequence of seed movement without timely regulation of stand density. Ecovalences and directional responses were large and negative if seed movement exceeded 125 miles north or south of origin. Ecovalences and coefficients of genetic prediction suggested coastal families should not be planted on poor sites. Favorable performances were observed for families planted in regions requiring specific adaptability often along their latitude of origin or areas of higher moisture.

Plants were grown in a greenhouse compartment from April until August. Half of the plants were grown without a fruit set treatment (control), whereas parthenocarpic fruits were allowed to develop on the other plants by preventing self-pollination and applying auxin to the stigma. For node positions 3 to 17, fruit set per node varied between 21 and 55 % for control plants [coefficient of variation (CV) = 11%], whereas auxin-treated plants showed much less variation in fruit set (41-57 %; CV = 5 %) and average fruit set was higher. In agreement with fruit set, fruit yield was also much more regular in the auxin-treated plants. Fruit fresh yield varied between 0.2 and 1.0 kg m-2 for control plants (CV = 20 %), and between 0.4 and 0.8 kg m-2 for auxin-treated plants (CV = 9 %). Results showed that developing seeds in sweet pepper fruits are the main cause of the abortion of new flowers, and irregular fruit set and yield. Parthenocarpic fruit growth resulted in flatter, 30 % smaller fruits, because of a reduction in fruit growth rate; the duration of fruit growth was 1 week longer than for fruits from control plants. Parthenocarpic fruits were hardly affected by blossom-end rot (BER) with only 1 % of fruits being affected compared to 31 % in the control.

Genetic improvement was proved an useful approach to increase maize yield in acid soils, since genetic variability is available and selection for aluminum tolerance is possible. The objective of this work was to measure genetic variability for net root growth (NRG) and estimate the coefficient of heritability in the open pollinated tropical population SIKALQ. A comparison between predicted and observed gains from selection after one cycle of divergent selection for NRG was included. One hundred half sib progenies were evaluated in nutrient solution for seven days, and NRG for each progeny was calculated. For this trait, the coefficients of heritability were 0.74 (individual plant), and 0.84 (progeny mean). Predicted gains from divergent selection were 3.1 mm day-1 and -4.0 mm day-1, while the observed gains were 2.3 mm day-1 and -2.5 mm day-1 for the tolerant and sensitive populations, respectively. Our results led to conclude that NRG is a quantitative trait with an important additive component.

A full diallel cross using four trees of each species (i.e. all possible pollinations among eight trees) was performed. This design was repeated at two sites that represent different outcomes of sympatry: (1) a xeric mountain ridge where many hybrids are established (HZ); and (2) a mesic valley bottom where virtually no hybrids are established (MOCYN). By measuring fruit survival at several developmental stages, both the timing and strength of reproductive barriers within and between sites, species, cross types, and pollen dosage levels were examined. In three of four cases, heterospecific fruit set was significantly reduced compared to conspecific fruit set. This reduction occurred after the time of fertilization, but before the onset of embryo growth. Increasing the dose of pollen from an average of 9-194 grains/stigma did not affect this result. Thus, early postfertilization processes play a strong role in species fidelity in these oaks. Quercus gambelii experienced a five-fold decrease in conspecific fruit set at HZ relative to MOCYN. In contrast, heterospecific fruit set of Q. gambelii was the same at both sites. Poor Q. gambelii pollen performance is implicated as playing the major role in this result. One Q. gambelii individual at HZ was highly fecund, and had higher heterospecific than conspecific fruit set; slight introgression in this tree was detected using RAPD markers.

Ovulate development is typically podocarpaceous. Ovules are unitegmic, and horizontal or inclined upwards throughout ontogeny; the pollination drop is inverted because of the declinate micropyle. Ontogeny of the epimatium-ovule complex is acropetal, the epimatium developing first. A terminal, distal sterile bract creates a pollen-scavenging area. During development, the whole cone re-orientates through some 270°, and the seed realigns approx. 60° with respect to the receptacle axis. The 'receptacle' or podocarpium supporting the seed is formed by gradual fusion of initially free bracts. The structures adnate to these bracts represent homologues of ovuliferous scales; they bear vestigial epimatia which may develop into super-numerary ovules or non-functional epimatia. Thus, female cones of A. pancheri are vestigially multi-ovulate.

A better understanding of the mechanisms and rates of weed evolution could aid in limiting or at least anticipating this process. Spontaneous hybridization between crops and related weed species can transfer crop genes coding for fitness-enhancing traits to wild populations, but little is known about how easily this takes place in various weed-crop complexes. We studied interspecific hybrids between wild and cultivated radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum × R. sativus), which often co-occur and share pollinators: To determine whether the F1 generation represents a strong barrier to subsequent introgression, we compared the fitness of wild plants and wild-crop hybrids. Two experiments were carried out in Michigan, USA, one with potted plants and the other involving four artificially established populations. In the artificial populations, we used white flower color, a dominant, crop-specific allele, to document the persistence of crop genes over time. Wild plants had yellow flowers, which is a recessiye trait. F1 hybrids had lower fitness than wild plants due to lower pollen fertility, fewer seeds per plant, and delayed flowering. Despite these disadvantages, hybrids contributed substantially to each population's gene pool. After 3 yr, frequencies of white-flowered plants in the artificial populations ranged from 8% to 22%, demonstrating that crop genes persisted. Other studies of flower color variation in wild populations of R. raphanistrum provide circumstantial evidence for frequent crop-to-wild gene flow. We predict that, if cultivated radish is engineered to possess transgenes coding for traits such as resistance to insect herbivores, disease, herbicides, or environmental stress, these fitness-related crop genes will easily spread to R. raphanistrum.",Adaptation; Artificial populations; Crop; Fitness-related trait; Flower color; Hybridization; Introgression; Pollen fertility; Raphanus raphanistrum; Transgenic; Weed; Wild radish,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034977995

Field studies were conducted in 1995 and 1996 at Kazova Plain in Tokat. The experiment was designed in a randomized-complete-block design with a split-plot arrangement with three replications. The treatments comprised six levels of nitrogen (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg N / ha) and four plant densities (5.7, 7.0, 9.5 and 14.0 plants / m2). Nitrogen rates were in the main plots, and planting densities were in the sub-plots. An open pollinated was used as the material in the experiment. In general, significant differences were determined in the investigated plant characteristics. Plant height tended to increase as the nitrogen rate increased. The tasseling period was reduced as the nitrogen level and sowing density increased. The maximum ear length was obtained from low planting densities (5.7 and 7.0 plants / m2). The number of kernels per ear was not affected by nitrogen application or population density. The 1000-grain weight increased with N application and decreasing plant density. Nitrogen application and plant densities had positive effects on the grain weight per ear. Nitrogen significantly increased the grain yield, but there were no significant differences in yield at the doses of 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg N / ha. The highest grain yield was obtained from 7.0 plants / m2 when averaged over two years. Our findings indicate that, for maximum grain yield of popcorn, 100-150 kg N/ha should be applied, and the plant density should be 7.0 plants / m2.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035120254

During these processes, certain factors may make the male-sterile line fertile and decrease the purity of hybrid seed. Additional problems include contamination with fertile seed originating from pollination with exotic pollen or from physical mixture of seed. Therefore, developing a rapid, economic and convenient system for ensuring seed purity is a prerequisite for hybrid seed production. To achieve this objective, novel kinds of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line, temperature-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line and temperature/photoperiod-sensitive genic male (T/PGMS) line were developed with green-revertible leaf color marker. Male sterile lines of all three types displayed the following major characteristics: a) Leaf color marker could be easily distinguished from normal green plants, but was only expressed at the seedling stage; b) They were insensitive to temperature with regard to the marker phenotype and expressed the marker unchanged under various environmental and growing conditions; c) A single recessive gene controlled the marker trait; d) They maintained sterility characteristics as their corresponding parent did. e) Expression of the marker trait not only did not have negative effects on major agronomic trait of male-sterile line itself, but also did not affect the hybrid F1 plants derived from these lines.

In one of the SRK transgenic lines, 1C, virtually no seeds were produced when the transgenic pistils were pollinated with W1 pollen (Mean number of seeds per pod = 1.22). This response was specific to the W1 pollen since pollen from a different self-incompatible Brassica napus line (T2) and self-pollinations were fully compatible.

The date palm tree is one of the fruit trees most cultivated in the Arabian Gulf States. Bioregulators were used for the quality and productivity improvement of date palm tree fruits. A study was conducted to assess the relative effectiveness of GA3, NAA, ethephon and a mixture of growth regulators on some fruit characteristics and productivity of the Barhee date palm tree cultivar. Materials and methods. Five selected female uniform date palm trees of the cultivar Barhee were pollinated on March 5-15, 1994, 1995 and 1996, by placing eight fresh male strands on the female spadix center (flower cluster).Ten flower clusters were used on each tree and divided into five groups of two flower clusters. Each of these groups was subjected to one of the following treatments: control (water), 150 mg GA3× L?1, 100 mg NAA×L?1, 1 000 mg ethephon × L?1 and a mixture of these three growth regulators. Then the fruit setting, fruit flesh and dry matter percentages, the total soluble solids, the fruit ripening, and the fruit weight per bunch andper tree were measured. Results and discussion. The data showed that the application of GA3 or ethephon on flower clusters of Barhee date palm trees had no constant effect on fruit characteristics and productivity of trees. NAA or growth regulator mixture applications on Barhee flower clusters reduced the fruit dry matter and fruit ripening percentages and increased the fruit weight per bunch and per tree. Conclusion. Treatments of Barhee date palm flower clusters, 20 d after pollination, with NAA or the specific growth regulator mixture decreased the dry matter percentage and the fruit ripening and increased the fruit flesh percentage and the date palm tree yield, therefore, these treatments could be recommended to improve the productivity of datepalm trees in the region. © 2001 Cirad/EDP Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996136624

To examine the basis for this response, pollen tube growth, embryo survival and indicators of photosynthetic rate were measured in two wheat cultivars ('Karamu' and 'Kotuku') crossed with maize at two irradiance levels (250 or 750 ?mol m-2 s-1, PAR). Pollen tube growth was significantly affected by light intensity in 'Karamu' plants but not in 'Kotuku' plants, despite both cultivars being pollinated by the same maize source. The percentage of pollen tubes reaching the cavity between the ovarian wall and integuments, or in the micropyle of 'Karamu' plants at high light intensity (65 %) was nearly three-times greater than that at low light intensity (22 %). Thus, either low light intensity can affect the maternal wheat plant in a way that inhibits pollen tube growth and/or high light intensity may promote pollen tube growth in 'Karamu' plants. Significant differences in rates of electron transport in plants grown at the two light intensities indicated that the rate of photosynthesis may also have an effect on pollen tube growth.

The species has been affected by habitat destruction and alteration, especially timber cutting, clearing of land, and drainage or flooding of wetlands. Stem dieback was noted in populations in five states, but populations monitored for three years do not appear to be declining. Three fungal pathogens were isolated from stems. Flowers covered with mesh bags produced no fruit, and flowers that received supplemental pollination did not set more fruit than open-pollinated flowers. Seed production was erratic in populations in Mississippi and Arkansas, and no seedlings were noted even after seed production was high. Individual ramets can be easily transplanted and multiply rapidly. Successful dispersal is very limited now due to restrictive land use in areas surrounding pondberry populations and to changes in hydrology.

To design an adequate conservation strategy able to avoid the extinction of this species, various aspects of its reproductive biology were studied. The extreme rarity of C. carthaginensis is not related to problems of development and/or fertility of pollen or ovules produced by the few existing specimens. Meiosis in the pollen mother cells is always regular and chromosome segregation is completely equilibrated in the male gametes. Pollen and ovule production is high and similar to that reported for other related species of Cistus. Pollen grains have high viability and germination rates, and the ovules are well-developed and functional. However, hand pollination treatments and microscopic observation of pollen tube growth along the style revealed that the species, like many others of this genus, shows gametophytic self-incompatibility. The isolated Valencian plant cannot, therefore, reproduce and regenerate a population. The conservation strategy of C. carthaginensis in the territory of Valencia should be based on the recovery of the reproductive capacity of the Valencian plant through pollen transfer from the unique population found in Murcia, once the viability of the crosses and the seed productivity have been assessed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035161773

At issue is whether the flower color polymorphism in this species is the product of random genetic drift, as Sewall Wright argued, or of natural selection, as proposed by Carl Epling and his colleagues. Our long-term studies of three polymorphic populations in the Mojave Desert demonstrate that flower color is subject to selection that varies in both time and space in its direction and magnitude. For all sites taken together, blue-flowered plants produced more seeds than white-flowered plants in years of relatively low seed production, whereas white-flowered plants had higher fitness in years of high seed production. Evidence of selection on flower color was found in two of the three study sites. Differences in fitness between the color morphs were sometimes large, with selection coefficients as high as 0.60 in some years. Our longest period of observations was at Pearblossom site 1, where plants reached appreciable densities in seven of the 11 years of study. Here we found significant differences in the seed production of the color morphs in six years, with three years of blue advantage and three years of white advantage. For all sites taken together, total spring precipitation (March and April) was positively correlated with both absolute and relative seed production of the color morphs. At Pearblossom site 1, blue-flowered plants typically had a fitness advantage in years of low spring precipitation, whereas white-flowered plants had a fitness advantage in years of high spring precipitation. This temporal variation in selection may contribute to the maintenance of the flower-color polymorphism at Pearblossom site 1, whereas gene flow from neighboring populations is proposed as the principal factor maintaining the polymorphism at the other study sites. We found no significant differences between the color morphs in pollinator visitation rate or in their carbon isotope ratio, a measure of water-use efficiency. Although the mechanism of selection remains elusive, our results refute Wright's conclusion that the flower color polymorphism in L. parryae is an example of isolation by distance, a key component of his shifting balance theory of evolution.",Flower color; Genetic drift; Isolation by distance; Natural selection; Polymorphism; Sewall Wright; Shifting balance theory,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034893563

Gradients of primary and secondary infection from point sources of ascospores and conidia placed in separate plant rows were recorded in each of 2 years at two sites with no history of the disease. Primary infection gradients were longer downwind than upwind, with 95% of blighted shoots occurring within 30 m of the ascospore point source. This observation, along with a positive correlation (r = 0.852, P = 0.0072, n = 8) between the distance over which shoot blight occurred and wind speed parallel to the row, supports the role of wind as a key factor in ascospore dispersal. By contrast, secondary infection gradients were shorter downwind and longer upwind, with 95% of infected fruit occurring within 20 m of the conidial point source. The shorter downwind spread of secondary infection, along with a nonsignificant correlation (r = -0.649, P = 0.0812, n = 8) between the distance over which infected fruit occurred and wind speed, suggests that factors other than wind are important in the transfer of conidia to open flowers; this could include conidial dispersal by bee pollinators, which have been shown previously to forage primarily upwind. Exponential and Pareto cumulative distribution functions were fitted to cumulative counts of blighted shoots and infected fruit to model spread of primary and secondary infection.

Samples were taken at weekly intervals from 12 May 1998 (estimated time of pollination) until 20 October 1998. The total non-structural carbohydrate content was high (?150-180?g mg-1 dry weight) at the time of the first samples and the carbohydrate spectrum consisted of sucrose, glucose, fructose, and pinitol. A dramatic decrease in carbohydrate content took place from June 6 onwards, that was accompanied by changes in carbohydrate partitioning to favor sucrose over hexoses and the disappearance of pinitol. Raffinose and stachyose were first detected on July 28, and their content gradually increased thereafter. Isolated embryos and remaining megagametophytes were analyzed starting with September 1. Carbohydrate content was higher in isolated zygotic embryo than in the rest of the seed, with a slowly increasing fraction of raffinose and stachyose. Comparisons of presented data with the results of our previous study of somatic embryo carbohydrate status (Lipavská et al., 2000) revealed the following common features: (1) a decrease in total carbohydrate content and (2) an increase in sucrose:hexose ratios in developing seeds and embryonal suspensor mass. Marked differences were observed in carbohydrate spectra: (1) somatic embryo development was not accompanied by pinitol accumulation in any phase; (2) mature zygotic embryos, in contrast to mature somatic embryos, contained raffinose and stachyose.

Since pollen is enriched in both nitrogen and phosphorus, this recurrent pulse of deposition constitutes a significant potential source of these elements in what are known to be severely nutrient-limited systems. Here, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that an ectomycorrhizal fungus, Paxillus involutus, is able to scavenge effectively for nitrogen and phosphorus in pollen and to return a significant proportion of each nutrient to its autotrophic host, Betula pendula. More than 75 and 96%, respectively, of the nitrogen and phosphorus were removed from pollen in microcosms containing the mycorrhizal fungus, 29 and 25%, respectively, being transferred to the plants. In contrast, in microcosms without the mycorrhizal fungus only 42 and 35%, respectively, of nitrogen and phosphorus were lost from the pollen, presumably as a result of export by saprotrophs, and only 12 and 7%, respectively, were transferred to the plants. We hypothesize that this process of resource recapture, by contributing significantly to the ability of the trees to sustain the necessary annual investment in pollen production, will have a major impact upon their reproductive capabilities and hence 'fitness'.",Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Nutrient mobilization; Organic substrates; Pine forests; Pollen; Vegetative mycelium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034936529

Phosphorus peak-to-background (p/b) and potassium p/b ratios increased slightly after the fourth week, while magnesium p/b ratios remained unchanged. The calcium p/b ratio was statistically higher at 4 weeks than in the subsequent weeks. Traces of iron and zinc were found in most of the globoids at all fruit ages. The zinc p/b ratio was higher in globoids at 4 weeks than at 9 weeks. Traces of manganese were detectable in only 18% of the globoids at 4 weeks and not detectable in any globoids at 9 weeks. The frequency of the small globoids of 0.25 ?m in diameter was the highest at 4 weeks and was zero at 9 weeks. The frequency of the larger globoids increased progressively from 4 to 9 weeks. As the spherical globoids increased in size and hence in volume, there was a 6.4-fold increase in the embryo phytic acid, which is the main component of globoids.

AFLP markers were developed with three combinations of restriction enzymes, EcoRI/MseI, KpnI/MseI and PstI/MseI. Most of the markers appear to be in simplex or single-dose and segregated 3:1 in the progeny. One linkage map was constructed for each parent using only the single-dose markers. The map of 86-7 consists of 171 markers assigned to 15 linkage groups and covering more than 902 cM of the genome. The map of 82-1134 consists of 167 markers assigned to 14 linkage groups and covering more than 682 cM of the genome. In the AFLP analysis, EcoRI/MseI generated nearly twice as many markers per run than PstI/MseI. Markers developed with three restriction enzyme combinations showed a mixed distribution throughout the maps.

Dormancy loss rate depends on genotype and may also be affected by environmental conditions during seed formation. To establish a quantitative relationship between temperature and PHS susceptibility, a malting barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar, 'Quilmes Palomar', was sown on different dates over a 3-yr period to obtain a range of thermal conditions during grain filling (soil type: Aeric Argiudoll). The period from pollination to physiological maturity (PM) was adjusted to a thermal time (TT) scale, which was then divided into 50°C-day intervals. Mean temperature within each interval was calculated for the different sowing dates. Grain dormancy was monitored using a germination index (GI). We sought a linear relationship between temperature during grain filling and GI at some moment after PM. The strongest correlation (P &lt; 0.0001) was obtained between mean temperature values within the TT interval ranging from 300 to 350°C-day (Tm300-350) and GI values 12 d after PM (GI12DAPM). This indicates that temperature during this sensitivity window explains variability in dormancy level among years and locations for this cultivar, and may therefore explain differences in PHS susceptibility. A regression model (GI12DAPM = 7.14 × (Tm300-350) - 99; r2 = 0.95, n = 9) was generated for predicting GI values 12 d after PM, and tested on commercial plots. The linear relationship between temperature and GI after PM was confirmed, though the effect of one or more undescribed, environmental factors differing among tested locations was revealed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034808710

Restrictions of nutrient element supply and root volume affect plant vigor and size. To study the interactive effects of nutrient element supply and container volume on pepper flowering and fruiting, a complete interactive experiment (3 x 3) containing three concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) at a constant ratio and three volumes of containers were conducted using a hydroponic system in a temperature control-greenhouse during a autumn-winter season. The cultivar of sweet pepper was cv. 'Hazera' 1195 and only cross-pollinated flowers were allowed to set fruits. The mean minimum root zone temperature was maintained at 16.3-16.6°C in the middle (18-dm3) and big (33-dm3) containers at night during the fruit developing stage, it dropped at night to 14.1°C in the small (9-dm3) container. The low concentration nutrient solution containing 3-0.5-1.25 mM of N-P-K, when combined with the small container induced an early flowering and short duration of flowering, that led to early fruit set and maturation. No difference in flowering, fruit set and total fruit yield of pepper was found between middle (6-1-2.5 mM) and high (9-1.5-3.75 mM) nutrient element level when the small and middle containers were used. Plants in the large container significantly delayed the flowering and fruit set when high concentration of nutrient elements was applied, but the total number of fruit set and total plant yield was higher than in the small container. High nutrient element concentration and larger container size produced high fruit yield only when allowed to grow and set fruits for a long period.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035016723

The two species showed no significant differences in the features studied. The ovule is orthocampylotropous, bitegmic and crassinucellate. Embryo sac development is of the Polygonum type; endosperm development follows the Nuclear type and embryo development is probably of the Onagrad type. Double fertilization was apparent 72 hr following both cross- and self-pollinations and 48 hr following open pollination. No differences were observed between cross- and self-pollination in pollen germination and pollen tube growth, megagametogenesis, double fertilization and embryogenesis. In all the treatments thickening and retraction of cell walls were observed in the integuments and placenta, followed by collapse of embryo sac (ovule) or degeneration of endosperm and zygote (seed). Both species seem to be self-compatible, with no occurrence of pre- or post-zygotic mechanisms as barriers to selfing.

In almost all mutualisms studied, specialist parasites have been identified that purloin the benefits that one mutualist provides another. Explaining how parasites are kept from driving mutualisms extinct remains an unsolved problem because existing theories explaining the maintenance of cooperation do not apply to parasites of mutualisms. Nonetheless, these theories can be summarized in such a way as to suggest how mutualisms can persist in the face of parasites. (1) For cooperation to occur, the recipient of a benefit must reciprocate, and the recriprocated benefit must be captured by the initial giver or its offspring. (2) For cooperation to persist, the mutualism must be re-assembled each generation. Because most mutualisms are of the 'by-product' type, broadly defined, the first condition is normally always fulfilled. Thus, the maintenance of mutualism usually requires enforcement of the second condition: reliable re-assembly. Hence, I argue that the persistence of mutualism is best understood by using theories of species coexistence, because each mutualist can be considered a resource for the other, and species coexistence theory explains how multiple taxa (e.g. parasites and mutualists) can stably partition a resource over multiple generations. This approach connects the study of mutualism to theories of population regulation and helps to identify key factors that have promoted the evolution, maintenance and breakdown of mutualism. I discuss how these ideas might apply to and be tested in ant-plant, fig-wasp and yucca-moth mutualisms. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.",Ant-plant; Cooperation; Dispersal; Ficus; Metapopulation; Mutualism; Myrmecophyte; Parasite; Pollination; Spatial ecology; Species coexistence; Yucca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034958474

Among them, the pollination-constant and nonastringent (PCNA) type is the most desirable for fresh fruit consumption due to the trait of stable loss of astringency on the tree with fruit development. Lack of tannin accumulation is the main cause of natural astringency loss in PCNA-type fruit, and is qualitatively inherited. The PCNA trait is recessive to the non-PCNA trait. In this study, we investigated amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers for the trait of natural astringency loss of PCNA-type fruit using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) for efficient selection of PCNA type plants in a breeding population. A total of 128 primer combinations were tested and one AFLP marker was found to be linked to the dominant allele controlling the trait for astringency. This marker, EACC/ MCTA-400, was absent in all of the PCNA-type plants tested, whereas it was present in about half of the non-PCNA-type plants tested. However, RFLP analysis using this marker enabled the detection of the other dominant allele, and all PCNA-type plants could be distinguished from the non-PCNA-type plants.

We found that increasing the frequency of functional males (the pollen-bearing morph) increased the frequency of pollen-collecting syrphid flies in the pollinator assemblage, decreased pollinator visitation to less preferred morph (females), and decreased the degree of pollen limitation of females. Moreover, sex ratio influenced the strength of selection on petal size through female fitness but did not alter the strength of selection through male fitness components, suggesting that sex ratio can alter the gender bias of selection on an attractive trait. This study of context-dependent selection has important implications for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in attractive traits. First, it suggests that only certain conditions generate male-biased selection and, thus, could lead to selection-driven male-biased petal size dimorphism. Second, it suggests that flexible pollinator foraging may be an important mechanism by which sex ratio influences selection on attractive traits. Finally, it implies that variation in sex ratio could limit the evolution of sexual dimorphism and/or could maintain genetic variation in attractive traits.",Flowers; Fragaria virginiana; Petal size; Selection; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035097934

Results and discussion. At the anthesis, the female gametophyte of the variety Tuono is at the four tetrad stage for 50% of the ovules observed in the embryo sac. The fusion of the polar nuclei was observed 5 d after pollination. Two weeks later, the sac contains a coenocytic framework in which the triploid nuclei of the endosperm multiply.

The aim of this work was to elucidate and compare programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms in these two ephemeral tissues. To achieve this, we used the TdT-mediated dUDP fluorescent (FITC) nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique to trace DNA fragmentation and transmission electron microscopy to follow chromosomal and nuclear degradation. The TUNEL experiments demonstrated DNA fragmentation in the endosperm nuclei 13 d after pollination (dap) and in the suspensor at 14 dap. However, the ultrastructural studies did not show any chromosomal degradation in the nuclei of the suspensor or endosperm until 17 dap, indicating that the DNA fragmentation is an initial step in the PCD pathway. We have further documented fundamental differences in the degeneration process of the nuclei of the two tissues. In the suspensor the heterochromatin becomes more condensed during degeneration and disperses to the nuclear periphery as electron-dense areas. The nucleolus will keep its round and condensed shape for some time before expanding into an irregular body. In the endosperm the heterochromatin is more like a network throughout the nucleus, and the nucleolus will eventually split into pieces scattered inside the heterochromatin. Internal vesicle-like structures appear in the nuclei of the suspensor at 11-13 dap. However, they might have a communicative function not necessarily related to the cell death. We conclude that both the suspensor and the endosperm go through PCD processes, but the pathways leading to dismantling of the cells do not follow identical routes in the two tissues. DNA fragmentation occurs in intact cells and within an intact nuclear envelope and not in cells that already are damaged. PCD in the endosperm precedes PCD in the suspensor, indicating that they might receive different signals or that the signal triggers different internal death programs in the two tissues.",DNA fragmentation; Endosperm; Nucleus; Programmed cell death; Suspensor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034880879

Evolutionary biologists interested in microevolutionary processess and conservation biologists interested in the impact of landscape change require a method that measures the real time process of gene movement. We present a novel two-generation (parent-offspring) approach to the study of genetic structure (TwoGener) that allows us to quantify heterogeneity among the male gamete pools sampled by maternal trees scattered across the landscape and to estimate mean pollination distance and effective neighborhood size. First, we describe the model's elements: genetic distance matrices to estimate intergametic distances, molecular analysis of variance to determine whether pollen profiles differ among mothers, and optimal sampling considerations. Second, we evaluate the model's effectiveness by simulating spatially distributed populations. Spatial heterogeneity in male gametes can be estimated by ?FT, a male gametic analogue of Wright's FST and an inverse function of mean pollination distance. We illustrate TwoGener in cases where the male gamete can be categorically or ambiguously determined. This approach does not require the high level of genetic resolution needed by parentage analysis, but the ambiguous case is vulnerable to bias in the absence of adequate genetic resolution. Finally, we apply TwoGener to an empirical study of Quercus alba in Missouri Ozark forests. We find that ?FT = 0.06, translating into about eight effective pollen donors per female and an effective pollination neighborhood as a circle of radius about 17 m. Effective pollen movement in Q. alba is more restricted than previously realized, even though pollen is capable of moving large distances. This case study illustrates that, with a modest investment in field survey and laboratory analysis, the TwoGener approach permits inferences about landscape-level gene movements.",AMOVA; Gene flow; Genetic structure; Parentage analysis; Pollen movement; Quercus alba; Twogener; ?-statistics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035091655

Without herbicide, relative yield of total biomass or reproductive structures did not differ from theoretical competitive equivalence at any accession ratio, thereby indicating that interaccession interference was similar. For picloram-treated plants, R plants accumulated more total, vegetative, and reproductive dry weight than did S plants at the early and late reproductive stages, and there was no difference between S and R plants at the vegetative growth stage.

Sequence divergence within and among major Ophrys lineages was low for both nrDNA and cpDNA sequences. Separate analyses resulted in similar but poorly resolved trees. An incongruence length difference test revealed that nrDNA and cpDNA data sets were not incongruent. A combined analysis resulted in a better-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships among the major Ophrys lineages. Our data strongly support a division of Ophrys into two groups. These groups do not correspond to the earlier proposed sections Euophrys and Pseudophrys and are thus in conflict with traditional classifications. Our results support a well-resolved monophyletic group that contains the geographically widespread O. bombyliflora, O. speculum, O. tenthredinifera, and the O. fusca-lutea lineage. Relationships in the other group are poorly resolved. Based on our observations that taxa with identical sequences at presumably rapidly evolving loci clearly differ in floral morphology, we hypothesize that the diversity in the genus Ophrys is the result of a recent radiation in this orchid lineage. © 2001 Academic Press.",DNA sequences; Molecular phylogeny; Ophrys; Orchidaceae; Recent radiation; Sexual deception; Specific pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034960404

Despite growing attention in recent years, however, few conceptual themes have yet to be identified that span mutualisms differing in natural history. Here I examine the idea that the ecology and evolution of mutualisms are shaped by diverse costs, not only by the benefits they confer. This concept helps link mutualism to antagonisms such as herbivory, prédation, and parasitism, interactions defined largely by the existence of costs. I first briefly review the range of costs associated with mutualisms, then describe how one cost, the consumption of seeds by pollinator offspring, was quantified for one fig/pollinator mutualism. I compare this cost to published values for other fig/pollinator mutualisms and for other kinds of pollinating seed parasite mutualisms, notably the yucca/yucca moth interaction. I then discuss four issues that fundamentally complicate comparative studies of the cost of mutualism:. problems of knowing how to measure the magnitude of any one cost accurately; problems associated with using average estimates in the absence of data on sources of variation; complications arising from the complex correlates of costs, such as functional linkages between costs and benefits; and problems that arise from considering the cost of mutualism as a unilateral issue in what is fundamentally a reciprocal interaction. The rich diversity of as-yet unaddressed questions surrounding the costs of mutualism may best be investigated via detailed studies of individual interactions.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746029457

In Brassica, the SI genes SLG (for S-locus glycoprotein) and SRK (for S-receptor kinase) are members of the S multigene family, which share the SLG-like domain (S domain), which encodes a putative receptor. We have cloned members of the S multigene family from the S9 haplotype of B. campestris (syn. rapa). In addition, eight distinct genomic regions harboring 10 SLG/SRK-like genes were characterized in the present study. Sequence analysis revealed two novel SRK-like genes, BcRK3 and BcRK6 (for B. campestris receptor kinases 3 and 6, respectively).

Fruit production has been shown to be costly to plants in terms of carbon and mineral nutrients that, otherwise, could be used for further growth, defense, or pollen production and dispersal. Consequently, the failure of flowers to initiate and/or produce mature fruits (e.g., because lack of pollination or flower predation) should free resources for growth, defense, and additional flower production. This prediction, however, assumes that plants have the physiological mechanisms to appropriately reallocate unused resources from the female function. This study examines whether plants of Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana reallocate resources from fruit/seed production to growth and flower production in response to the removal of pistillate flowers 1 d after anthesis. This wild gourd is an annual, monoecious vine that produces a single flower per reproductive node. We found that when plants were not permitted to allocate resources to fruit and seed production, the vines grew faster, initiated more staminate and pistillate flower buds, and produced more pistillate flowers but had a smaller proportion of staminate buds that reached anthesis and fewer staminate flowers on their main shoot than plants with fruit/seed production. These findings indicate that the resources that would have gone into fruit maturation were reallocated to growth and flower bud production. However, despite an increased investment in the production of staminate flower buds, a relative surplus of resources did not result in an increase in the production of staminate flowers. Recent findings concerning the physiology of sex expression in Cucurbita indicate that the failure of staminate flower buds to develop to anthesis results from an increase in the hormonal signal (ethylene) that stimulates pistillate flower development on vines without developing fruits.",Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana; Phenotypic plasticity; Resource allocation; Sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034881115

However, male plant fitness, defined as the number of seeds sired by pollen, contributes half of the genes to the next generation and is therefore crucial to the evolution of natural plant populations. This is the first study to examine effects of insect herbivory on both male and female plant reproductive success. Through controlled field and greenhouse experiments and genetic paternity analysis, we found that foliar damage by insects caused a range of responses by plants. In one environment, damaged plants had greater success as male parents than undamaged plants. Neither effects on pollen competitive ability nor pollinator visitation patterns could explain the greater siring success of these damaged plants. Success of damaged plants as male parents appeared to be due primarily to changes in allocation to flowers versus seeds after damage. Damaged plants produced more flowers early in the season, but not more seeds, than undamaged plants. Based on total seed production, male fitness measures from the first third of the season, and flower production, we estimated that damaged and undamaged plants had equal total reproductive success at the end of the season in this environment. In a second, richer environment, damaged and undamaged plants had equal male and female plant fitness, and no traits differed significantly between the treatments.

Few studies have tested predictions about the distribution of genetic variation among co-occurring endemic plants species. We describe genetic variation and its relationship to life history traits for seven narrowly endemic, federally endangered Florida scrub species: Dicerandra christmanii, D. frutescens, Eryngium cuneifolium, Hypericum cumulicola, Liatris ohlingerae, Nolina brittoniana, Warea carteri. These species have varying life histories, degrees of habitat specialization, and geographic distributions. Measures of genetic (allozyme) diversity (mean number of alleles/locus, percentage of loci polymorphic and expected heterozygosity) varied among species. However, genetic variation was generally lower than published means for plants and also generally lower for means for comparable groups (endemics, short-lived herbs, species with mixed mating systems, species with gravity dispersed seeds). The chief exception was L. ohlingerae, which had relatively high genetic variation. All three measures of genetic variation produced the same ranking among species: L. ohlingerae &gt; D. christmanii &gt; N. brittoniana &gt; E. cuneifolium &gt; D. frutescens &gt; W. carteri &gt; H. cumulicola. For six of these species, we compared genetic variation with rankings of eight life history factors. Genetic variation was highest in long-lived, demographically stable, outcrossing species with long pollinator dispersal distances. Attributes such as median population size, habitat specificity, geographic range, and estimated primary seed dispersal distances were not related to rankings for genetic variation. The studied species varied widely in genetic differentiation among populations (0.02 &lt; FST &lt; 0.72). The most differentiated species, H. cumulicola, is pollinated by specialized bees that may move short distances, therefore limiting gene flow among isolated patches. These comparisons emphasize that co-occurring narrowly endemic species can have a diversity of genetic patterns and that many factors can influence the amount and distribution of genetic variation. Further loss of genetic variation due to habitat loss and fragmentation will impact the genetic variation of these species differently. A single conservation strategy for this suite of species is therefore unlikely to achieve genetic conservation goals.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034984693

First of all, they allow to get insight into the genome organization of a species, and to compare the genome structures of different species. Genetic maps are also useful for the identification of genomic regions involved in physiological processes, and are valuable tools for the positional cloning of genes. In the framework of a project with the aim of identifying genomic regions involved in disease resistance in Lolium spp., we constructed genetic maps using different marker systems. In the ryegrass species L. perenne and L. multiflorum self-pollination is prevented by a very efficient self incompatibility system. This has clear implications in mapping studies: inbred lines and double haploids are difficult to produce, and if produced low seed yields are obtained. For this reason, we created several mapping populations by crossing two highly heterozygous unrelated plants. This implies that at any given locus, up to four different alleles might be segregating in the offspring. Different marker systems were used for the construction of the genetic maps. In first instance, AFLP was used as a high throughput marker system. This allowed to generate a high number of DNA-markers useful for map construction in a quick way. The drawback of the AFLP technique is twofold: AFLP markers are 'anonymous', and are dominant (not all alleles at a locus can be detected). Co-dominant marker systems, which allow to detect all alleles present at any locus, are much more informative and are required for the construction of detailed linkage maps in outcrossers. In this study, we used three co-dominant marker systems: SSR, STS and RFLP. The RFLP markers were generated using heterologous probes derived from other monocots, what should allow to analyze the syntenic relationships between ryegrass and other monocots. Using these markers generated with different techniques, a genetic map of ryegrass has been constructed suitable for QTL analysis and comparative genetics.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-21444461603

Results showed that the wheat × jointed goatgrass hybrid can only serve as a female parent to produce the BC1 generation. The BC1 generation was found to have 1.8% male fertility and 4.4% female fertility, indicating that it could serve as either the male or female parent to produce a BC2 generation. The fertility of the resultant BC2 generation further increased. The average male, female, and self-fertility was 8.9, 18.0, and 6.9%, respectively. After the BC2 generation, the backcross progeny has three possible ways to reproduce: to pollinate jointed goatgrass, to be pollinated by jointed goatgrass, or to pollinate itself. Restoration of the chromosome number of jointed goatgrass continues as the BC2 generation is selfed, but some plants can contain an alien chromosome over generations. The possible ways to reduce the chance of gene flow between these two species are (1) prevent the production of hybrids, (2) prevent the production of the BC1 generation, and (3) put a herbicide-resistant gene on the A- or B-genome of wheat.",Biological risk; Herbicide resistance; Introgression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002434118

An 11-year data series of pollen dispersal by birch showed marked annual fluctuations in flowering. Although flowering fluctuated widely among years, a reciprocal relationship was observed between two consecutive years; very little flowering occurred after a mast year. This suggests that there is a negative relationship between current fruiting and flower bud induction. There was a significant positive relationship in flowering between regions, which suggests that weather conditions regulate flowering in birch. A model that included weather variables and resource allocation systems among years explained 94.5 % of the observed annual fluctuations in flowering. In the model, warm spring conditions from bud burst to flower bud development and little flowering in the previous year (t-1) resulted in increased flowering in the current year (t), whereas abundant flowering in year t-2 resulted in a decrease in flowering in the current year (t). The latter indicates that flowering in year t-2 affects resource storage after overwintering; the balance is carried forward to year t-1 and affects the initiation of flower primordia before bud burst. In the model, fluctuating weather conditions in the previous spring strongly affected the masting behaviour of birch. © 2001 Annals of Botany Company.",Betula platyphylla var. japonica; Flowering; Masting; Modelling; Pollen dispersal; Resource allocation; Resource budget model; Weather conditions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035707587

A combined evolutionary biological approach to studying floral monosymmetry in the Lamiales, the order that contains the model plant Antirrhinum, is just beginning to take shape. In contrast, floral left-right asymmetry has largely been neglected, although it is much in discussion in animal biology, probably because in flowers (unlike in animals) left-right asymmetry is not predominant. Nevertheless, there are patterns in the evolution of floral left-right asymmetry that are interesting enough to be addressed by developmental genetics. These are the direction of contortion in flowers with contort petal aestivation, and the direction of deflection of pollination organs in groups with enantiostylous flowers or in some groups with enclosed pollination organs, such as beans (Phaseolinae, Fabaceae) or louseworts (Pedicularis, Orobanchaceae).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035139539

It has been one of the most studied tropical pines and the one with the most commercial importance in Brazil. The objective of this work was to select the best provenances for plantations and best trees in families for the establishment of seed orchards. For that a trial with five provenances and 47 open-pollinated families was planted near Planaltina, Federal District, in the Cerrado Region of Brazil. The provenances tested were Poptun (Guatemala), Gualjoco, Los Limones, El Porvenir and Santa Cruz de Yojoa (Honduras) and assessed at 12 years of age. Poptun and Gualjoco had larger volume, and Los Limones and El Porvenir the lowest incidence of forks and foxtails. Individual tree heritabilities for volume, stem form and branch diameter were 0.34, 0.06, and 0.26 respectively. More than 90% of the trees had defects, common in unimproved P. caribaea.

Four pesticides, selected as markers, were monitored in pollen samples collected in two sampling areas, one located in an intensive agricultural area and the other far from direct pesticide impact. Analytical results were consistent with use patterns of the chemicals and their physico-chemical and persistence properties. For a preliminary estimate of bee exposure via pollen, both by ingestion and by contact, an exposure index was developed, based on physico-chemical properties, persistence and application rates. On the basis of the exposure estimates and acute toxicological data (ingestion and contact LD50), Toxicity Exposure Ratios (TERs) were calculated as indicators of the risk for honeybees due to this particular exposure route. TER values were compared to Hazard Quotient (HQ), calculated as the ratio between application rate and the LC50 value, according to European guidelines, showing a satisfactory agreement. The advantage of the above described procedures is that the environmental fate of the chemicals, and not only application rates, are taken into account. This approach may represent a preliminary tool for a comparative screening of the risk for pollinator insects due to this particular exposure route.",Honeybees; Integrated pest management; Pesticides; Pollen; Risk assessment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033634777

Random mating is performed either using hand-pollination techniques or in wind-pollinated isolated blocks. Eighty-two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were used to examine samples of random mated, hand-pollinated BSSS(R) and BSCB1(R) maize populations to find out whether their genotypic proportions conformed to predicted outcomes of random mating. The majority of loci conformed to expectations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Excess homozygosity was observed at 87% of the loci where the null hypothesis of HWE was rejected. For pairs of polymorphic loci, linkage equilibrium was observed in the BSSS(R) and BSCB1(R) progenitor populations (fewer than 5% of all tests rejected the null hypothesis of equilibrium at the P ? 0.05 significance level). The BSSS(R)C0, BSCB1(R)C0 and BSCB1(R)C12 populations showed slight increases in the proportion of pairs of loci in linkage disequilibrium compared to the progenitors (approximately 8.4% of all pairs of loci rejected the null hypothesis at the P ? 0.05 significance level). BSSS(R)C12 was an extreme outlier with 25.0% of all pairs of polymorphic loci displaying significant (P ? 0.05) linkage disequilibrium. This result was likely caused by the artificial grouping of three BSSS(R)C0 plants with 97 BSSS(R)C12 plants during sampling. Results from principal components analysis of all individuals based on RFLP alleles supported this interpretation. Overall, most of the observed deviations from equilibrium were likely to have been caused by positive assortative mating in the case of HWE, and natural selection for epistatic effects between unlinked loci in the case of link age disequilirium.",Genotypic frequencies; Principal component analysis; Quantitative genetics; RFLP markers; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033675209

Open-pollinated families of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were collected in 2 seed orchards with 28 and 35 families respectively and cultivated for 1 growth period in a growth chamber. Heritability estimates were generally moderate-high (h2 = 0.3-0.8) for growth traits in individual treatments. Joint analyses of all treatments revealed significant family x temperature and family x temperature x water regime interactions. Family x water regime interaction and family effects were not significant. The results indicate low adaptation to water availability and a higher adaptation to different temperatures in the two Swedish Pinus sylvestris populations. If we assume that our results hold for a large part of the rotation the G x E interactions imply that climate change can alter the ranking of clones in a breeding program and thus decrease genetic gain. Studies of family ecovalence values showed that a minority of families (4-31%) contributed significantly to the interactions.

Reducing species loss requires that salient features of natural fire regimes be incorporated into managed regimes. Lightning-season burns have been emphasized as the critical component of disturbance regimes that maintain native biodiversity within endangered longleaf pine savannas, the most diverse plant community in North America. Over evolutionary time, lightning-season fire is thought to have exerted strong selection pressure on plant pollinator interaction, flower production, and seedling establishment. In this study, season of burn had no effect on pollination activity of native legumes. Contrary to the conventional paradigm, we found a wide range of reproductive responses among dominant legumes in response to the season of burn treatments, suggesting that a variable fire season, rather than a single season of burn, is appropriate to maintain a greater variety of native species. We propose that varying the components of fire regimes, rather than selecting a particular fire regime, is likely to be important to conserve biodiversity in this and other fire-dependent communities.",Aristida beyrchiana; Biodiversity; Fire regime; Pinus palustris; Reproduction; Wiregrass,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033709944

However, it is of virtual importance for grass pollen allergic patients with symptoms all the year round to know the concentration of grass pollen allergens in their homes. Objective The main objective of this study was to quantify the amount of grass pollen allergen in mass units (?g Phl p 5) in dust settled indoors and to detect the distribution of allergenic activity in different sampling locations of homes. Furthermore, we studied the seasonal fluctuation of allergen content in dust samples. Methods We adapted the two site binding assay for detection of group 5 grass pollen allergens in samples from randomly selected homes in Hamburg (n = 371), Erfurt (n = 396), Hettstedt (n = 353), Zerbst (n = 289) and Bitterfeld (n= 226), Germany. Dust samples were collected from floor of living room (LR), bedroom (BR) or children's room (CR) and mattress (MA) during period of June 1995 to August 1998. The amount of the major grass group 5 allergens was detected in ?g/g dust. Results Phl p 5 was detected in 67% of the samples analysed (n = 4760). The range was between undetectable (<0.03 ?g/g dust) and 81 ?g/g dust. Phl p 5 levels were significantly higher in the dust from LR (geometric mean 0.117 ?g/g dust) or BR/CR floors (geometric mean 0.098 ?g/g dust) than in mattresses (geometric mean 0.043 ?g/g dust). We observed seasonal fluctuation of indoor Phl p 5 levels with peak in June but also annual differences. Thus Phl p 5 content indoors reflects also the different quantities of pollen counts of annual courses. During pollination period we found two times higher Phl p 5 levels (0.172 ?g/g dust, P < 0.001) than outside of grass pollination season (0.095 ?g/g dust). The indoor Phl p 5 levels outside of season seem to be independent of pollination before. We suppose that settled pollen grains or allergenic material from outdoor particles carried indoors via footwear and clothes accumulates in house dust. Conclusion Although we not known how the allergens in settled dust are equilibrated with those in the air, the considerable high level of Phl p 5 in indoor dust even during periods when no grass pollen is present in the atmosphere may be an important cause of pollen-allergy symptoms outside of season.",Grass pollen allergen; Indoor allergen exposure; Quantification; Seasonal fluctuation; Settled dust,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033692483

Arrays contained single-flowered stems of red-flowered Iris fulva, blue-flowered I. hexagona, and purple-flowered F1 hybrids. At one site, where I. hexagona was the only wild-growing iris, queen bumble bees were the most common pollinator, and the rank order of pollinator visit rates was I. hexagona &gt; F1 &gt; I. fulva. At a second site, where I. fulva predominated in the wild, hummingbirds were the most common pollinators, and this order was reversed: I. hexagona &lt; F1 &lt; I. fulva. Thus, at both sites, the naturally occurring iris was visited most frequently and F1 flowers were visited more frequently than the non-native species. Pollinators used both long-distance and short-distance cues to discriminate among flowers, and differences in visit rates seemed to be based on differences in the ease of access to pollen and nectar rewards on flowers of different size. Analysis of movement patterns between flowers showed that pollinators were more likely to make parental-F1 transitions than heterospecific transitions. These data suggest that pollinator behavior acts as a partial barrier to initial hybridization, although this barrier largely breaks down after F1 formation.

Multilocus genotyping using microsatellite DNA markers allowed the assessment of the pollen source based on single progeny as units of observation. Outcrossing was detectable by the presence of non-maternal alleles at one or more of the loci. In outcrossing cases, three microsatellite alleles were present in unripe seeds, consisting of both maternal alleles and the paternal allele composing the triploid primary endosperm. In ripe seeds, only the diploid embryonal genotype was amplifiable by PCR. Two intertidal populations situated in the German Wadden Sea were almost entirely outcrossing (t ± SE 0.96 ± 0.03, N = 60 and 0.97 ± 0.029, N = 37). Because of the high polymorphism displayed by the eight chosen microsatellites, representing a total of 69 and 76 alleles, the likelihood of erroneously inferring selfing was small (? = 0.0026 and 0.0007). In order to study the correlation of paternity, the coefficient of relatedness was determined within sibships. Relatedness (r ± SE) was calculated as 0.357 ± 0.059 and 0.343 ± 0.037, indicating multiple paternities within inflorescences.

Ornithophily was the dominant pollination mode at high elevations and in wet regions, while entomophily dominated in arid regions. Chiropterophily was most common in wet lowland regions, autogamy in arid sites, and mixed pollination in the lowlands. Pollination modes were rather evenly distributed among life-forms and ecophysiological types, with a few exceptions: terrestrial forest bromeliads, mostly belonging to unarmed, soft-leaved taxa, had a prevalence of entomophily and few ornithophilous species; large, spiny terrestrial bromeliads of Puya and Bromelioideae showed a prevalence of ornithophily; and autogamy was restricted to the neotenous subgenus Diaphoranthema of Tillandsia. The restriction of unspecific pollination modes to the lowlands is hypothesized to be related to the abundance of pollinators, eliminating the need for specialized co-evolution, or to the overall rarity of bromeliads in this environment, precluding the development of specialized relationships. The low representation of entomophilous species in small dry forest regions compared to extensive areas is assumed to be due to the seasonal influx of hummingbirds and/or bats. Overall, the frequency of individual pollination modes was related to the availability of pollinators as determined by temperatures and humidity.",Bats; Bromeliads; Diversity; Hummingbirds; Insects; Montane forest; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034485742

Empirical studies have established that pollinators almost invariably visit a smaller proportion of flowers as patch size increases. This has not been adequately explained. Here I present data on the payoff curve achieved by bumblebees, Bombus lapidarius, when visiting patches containing different numbers of inflorescences, and use the marginal value theorem to predict the optimum duration of stay within patches. The data demonstrate that visiting a declining proportion of inflorescences as patch size increases is an optimal strategy, if we assume that bees are attempting to maximise their rate of reward acquisition. I argue that this occurs because searching for the remaining unvisited inflorescences is easier in a small patch. On large patches, bees visited more inflorescences per patch than predicted (although still visiting a declining proportion). I suggest that this may occur because bees are using simple departure rules which result in near-optimal behaviour. I show that a departure rule based on two successive encounters with empty inflorescences closely predicts observed behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034496786

A previous study of pollen dispersal in which the transfer of individually marked pollinia was monitored, indicated not only that populations of the nonrewarding, bumblebee-pollinated orchid Calypso bulbosa are connected by substantial levels of gene flow, but also that seed production may be the result of self-fertilization to a considerable extent. We examined the genetic structure of 21 C. bulbosa populations in northern Sweden by F-statistics analyses of variation at three polymorphic allozyme loci. Four populations each consisted of two or three distinct patches, which also allowed us to evaluate among-patch differentiation. The inbreeding coefficient over all loci within populations was high (FIS = 0.283). F-statistics indicated that the level of genetic differentiation among patches within populations varied among populations. FST among patches within populations ranged between -0.021 and 0.119 and was significantly different from zero in two of the populations. There was low to moderate genetic differentiation among populations (FST = 0.072). A Mantel test indicated a positive correlation between geographical and genetic distances among populations, but this correlation was dependent on the difference in allele frequencies between the southernmost population sampled and all other populations. Self-fertilization and substructuring within sampling units (within patches and populations) may have contributed to the high inbreeding coefficients observed in many C. bulbosa populations. Long-distance seed and pollen dispersal may account for the low to moderate genetic differentiation among populations.",Deceptive pollination; F-statistics; Orchidaceae; Population differentiation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034513940

Fabaceae, is an endemic plant of Crete with potential for use in commercial floriculture. It is a herbaceous perennial evergreen sub-shrub that flowers from April to June. It forms numerous thick racemes with an average of 50 pink or purple flowers 10 to 12 mm long. A great variability in major morphological characteristics exists among the populations of E. cretica on the island, however color variants are very rare. Selection and breeding is a necessary prerequisite before the plant is marketable, therefore research conducted at the TEI of Heraklion since 1994 has focused on natural and artificial self and cross pollination of pink flowered Ebenus plants. It has been concluded that the zygomorphic flowers of E. cretica are pollinated by insects (bubblebees); the tripping mechanism occurs and seeds are formed by either cross or self pollination. For controlled self-pollination, unripe flower racemes were enveloped in paper bags and shaken by hand or wind to release pollen; however this method gave poor results. Best results were obtained by tripping the flowers while avoiding the introduction of foreign pollen. Self-incompatibility was not observed. Artificial cross-pollination was achieved by emasculating flowers on the female parent, two to four days prior to the dehiscence of the anthers. The corolla is half white and half pink at this stage, turning to a uniform pink when the pollen is ripe. The stigma appears to be fully receptive two days before the dehiscence of the anthers. Each fertilized ovule gives one mature seed approximately three weeks after pollination. This research indicates that breeding techniques can be applied without difficulty to E. cretica in order to develop uniform plant material and new varieties/hybrids with desirable characteristics.",Breeding techniques; Ebenus cretica; Endemic plant; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-31544476451

At one site, regular flower visitation was demonstrated by automated photography and by spool-and-line tracking. Pollen load data for Sminthopsis murina and Sminthopsis griseoventer suggest that these species may also act as pollinators. Evidence for pollination by Phascogale tapoatafa is anecdotal but studies at three locations report extended bouts of nectar feeding, and heavy pollen loads were directly observed at one site. Some 38 plant species are known to be visited by 10 dasyurid species, with 4-10 plant species being visited by each of five dasyurid species.

For these studies, 1st caged plot was meant to be pollinated only by honey bees, 2nd caged plot to be pollinated only by wind and 3rd was kept open, as control (Honeybees + Wind + Other pollinators). Polo proved as a safer insecticide showing minimum mortality of honeybees as compared to Primor at all post treatment intervals.

Such pollination is believed to stimulate parthenogenic egg cell development without fertilization. Therefore, we have studied several factors which can improve the stimulus effect of the pollination. Treatment of trees with kaempherol, which can stimulate pollen germination and pollen tube growth, resulted in inconsistent effects on embryo yield: two out of four years the effect was positive. Repeated pollination has an overall positive effect on embryo yield, although this effect was not observed with all cultivars in all years. When the first pollination was done with pollen irradiated at high dose, and the second one with pollen irradiated at low dose the embryo yield was much higher compared to two pollinations with pollen irradiated at high dose. Pollination of one stigma with 'low dose pollen' and the other four with 'high dose pollen' resulted in higher embryo yield compared to a pollination of all stigmas with 'high dose pollen'. A better embryo yield was obtained for king flowers compared to lateral flowers in a cluster. This effect was observed in all cultivars and for pollen treated at low and high dose.

The pollination ecology of Ixia species can be divided into several distinct systems exploiting insects of four insect orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera). Ixia atrandra, I. curta, I. lutea, I. maculata, I. metelerkampiae, and I. versicolor have salver-shaped, nectarless flowers, in bright colors contrasting with dark ""beetle marks"" and are pollinated exclusively by hopliine scarab beetles. Four Ixia species with narrowly tubular flowers, spreading tepals, and ample nectar are pollinated by long-proboscid flies (Moegistorhynchus longirostris and Philoliche species). Three additional species with tubular flowers, and modest nectar volumes, appear to be pollinated by the pieriid butterfly, Colias electo (Ixia orientalis), or by a combination of hopliine beetles and tabanid flies with short probosces (I. aurea, I. esterhuyseniae, I. tenuifolia). The remaining species are largely pollinated by anthophorine bees or Apis mellifera, but bee pollination comprises three discrete systems. Species pollinated by Anthophora and Pachymelus species (I. capillaris, I. latifolia, I. odorata, I. rapunculoides, I. thomasiae) have cup-shaped flowers that secrete nectar. Salver-shaped flowers of I. flexuosa secrete no nectar, but are pollinated by pollen-collecting Apis mellifera. Buzz pollination by Amegilla fallax in I. scillaris is associated with vertical floral presentation, nectarless flowers, unusual in having a short, closed perianth tube, short, stubby filaments, and anthers dehiscing incompletely from the base. Outgroup comparison suggests that the ancestral pollination system in Ixia is the one in which flowers are cup-shaped, produce nectar, and are pollinated by large anthophorine bees. Exaggeration of the perianth into an elongate tube containing ample nectar, or the closure of the perianth tube and absence of nectar, or the development of basal anther dehiscense must be regarded as specialized adaptations related to their derived pollination strategies.",Apidae; Hopliini; Iridaceae; Ixia; Nemestrinidae; Pollination biology; Tabanidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034496219

Nectar and pollen are potentially valuable sources of energy and protein for these animals. Research on the ecological and physiological problems associated with the use of flower products as a source of nutrition has concentrated primarily on specialist flower-feeding marsupials and bats. As a result, pollen and nectar are often overlooked in dietary studies involving more generalist small mammals. Many of South Africa's Protea species are rodent-pollinated. The plants appear to be highly adapted for rodent pollination, but the rodents are not specialist flower feeders. Most of the rodents are common throughout southern Africa, including regions where suitable flowers are unavailable. We used these animals to address several questions: Is there a link between nectar sugar composition and rodent sugar preference? How do rodents respond to xylose, a pentose sugar found in Protea nectar? How effectively can these rodents dilute their urine in response to high water intake (a common situation for a nectarivore), keeping in mind that many of them are also found in arid environments and can concentrate their urine to a high degree? Can these rodents extract nitrogen from pollen? How do their nitrogen requirements, when fed pollen, compare to their requirements on other foods? A correlation was found between the sugar preferences of the Namaqua rock mouse, Aethomys namaquensis, and the sugar composition of Protea. Xylose was more willingly consumed by the mice than by bird pollinators. The ability of A. namaquensis to metabolize xylose was particularly exciting. At least two rodent species, Rhabdomys pumilio and A. namaquensis, are capable of producing both remarkably dilute urine (30 to 40 mOsm/kg) and highly concentrated urine (3,500 to 5000 mOsm/kg) in response to variable water intake, and A. namaquensis was able to meet its nitrogen requirements eating only small quantities of pollen (700 mg/day). The daily digestible maintenance nitrogen requirements of A. namaquensis on a pollen diet (66 mg) were not significantly different from those predicted for a rodent of its body size feeding on a natural diet. Nectar- and pollen-feeding does pose physiological challenges for small mammals, but these challenges do not preclude the use of these foods by non-specialists. Protea nectar and pollen are likely to be of seasonal importance in the diet of these rodents.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845728205

The populations were established in a concentric donor-acceptor field experiment. Gene flow was found mainly to be affected by the distance between the donor and acceptor plants. Analysing 21 132 acceptor plant progenies, gene flow was shown to decrease rapidly with distance to the donor field up to 75 m, and beyond this distance much more slowly. The ability of donor pollen to fertilize acceptor plants depended very much on the density of the acceptor plants. Pairs of acceptor plants produced more compatible pollen locally, and captured significantly less donor pollen than single-plants. Despite the higher seed production of acceptor plants planted in pairs, the absolute number of heterozygous seeds carrying the donor allele was always lower than for single-plants. Wind direction had only a slight effect upon the type of pollen captured. Because of pollen production within the two plant populations being continuous and overlapping, the time when anthesis occurred had little effect on gene flow between the populations. Vigorous and tall acceptor plants with many panicles, high seed yield and high 1000-seed weight were able to capture more donor pollen than shorter plants. The results may be used to assess the risk of gene flow and to develop strategies for monitoring the spread of transgenes from genetically modified grasses.",Allozymes; Gene flow; Genetic markers; Meadow fescue; Pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034466983

We have tried to improve this efficiency by alternative pollination techniques, treatments with plant growth regulators for better fruit set and normal seed stratification followed by ex vitro germination of selected seeds. The experiments were done witch several cultivars, pollinated with pollen irradiated at different doses. In standard protocols flowers are emasculated and hand pollinated with irradiated pollen, which is a very labour intensive activity. In the case of self incompatible cultivars pollination can be done by a beebooster system. With this system good fruit set, seed set en embryo set was obtained in 'Elstar' and 'Granny Smith'. The homozygous status of the resulting seedlings is still under investigation. On the other hand we have tried to improve fruit set (and embryo production) by application just after pollination of daminozide (an anti GA) and NAAm (an anti auxin derivat). The benefit of the improved fruit set of the NAAm application was lost due to a reduction of the number of embryos per fruit. Daminozide had a slight but positive effect on fruit set, seed set and embryo set, resulting in a higher embryo yield. Parthenogenic seeds were variable in size and weight. Seed set, seed weight and embryo set decreased with increasing irradiation dose. Parthenogenic seeds of normal size contain in most cases normal shaped but slightly smaller embryos than non-parthenogenic seeds. When parthenogenic seeds of more than 50 mg were stratified and sawed in Juffy plugs in a greenhouse, germination was slightly lower or comparable to that obtained in vitro and the percentage of putative homozygous plants was higher.",Beebooster; Embryo set; Embryo size; Plant regeneration; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879432054

In addition, some of selected F1 hybrids as well as the hexaploid hybridogenous species H. rubrum Peter were open pollinated and their offspring was studied. In most crosses the sexuals served as seed parents, while the pollen donors were usually facultative apomicts. A considerable karyological diversity was recorded within the progeny of some of individual seed parents, hybridizing easily due to (at least facultative) sexuality. In addition, the haploid parthenogenesis and the participation of unreduced gametes (probably the fertilization of unreduced egg cell) contributed to offspring diversity. These reproduction modes, together with apomictic reproduction and fertilization of reduced egg cell, caused the rise of extremely diverse progeny of H. rubrum. The haploid parthenogenesis connected with aneuploidy was recorded as a new observation. Although the aneuploids are very rare in nature in Europe, the abundant and viable aneuploid progeny can be easily obtained from experimental crosses. Similarly, the viable triploids arising frequently from the crosses between diploid and tetraploid species, are in contrast to sparse occurrence of triploid cytotypes in the field. The reasons for these disproportions are discussed. Whereas the reduced competitive ability is expected in polyhaploids in the field, the natural polyploids originated spontaneously from the unreduced gametes may be more common.

Cross-pollination includes recognition and pistil activation and leads to seed set. Self-pollen germinate, and their pollen tubes penetrate the ovules but after fertilization they abort. A group of glycoproteins in the pollen coat seems implicated as signal molecules for recognition and activation. Pistil activation is expressed as extra water uptake in the pistil, especially in the fluid pollen tube pathway, and results in higher in vitro pollen tube penetration in the ovular micropyle. In the fluid pollen tube pathway of unpollinated styles a high concentration of sucrose, glucose and fructose is present. The level of these carbohydrates remains the same during the pollen tube growth of cross-pollen. This level decreases after the passage of self-pollen through the stylar channel, and the level of carbohydrates is restored. This implies extra carbohydrate influx in the pollen tube pathway after cross-pollination. Recognition and activation signals act together after cross-pollination of Gasteria. After self-pollination the utilization of carbohydrates lowers the pistil's carbohydrate capacity, perhaps also leading to a late-acting incompatibility.",Activation; Fructose and sucrose consumption; Gasteria; Glucose; Ovular incompatibility; Pollen tube growth; Recognition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034354109

The existing experimental evidence has been studied, along with practical experience from, for example, seed certification schemes, to assess the relationship between distance from pollen sources and cross-pollination levels in adjacent crops. The study has covered all production and breeding systems for maize, oilseed rape and beet. This paper describes the scope of the study, considers the most important factors influencing levels of cross-pollination, and recommends separation distances needed to achieve off-type thresholds of 0.1%, 0.5% and 1.0% in commercial non-seed crops. The levels at which wind-borne maize pollen fertilizes adjacent crops is strongly affected by the size of the emitting crop, the strength of the wind and any barriers that intervene. Hence the separation distances have been derived from experiments where these factors seem to have been very favourable. Maize grain is the only part of the plant affected by cross-pollination. Separation of receptor crops intended for silage can be reduced and still keep cross-pollination within specified levels. For oilseed rape, the levels of cross-pollination between fields declines rapidly with distance. Where the receptor crop contains male sterile plants the levels of cross-pollination are increased compared to conventional varieties. Cross pollination does not affect the produce of non-seed beet crops.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034449153

All species received insect visitation; the larger-flowered species had more visitors.

Inflorescences consist of pleiothvrses whose smallest elements are three-flowered cymes. The upper flowers of each cyme are subtended by a bract with two prophylls, functioning as bract of the smaller flowers, and are surrounded by a variable number of colleters. Sepals fail to develop, are present as two pairs of different size, or as a single lateral pair. The four petals arise as broad diagonally inserted lobes around a central depression. The stamen primordia emerge on the inner slopes of the cup-like flower primordium in the interstices of the large petal lobes. The gynoecium develops externally as two shallow stylar primordia whereas most of the ovary is embedded in the receptacular tissue. The two erect styles are lined on their inner side with stigmatic papillae. Placentation is strictly spoken central-basal; an apical septum is formed after ovule initiation by downward growth of tissue subjacent to the styles and connects postgenitally with the placenta. Sterilisation of one of the sexes occurs at the onset of ovule initiation in staminate flowers, and after anther development in pistillate flowers. Differences of morphs become manifest just before anthesis with reflexed petals in staminate flowers and erect petals in the pistillate forms. There is no trace of a nectary. The use of the terms 'early' and 'late' sympetaly is discussed for the Rubiaceae. It is shown that the nature of a 'corolla tube' is not necessarily homologous in the family and relates to fluctuations of three processes: the extent of growth of a meristematic zone common to stamens and petals (stamen-corolla tube), the growth of a petal tube sensu stricto, and postgenital fusion of filaments with the corolla. The development of a concave floral primordium determines the existence of a peripheral collar or 'early sympetaly.' Gynoecial development is compared with other Rubiaceae. It is suggested that ovaries arise along a common pattern in the family. Differences in position of placentation are related with the heterogenous nature of the septum that consists of a basal and apical section. The flower of Galopina tomentosa is characteristic for the wind-pollinated Anthospermeae with a strong tendency for reduction.

Seedlings cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium produced somatic embryos directly on hypocotyls and cotyledons after 2 to 3 subcultures onto the same medium. A low pH of the medium (3.5-5) was more conducive to somatic embryogenesis than a higher pH (6 and 7). Embryogenic potential of the seeds was inversely correlated to seed age: about 41-68% of immature seeds between the ages of 14 and 28 days after pollination (DAP) formed somatic embryos compared to 0-11% of the seeds obtained 29-37 DAP. About 54% of the somatic embryos produced secondary embryos after subculturing onto the same medium. The embryogenic potential of the cultures has been maintained on MS basal medium for 2 years (12 generations) without diminution. Up to 75% of the secondary embryos developed into plantlets on MS medium enriched with 10-6 M zeatin, and 40% of these produced flowers when transferred to an optimised flower-induction medium.

Hand pollinations were carried out to produce self- and outcross-pollinated CH progeny, and CL seeds were also collected. In a greenhouse, selfed and outcrossed CH flowers produced similar numbers of seeds, and both types of progeny had similar survival rates and comparable numbers of CH flowers, although outcrossed CH progeny had 14% greater vegetative biomass than selfed CH progeny. The level of inbreeding depression in V. canadensis was low, indicating that there may be few drawbacks to selfing in this species. A comparison of CL and self-pollinated CH progeny showed that, although there were differences in CH flower number, overall fitness differences were minimal.

The flow of genes may occur through pollen since it is the reproductive system that is designed for gene movement. Pollen-mediated gene escape is hard to control in mating plants. Pollen from a wind pollinator can move over distances of more than 1000 m. To investigate the efficiency of transgenic pollen movement under realistic environmental conditions, the use of bait plants might be an effective tool. In this study, cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) sugar beets were tested with regard to their potential for monitoring transgene flow. As the pollen source, transgenic sugar beets were used that express recombinant DNA encoding viral (beet necrotic yellow vein virus) resistance, and antibiotic (kanamycin) and herbicide (glufosinate) tolerance genes. In a field trial, the effectiveness of a hemp (Cannabis sativa) stripe containment strategy was tested by measuring the frequency of pollinated CMS bait plants placed at different distances and directions from a transgenic pollen source. The results demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the containment strategy. Physiological and molecular tests confirmed the escape and production of transgenic offspring more than 200 m behind the hemp containment.

The strategy utilizes F2 hybrids produced from two parents similar in agronomic and quality traits but which differ in their plant genes for resistance to a pest or pathogen. The grower would plant F2 hybrid seed that should allow for the expression of hybrid vigor for agronomic and quality traits while presenting a diverse population of plants to the pest or pathogen in which individual plants differ for their pest resistance genotype. This strategy will be suitable especially in self-pollinated crops like cotton (Gossypium spp.) where there is no significant effect of inbreeding depression. This simulates nature where the pest or pathogen is exposed to a population of host plants that differ in resistance genes. This strategy should delay or minimize the selection of a dominant pest or pathogen biotype that can damage and reproduce on the resistant plants resulting in the loss of the usefulness of the resistant genes. Careful selection of individual genes should allow this strategy to utilize the advantages of strong vertical resistance genes while maintaining the sustainability advantages of horizontal resistance. This strategy also provides for a refuge of a small percentage of the plants in an F2 population which do not carry any resistance genes, thus providing an additional benefit in resistance management against genetically engineered pest resistant crops.

Their distribution is restricted, mainly associated with ""campos rupestres"", a montane biome in SE Brazil. Both species proved to be self-compatible but because of herkogamy they are greatly dependent on visitors to effect pollination. The main pollinators are medium-sized bees. In experiments where pollinators were excluded or discouraged the percentage of abscised fruits was total or extremely high; most of these fruits dropped within the first two weeks after pollination in D. orbicularis and three weeks in D. hirsutus. The percentage of surviving fruits from control or manual pollination was higher in D. orbicularis (ca. 70%) than in D. hirsutus (ca. 50%). Seed set was very variable, with slightly lower means in D. hirsutus. Within each species the mean seed set was similar in self-, cross-pollinated fruits, and controls. In both species, the similarity between control and manual pollination fruit survival curves suggests that factors other than pollen limitation are the cause of abortion in the study area. The high rate of abscission, which was also observed in unmanipulated fruits, was attributed to resource limitation. In D. hirsutus this was caused by drought during seed development. In D. orbicularis it was enhanced by nutrient drain by shoot-galling flies. The lack of selective abortion of either selfed fruits or fruits with a small number of seeds may be a useful mechanism to overcome this detrimental effect which is felt later during fruit development.",Brazil; Diplusodon; Fruit abortion; Lythraceae; Pollination; Rupestrian fields,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034488317

Ipomopsis flowers were hand-pollinated with either pure conspecific pollen (the control) or with C. linariaefolia pollen applied prior to, simultaneously with, or following conspecific pollen. Flowers that were simultaneously given C. linariaefolia and I. aggregata pollen received 39% less conspecific pollen than flowers in the control, but did not set fewer seeds per fruit. Flowers that were given C. linariaefolia pollen first received 30% less conspecific pollen and set 38% fewer seeds per fruit than the control. These results suggest that there is a priority effect; deposition of C. linariaefolia pollen on I. aggregata flowers results in competition, but only when C. linariaefolia pollen is deposited first. Unlike pollen of another competitor of I. aggregata (Delphinium nelsonii Greene. Per.), C. linariaefolia pollen caused competition without inducing an increased rate of stigma closure. Only 12% of I. aggregata's stigmas closed when C. linariaefolia pollen was deposited, and seed set of I. aggregata was reduced relative to the control whether their stigmas closed or not. The low rate at which C. linariaefolia pollen induces closure of I. aggregata's, stigmas could be an adaptation to reduce the negative effects of competition.",Castilleja linariaefolia; Competition; Hand pollination; Hummingbirds; Ipomopsis aggregata; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007821346

(FRIM), Kepong, 52109 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","The mating system of Dryobalanops aromatica in three different forest types and a seed orchard was quantified by allozyme analysis of progeny arrays using a mixed-mating model. The primary forest (Bukit Sai) had the highest multilocus outcrossing rate (tm = 0.923 ± 0.035), followed by logged forest (Lesong; tm = 0.766 ± 0.056) and artificial forest (FRIM; tm = 0.661 ± 0.066) with seed orchard showing the lowest (Tampin; tm = 0.551 ± 0.095). Deviations from the mixed mating model were evident from differences in pollen and ovule allele frequencies, and heterogeneity of pollen pools in all three different forest types and the seed orchard. A high rate of outcrossing in primary forest (tm = 0.92) may indicate that the species is self-incompatible, but a lower value in the seed orchard (tm = 0.55) might suggest further that the self-incompatibility system is weak. The outcrossing rate was greater in the primary forest (tm = 0.92) than in logged forest (tm = 0.77). It is argued that this might be a consequence of the lower density of flowering trees and alteration of pollinator foraging behaviour in logged forest. Higher values of correlated mating (rp) and biparental mating (tm - ts) in primary forest (0.08 and 0.39, respectively) in comparison with logged forest (0.03 and 0.11, respectively) demonstrate that logging activities might reduce the seeds produced through consanguineous mating. Compared with primary forest, it is argued that lower rates of outcrossing in artificial forest (tm = 0.67) and seed orchard (tm = 0.55) might be attributed to lack of flowering synchrony and insufficient number of pollinators. The high level of correlated mating (rp = 0.43) and biparental mating (tm - ts = 0.12) in the seed orchard may further suggest that the seed orchard was established using related seed sources.",Allozyme; Dipterocarpaceae; Dryobalanops aromatica; Kapur; Mating system; Tropical rain forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034502838

The process of haploid embryo induction has been macroscopically well studied, but only limited data exist from microscopic examination of ovule development status at the inoculation stage and of the origin of gynogenic embryos. Microscopic studies were carried out using individual donor plants with relatively high embryo induction frequencies (45.9 embryos formed per 100 flowers, on average, for 2 years). Ovaries from flower bud culture were fixed at 1 week intervals up to the 7th week of culture. These were compared with pollinated ovaries at 1 or 2 weeks after pollination. In total, 1428 unfertilized embryo sacs were examined. The results indicate that, at the time of inoculation, ovules within ovaries 2.0-3.0 mm in diameter contained two- or four-nucleate embryo sacs in the smallest ovaries to mature embryo sacs in the largest ovaries. It seems likely that the embryos are actually induced from ovaries cultured at the immature stage. After 1 or 2 weeks in culture, the egg apparatus primarily consisted of distinctly enlarged synergids and the egg cell, which was often detached from the micropylar pole. But free nuclear endosperm was also formed. From the 2nd to 7th week in culture, formation of haploid embryos (from globular to the almost mature cylindrical stage) was detected in 5.7% of the ovules. Their origin, for several reasons, was most likely the egg cell. In addition, ovules containing endosperm only (3.6%) and ovules containing the egg apparatus (0.5%) or both endosperm and embryo (0.4%) were detected.

The attack to terminal flower heads followed the overall attack risk at the plant level. The density of ovipositing females early in the season was the most likely explanation for the attack pattern.

The pollen was collected in 1984 with Cour traps. Most pollen types in the atmosphere of the studied sites are from woody species; a less important proportion comes from herbaceous species. The most abundant pollen types are: Cupressaceae, Ostrya, Moraceae, Pinaceae, Urticaceae, Graminaceae, Betula, Platanus, Quercus and Castanea. Trieste is quite different from the other sampling sites, both for the higher values of overall pollen counts and for the superabundant pollen shedding of Cupressaceae, Ulmaceae, Ostrya, Quercus, Moraceae, Oleaceae, Pinus, Castanea, Graminaceae, Urticaceae and other minor taxa. Udine often proves similar to Trieste, although the sites have different pollen count values.

Measurement of physical parameters such as mean capsule weight, mean seed weight and mean ratio of the weight of the capsule contents to the weight of the empty capsule showed no significant differences between woodland and isolated trees. In contrast, reproductive output as measured by mean number of seeds per capsule, mean number of seeds per 10 g of capsule contents and mean seed weight as a percentage of the weight of the capsule contents, was significantly lower (45-48% less) in isolated trees than in woodland trees. Mean percentage seed germination was also significantly lower (14% less) in the isolated trees and the mean number of viable seeds per 10 g of capsule contents was only 38% of the woodland trees. These results indicate that E. melliodora, like many eucalypts, has a mixed mating breeding system with preferential outcrossing but is also capable of self pollination leading to a reduction in seed yield and viability. The woodland and isolated trees produced a mean of 4.6 and 2.1 seeds per capsule, respectively.

We demonstrate how ecology helps us understand forests and forest change and argue an urgent need for a wider appreciation and utilisation of current knowledge. We illustrate how forest managers must take a holistic, long-term landscape-level view, and how change in itself is inevitable. We start by considering familiar concerns relating to silviculture and canopy disturbance. From the basis, we move into the neglected biology of tree pollination and seed dispersal and the risks associated with animal loss. We identify the increasing threats from fire, exotic species, and habitat fragmentation. Finally, we consider the difficult balance between timber production and conservation related values: We then suggest how our ecological overview, with its mixture of common sense and more subtle insights, might be translated into beneficial actions and conclude that considerable progress is attainable, but requires collaboration between ecologists and forest managers. Initiatives that seek to reform forest practices in the tropics require a sound ecological basis to better address the many challenges facing modern forestry in these regions - such a basis is, in large part, already available for wider use. We provide some illustrations as to how management may be improved. Fundamental to these is the recognition that ecological knowledge is crucial to forestry but currently too often ignored, and that considerable and rapid progress is possible if ecologists, foresters, and others can find ways to work together and address this directly.",Biodiversity; Conservation; Education; Landscape ecology; Rainforest; Reduced impact logging; Tropical silviculture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034485409

Don) Bojin is typically andromonoecious while the other species in the same genus are basically monoecious. The evolutionary advantages of male flowers and hermaphrodite flowers in S. guyanensis subsp. lappula were assessed by measuring sex allocation and pollen movements in two wild populations of the species. Two cultivated populations served as controls. The percentage of male flowers was very low in the two wild populations in Dongxiang, Jiangxi Province and Wuyishan, Fujian Province, viz., 2.48% and 0.96% respectively. In the two cultivated populations, male flower percentage significantly increased when the soil was of higher nutrient content. This indicates that the allocation to male versus female reproduction might change in response to environmental factors. Pollen production per male flower was 4.1 times higher than that of a hermaphrodite flower. The floral shape and size of male and hermaphrodite flowers were similar. No difference was observed between these dimorphological flowers in pollen germination rate in vitro and in the speed of pollen tube growth in vivo. Anthesis was only 4 - 5 h. Male flowers usually opened 0.5 h earlier than hermaphrodite flowers. An unexpected finding was that no pollen from the male flowers was found on the stigmas of the hermaphrodite flowers, in spite of the occasional visits by insects to both types of flowers in both wild and control populations. A consistent pattern of fruit development was found to exist in open pollinated flowers as well as in flowers that had been bagged. The sex ratios did not have significant influence on fruit set. Approximately 25% of the pistils in a gynoecium failed to develop into fruits because no pollen was deposited on them, indicating that the fruit set of this andromonoecious plant is mainly affected by pollen limitation rather than resource limitation. Reproduction in S. guyanensis subsp. lappula in the habitats was dependent on self-pollination in hermaphrodite flowers. The male flowers in this species might be a potential source of additional pollination and may facilitate cross-pollination. The fact that the flowers of monoecious species in Sagittaria pollinated by a wide diversity of insect visitors may contribute enormously to the diversification of sex expression in this genus.",Andromonoecy; Evolution; Lappula; Sagittaria guyanensis subsp; Sex expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034462094

Spondias mombin was seasonal and highly synchronous in flower and fruit production among islands and across years. Proportions of individuals fruiting varied among islands, years, and tree size classes. There was a positive relationship between probability of fruit production and tree size. Synchronous reproductive activity in S. mombin probably was due to responses to proximate environmental cues such as fluctuations in irradiance, but other factors must have been responsible for temporal and spatial variation in reproductive performance.

End results are expressed as predicted average gain per year. The patterns of predicted response to selection vary widely between inferred covariance structures.

This disease-induced frequency-dependent selection was not sufficient to maintain polymorphism for resistance genes in the host populations. The present study examines whether interactions between disease and competition could impact upon the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in a highly self-pollinated species such as wheat, where strong associations between traits are likely. Four different two-way mixtures of wheat genotypes, susceptible to different races of P. striiformis, were planted at different frequencies in both the presence and absence of disease. In order to examine the influence of competition and disease on the maintenance of genetic polymorphism, relationships between host absolute fitness and host frequency were studied for each genotype in the mixtures of plants both in the presence and in the absence of disease. In the absence of disease, the absolute fitness of the stronger competitor was often negatively frequency-dependent, or else it did not vary with host frequency; the absolute fitness of the weaker competitor was often positively frequency-dependent. Disease typically rendered the slopes between absolute fitness and genotype frequency more negative for the stronger competitor. However, the influence of disease was not strong enough to reverse the sign of the slope between absolute fitness and genotype frequency for the genotype that was the weaker competitor in the absence of disease. Thus, disease was unable to reverse the relative ranking of the two genotypes caused by competition and create the negative frequency dependence on both genotypes in a mixture that is required for the maintenance of genetic polymorphism.",Absolute fitness; Competition; Genetic polymorphism; Linkage disequilibrium; Resistance genes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034508724

Owing in part to the advent and rapid expansion of computer technologies, the number of fossil plant form-function models has burgeoned in the last two decades and encompasses every level of biological organization ranging from molecular self-assembly to ecological and evolutionary dynamics. This recent and expansive interest in modeling fossil plant form-function relationships is discussed in the context of the general philosophy of modeling past biological systems and how the reliability of models can be examined (i.e., direct experimental manipulation or observation of the system being modeled). This philosophy is illustrated and methods of validating models are critiqued in terms of four models drawn from the author's work (the quantification of wind-induced stem bending stresses, wind pollination efficiency of early Paleozoic ovulate reproductive structures, population dynamics and species extinction in monotypic and ""mixed"" communities, and the adaptive radiation of early vascular land plants). The assumptions and logical (mathematical) consequences (predictions) of each model are broadly outlined, and, in each case, the model is shown to be overly simplistic despite its ability to predict the general or particular behavior or operation of the system modeled. Nonetheless, these four models, which illustrate some of pros and cons of modeling fossil form-function relationships, are argued to be pedagogically useful because, like all models, they expose the internal logical consistency of our basic assumptions about how organic form and function interrelate.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034472357

D-type cyclins are considered to be important parts of the signal transduction for stimulation of DNA replication and cell division. To study the function of D cyclins in fruit development, full-length cDNA clones for three D cyclin genes were isolated from young tomato fruit. They were classified as D3 cyclins by sequence similarities and a phylogenetic analysis and named as LeCycD3;1, LeCycD3;2 and LeCycD3;3. The deduced amino acid sequences for LeCycD3;1-3 contained a retinoblastoma-binding motif and a PEST-destruction motif. Pollination and fertilization were followed by a high increase in the transcript levels of LeCycD3;1-3 in young fruit. Using in situ hybridization, high expression of LeCycD3;3 was detected in the vascular tissue of young fruit suggesting a role in vascular development. The D3 cyclins are probably involved in transducing the signals leading to fruit growth by cell divisions. Distinct differences were detected in their temporal and spatial expression patterns suggesting that they play different roles in fruit development as well as in the development of other plant organs.",Cell cycle; Cyclin; Fruit development; Lycopersicon esculentum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034536950

This field had been planted with glufosinate-resistant and imidazolinone-resistant B. napus in 1997 and was adjacent to a field that had grown glyphosate-resistant B. napus. Mature volunteer B. napus were collected on a 50- by 100-m grid in the field. Progeny from 34 volunteers were sprayed with glyphosate at 440 g ae ha-1, and the survivors were sprayed with either glufosinate or imazethapyr at 400 or 50 g ai ha-l, respectively. Where seed numbers permitted (14 volunteers), seedlings were also sprayed sequentially with glyphosate, glufosinate, and imazethapyr, at 440 g ae ha -l, 400 g ai ha-1, and 50 g ai ha-1, respectively. In total, 15 volunteers had progeny that were between 66 and 82% resistant to glyphosate, consistent with the predicted 3:1 resistant: susceptible ratio. Volunteer B. napus plants with glyphosate-resistant seedlings were most common close to the putative pollen source; however, a plant with glyphosate-resistant progeny was collected 500 m from the adjacent field edge. Seedlings from all nine volunteers collected from the glufosinate-resistant area showed multiple resistance to glyphosate and glufosinate, whereas seedlings from 10 of 20 volunteers collected from the imidazolinone-resistant area showed resistance to imazethapyr and glyphosate. DNA extraction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of seedlings confirmed that mature B. napus volunteers were hybrids resulting from pollen transfer rather than inadvertent seed movement between fields. Two seedlings from the 924 screened were resistant to all three herbicides. Progeny from these self pollinated individuals were resistant to glyphosate and glufosinate at the predicted 3:1 resistant: susceptible ratio and resistant to imazethapyr at the predicted 15:1 resistant susceptible ratio. Sequential crossing of three herbicide-resistant varieties is the most likely explanation for the observed multiple herbicide resistance. Integrated management techniques, including suitable crop and herbicide rotations, herbicide mixtures, and nonchemical controls should be used to reduce the incidence and negative effect of B. napus volunteers with multiple herbicide resistance.",Herbicide tolerance; Oilseed rape; Pollen transfer; Volunteer canola,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034493524

Box 3000, 90401 Oulu, Finland","Apical dominance is advantageous in conditions favoring rapid growth in height and unbranched architecture. The cost of apical dominance, on the other hand, should be expressed in conditions where fecundity increases along with an increasing number of branches. Apical damage can be used to measure such costs: when suppressed meristems are released from apical inhibition, the vegetative and reproductive productivity of initially unbranched plants should increase owing to the regrowth and increased branch development following damage. We studied these regrowth responses in two monocarpic herbs, Erysimum strictum P. Gaertn., B. Mey., and Scherb. and Rhinanthus minor L., after both apical damage (10% of the shoot cut) and more extensive damage (50 and 75% cutting). Both species tolerated apical damage, although severe damage had detrimental effects on the performance of both, especially R. minor. Apical damage had positive effects on most of the measured performance parameters of Erysimum. However, the success of seed germination collapsed, presumably due to delayed flowering and less successful pollination. The response was parallel in Rhinanthus; apical damage affected neither the vegetative biomass nor fecundity, but heavier damage, especially 75% clipping, led to severe reductions in most performance measures. The differences in regrowth responses are presumably due to the different habitat requirements of the species. Rhinanthus prefers relatively dense vegetation and starts to branch and produce flowers after a certain threshold in height has been reached, whereas Erysimum prefers gaps in vegetation. In this species, unbranched architecture may be favored in closed vegetation and branched architecture in less competitive habitats. In both species, fruit production correlated positively with the number of branches in both control and clipped plants, which is consistent with the assumption of the cost of apical dominance.",Apical dominance; Competition; Damage; Meristem; Overcompensation; Regrowth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001439233

Seedlings from 6-10 open-pollinated families from seven provenances, spanning the geographic range of the species, were planted in a single-tree-plot, sets-in-replications design with 30 replications at two sites-Omataroa (near Whakatane) and Parakao (west of Whangarei). The Omataroa trial was badly frosted during the first winter and was abandoned after frost scoring. The Parakao trial was assessed for diameter at breast height 1.4 m (dbh), bole straightness, forking, and crown health at ages 2 and 6 years, and height and wood density of a subsample were measured at age 6. There were significant differences between provenances at Parakao at both ages for all traits except dbh and wood density at age 6. Family differences, not generally significant at age 2, were highly significant for all traits at age 6. Heritability (narrow-sense) at age 6 varied from 0.10 for straightness to 0.26 for health. Family mean heritability varied from 0.50 for diameter increment to 0.62 for health. Growth rate and crown health were good; overall mean dbh was 200 mm and mean height of dominants and codominants was 15 m by age 6 at the Northland site. The main deficiencies were the initially low survival (50% at Parakao) caused variously by possum browsing and frost, and stem malformation caused by forking and top breakage. It was concluded that the potential for gain from combined selection using provenance, family, and individual performance was good for all traits but that the trial contained too little material on which to base a future breeding programme.

One of the early steps of the selection process consists in testing the hybrid progenies for their resistance to scab. With the aim of standardising the inoculation scab test conditions, the seedlings are quantitatively inoculated in a bench of original conception by spraying conidia suspended in distilled water. This equipment guaranteeing a very homogeneous distribution of the liquid, therefore the influence of scab inoculum concentration can be studied.

The final fruit set is very low, specially in orchards planted only with this cultivar. This problem is very common in olive cultivars. Thus, the investigations focused on the development and the morphology of the reproductive organs: Pollen grain quality and quantity, pollen germination and pollen tube growth, fertilisation and fruit set. Another two olive cultivars 'Grossa de Spagna' and 'Rasie' were used for cross-pollination. One month before anthesis, the two tetrasporangiate anthers were developed. About three weeks before anthesis, the microspore mother cells were observed clearly. Through a week, they developed to the microspore tetrade stage. Finally, the fully developed pollen grains could be observed about five days before anthesis. The pollen grain number of the pollinizers was higher than in 'Nabali Baladi'. The normal pollen grains were more than 82% for the three cultivars in both years. The pollen viability was tested on an agar medium 0,8%, containing 10% sucrose and 50 ppm citric acid. Immersion of the pollen grains in olive oil before spreading them on the medium improved this test significantly. The pistil consists of a superior ovary, short style, and wet papillate stigma. It was developed about six days before anthesis. A protuberance structure arised from the placenta of the ovary about four weeks before anthesis which developed to the anatropous ovule. Each carpel contained two ovules and only one ovule developed to the seed. The first embryo sac mother cell could be recognised in the middle of the ovule about two weeks before anthesis. The embryo sac with eight nuclei was completed about two days before anthesis. The pollen tubes grew intercellularly through the stigma and the transmitting tissue in the style. One pollen tube entered the ovary to fertilise one ovule through the micropyle. The stigmas with a high pollen grain number had also a high number of germinated pollen grains. The flowers which had less than ten germinated pollen grains on the stigma had low percentage of fertilised ovaries. In most of self-pollinated flowers, all germinated pollen grains could not penetrate the transmitting tissue in the style, while in open- and cross-pollination, most of the flowers had germinated pollen grains, and the tubes grew through the transmitting tissue in the style. In open- and cross-pollination, the pollen tubes started to enter the ovules two to three days before in self-pollination. In addition to that, the percentage of the fertilised ovules in open- and cross-pollination was about three times higher than in self-pollination. One week after anthesis, there was no difference in length between the fertilised and the non-fertilised ovules. Two weeks after anthesis, the ovule length doubled and the non-fertilised ovules degenerated. From the third week till the seventh week after anthesis, the ovule grew almost logarithmically. Eight weeks after anthesis till the mature stage, there was no further increase in the ovule size. The nuclear endosperm started to develop five days after anthesis. It became cellular 15 days after anthesis. The absorption of the nucellus tissue and the endosperm was very clear during the embryo development. The zygote was observed nine days after anthesis. Four and five weeks after anthesis, it developed to a long narrow suspensor. Six weeks after anthesis, the embryo reached the globular stage. One week later, it started to develop two cotyledons (heart-shaped) which developed quickly to the full length 12 weeks after anthesis. Finally, the embryo and the partly absorbed endosperm reached the final stage about 22 weeks after anthesis. The perfect flowers abscised in two ways: The non-fertilised perfect flowers abscised through the second week after anthesis, and part of the fertilised flowers abscised from two to six weeks after anthesis. After that, there was no significant fruit drop. The fruit set in open- and cross-pollination was significantly higher than in self-pollination. According to these results, 'Nabali Baladi' can be considered as a partial self-compatible cultivar. Its self-incompatibility is gametophytic. Therefore, in 'Nabali Baladi' orchards, two other pollinizers are recommended. 'Rasie' and 'Grossa de Spagna' are good pollinizers for 'Nabali Baladi'. In old 'Nabali Baladi' orchards, it is recommended to graft the olive trees with at least two pollinizers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034467349

A ring meristem in Adrastaea initiates a whorl of five stamens, alternate with the first stamens but outside their whorl. In radially symmetrical species of Hibbertia, a first ring of stamens is supplemented centrifugally by additional stamens on a meristem ring. The first stamens in zygomorphic species of Hibbertia initiate as a terminal ridge on the floral apex, with subsequent stamens added centrifugally on one side and two carpels initiated on the opposite side.

There are examples of parallel palynomorphological evolution associated with divergent evolution of sporophytes. In other cases, conservative pollen morphologies lag behind of the rapidly evolving sporophytes or, on the contrary, pollen evolution overtakes slowly evolving sporophytes. The coincidence of major evolutionary stages of whole plant morphology and palynomorphology resulted from global ecosystem events that simultaneously affected plant vegetative functions, reproduction strategy and pollination ecology. The most typical palynomorpholoical reactions to such events were a substitution of functions in multifunctional structures or paedomorphic innovations. Recurrence of pollen morphologies is a consequence of recurrent ecosystem states.

For restoring male fertility in the hybrids, dominant, nuclear restorer genes are necessary. However, current pollinator lines are only partial restorers. Effective restorers were recently detected in the German inbred line L18 and in materials originating from the Argentinian rye cultivar Pico Gentario and an Iranian primitive rye accession called IRAN IX. F2 populations were developed for each of these three restorer sources to map the responsible genes by means of RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) markers. For this purpose, homo- and heterologous DNA probes were used leading to 101 polymorphic marker loci in total. For phenotypic evaluation, 100 to 134 randomly chosen plants from each of the populations were cloned and grown at two or three locations with two plants each. Segregation ratios of pollen fertility in the F2 populations with L18 and IRAN IX were in accordance with a monogenic dominant inheritance. The segregation pattern for Pico Gentario indicated complementary gene action. Major dominant restorer genes were detected on chromosomes IRS (L18) and 4RL (Pico Gentario, IRAN IX). The gene on 1RS explained 54% of the phenotypic variation and that on 4 RL 59% and 68% in the Pico Gentario and IRAN IX populations, respectively. Additionally, three minor genes from L18 were identified on chromosomes 3RL, 4RL and 5R. In the Pico Gentario population, a dominant modifier gene contributed by the female parent was found on chromosome 6R. This gene significantly enhanced the expression of the major restorer gene but on its own was not able to restore any degree of fertility. The map-distances between the major restorer loci and at least one flanking marker were small in all three F2 populations (5-6 cM). In Pico Gentario an unfavorable linkage exists between the major restorer gene and a QTL for plant height. Since highly effective restorers are scarce in actual breeding populations, the major restorer genes detected on chromosomes 1 RS and 4RL should be introgressed into actual restorer lines. This is facilitated by using the closely linked molecular markers described.",CMS; Genetic resources; Hybrid rye; Restorer genes; RFLP markers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034526225

Because of this self-incompatibility, fruit production is dependent on the activity of insects, which is strongly influenced by weather conditions. Self-incompatibility therefore leads to irregular fruit production. To obtain self-fertile apple trees, plants from the strongly self-incompatible apple cv. 'Elstar' were transformed with either a sense or antisense copy of one of the endogenous alleles of the S-gene which controls the self-incompatibility reaction. In spring 1999 these transgenic trees were flowering. For each tree part of the flowers were self-pollinated and part were cross-pollinated with pollen of the cross-compatible apple cv. 'Delbard Jubile'. Analysis of fruit and seed set revealed that in some lines the self-incompatibility mechanism was switched off. Fruit and seed set after self-pollination in these lines were comparable to that obtained after cross-pollination. Fluorescence microscopy further confirmed that in these lines the incompatibility mechanism was switched off as pollen tubes were frequently observed in the ovules six days after self-pollination.","""Elstar'; Fruit set; Malus x domestica; Pollen tube growth; Seed set",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141986855

Thell, 2n = 6X = 42, AABBDD) breeding programs aim to reorganize genotypes to achieve better yields, environmental adaptation and food quality. The necessary interdisciplinary for breeding purposes requires an accurate choice of the most appropriate cellular and/or molecular strategies available to be integrated with agronomic approaches in order to overcome the genetic limitation of each cultivated species, at each agroecosystem. Cytogenetics has given a great contribution to wheat genetic studies and breeding, due to viability of chromosomal variants because of homoeology among genomes in this allohexaploid species and the genus Triticum. The level of development of cytogenetic techniques achieved over the last 60 years has set wheat apart from other cereal crops in terms of possibilities to introduce genetic material from other species. Cytogenetic approaches have been extensively used in chromosomal mapping and/or resistance gene transference from tribe Triticeae-related species. Monosomic analysis, entire chromosomes engineered through single additions and/or substitutions, reciprocal translocation through radiation or manipulation of homoeologous pairing, as well as synthesis of new amphiploids to allow homologous recombination by chiasmata evolved considerably since the past decades. The association of tissue culture and molecular biology techniques provides bread wheat breeding programs with a powerful set of biotechnological tools. However, knowledge on genetic system components, cytotaxonomical relationships, cytogenetic structure and evolutionary history of wheat species cannot be neglected. This information indicates the appropriate strategy to avoid isolation mechanisms in interspecific or intergeneric crosses, according to the genome constitution of the species the desired gene is to be transferred from. The development of amphiploids as ""bridge"" species is one of the available procedures to facilitate gene flow between wheat and related species. Since the environment at the center of origin of wheat in Southern Asia is quite different from subtropical environments, Brazilian breeding programs overcome more challenges to adapt wheat crop to biotic and abiotic stresses than some other countries. The germplasm bank of Embrapa Trigo has about 1000 registered entries of Triticum relatives, Aegilops, Secale and Agropyron species supplied from several germplasm banks distributed over the world which were multiplied and/or selected for naturally occurring or artificially inoculated fungal diseases. Since Aegilops squarrosa L. entries showed very good performance, the genetic variability observed in this species was firstly exploited. It is reported here the strategy used for transferring useful genes from Ae. squarrosa (DD, 2n = 14): crossing with tetraploid species (AABB, 2n = 28), rescue and in vitro culture of immature embryos for regeneration of the trihaploid (ABD, 2n = 21) hybrid, and colchicine treatment for genome duplication resulting in the artificial synthesis of hexaploid wheat lines (AABBDD, 2n = 42). Results of 10,739 artificial pollinations involving 28 cross combinations amongst eight T. durum L., T. dicoccum and T. cartlicum tetraploid entries used as female parents and ten selected Ae. squarrosa sources of resistance as male parents are presented here. Immature embryos from 18 cross combinations were recovered and cultured in vitro. Green plantlets from 13 combinations were regenerated. Fertile amphiploids were recovered only from crosses among entries of tetraploid T. durum and diploid Ae. squarrosa. They originated 11 fertile synthetic amphiploid lines from seven different combinations. Useful stem and leaf rust as well as powdery mildew resistance for future use in breeding programs were obtained.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034432309

Large scale patterns and clumping were present in the distributions of pest and diseases, but the experimental design of randomised incomplete blocks was found to adequately accommodate them. From the variance components, estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML), heritabilities and combining abilities were computed. In some cases where the data showed a skewed distribution, jackknife estimates of the standard errors for the heritabilities were derived. The combining abilities were ranked, and the confidence intervals for each rank determined by bootstrapping the residuals. The heritability for apple scab resistance was about 0.35, although it was much lower for some sub-populations due to high frequencies of resistant seedlings. Similarly, heritability for fire blight resistance was 0.10 for subline 94, while they were 0.29 for subline 92, and 0.70 for subline 93. The preliminary estimate for woolly apple aphid resistance in subline 93 was 0.52. Test-crosses confirmed the presence of major gene resistances to this pest in the open-pollinated seedlings derived from 'David', 'Korichnoe Polosatoje', Mildew Immune Seedling, and M. floribunda 821.

Several types of delayed homogamy beginning with protogyny occur. Besides the cultivar 'Érdi nagygyümolcsü' pollinated by wind, beetles, and other insects, producing nectar even in bud stage, nectarless types of protogynous buds can also be found. Besides the delayed homogamous types with initial protogyny there are cultivars with flowers of continuous homogamy and autogamic flowers as well. Features of autogamy are clearly manifested in some cultivars, like the bending of stamina towards the pistil or vice versa, either at the end of the flowering or even starting at the beginning of bloom time. According to studies of free pollination, fruit set is the best in genetic self-fertile cultivars, rather than in those with delayed autogamy. With some cultivars the flowers of different biological types occur in the same tree. Pollination efficiency of cultivars with stamens bending away from the pistil depends on nectar production while in flowers with stamens leaning towards to the pistil and in self-fertile cultivars the role of the nectar may become of secondary importance. Periodicity of flower activities is not uniform in the cultivars studied and this is a point to be considered in the planning of orchards with self-sterile cultivars.",Delayed homogamy; Fertility; Floral biology; Nectar; Sour cherry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879434311

Box 12252, Aleppo, Syrian Arab Republic","Because of their great importance as cytogenetic and breeding tools, haploids have been produced in several crop plants, including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Reports of seedset on haploid plants are very rare. Earlier, we produced 142 haploids (2n = 2x = 14; AB genomes) of seven commercial durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) cultivars (Cappelli, Durox, Langdon, Lloyd, Medora, Monroe, and Renville) by crossing them with maize (Zea mays L.). Of these, we studied 101 haploids. Some haploids from each of the cultivars set seed without colchicine treatment or cross pollination. The cytological basis of this interesting phenomenon was studied. Because all cultivars have the homoeologous pairing suppresser Ph1, their haploids formed mostly univalents and had irregular meiosis. Yet, viable seed was formed on some haploids. The seedset varied with the genotype. Langdon, with a mean of 2.75 seeds per haploid, was the highest yielder. These seeds gave rise to normal disomic (2n = 4x = 28; AABB) plants. The seeds had viable embryos formed by fusion of unreduced male and female gametes with 14 chromosomes each. The unreduced gametes were formed by two closely related first division restitution mechanisms resulting in meiotic non-reduction: (i) complete failure of movement of univalents at anaphase I, followed by normal second (equational) division, and (ii) anaphase I movement of all univalents to one pole. Thus, formation of these gametes by-passed the reductional division but occurred by normal equational division. It is hypothesized that lack of pairing may be a prerequisite for the occurrence of meiotic restitution and hence chromosome doubling. Fluorescent GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) analyses of somatic and meiotic chromosomes of the haploid-derived plants showed the complete duplication of both the A- and B-genome chromosomes. Fertility of the derived disomics and the presence of two doses of the marker chromosome involving the 4A.7B translocation, an evolutionary landmark of durum wheat, further corroborated the precise duplication of all chromosomes. We found that the distal segment translocated from chromosome 7B constitutes approximately 24% of the long arm of 4A.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034534273

There is not autogamy but mostly self-incompatibility. Fruits from controlled cross-pollination showed the highest seed set and seed viability. The nectar sugar is characterized by a similar amount of glucose and fructose, and by the absence of sucrose. Although nectar secretion was continuous throughout the life of the flower, most nectar was secreted during the first 24 h after flower opening. Nectar production costs appear to be lower than in other species since nectar secretion is neither inhibited after a removal (i.e. a pollinator visit) nor reabsorbed as the flower ages. Sphingids visit the flowers mainly after midnight. They insert their proboscis down to the base of the corolla tube to reach the nectar. The upper limit to fruit production is set by pollinator visits. Fruits produced from open-pollinated flowers are often predated by numerous larvae (mainly lepidopteran ones). Considering that this species is mostly self-incompatible and pollination is limited, that each plant displays only a low number of flowers throughout the flowering season, and that there is a high rate of fruit predation, it is not surprising that fruits of J. integrifolia are so rare.",Breeding system; Jaborosa integrifolia; Nectar removal effects; Nectar sugar composition; Pollen tube growth; Self-incompatibility; Solanaceae; Sphingidae; Stigma-height polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034495774

Given the possibility of self-incompatibility, a glasshouse crossing experiment was also carried out to investigate the potential for selfing. The results from the crossing study showed that C. maritima is basically an obligate outcrosser, but that self-compatible individuals also occur at low frequency, providing some flexibility in the mating system. Similarly, analysis of the isozyme data showed a preponderance of cross fertilisation, but with significant low levels of selfing in two populations. There were no correlations between outcrossing rates and population size or density, although there was evidence of restricted mating at the individual level (low paternal diversity within seed from a given mother).

Populations of the two species maintained low levels of allozyme diversity (expected heterozygosity = 0.061 forA. japonica and 0.048 forA. crenata). The average genotypic diversity index for the two Ardisia species is also low, and the degree of population differentiation observed in A. japonica was high. It is suggested that populations are established (colonized) from only a few seeds via long-distance seed dispersal by birds. The resulting adult populations would consist of only a few reproductive adults (founders) and the population will experience a genetic bottleneck coupled with limited migration. The process results in lower genetic diversity within populations and increased genetic diversity among populations found in A. japonica. Genotypic diversity among populations of A. japonica was large, and no ""widespread genotypes"" were observed. These findings suggest that the present populations of A. japonica might have been founded from sexually produced seed rather than asexually by fragmentation and dispersal of preexisting clones. For A. crenata, however, one widespread genotype occurred at a high frequency due to extensively clonal spread in populations, resulting in the low genetic differentiation among populations (GST).

The prerequisite is that early performance from retrospective study and late performance from field testing must correlate genetically. This selection index procedure is particularly applicable when practical considerations make seedling selection of early traits preferable. An example is the study of biomass partitioning where young trees could offer a solution for large scale evaluation and serve as a useful first approximation to what might be expected in older trees. To numerically illustrate this selection procedure, we present a case study of retrospective early selection in 110 open-pollinated families from Alberta lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta spp. latifolia). Twenty-eight glasshouse traits in seedlings and the 9-year tree height of their siblings on four sites were conceived as the early and late traits, respectively. Five greenhouse traits having highest genetic correlations with overall field performance were selected and indices of one and two traits from these five glasshouse traits with 9-year tree height averaged 3.0% and 6% more efficient, respectively, relative to selection based on 9-year tree height alone. 24 seedling traits which had highest correlations with the field site height were selected for combination with 9-year tree height of one site. Their efficiencies, relative to selection based on 9-year tree height alone, for indices of one and two of glasshouse traits averaged 40% and 55% greater, respectively, than selection based on 9-year tree height alone.

Because of the inaccessible location of the embryo within the maternal tissue, microspore-derived embryos (MDEs) of B. napus were used as a model for studying the role of ethylene during embryo development. The MDEs also produced a peak in ethylene evolution at 20 DAC (i.e. the early cotyledonary stage), dropping to minimal levels by 25-30 DAC. At 20 DAC the excised cotyledon evolved 85% of the ethylene found in the whole MDE. To determine the role of ethylene, MDEs were treated with aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG, an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis), CoCl2 (an inhibitor of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase), and silver thiosulphate (STS, an inhibitor of ethylene action). An inhibition in ethylene production or action at 20 DAC resulted in diminished lateral cotyledon expansion, due to a reduction in the lateral expansion of cells within the cotyledon. Recovery to 'control-type' levels of cotyledon cell expansion was achieved by application of ACC (the metabolic precursor of ethylene) to AVG-treated MDEs. Thus, ethylene production at 20 DAP likely controls cotyledon expansion during embryo development.",Brassica napus; Cotyledon expansion; Ethylene production; Microspore-derived embryos; Seed development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034536607

This knowledge is useful for commercial cultivation and for breeding. S-alleles were classified on the basis of growth/no growth of pollen tubes in the styles after hand pollination with pollen whose S-alleles are known. Observations were performed 24 hours after pollination with a microscope with fluorescent light, using non-fixed material. We identified some S-allele combinations not yet reported. Among them cases of homozygosity (S2 S2) and of codominance (S1S7, S7S20) in pollen. Pollen with homozygous S-alleles is useful as a marker in incompatibility studies as it makes determination of the alleles easier.

For this reason, open pollinated seed megagametophytes of half-sib families originated from the four populations (Camliyayla, Ulukisla, Cehennemdere and Gulekdere) were used. 24 loci were resolved for the 14 enzyme systems assayed. Polymorphism (P) varied between 41% in Camliyayla and 55% in Ulukisla. The mean number of alleles per locus (A) was around 1.6 and the expected heterozygosity (H(s)) was about 21%. Moreover, only Ulukisla had a unique allele (second allele of GOT2) which gave the distinctive character to the population.

Empirical studies have also found that tolerance is a common response to consumers among plants. Currently recognized mechanisms underlying tolerance include several general sets of traits: allocation patterns; plant architecture; and various other traits that may respond to consumer damage, e.g., photosynthetic rate. Theoretical studies suggest that tolerance to consumer damage may be favored under a range of conditions, even when the risk and intensity of damage varies. However, most of these models assume that the evolution of tolerance is constrained by internal resource allocation trade-offs. While there is some empirical evidence for such trade-offs, it is also clear that external constraints such as pollinator abundance or nutrient availability may also limit the evolution of tolerance. Current research also suggests that a full understanding of plant adaptation to consumers can only be achieved by investigating the joint evolution of tolerance and resistance. While tolerance to consumer damage has just recently received significant attention in the ecological literature, our understanding of it is rapidly increasing as its profound ecological and evolutionary implications become better appreciated.",Compensatory growth; Evolutionary constraints; Herbivory; Phenotypic plasticity; Plant pathogens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034503352

Franco) from western Oregon. In addition, the efficacy of bud phenology traits as predictors of cold hardiness at the two stages was explored. Fall and spring cold hardiness were assessed using artificial freeze testing. Similar genetic control of cold hardiness in seedlings and saplings is suggested by strong type-B genetic correlations (rB) between the two ages for fall and spring cold injury traits (rB &gt; 0.78) and by similar trends in individual tree heritability estimates (h2 i), e.g., h2 i was greater in spring (h?2 i = 0.73) than in fall (h?2 i = 0.36) and greater in the Coast population (h?2 i = 0.69) than in the Cascade population (h?2 1 = 0.40) at both ages. Strong responses to direct selection are expected for spring cold hardiness at both ages and for fall cold hardiness in seedlings, even under mild selection intensities. Similar heritabilities in seedlings and saplings, and strong genetic correlations between ages for cold-hardiness traits, ensure that selection at one age will produce similar gains at the other age. Type-A genetic correlations (rA) between fall and spring cold hardiness were near zero in the Cascade population (rA = 0.08 and -0.14 at ages 2 and 7, respectively) but were moderate and negative in the Coast population (rA = -0.54 and -0.36, respectively).

Don) Endl.) has long-lived individual trees that can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Allozyme markers indicate that, in old-growth populations in northern California, 15-34% of clones are multistemmed. Of those, they have few stems per clone, and none are very spatially pervasive. There is much variety in the clonal configurations observed, including circular, linear, and (or) disjunct arrangements. Visual assessment is a poor predictor of clonal identity and fairy ring structures more often than not contain multiple genotypes. In this first allozyme study of coast redwood, high levels of genetic variation are observed, higher than those observed for most other western conifers. These levels are perhaps related to the species' hexaploid condition, ancient phylogenetic lineage, and historically broader natural range. There are also generally high levels of genotypic diversity. Upland sites, with more frequent and intense fires, do not differ significantly in genotypic diversity from the more mesic lowland sites. Population structure in coast redwood seems to resemble the classic pattern for many open-pollinated conifers: much diversity within and little among populations. However, this is not a rangewide study. The current levels and structure of genetic and genotypic diversity in old-growth populations suggests episodic recruitment. The long-lived nature of individual stems and the capacity for asexual reproduction may allow clones to exist indefinitely, thus challenging some of the generalizations in evolutionary theory that are based on sexually reproducing species.",Allozyme diversity; Asexual reproduction; Clones; Conifer; Gymnosperm; Polyploid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034467015

We studied possible behavioral mechanisms underlying the formation of flower-size preferences in Bombus terrestris (L.) using a two-phase laboratory experiment. Bumblebees foraged on artificial flowers that bore either a big or a small display of uniform color. Only flowers of one display size contained nectar rewards. We changed the display color and the locations of big and small flowers in the second experimental phase. Forty-one percent of the bees made their first visit to a small flower. Formation of size-reward associations followed a similar course in both experimental phases, reaching >85% choices of rewarding flowers. Some learning occurred within the first three visits. Learning of the size-reward association was equally good for big and small displays in the first experimental phase, but better for small displays in the second phase. Our results suggest that associative learning is involved in the formation of preferences for large displays. Bees that had learned to prefer large displays in one foraging situation may not transfer this preference to a novel situation that is sufficiently different. This behavior may select for honest advertising in flowers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845745953

Twenty-two half sib progenies were planted at experimental stations at Pindorama, Votuporanga and Jaú, in São Paulo State, using a randomized and complete block design, with five replications and ten plants per plot. Dry rubber production was assessed when the plants were three years old. Based on the genetic variability of the populations, Pindorama was the best environment for the expression of variability. At the individual level, heritability was seriously affected when random progenies from an open pollinating population were considered as half sib progenies.

The promoter regions of the FPS1 and FPS2 genes controlling the expression of isoforms FPS IS and FPS2, respectively, were fused to the ?-glucuronidase (GUS)reporter gene and introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The FPSIS:GUS gene is widely expressed in all plant tissues throughout development, thus supporting a role for FPSIS in the synthesis of isoprenoids serving basic plant cell functions. In contrast, the FPS2:GUS gene shows a pattern of expression restricted to specific organs at particular stages of development. The highest levels of GUS activity are detected in flowers, especially in pollen grains, from the early stages of flower development. After pollination, much lower levels of GUS activity are detected in the rest of floral organs, with the exception of the ovary valves, which remain unstained throughout flower development. GUS activity is also detected in developing and mature seeds. In roots. GUS expression is primarily detected at sites of lateral root initiation and in junctions between primary and secondary roots. No GUS activity is detected in root apical meristems. GUS expression is also observed in junctions between primary and secondary stems. Overall, the pattern of expression of FPS2:GUS suggests a role for FPS2 in the synthesis of particular isoprenoids with specialized functions. Functional FPS2 gene promoter deletion analysis in transfected protoplast and transgenic A. thaliana plants indicate that all the cis-acting elements required to establish the full pattern of expression of the FPS2 gene are contained in a short region extending from positions - 111 to +65.

However, the cues the hummingbirds use to make such choices are not known. To determine the proximate cues hummingbirds use to avoid visiting nectar-robbed plants, I conducted multiple field experiments and one aviary study using the nectar-robbed, hummingbird-pollinated plant Ipomopsis aggregata. In the first field experiment, free-flying hummingbirds were presented with plants in which I manipulated nectar volume and the presence of nectar-robber holes. Hummingbirds visited significantly more plants with nectar and probed more available flowers on those plants, regardless of the presence of nectar-robber holes. Thus, I hypothesized that hummingbirds may avoid robbed plants based on their spatial memory of unrewarding plants and/or visual cues that nectar absence provides. In an aviary study, I removed spatial cues by re-randomizing the position of plants after each hummingbird-foraging bout, but hummingbirds still selected plants with nectar. Nectar may provide a visual cue in I. aggregata flowers because corollas are translucent, and nectar is visible through the side of the corolla. To determine if hummingbirds use this visual cue to avoid plants with no nectar, I masked corolla translucence in a field study by painting flowers with acrylic paint. Hummingbirds still visited significantly more plants with nectar and probed more flowers on those plants, whether or not the corollas were painted. These results suggest that hummingbirds use nectar as a proximate cue to locate and avoid non-rewarding, nectar-robbed plants, even in the absence of spatial cues and simple visual cues.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034496787

Expected efficiency of CS relative to SS was computed as the ratio of the expected gains of each method (CS/SS). For analysis, data from the literature and from a specific open pollinated progeny trial of Eucalyptus grandis (HILL) MAIDEN were taken. An average efficiency of 1.21 (SS = 1.00) was found for the published data, concerning growth characters. For the specific progeny trial efficiency was of 1.27 for H (plant height) and 1.31 for DBH (diameter at breast height) and V (volume). A procedure that allows predicting minimum efficiency for a given trial was worked out. Both methods were also compared under equal effective population sizes (Ne). It became evident that CS is superior to SS, and this superiority is more evident for traits with small narrow sense individual heritabilities or trials with small plot sizes (or both). Efficiency of CS over SS is less evident for traits in general, when effective population size was maintained equal in both schemes.

The yield of sunflower could be increased to a considerable extent by using brassinolide, a plant growth promoting substance, isolated from the pollen of rape, which prevents the formation of empty achenes, thus increasing the number of filled seeds. Field experiments were carried out at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, India during the summer (March-May) and South West Monsoon (June-September) seasons of 1997 to study the effect of brassinolide and NPK levels on the yield and yield attributes of sunflower. The experiments were laid out in a split plot design. The main plots were treated with five levels of fertilizer (N:P:K), namely 40:20:20, 50:25:25, 60:30:30, 70:35:35 and 80:40:40 kg ha-1, while the subplots consisted of seed setting treatments: hand pollination, 0.2% borax + 2% diammonium phosphate spray and 1 ppm brassinolide spray at the ray floret opening stage, together with a control.

Individual tree and family-mean heritabilities were lower for green specific gravity than for oven-dry specific gravity for families from both sets of tests.

At 21 years from seed, the trees in this study had probably not completed the transition to production of mature wood.Green and oven-dry alcohol-toluene extracted wood specific gravities (X? = 0.39 and 0.46 respectively) were assessed from a total of 60 open-pollinated ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa LAWS.) families at 21 years from seed grown in progeny tests in northern Idaho and northwestern Montana. The trees in the Montana tests averaged higher green and oven-dry specific gravities (0.40 and 0.48 respectively) compared to those from the Idaho tests (0.38 and 0.44 respectively). There was wide variability in moisture content, but the families with the highest and lowest green specific gravities tended to rank high and low respectively for oven-dry specific gravity. Family x site interactions were significant only for green specific gravity in the Idaho tests. Growth data (height and diameter) and specific gravity were not significantly correlated at any of the test sites.

At an earlie trial in April, they were acquitted of theft, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the criminal damage charges. This jury had no such doubts. Its verdict was unanimous. ""Not guilty"" It gave the thumbs up to the dependants as they filed out of court, and members waited outside to congratulate them personally. The dependants had claimed ""lawful excuse"" for removing the crop before it flowered. One after another they had gone to the witness stand to state their belief that their actions were taken for the greater good. Unwavering, even in the face of stringent cross-examination, they had presented their case with clarity and conviction. There was no doubting their sincerity. Speaking immediately after the verdict, Peter Melchett said: ""We are delighted that an English jury was convinced that the Greenpeace volunteers were rightly acting to protect property and the environment...We now call on Government to end the GM farmscale trials before any further genetic pollution of the environment occurs.""He pointed out that the Government's own advisors had told it contamination from field trials was inevitable but it had chosen to ignore that advice. Separation distances between GM and non-GM crops have been hopelessly inadequate, as subsequent cross- pollination has made evident. The Government has now admitted that it may have to order the de-flowering of GM oil seed rape crops before they flower next spring. It would certainly have been a bizarre twist if the Crown had succeeded in convicting people for doing something its government is about to do for the same reasons. Now taxpayers have to foot the bill for the Crown's failure to make criminals of the 28 activists who share a common belief that the field trials are an ill-conceived, dangerous and silly exercise. The court costs are estimated at around £250.000 and this will raise still more questions over why these prosecutions were mounted. To have awarded costs, presumably the judge must have believed that neither prosecution had much validity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034476860

Data from one small trial demonstrated a genetic basis to a steep local cline in habit, in the size of plants flowering and in the height of the change in foliage type. Thus, slow growth, early phase change and precocious flowering appear to be maintained in exposed coastal environments by current selection. This contrasts with results from five large trials that contained open-pollinated progeny from across the whole geographic range of this taxon. On this broad scale, early phase change appears to promote growth, a fitness surrogate, in two trials but not the others, implying differential selection for the timing of phase change. In these cases, early phase change may have been favoured in warm, wet environments by reducing damage by leaf fungi. There was marked genetic variation in the timing of vegetative phase change among broad regions, consistent with either adaptation to broad-scale environmental variation or historical differentiation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033732310

Three classes of compatibility reaction were observed within outcross treatments: (1) reciprocal compatibility, (2) one-way compatibility and (3) reciprocal incompatibility. This is diagnostic of sporophytic control of self-incompatibility, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae. This is supported by the occurrence of a dry stigma and trinucleate pollen. Analysis of the behaviour of self- and outcross pollen on the stigma by using fluorescence microscopy shows that rejection of self-pollen does not all occur at one point but at a number of stages, with cumulative reductions in the adherence of pollen to the stigma, pollen germination, pollen tube penetration of the stigma and fertilisation. On the basis of both fruit set and pollen behaviour data, for any level of relatedness, tetraploid plants are about 20% less likely to be compatible with each other than diploid plants. This presumably reflects the greater likelihood of matching S alleles given the greater potential for polymorphism at the individual level.

This study explores the importance of flower position for reproductive success of individual flowers of the deceptive terrestrial orchid, Dactylorhiza maculata (L.) Soo. 2. Upper flowers had smaller lips and produced lighter pollinia than those in other parts of the inflorescence, probably due to architectural effects. 3. Dry weight of seed capsules decreased from bottom to top in the inflorescence in both open-pollinated and hand-pollinated plants. However, removal of flowers from the middle and lowest parts of the inflorescence considerably increased seed production of the upper flowers. Decreased seed set was due to decreased resource availability because of the long maintenance time of opened but not pollinated lower flowers. 4. Experimental self-pollination resulted in reduced seed set compared to that following pollination with cross-pollen, but decreased seed set was independent of flower position within an inflorescence. 5. Dactylorhiza maculata with large inflorescences did not have better pollination success. The production of more flowers than the plant is able to fully support may have evolved as an ovary reserve in case of flower herbivory, or as a 'bet-hedging' strategy through which the plant can increase seed production in years with good pollinator availability.",Dactylorhiza maculata; Flower position; Flower size; Pollinia size; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033748068

This supply varies during the course of each day and also throughout development. The impact of these variations on the metabolism of developing endosperm was examined by determining the energy status of the endosperm throughout the course of a day. The adenylate energy charge decreased as the tissue matured, and exhibited a distinct diurnal pattern, reaching a minimum in the afternoon, when the flux of photosynthate is the highest. The minimum value observed was similar to the adenylate energy charge in tissues under mild stress. As the endosperm matured, the adenylate energy charge decreased steadily. The levels of the polysaccharide precursors ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose did not reflect the daily fluctuations in adenylate energy charge, but did exhibit similar long-term behaviour in the latter half of development, decreasing steadily after 21 d after pollination. Similarities in the metabolic patterns of adenylate and uridylate nucleotide levels are discussed in terms of the analogous roles of these compounds in starch and cellulose biosynthesis, respectively.

We describe here the cloning and functional expression of a GPP synthase (GPPS) from Arabidopsis thaliana.

This argues that monoterpene synthesis is not solely restricted to specialized secretory structures but can also occur in photosynthetic parenchyma.

Females may compensate for their loss of male fitness by reallocating resources from male function (pollen production and pollinator attraction) to female function (seeds and fruits), thus increasing seed production. Females may also benefit from their inability to self-fertilize if selfing and inbreeding depression reduce seed quality in hermaphrodites. We investigated how differences in floral resource allocation (flower size) between female and hermaphroditic plants affect two measures of female reproductive success, pollinator visitation and pollen receipt, in gynodioecious populations of Geranium richardsonii in Colorado. Using emasculation treatments in natural populations, we further examined whether selfing by autogamy and geitonogamy comprises a significant proportion of pollen receipt by hermaphrodites. Flowers of female plants are significantly smaller than those of hermaphrodites. The reduction in allocation to pollinator-attracting structures (petals) is correlated with a significant reduction in pollinator visitation to female flowers in artificial arrays. The reduction in attractiveness is further manifested in significantly less pollen being deposited on the stigmas of female flowers in natural populations. Autogamy is rare in these protandrous flowers, and geitonogamy accounts for most of the difference in pollen receipt between hermaphrodites and females. Female success at receiving pollen was negatively frequency dependent on the relative frequency of females in populations. Thus, two of the prerequisites for the maintenance of females in gynodioecious populations, differences in resource allocation between floral morphs and high selfing rates in hermaphrodites, occur in G. richardsonii.",Floral dimorphism; Frequency-dependent selection; Geitonogamy; Geraniaceae; Geranium richardsonii; Gynodioecy; Pollen receipt; Pollinator choice; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033755398

Yucca moths are the only documented pollinator of yuccas, and moth larvae feed solely on developing yucca seeds.

We tested the prediction that yucca moths primarily perform outcross pollinations by using fluorescent dye to track pollen dispersal in five populations of Y. filamentosa. Dye transfers within plants were common in all populations (mean ± 1 SE, 55 ± 3.0%), indicating that moths frequently deposit self-pollen. Distance of dye transfers ranged from 0 to 50 m, and the mean number of flowering plants between the pollen donor and recipient was 5 (median = 0), suggesting that most pollen was transferred among near neighbors.

Supplementary pollination and flower-removal experiments were performed to investigate whether the observed pattern is attributable (a) to variation in pollen receipt, (b) to sequestration of resources by the earliest flowers on an inflorescence, and/or (c) to 'architectural' limitations on the fruit/seed production of later flowers.

Outcrossing is the ancestral breeding system for the genus Clarkia. Flowers of ssp. parviflora have characteristics commonly associated with selfing taxa: they are smaller and have little temporal and spatial separation between mature anthers and stigma (dichogamy and herkogamy, respectively). Flower morphology and development were studied in four populations of each subspecies to establish the developmental changes that occurred in the evolution of setting. In particular, we sought to evaluate the hypothesis that the setting flower may have arisen as a byproduct of selection for rapid maturation in the arid environment occupied by ssp. parviflora. This hypothesis predicts that development time should be reduced in spp. parviflora relative to ssp. xantiana. We also sought to compare the pattern of covariation of flower morphology and development between subspecies to that within subspecies. Similar within vs. between patterns of covariation could be indicative of developmental or functional constraints on the independent evolution of floral parts. In spite of significant variation among populations within subspecies, the subspecies clearly differ in flower morphology and development. All floral organs, except ovaries, are smaller in ssp. parviflora than in ssp. xantiana. The flower plastochron, the duration of flower development from bud initiation to anthesis, and the duration of protandry are all shorter in ssp. parviflora than in ssp. xantiana. Maximum relative growth rates are higher for all organs in ssp. parviflora than in ssp. xantiana. Thus, progenesis (i.e., via a reduction in development time) is combined with growth acceleration in the evolution of the setting flower. Since reduced development time and growth acceleration both allow setting flowers to mature earlier than outcrossing ones, selection for early maturation may have contributed to the evolution of the setting flower form. The pattern of trait covariation differs within spp. parviflora relative to the patterns within spp. xantiana and between the two subspecies, suggesting that floral parts can and have evolved independently of one another.",Clarkia; Development; Growth rate; Heterchrony; Outcrossing; Progenesis; Selfing; Trait covariation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033761106

We further hypothesized that pseudoflowers of U. pisi interact with uninfected true host flowers through insects during their period of co-'flowering' in early spring. We conducted artificial array experiments in the field to test whether the two species share insects and whether they influenced each other's insect visitation. Insects moved between true flowers and pseudoflowers, but true flowers received more visits over all. Pseudo-flowers and true flowers did not influence each other's visitation rates in mixtures.

This can be attributed either to postfertilization abortion of selfed ovules or to cryptic self-incompatibility (CSI). CSI is a form of self-incompatibility whereby the advantage to outcross pollen is expressed only following pollinations where there is gametophytic competition between self and outcross pollen. Under the definition of CSI, this differential success is due to the superior prefertilization performance (pollen germination rate and pollen tube growth rate) of outcross pollen relative to self pollen. Although CSI has been demonstrated in several plant species, no studies have assessed among-population variation in the expression of CSI. We conducted a greenhouse study on Clarkia unguiculata (an annual species with a mixed-mating system) to detect CSI, and we compare our observations to previous reports of CSI in C. gracilis and another population of C. unguiculata. In contrast to these previous studies of CSI in Clarkia, we used genetic rather than phenotypic markers to measure the relative performance of selfed vs. outcross pollen. In this study, we measured the intensity of CSI in C. unguiculata from a large population in southern California and we determined whether the magnitude of pollen competition (manipulated by controlling the number of pollen grains deposited on a stigma) influenced the outcome of competition between self and outcross pollen. In contrast to previous investigations of Clarkia, we found no evidence for CSI. The mean number of seeds sired per fruit did not differ between self and outcross pollen following either single-donor or mixed pollinations. In addition, the relative success of selfed vs. outcross pollen was independent of the magnitude of pollen competition. These results suggest that: (1) one of the few nonheterostylous species previously thought to be cryptically self-incompatible is completely self-compatible (at least in the population studied here) or (2) phenotypic markers may be problematic for the detection of CSI.",Clarkia; Cryptic self-incompatibility; Gametophytic competition; Mating system; Onagraceae; Outcrossing; Pollen performance; Selfing; Siring success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033765851

The observations concern the portion of the life cycle spanning pollination to germination. Pollinators do not appear to distinguish between floral morphs, as revealed by nonbiased distribution of fluorescent powder used as a pollen analogue. Pollen-tube growth is also equal for the two morphs. Seed germination is affected by the presence of anthocyanin, but apparently only by the genotype of the mother at the anthocyanin locus, and not by the genotype of the embryo itself. In addition, there was an interaction between maternal morph and the maternal source population, with seeds from high-elevation anthocyanin-producing mothers germinating most rapidly and seeds from low-elevation anthocyanin-producing mothers germinating most slowly in a common garden at low elevation. However, because germination of anthocyanin-producing and anthocyaninless progeny proceed equally quickly, the anthocyanin marker provides unbiased estimates of outcrossing rates. The results overall support the use of anthocyanin as a neutral marker, with the alternate phenotypes unlikely to be differentially impacted by the processes of pollination, pollen-tube growth, and germination. Fluctuating selection on conditions for dormancy release may be partially responsible for the maintenance of the anthocyanin polymorphism in Datura stramonium.",Anthocyanin; Datura stramonium; Fluorescent powder; Germination; Neutral marker; Outcrossing rates; Pollen tubes; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033765847

Moreover, because of the overlap in gene expression between the two phases of the life cycle, selection on microgametophytes may alter the resulting sporophytic generation. The extent to which pollen competition occurs in nature has been unclear, because tests of the predictions of the pollen competition hypothesis have used cultivars and/or artificial growth conditions and hand-pollination techniques. In this study we used a wild species, Cucurbita foetidissima, in its natural habitat (southern New Mexico) to determine the amount and timing of the arrival of pollen onto stigmas, the relationship between pollen deposition and seed number, and the effects of the intensity of pollen competition on progeny vigor.

About 29% of the flowers receiving a single pollinator visit had 900 or more pollen grains on its stigma. Moreover, within 2 h of anthesis, &gt;4000 pollen grains were deposited onto a typical stigma, indicating that multiple pollinator visits must have occurred.

The phylogenetic distribution of staminodes suggests that they typically arise during evolutionary reduction of the androecium. Differences in the genetic control and patterns of stamen loss between actinomorphic and zygomorphic flowers shape staminode development. In clades with actinomorphic flowers, staminodes generally replace an entire stamen whorl and staminode loss seems irreversible. In contrast, in clades with zygomorphic flowers staminodes evolve from a subset of the stamens in a whorl and staminodes can reappear in a lineage after being lost (e.g., Cheloneae, Scrophulariaceae). If staminodes do not adopt new functions during androecium reduction they are lost quickly, so that nonfunctional staminodes appear only in recently derived taxa. Alternatively, when staminodes assume new floral roles, either directly or indirectly after a nonfunctional period, they can become integral floral components which perpetuate within clades (e.g., Orchidaceae). Indirect evolution of staminode function allows greater flexibility of function by allowing staminodes to take over roles not performed by stamens, such as involvement in mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and mechanisms of explosive pollination. Multifunctional staminodes characterize lineages with universal or widespread staminodes.",Androecium; Angiosperm; Floral evolution; Functional shifts; Pollination; Staminode; Vestigial organs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033755480

I examined the degree of self-compatibility, pollinator-visitation rates, and pollen limitation of fruit and seed production in both species. Both Trillium species were self-compatible, but outcrossed flowers produced more successful fruits and seeds than self-pollinated flowers. Pollinator-visitation rates to the two species were low compared to other insect-pollinated spring ephemerals. In addition, both T. erectum and T. grandiflorum experienced pollen limitation in fruit and/or seed production; however, levels of fecundity in both species may be influenced by resource availability as well. I found significant phenotypic variation in 11 morphological characters within and among the five study populations. The sizes of all morphological characters were positively correlated. In general, larger T. erectum and T. grandiflorum produced more seeds. Phenotypic selection analysis revealed that direct and indirect selection acted on the size of morphological characters for both species. But there was no detectable selection acting on plant shape. This study reveals that variation in plant size exists within and among populations of both species, and this variation is associated with variance in female reproductive success.

Pollen morphology and ultrastructure were described for 13 Callitriche species using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Representative taxa of each growth form were examined; these included three terrestrial species (C. deflexa, C. peploides, and C. nuttallii), nine amphibious species (C. brutia, C. cophocarpa, C. cophocarpa-stagnalis hybrid, C. cribrosa, C. hamulata, C. heterophylla var. heterophylla, C. lusitanica, C. marginata, and C. trochlearis), and one obligately submersed species (C. truncata). Of the amphibious taxa, C. heterophylla var. heterophylla and C. trochlearis had internal geitonogamy, a type of internal self-fertilization. Pollen from all taxa was spheroidal, small, intectate, and lacked well-defined apertures. Taxa primarily differed with respect to exine thickness, surface ornamentation, and the presence or absence of aperture-like regions. The pollen of terrestrial species, as well as that of C. marginata, had well-developed exines with thick sculptured and basal layers. In general, amphibious taxa produced pollen with distinct, but thinner, exines than that of terrestrial taxa. Pollen of the amphibious taxa with internal geitonogamy had a thicker basal layer than species without internal geitonogamy, whereas the overall exine was reduced in C. hamulata and absent in C. brutia and C. lusitanica. Pollen of the obligately submersed C. truncata also lacked an exine.

The purpose of this study was to test whether ants can affect the pollen viability, a component of male fitness, when they visit flowers of the shrub Acacia constricta. Acacia constricta inflorescences hand-pollinated with flowers over which Formica perpilosa ants had crawled set significantly fewer seed pods than inflorescences hand-pollinated by control flowers that had no contact with ants. Many ant species secrete antibiotic substances onto the integument that render pollen inviable, and these secretions are probably the mechanism for reduced pollen viability in this study. The ratio of seed pods produced by self-pollinated inflorescences to those produced by cross-pollinated inflorescences was 0.16, indicating that A. constricta is largely self-incompatible. Because F. perpilosa workers forage primarily on the acacia tree under which they nest, they are unlikely to serve as efficient vectors of outcrossing. Previous work showed that A. constricta shrubs with F. perpilosa ants produce approximately twice as many seeds as similarly sized plants not so associated. The results indicate that association with F. perpilosa could cause a reproductive trade-off for A. constricta: benefits to female function may be accompanied by costs to male function.

The purpose of this paper was to examine whether in size-limited habitats in patchy and discrete marshes in two Mediterranean wetlands in southern France natural populations may suffer from a reduced maternal fecundity due to a deficit in outcross pollen. We first verified that S. maritimus suffers from a reduced fecundity when self-pollinated. At a site in the Camargue, mean fecundity (mean number of achenes per centimetre of spikelet) measured in 1995 and 1996 in seven and nine populations, respectively (surface area from 50 to 4500 m2) increased significantly with population surface area in 1995 but not in 1996. In the second wetland at Roquehaute, which is composed of small ponds, fecundity was very low in all 12 local populations studied in 1996 (1.1 achenes per spikelet, SD = 1.2) and was not correlated with the population surface area (from 10 to 400 m2). We performed a pollen supplementation experiment in five local populations at Roquehaute to determine whether this low fecundity may be due to a pollen limitation. A significant increase in fecundity after among-pond pollinations compared to within-pond pollinations indicated that local populations suffer from a deficit in outcross pollen, since each pond appears to contain one or a few number of clones (or incompatibility types). In S. maritimus, clonal spread may have a cost in terms of reduced fecundity in small habitats because each habitat is colonized by very few clones.",Clonal growth; Colonization; Cyperaceae; Habitat size; Mediterranean wetlands; Scirpus; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033755251

Most crops represent temporal foraging habitats with high abundance of bumblebees but mainly with low diversity in the bumblebee forage community, in contrast to permanent foraging habitats such as, for example, a hedgerow. The high numbers of bumblebees in the monoculture of crop plantations consisted mainly of short-tongued bumblebee species. The role of foraging distances for the visitation rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture-recapture experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B. terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances, such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare, long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator limitation in modern agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, long-distance flights of bumblebee pollinators have to be considered in the present discussion on gene flow from transgenic plant species on a landscape scale.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033785338

Six different media (all modified MS with different growth regulators and vitamins) were tested with the objective of inducing multiple shoots from 7 to 10 DAP embryos, from crosses between R x B. The media M1, supplemented with Kinetin (13.94 ?M) and NAA (5.37 ?M), and media M3, supplemented with BA (4.44 ?M and IAA 2.85 ?M), regenerated adventitious shoots and calli about 30-40 days after inoculation. The highest multiplication rate observed was 2.85 shoots per explant in media M1, 60-70 days after culturing. Two other media, M6, supplemented with 2,4-D (13.57 ?M) and M2, with 2,4-D (9.05 ?M) and BA (8.87 ?M) exclusively induced the formation of calli.

We exposed three phenologically distinct O. lignaria populations (early-, mid-, and late-flying) to different temperature treatments through development and wintering for a total of nine rearing treatments. These treatments combined three approaches to obtain early bee emergence: (1) Exposing bees to warmer or fluctuating temperatures, or both, during development; (2) exposing bees to warmer wintering temperatures; and (3) using early-flying bee populations from Central Valley California latitudes. Extended periods of high prewintering temperatures resulted in apparent fat body consumption of prewintering adults and reductions in springtime adult longevity. In general, temperature treatments that promoted rapid immature development, and thus longer wintering periods, resulted in earlier spring emergence patterns of bees well timed with bloom period of almonds. Warmer wintering periods also resulted in earlier emergence. In addition to providing good bee-bloom synchrony, several treatments also yielded vigorous emerging populations, rapid establishment and nesting, and population increases.

Unlike monoecious figs, which produce a mixture of wasps, seeds, and pollen in every fruit, dioecious fig species have hermaphrodite (functionally male) trees, which produce wasps and pollen only, and female trees, which produce seeds only. Dioecious fig species are free of the seed-wasp trade-off involved within each monoecious fig fruit; wasp and seed production in dioecious species reflect selective pressures acting on each sex to maximize offspring production. We studied specific predictions of the reproductive behavior of dioecious fig species, predictions that were made based on studies of monoecious figs. Pollinator (and associated parasitic wasp) arrivals at trees bearing receptive inflorescences were closely linked to the seasonal variation in receptive fig numbers. More wasps arrived at female trees of F. exasperata than at 'male' trees, apparently because of synchronized wasp release by male trees during the time of synchronous female tree receptivity. Wasp numbers arriving at male and female trees of F. hispida did not differ significantly, apparently because inflorescence production on male and female trees was more evenly spread over time. Female inflorescences had more pollinators than male inflorescences in F. hispida; female and male inflorescences had approximately equal numbers of pollinators in F. exasperata. Hand-pollination experiments introducing one, three, or eight pollinators into figs of F. hispida showed that foundress number was a significant predictor of resultant wasp or seed number. In both fig species, female inflorescences initiated more flowers than male inflorescences, and produced more seeds than male inflorescences produced wasps. Female fruits were not larger than male fruits at maturity in either fig species. Only in F. exasperata were male fruits significantly smaller in the dry than in the wet site. Both species had a relatively high average level of pollination (>70%). The mean percentage of fruit matured was 56% in F. hispida, and a surprisingly high 78% in F. exasperata. Both fig species exhibited strong sex differences in foundress numbers, numbers of flowers initiated, and numbers of wasps or seeds matured, suggesting strong selection on components of reproductive success within each sex after dioecy evolved. Our quantitative analyses elucidate how some of the many factors in plant-pollinator relationships affect plant reproductive success in the fig-wasp mutualism.",Agaonidae; Dioecy; India; Moraceae; Mutualism; Phenology; Pollination; T ropics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033789566

Methods: A total of 28 asthmatic farmers, with allergy to grass pollen, reporting persistent asthma symptoms after grass pollination, were enrolled. An accurate allergologic screening excluded other sensitizations. Analysis of total and grass-specific IgE and eosinophil cationic protein was carried out before (March) and during (May) the following spring. After the complete end of pollination, bronchial hyperreactivity was assessed. Results: Symptoms (cough, wheezing) persisted during the autumn for a mean period of 41 days (range 13-69). Total IgE was moderately high and grass-specific IgE ranged from 9.25 to 41.12 kU/l without significant differences before and during spring. On the contrary, serum ECP levels significantly increased during the pollination period. PD20 methacholine evaluated after the end of grass pollination was negatively significantly correlated with levels of total IgE (r = -0.73; P &lt;0.01) and the increase (from March to May) of serum ECP (r = -0.75; P &lt;0.01). However, PD20 methacholine did not correlate with grass-specific IgE and serum ECP absolute values of both March and May. A positive correlation was found between number of postseasonal days with symptoms and both spring increase of serum ECP (r = 0.75; P = 0.04) and levels of total IgE (r=0.76; P&lt;0.01). The number of postseasonal days with symptoms inversely correlated with postseason PD20 methacholine (r = -0.76; P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The study demonstrates that in grass-sensitized farmers with asthmatic symptoms persisting for several weeks after grass pollination has ceased, the degree of airways hyperreactivity and the duration of postseasonal symptoms are directly related to the spring increase of ECP levels, as well as to the level of total IgE in serum. This allows us to identify two candidate biomarkers for the risk of developing prolonged asthma symptoms, and for the effective monitoring of anti-inflammatory treatment and allergen-specific immunotherapy.",Allergy; Bronchial hyperreactivity; Eosinophil cationic protein; Farmers; Grass pollen; IgE; Methacholine challenge,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033777263

Here we determined whether short delays in pollen arrival time altered the average success of 'fast' and 'slow' pollen donors when both types of pollen experienced the same delays. Hand-pollination experiments were carried out using four pairs of pollen donors that differed in competitive ability. We allowed delays of 15 or 30 min between the first and second pollen donor and then determined seed paternity using allozyme markers. The second donor typically sired fewer seeds than pollen that arrived earlier, but, contrary to expectation, 'faster' pollen did not always sire significantly more seeds than 'slower' pollen when each was applied after delays of the same duration. In two of the four pairs of donors, differences that were seen following simultaneous pollinations disappeared when each type of pollen was applied following identical delays of 15 or 30 min.

The rigor of this theory was tested using seed set and germination of cross-compatible pollinations in 18 naturalized L. salicaria populations in Minnesota/Wisconsin (n=342 genotypes; n=86 shorts, n=127 mids, and n=129 longs). Seed set for short-styled genotypes ranged from zero to 135 (36±38); raids-0-156, (53±39), and longs-0-151 (59±39). Mean seed set per capsule was not significantly different for mids and longs, but both were significantly greater than that of shorts (F= 14, P&lt;0.0001). Zero seed set frequently occurred in most compatible crosses, in contrast with theoretical expectations. The high percentage of populations deviating from normality must be due to incompatibility. An incompatibility system independent of heterostyly could cause this, where failed crosses result from matches of incompatibility speCificities in pollen and pistil. This independence is questionable, however, given the non-significant difference in failed outcrosses for pooled ?2 comparing within and between populations (?2=0.395, P&gt;0.5). A sporophytic incompatibility model is proposed with a minimum of three specificities. Zero seed set in compatible crosses is due to the addition of alleles from L. alatum, a distylous species that forms introgressive hybrids with L. saIicaria. Reduced fecundity could increase the deficiency of shorts, and significantly greater seed germination of shorts could explain the continued presence of short-styled individuals in L. saIicaria populations.",Germination; Heterostyly; Lythrum; Seed set; Self incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033783772

This creates an evolutionary conflict in that selection will favour individuals that increase their fitness at the cost of the mutualist partner. To counter this evolutionary instability, each partner must be able to prevent over-exploitation by the other. In plant/seed-parasite pollinator mutualisms like that involving the globeflower Trollius europaeus and the globeflower fly (Chiastocheta spp.), ovipositing females can have a more or less mutualistic/antagonistic effect on plant seed output, depending on the amount of pollination achieved during oviposition, the number of eggs laid and seed predation per larva. We found that flowers with no Chiastocheta egg had a high seed set and there was no significant increase in seed set before predation with increasing egg load, suggesting that most pollination is achieved by non-ovipositing visitors (males and/or non-ovipositing females). Hence, additional eggs do not lead to higher pollination, oviposition is a non-mutualistic behaviour and, therefore, there is a conflict between T. europaeus and Chiastocheta flies for the number of eggs laid. Egg load increases throughout flower lifespan. No mechanism seems to have evolved to regulate the number of eggs laid on T. europaeus. For example, controlled pollination experiments showed that T. europaeus cannot limit Chiastocheta oviposition by triggering flower senescence as soon as full pollination has been achieved. In this context, the high average number of eggs per flower observed in alpine populations is not surprising. Finally, the decrease in net seed production with increasing egg load was weak. We discuss the other factors involved in the regulation of the conflict between T. europaeus and Chiastocheta flies.",Chiastocheta; Conflict; Flower senescence; Mutualism; Oviposition; Seed predation; Trollius europaeus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000626555

Only four natural sites remain in the state totaling fewer than 100 clumps.

Self-pollination resulted in significantly lower offspring quantity and quality. Total seed number and total seed mass for self-pollinated capsules were approximately one-fourth that of outcrossed capsules. Germination, survivorship, and growth over 5 yr were also significantly lower for offspring from self-pollinated capsules.

Pollination is needed for seed set, but most seedlings are produced asexually by pseudogamy. Although sexual processes may occur, clonal diversity can be extremely low. We performed a pollination experiment to investigate the breeding system and used allozyme and AFLP markers to analyze genetic variation among and within seed families in R. armeniacus and R. bifrons. Pollination either with self or outcross pollen was necessary to trigger seed set. Outbreeding marginally increased the number and quality of seeds compared with selfing. The enzyme PGI revealed some genetic variation within seed families. Seven other enzyme systems were monomorphic. The more detailed AFLP analyses with five primer pairs detected the same rate of genetic variation (14-17% of seedlings were genetically distinct) and confirmed the allozyme results for the same individuals. No genetic variation was found between the seed families from within a species collected in widely separated populations, but clear species-specific differences were observed. The results support the view that polyploid Rubus species are pseudogamous apomicts with low genetic diversity among and within seed families.

It was possible to assign paternity to all offspring within this population by paternity analysis. Although no ordinary pollinator visits were observed during the flowering period, effective pollen flow occurred throughout the population. It appears that low frequencies of pollinator visits nonetheless permitted adequate pollen flow. Studies of seedling dynamics suggested restricted recruitment by means of seed. Gene flow in the present population seemed to depend mainly on pollen. Local genetic structuring caused by seeds falling near the mother plant and by vegetative reproduction was detected by means of spatial autocorrelation. Three main modes of development of genetic structure were found for this species: (1) asexual reproduction by adventitious buds, which was dominant (up to 20 cm from the parent plants); (2) sexual reproduction by seeds that fell from flower stalks (up to 60 cm from the parent plants); and (3) pollen that dispersed over a wide area (throughout the population).",Gene flow; Genetic structure; Microsatellite; Paternity analysis; Spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033787125

This is determined by sexual selection of pollen microspores and ovules during pollination and fertilization. These processes may include pollen competition and seed abortion, which reduce the number of microspores and ovules available for final seed production. Thus, even an excess of pollen microspores to ovules does not result in fertile seeds equal to ovule number. We investigated pollen requirements of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum cultivar 'Bluecrop') for maximal seed production and how fertile seed number translates into fruit quality, since fruit quality would ultimately determine the dispersal of its offspring. We demonstrate that individual blueberry flowers with a mean of 106 ovules reach their maximum fruit set and mass and minimum time to ripen when 125 outcross pollen tetrads pollinate a flower, compared to 10 or 25. Three hundred tetrads resulted in the increase of fertile seeds, but did not result in a further increase of fruit mass or fruit set, or decrease in time to ripen. We also examined the effect of pure and mixed loads of self and outcross pollen (25 and 125 tetrads), and found no differences in fertile seed number, fruit mass, or percentage fruit set when pollen loads were either 25 self or outcross pollen tetrads, although number of days to ripen was significantly shorter by 8 d with 25 outcross tetrads. When the pollen load of 125 tetrads consisted of self or a 50:50 mixture of self and outcross pollen, fruit mass, days to ripen, and percentage fruit set were not different from loads of 125 outcross pollen. In addition, a pollen load of 25 outcross tetrads resulted in fertile seed number and fruit quality in between that of 25 self, and 125 self, 125 mixed, or 125 outcross tetrads. Large, small, and flat seed types were identified, and only large seeds (length = 1.7 mm) were fertile.

The success of selfing, open-pollination and outcrossing of both species and interspecific hybridization was monitored from seed-set to 10-year's growth in a field trial. There was a unilateral barrier to hybridization with seed-set obtained only with E. ovata females. The F1 hybrids exhibited reduced viability compared to intraspecific cross-types at virtually all stages of the life cycle and are clearly at a selective disadvantage compared with their open-pollinated E. ovata half-sibs with which they would directly compete in nature. Eucalyptus ovata and E. globulus overlap in their flowering time but the F1 hybrids flowered later with virtually no overlap with either species. The asynchronous flowering and reduced reproductive fitness of F1 hybrids would markedly limit the opportunity for advanced generation hybridization. Inbreeding similarly had a deleterious effect on the fitness of both species, and the F1 hybrids were most competitive with the E. ovata selfs. It is argued that changes in inbreeding levels of parental populations may be a key factor affecting the relative fitness of hybrids and their potential to impact on the pure species gene pool. Reduced fitness of the pure species through inbreeding may result in hybridization having its greatest evolutionary impact in small founder or relict populations.",Eucalyptus globulus; Eucalyptus ovata; Hybrid fitness; Hybridization; Inbreeding; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033787188

The seedlings were planted in common garden experiments and assessments of growth rhythm and growth were made repeatedly over years up to age 5. Large and significant family effects were obtained for all traits. Generally, the coefficients of additive variance were large. The site x family interaction in Prunus avium was slightly larger than in Fraxinus excelsior. The genetic correlations between the observations of the same trait during different years were generally strong. As expected there was generally a negative relationship between growth cessation and plant height. The large coefficients of additive variation in separate populations for the adaptive traits studied, indicate a potential to respond to strong environmental changes such as are predicted by global warming.

The spatial extent of asexual clones in the field was low in comparison with the predominance of apomixis, thus indicating a low dispersal of seeds from their parent.

In contrast, precocious germination in the enl1 mutant was caused by the absence of endosperm in the seeds, but not by the external signal of rain. In riv mutants, the precocious germination occurred simultaneously at late stages of seed development. The germination test in the presence of exogenous ABA revealed that sensitivity to ABA was gradually reduced from 15 through 35 days after pollination in the wild-type seeds, and was almost lost at 40 days after pollination. A similar tendency was observed in riv1 and riv2 seeds. However, at 15-35 days after pollination, riv1-1 and riv2 seeds had significantly lower sensitivity to ABA than the wild-type seeds. In addition, the three riv mutants lost the sensitivity to ABA at an earlier stage of seed development than the wild type. These results indicate that riv1 and riv2 have a lower sensitivity and shorter period of sensitivity to ABA.",ABA; Embryo; Endosperm; ENL; Rice; RIV; Vivipary,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033815769

Despite the ecological and evolutionary significance of pollen limitation, most studies have only examined fertility in a single population at one time. Here we investigate pollen limitation of fruit and seed set in five populations of Narcissus assoanus, a self-sterile, insect-pollinated geophyte, over 2-3 years in southern France. In common with many early spring flowering plants, pollinator visitation to N. assoanus is often infrequent. Supplemental hand-pollination of flowers with outcross pollen significantly increased overall fruit and seed set by 11% and 19%, respectively. Four of the five populations experienced some pollen limitation during the study. For a given year, there was significant variation in pollen limitation among populations. Two of the populations were pollen limited in one year but not in other years in which they were studied. Seed:ovule ratios for open- and hand-pollinated flowers averaged 0.29 and 0.33, respectively. While hand pollination significantly increased the seed:ovule ratio, the low value obtained indicates that the majority of ovules in flowers do not mature seeds despite hand pollination. The role of genetic and environmental factors governing low seed:ovule ratios in N. assoanus is discussed.",Fruit and seed set; Narcissus assoanus; Pollen limitation; Reproductive ecology; Seed:ovule ratios,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033805478

The evolutionary relationships of functionally dioecious figs (Ficus subg.

Forty-six species representing each monoecious subgenus and each section of functionally dioecious subg.

Separate and combined analyses of molecular and morphological data sets suggested that functionally dioecious figs are not monophyletic and that monoecious subg.

The combined analysis indicated one or two origins of functional dioecy in the genus and at least two reversals to monoecy within a functionally dioecious lineage. The exclusion of breeding system and related characters from the analysis also indicated two shifts from monoecy to functional dioecy and two reversals.

Here I use a powerful new molecular marker (AFLP) for paternity analysis in a natural population of the outcrossing angiosperm Persoonia mollis (Proteaceae) to assess male reproductive success following equal pollination of 15 pollen donors on each of 6310 pistils. These results were contrasted with male reproductive success of these same plants following natural mating. Following equal pollination, there was a significant departure from equal siring success, indicating a potential for postpollination sexual selection. The most successful pollen donor sired more than twice the expected number of seeds, and this was largely consistent across recipient plants. However, siring success following natural mating was significantly different from siring success following artificial pollination and showed that the reproductive gains to be made from superior pollen performance did not translate into increased reproductive success following natural mating. As the ecological context for post-pollination sexual selection is strong in P. mollis, I suggest that pollen competition may ultimately have only a weak effect on non-random male mating success under natural conditions because the realized opportunities for pollen competition within pistils are limited.",AFLP; DNA fingerprinting; Mate choice; Paternity; Pollen competition; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034619084

Yet, the functional significance of dichogamy has rarely been studied. We investigated the nature and functioning of dichogamy in eastern Ontario populations of Aquilegia canadensis, a highly selfing columbine previously described as protogynous. We then manipulated flowers to determine whether increased protogyny would reduce self-fertilization. Contrary to previous reports, A. canadensis is not dichogamous. Controlled pollinations in a greenhouse showed that pollen tubes generally begin to develop after anther dehiscence. Although stigmas can collect pollen early in floral development, naturally pollinated flowers collected from four populations had few pollen grains on stigmas and almost no pollen tubes in styles until after anther dehiscence. Limited pollen deposition before anther dehiscence was also associated with low nectar availability and limited sepal expansion. Because inbreeding depression is strong in this species, selection may favor increased protogyny if it reduces selfing. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the level of selfing in flowers rendered protogynous by the removal of the first 19 (of 39) anthers to develop, with nonprotogynous control flowers. Contrary to expectations, protogyny did not reduce selfing.

We predicted that if seasonal changes in mating opportunity select for phase duration, male-phase duration should decline when pollinator effects are experiment controlled. 3. A comparison of phase duration in naturally pollinated and pollinator-excluded plants supported this prediction: male-phase duration in the pollinator-exclusion treatment was longer and declined faster than in the naturally pollinated group. 4. A population survey revealed that once the effects of temperature were controlled for, male-phase duration was negatively correlated with date, while female-phase duration was positively correlated with date. 5.

These species are mostly hummingbird pollinated. Nectary morphology follows the general pattern within each of the families, suggesting it is an ancestral feature. The mean nectar concentration (± SD) as a percentage of weight (weight/total weight of solution) was 28.3 ± 20.7. Sucrose, fructose, and glucose were identified in most samples. In Nicotiana cordifolia, an unknown monosaccharide was also detected. When more than one sample per species was examined, there was usually variability in sugar ratios. Statistical tests indicated that population size does not influence this variability. However, there were differences when the pollinator type was compared, with a trend of a higher sucrose proportion and a lower coefficient of variation of sucrose in the species pollinated by hummingbirds. This would indicate a specialization in the nectar composition of the hummingbird-pollinated species. Cuminia eriantha, N. cordifolia, and Rhaphithamnus venustus also possess amino acids in their nectar. In the non-hummingbird-pollinated species, the presence of nectaries and nectar serves as an indication of the ancestral pollination system of the first colonizers rather than the current condition, which is wind pollination or self-compatibility for most of the species. Thus, the presence of nectar in flowers does not necessarily indicate extant biotic pollination.",Angiosperms; Hummingbird pollination; Nectar sugar composition; Nectary structure; Robinson Crusoe Island; Sugar concentration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033832086

Maize PCNA cDNA has been cloned and overexpressed in order to raise antibodies. The expression of PCNA has been followed during seed development and seed germination using the homologous antibodies. The protein was found at a constant level during seed development up to 48 days after pollination (DAP) and then the amount declined to very low levels, similar to those found in dry seeds. Upon germination, PCNA levels rose gradually reaching a peak by 20 h germination. Imbibition in the presence of cytokinins (Benzyladenine, BA) produced a sharp increase in amount during the first 3-6 h germination, whereas imbibition in the presence of abscisic acid (ABA) did not alter the pattern of expression as compared with control seeds. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PCNA was associated to a putative cyclin D protein during germination and this association was altered by phytohormones. While the complex PCNA-cyclin D-like protein was present along the first 15 h of germination under control conditions, it was dissociated after 6 h if embryo axes germinated in the presence of BA or ABA. However, complex dissociation in the presence of BA was due to degradation of the putative cyclin D protein while in the presence of ABA the putative cyclin D was still present. These results are discussed in the context of seed germination and the cell cycle.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033827560

Box 4000, Fredericton, NB E3B 5P7, Canada","Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) has become increasingly rare across large portions of its range in eastern North America as a result of a general and widespread decline over the past century. Genetic diversity, population genetic structure, outcrossing rates in the filled seeds, and actual inbreeding levels were characterized in five small, isolated, remnant red spruce populations from the disjunct northwestern limits of its range in Ontario and five populations from the larger, more extensive Maritime populations of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to determine genetic and reproductive status, to provide some benchmarks for monitoring genetic changes resulting from isolation and restricted population sizes, and to assist the development of restoration and conservation strategies. Thirty-seven allozyme loci coding for 15 enzymes were used for genetic diversity assessments, and six of the most polymorphic loci were used for mating system determination. On average, 29.1% (95% criterion) of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was 1.60, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.097 and 0.100, respectively. The Ontario populations were comparable to or slightly less genetically variable than those from the Maritimes. Only 4.7% of the detected genetic variation was among stands; the remainder was among individuals within stands. The Maritime populations were genetically less differentiated from each other than those in Ontario. With the exception of three Maritime populations clustering tightly in one group, there was no clear separation of Ontario red spruce populations from Maritime red spruce populations based on genetic distance as well as canonical discriminant analyses. The average multilocus (t(m)) and single-locus (t(s)) population outcrossing rates were 0.595 and 0.558, respectively, indicating a comparatively high tolerance for inbreeding up to the filled seed stage of development in red spruce. The Ontario populations, on average, showed higher outcrossing rates (t(m) = 0.654, t(s) = 0.641) than the Maritime populations (t(m) = 0.535, t(s) = 0.475). Individual family outcrossing rates were similar to their respective population outcrossing rates and no significant differences were observed among families within populations for the multilocus estimates. When such high levels of inbreeding in filled seeds were combined with the proportions of empty (post-pollination-aborted) seeds, it appears that actual inbreeding levels may vary from 48 to 86%. The highest inbreeding levels occurred in the smallest, most isolated Ontario populations and in those populations most likely to have been affected by poorer pollination conditions. Allozyme variation indicates that in the short term, extant remnants of Ontario red spruce have maintained their genetic diversity and integrity. For artificial restoration of red spruce in Ontario, local seed sources could be used without undue concern over losses of genetic diversity. However, over the longer term, genetic drift and inbreeding may be expected to result in further losses of genetic diversity and (or) reproductive fitness if population sizes, numbers, and distribution continue to decline.",Allozymes; Gene conservation; Genetic diversity; Inbreeding; Outcrossing rates; Picea rubens; Population structure; Restoration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033832088

Measurements of cone and seed traits from natural populations were used as indicators of the reproductive and genetic status of red spruce across the northern margins of its range in Canada. Cone and seed traits were quantified to provide reproductive benchmarks for assessing and monitoring population viability. Reduced fecundity and seedling height growth were observed in some of the smallest Ontario populations, suggesting some inbreeding depression in both vegetative and reproductive components of fitness. Nevertheless, the reproductive status of these small isolated Ontario populations compared favorably with the much larger, more extensive Maritime populations in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Significantly higher proportions of aborted (nonpollinated) seeds and lower proportions of filled seeds suggested poorer pollination conditions in the Maritimes in 1996. The proportion of empty seed, which was used to estimate inbreeding levels, was significantly and negatively related to seedling height growth. In the short-term, the Ontario populations, which probably represent relatively recent remnants of a broader past distribution, generally appeared to be quite resilient to the effects of small population size on fecundity and progeny fitness. In the longer term, continuing decline in population sizes and numbers may be expected to erode reproductive success and genetic diversity through the effects of inbreeding, genetic drift, and changes in mating behavior. The reproductive indicators described here have general validity for assessing and monitoring reproductive and genetic aspects of population viability in conifers.",Conservation; Inbreeding; Picea rubens; Population viability; Reproductive fitness indicators; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033831955

Pan-traps on the ground yielded a faunal sample depauperate in many of the more common native bee species on creosote bush, particularly its floral specialists. This pan-trap sample also corresponded poorly with the previous four years' faunal samples at this site, with pairs of neighboring net-sampled sites throughout the Southwest, and with all pairs of bee samples from Larrea across the Upper Sonoran desert.

Indicator plants for nesting sites of the native leafcutter bee Megachile wheeleri Mitchell were characterized within a Northern California coastal dunes preserve. Nesting was restricted to the Poa-Lathyrus plant community. Significant positive associations were detected between bee nests and Aira praecox L., A. caryophyllea L., Solidago spathulata DC., Juncus lesueurii Bolander, and mosses; negative associations with Carex obnupta L. Bailey and Lathyrus littoralis (Nuttall) Endlicher. Nest density and total plant cover were not significantly correlated. Nests were generally not constructed near the bee's host plants. Most nesting occurred in a zone transitional between mesic lowlands and xeric higher elevations. Natural successional change was increasing nesting habitat, but climax shore pine-spruce forest should eventually eliminate nesting habitat in the long term if succession is not disturbed. The introduced plants Lupinus arboreus Sims and Ammophila arenaria L. may eliminate nest habitat, but Aira praecox L. and A. caryophyllea L. may enhance it. Other bee and wasp species were present in samples but no significant associations with plants were detected because densities were so low. Very large sample sizes will be required to determine significant associations for those species. M. wheeleri nests ranged from dense aggregations to scattered individual nests. Other bee and wasp species also nested within M. wheeleri nest aggregations, including the sphecid wasp Bembix americana comata J. Parker, which normally nests in barren sand.

The change from gene silencing to PAL over-expression is accompanied by a loss of cytosine methylation of the PAL transgene and reduced methylation of the endogenous tobacco PAL2 gene, but not the PAL1 gene. These changes are associated with the appearance of high levels of bean PAL and tobacco PAL2 transcripts in the total RNA fraction from PAL over-expressing plants. However, tobacco PAL2 transcripts are inefficiently recruited into polysomes, and tobacco PAL2 protein is not detected in leaves of PAL over-expressing or wild-type lines. Thus, in spite of the post-transcriptionally controlled increase in tobacco PAL2 transcripts in PAL over-expressors, the increased PAL activity is primarily the result of the increase in bean PAL transcripts and corresponding enzymatic activity. These results reveal a complex cross-talk between expression of the PAL transgene and the corresponding endogenous PAL genes at the levels of transcription, transcript stability and polysomal recruitment during sense transgene-mediated silencing and subsequent over-expresson of PAL in tobacco.",Epigenetic gene silencing; Phenylpropanoid metabolism; Post-transcriptional control; Transgene expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033832636

Pollen germinates on the stigmatic surface and develops a tube that elongates in the transmitting tract of the style to transport the male gametes to the embryo sac inside the ovary. Pollen tube growth is fuelled by cytosolic activities within the pollen, but female tissues facilitate this process to ensure that pollen tubes arrive at the ovary when the ovules are the most receptive for maximum reproductive success. Interactions between pollen and pistil factors, probably both physical and biochemical, must be transmitted to the pollen cytosol to elicit the appropriate pollen cellular activities. Our research focuses on identifying the molecules that are involved in these interactions, understanding their biochemical and cellular bases, transmittal of these interactive signals into the pollen cytosol and the pollen cellular responses.

N. alata has a classic gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) system in which the specificity of pollen rejection is determined by a multiallelic S-locus. S-RNases are products of the S-locus, and are the factors that determine specificity in the style. In vitro mutagenesis experiments have been conducted to determine how allelic specificity is encoded in the S-RNase sequence. Plant transformation experiments have shown that S-RNases also act as factors controlling interspecific pollen rejection. By examining the effect of S-RNases on inter- and intra-specific compatibility in different genetic backgrounds, four different pollen rejection mechanisms can be recognized. S-RNases are implicated in three of these mechanisms. The dependence of pollen rejection on genetic background shows that S-RNases interact with other factors. In general, such factors can be classified in three groups based on their mode of interaction with the S-locus and other pollen-pistil interaction pathways. Some of these factors are now cloned. As more factors are cloned and characterized, it is becoming apparent that pollen-pistil interactions that were once thought to be distinct are actually interrelated.

Despite self-incompatibility (SI) being the most common mode of outcrossing in the Asteraceae, there have been few detailed studies of SI within this family. This paper discusses the SI system operating in Senecio squalidus (Oxford ragwort), an invasive alien species that has colonized most parts of the UK within the last 150 years. In S. squalidus, SI is sporophytic and controlled by a single multiallelic S locus. Preliminary findings suggest that UK populations contain few S alleles. Pseudo self-compatibility (PSC) has been found to operate in S. squalidus and leads to total or partial loss of S-specific discrimination as females, though pollen S function is unaffected. Exceptional compatible and semi-compatible crosses in normally incompatible groups suggest that a cryptic gametophytic element (the G gene) can influence the outcome of certain crosses. It is suggested that PSC, mediated by modifier loci unlinked to the S locus, together with the apparent activity of a G gene in determining SI, may have provided flexibility in the SI system of S. squalidus that was crucial to its success as a colonist. Basic aspects of the cell biology of the pollen-stigma interaction during compatible and incompatible pollinations in S. squalidus are discussed in the light of previous studies of species in the Asteraceae and Brassicaceae.

For meiotic and pollen staining analysis flower buds and flowers in anthesis were, respectively, examined. In most plants microsporogenesis was regular, with meiotic indexes over 90.0% and pollen viability over 83.0%. We observed meiotic abnormalities including univalents and stickiness in metaphase I, laggards and bridges in anaphase and telophase I and II and microcytes at the tetrad stage. Dyads and triads were found in two plants (112 and 122) at the end of microsporogenesis, suggesting production of unreduced gametes. These plants had a low pollen viability (22.9 and 24.4%, respectively) probably due to observed meiotic irregularities. One plant (223) presented pollen grains with a different shape and bigger size, possibly unreduced. Plants 112 and 122 were monoembryonic and plant 223 polyembryonic with 3.5 embryos per seed. The potential fertilization ability of the pollen grains was estimated by in vitro germination tests. Pollen germination was generally high, up to 91.5%, but eight plants (039, 050, 072, 081, 087, 112, 122 and 126) had pollen germination of less than 59%. We conclude that most plants have the ability to produce viable gametes and could be used as pollen donors in programmed crosses. The monoembryonic unreduced-gamete producer plants 112 and 122 are potential progenitors in crosses aimed at producing triploid seedless fruits.

The FIS2::GUS product is found in the embryo sac, in each of the polar cell nuclei, and in the central cell nucleus. After pollination, the maternally derived FIS2::GUS protein occurs in the nuclei of the cenocytic endosperm. Before cellularization of the endosperm, activity is terminated in the micropylar and central nuclei of the endosperm and subsequently in the nuclei of the chalazal cyst. MEA::GUS has a pattern of activity similar to that of FIS2::GUS, but FIE::GUS protein is found in many tissues, including the prepollination embryo sac, and in embryo and endosperm postpollination. The similarity in mutant phenotypes; the activity of FIE, MEA, and FIS2 in the same cells in the embryo sac; and the fact that MEA and FIE proteins interact in a yeast two-hybrid system suggest that these proteins operate in the same system of control of seed development. Maternal and not paternal FIS2::GUS, MEA::GUS, and FIE::GUS show activity in early endosperm, so these genes may be imprinted. When fis2, mea, and fie mutants are pollinated, seed development is arrested at the heart embryo stage. The seed arrest of mea and fis2 is avoided when they are fertilized by a low methylation parent. The wild-type alleles of MEA or FIS2 are not required.

Effective pollination rate was determined at two stages of the fertilization process: (a) pollen germination on the stigma; (b) pollen-tube penetration into the ovule. Pollination rates were negligible during the first part of the flowering season (31 March to 18 April), reaching a high value only at the end of the season (21 May). The same phenomenon also occurred, albeit with consistently higher rates of effective pollination, when detached flowers, taken from the orchard during the flowering season, were pollinated and incubated for 24 h at the presumed optimal temperature of 30°C, indicating that the reproductive organs were not fully functionally viable. At the start of the flowering season, all the pollen was deformed, and later (16 April 1997), when pollen grain shape was normal, only 23% of it was found to be viable by Alexander's staining. The functional viability of the pollen and pistils of orchard- and phytotron-grown (22/27°C, night/day) flowers was determined in detached flowers. At the beginning of the flowering season, both orchard pollen and pistils tended to be defective. Orchard pollen germinated poorly, even on phytotron adapted stigmas. Ovule penetration was hampered in orchard pistils, even when phytotron pollen was used for pollination. Chilling injury appeared to be responsible for the damage to the reproductive organs of the orchard flowers. The negligible rate of effective pollination found in mango orchards in Israel during a significant part of the flowering season therefore appears to be due to the detrimental effect of cold weather on the pollination and fertilization processes as well as on the functional viability of the male and female reproductive organs.

Its major role is to modify the cob vascular system amino acid pool composition to better suit the requirements of the developing endosperm. Nitrogen metabolism in the PPCh tissue may, therefore, influence individual kernel development and consequently play an important role in determining grain yield capacity in maize. The objectives of the two experiments reported in this work were: (1) to determine the effect of nitrogen supply on the activities of the nitrogen assimilating enzymes glutamine synthetase (GS), NADH-dependent glutamate synthase (NADH-GOGAT), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) in the pedicel-placento-chalaza (PPCh) tissue of maize genotypes contrasting in their responsiveness to nitrogen (N) fertilization, and (2) to verify if the activities of these enzymes in the PPCh tissue are correlated to individual kernel weight. Hybrids were grown in the field under low (16 kg/ha) and high (116 kg/ha) N supply and hand pollinated at silking. Enzyme activities were measured 30 days after pollination (DAP) and individual kernel weight was determined after black layer formation. Nitrogen supply did not influence individual kernel weight, soluble protein, GS and PEPC activities. However inconsistent results were observed for NADH-GOGAT and GDH over experimental years. Enzyme activities varied among genotypes, but correlation determinations indicated that individual kernel weight was not associated with soluble protein content and GS activity, with discrepant results observed for NADH-GOGAT and GDH over years. However, a positive and significant correlation was observed between kernel weight and PEPC activity in both experiments. This finding merits further investigations over a larger number of genotypes and different environmental conditions. It suggests that genotypes with increased PEPC activity in the PPCh tissue have increased kernel weight and that this enzyme plays an important role in determining grain yield in maize.",GDH; GOGAT; Grain filling; GS; Pedicel-placento-chalaza; PEPC,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033846346

The five races of maize with no or low frequency of Rf alleles are all highland races from central Mexico. Other studies have shown that members of this racial group did not contribute to the Southern Dent or Northern Flint maize that constitute the varieties from which most of US inbred lines are derived. Forty-eight of the Rf alleles isolated from 25 races of maize were tested for their homozygous viability by self pollinating heterozygous (Rf/rf) plants. Judging from the normal seed set and pollen records, none of the newly identified Rf alleles exhibits zygotic lethality. Thus, we have identified naturally occurring restorers in these races since any Rf mutations arising in the course of these studies are expected to be zygotic lethals. The widespread occurrence of Rf alleles in normal cytoplasm Mexican maize and its wild relatives, the teosintes, supports the hypothesis that these represent genes involved in normal mitochondrial function, some alleles of which are also capable of restoring S male-sterile cytoplasm to fertility.",Maize; Restorers-of-fertility; Teosinte; Zea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033846445

In 1995, pollination failure would be the most plausible reason for the variation in reproductive success among the populations. However, pollinator availability was relatively high in all populations in 1996 and 1997. In these years, higher proportions of fruit failed because of antagonistic biological interactions. In the populations with poor pollinator availability in 1995, mean fruit and seed-sets were greater in the long-styled morph than in the short-styled morph.

Here I present the first detailed description of its pollination biology. On San Salvador Island, P. bahamensis appears to be pollinated exclusively by two bird species, Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars. This pollination dependence was dramatically demonstrated in one season when hurricanes decimated these bird populations, and pollen deposition and fruit set of P. bahamensis was significantly reduced. However, the lack of pollination limitation of fruit set during two other flowering seasons and the relatively low pollen/ovule ratio (607) suggests that pollination of P. bahamensis by these birds is generally reliable. Flowers show traits typical for a bird pollination syndrome, except that the corolla is green. Flowers are held horizontally on the shrub, rather than vertically, suggesting that passerine birds (Bananaquits) rather than hummingbirds have been the most effective pollinator and major selective agent for the floral traits in this species. Individual Bahama Woodstars are ineffective pollinators, depositing few or no pollen grains on stigmas per visit; however, they maintained pollination in one season when visits by Bananaquits were infrequent, and they contributed to the reliability of pollination for this endemic species.",Bird pollination; Breeding system; Endemic plant pollination; Flowering phenology; Fruit set; Green flowers; Hummingbird pollination; Island pollination; Nectar production; Passerine pollination; Pollen deposition; Pollen/ovule ratio; Pollination limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004709040

The results show that the distribution of the sources and the wind direction play a very major role in determining the pollen concentration in the atmosphere when these sources are located in certain quadrants, and that the widely distributed pollen sources show no relationship with wind direction.

Bad development of flowering capitula was caused by the wind and by interference among umbels. A positive correlation between the proportion of atrophied capitula and the number of capitula/umbels also suggested resource limitation. A caterpillar of a Recurvaria Haworth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) species that eats flowers and a boring caterpillar (Lepidoptera not identified) were the main herbivores. Plants reproducing during the flowering peak had a lower probability of being damaged by Recurvaria sp., suggesting an escape from herbivores by flowering synchronism. The proportion of capitula damaged by herbivores was low, causing a reduction of about 5% in the seed set/plant. The boring caterpillar may or may not cause umbel abortion. When the abortion occurs, seed production is reduced by 12%. Many capitula with no damage and individual flowers (up to 50%) did not produce seeds. Pollination failure could be related to this low rate of seed set. We discuss the fact that the low recruitment of seedlings reported for populations of P. polyanthus did not seem to be limited by seed rain, which was estimated at an average of 8000 seeds/plant even when herbivore damage occurred. © 2000, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

Trees originally measured for these traits at age 12 were remeasured at age 24 in three progeny test plantations. The majority of trees scored as having ramicorn branches at age 12 (62%) still had them at age 24, but most forks (53%) had become ramicorns by the second measurement. Thus, there seems little need to score forks and ramicorns separately; simply counting the number of whorls with steep-angled branches seems sufficient for selection purposes. Branch size scores were relatively consistent between the two ages, but not scores for bole sinuosity. Because of low estimated individual and family heritability estimates (?0.13 and &lt;0.41,respectively), predicted genetic responses in DBH and individual stem-defect traits were only modest for this population. Nevertheless, with the exception of sinuosity, genetic correlations between comparable stem-defect traits at the two ages were strong (rA ? 0.82), and predicted responses in traits at age 24, from selection at age 12, were nearly as great as responses expected if selection was delayed until age 24. Branch size and occurrence of steep-angled branches were unfavorably (positively) correlated with DBH (estimated rA=0.56 and 0.41, respectively).

This induces pollen transfer between flowers on the same plant (geitonogamy). Consequently, in self-compatible plants the selfing rate increases with the number of simultaneously open flowers on the plant, and pollen export to other plants in the population can be a decelerating function of the number of flowers. I argue that geitonogamy is important in relation to two phenomena. First, it may explain the low number of seeds per flower and the size-dependent sex allocation observed in some species. Applying sex allocation theory to the boraginaceous Cynoglossum officinale and Echium vulgare shows that hermaphroditism is stable in both species. The predicted evolutionarily stable values for seeds per flower are close to observed values in the field. The model generally predicts that seeds per flower increase with plant size. This prediction is fine for C. officinale but E. vulgare defies the theory. Second, geitonogamy is important in the evolution of dioecy, as already suggested by Darwin. With abiotic pollination the export of pollen to other plants is likely to be proportional to the number of flowers produced, while it decelerates in animal-pollinated plants. Dioecy can then evolve gradually in a species with abiotic pollination, provided that inbreeding depression exceeds 50%, geitonogamous selfing increases with the number of flowers and that genetic variation exists. With complete pollen discounting as in the models of geitonogamous pollination by animals, hermaphroditism is always stable. The model explains Darwin's observation that dioecy is more common in wind-pollinated species and in species in which individuals are large, reproducing with many flowers.",Dioecy; Geitonogamy; Hermaphroditism; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033852987

Eight PCR-amplified fragments of the chloroplast genome were screened for restriction fragment length polymorphisms, using one or two 4 bp-cutter restriction endonucleases. cpDNA variation was investigated on two geographical scales: (1) among four regions in France and Belgium; and (2) within the Belgian region. A total of 150 individuals from six populations were analysed. Fourteen polymorphisms were detected in six of the cpDNA fragments. All polymorphisms probably resulted from insertions or deletions, and allowed the identification of 12 haplotypes. The level of genetic differentiation computed on the basis of haplotype frequencies was similar on the two geographical scales considered (G(STc) = 0.286 among regions, G(STc) = 0.259 among populations within the Belgian region).

The formation of 2n eggs through diplosporic apomeiosis has also been documented in a diploid mutant of M. sativa subsp. falcata (L.) Arcang. (2n = 2x = 16), named PG-F9. Molecular tagging of 2n-egg formation appears to be an essential step towards marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning strategies aimed at investigating and manipulating reproductive mutants of the M. sativa complex. We made controlled crosses between PG-F9 and three wild type plants of M. sativa subsp. coerulea (Less.) Schm. (2n = 2x = 16) and then hand-pollinated the F1 progenies with tetraploid plants of M. sativa subsp. sativa L. (2n = 4x = 32). As a triploid embryo block prevents the formation of 3x progenies in alfalfa because of endosperm imbalance, and owing to the negligible selfing rate, seed set in 2x-4x crosses was used to discriminate the genetic capacity for 2n-egg production. F1 plants that exhibited null or very low seed sets were classified as normal egg producers and plants with high seed sets as 2n-egg producers. A bulked segregant analysis (BSA) with RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA), ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat), and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) markers was employed to identify a genetic linkage group related to the 2n-egg trait using one of the three F1 progenies. This approach enabled us to detect a paternal ISSR marker of 610 bp, generated by primer (CA)8-GC, located 9.8 cM from a putative gene (termed Tne1, two-n-eggs) that in its recessive form determines 2n eggs and a 30% recombination genomic window surrounding the target locus. Eight additional RAPD and AFLP markers, seven of maternal, and one of paternal origin, significantly co-segregated with the trait under investigation. The minimum number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling seed set in 2x-4x crosses was estimated by ANOVA and regression analysis. Four maternal and three paternal independent molecular markers significantly affected the trait. A paternal RAPD marker allele, mapped in the same linkage group of Tne1, explained 43% of the variation for seed set in 2x-4x crosses indicating the presence of a major QTL. A map of the PG-F9 chromosome regions carrying the minor genes that determine the expression level of 2n eggs was constructed using selected RAPD and AFLP markers. Two of these genes were linked to previously mapped RFLP loci belonging to groups 1 and 8.

Different stages of seed development were selected according to days after pollination (DAP): 21, 24, 28, 35, 42 and 42 plus 14 days of storage for diploid ZE and 35 and 42 plus 14 days of storage for triploid ZE. SE were collected at five growth stages from globular to late cotyledonary. Quantitative analysis of ABA was performed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Both types of embryos - somatic and zygotic - essentially differed in their levels of ABA, always being the highest for 2n ZE and lowest for SE. Although the concentration of ABA in ZE of the triploid line was higher when compared with the same DAP, when the comparison was based on embryo development, both the concentration and content of ABA was higher in the diploid line. The pattern of developmental changes in the level of ABA in the diploid ZE was consistent with that known for other species. An increase was observed during embryo development with a peak (51.1 ?g g-1 FW or 0.95 ?g per embryo) at the final stage of embryo formation between 21 and 24 DAP. A sharp decrease in the ABA level then took place (more than 3-fold within 4 days) and was followed by a further reduction as the seed matured. The maximal and minimal values for ABA concentration differed about 35-fold. SE differed substantially from their zygotic counterparts not only in that the concentration of ABA was extremely low (0.005-0.011 ?g g-1 FW) but also that no significant changes occurred during embryo development and no peak of ABA concentration was observed. Other tissues of the ovule and ovary also contained ABA and could be a source of ABA for the embryo.

To determine if the expression of any S gene family members correlates with female receptivity, we analyzed their expression in developing maize silks. We show that a large family of maize S transcripts is expressed in developing silks. Surprisingly, we isolated a cDNA complementary to a large portion of the anti-sense strand of the maize receptor kinase S domain. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-polymerase chain reaction, RNase protection, and Northern hybridization wich single-stranded riboprobes confirmed that natural antisense S transcripts exist in leaves and seedling shoots and in all sexual tissues tested except mature pollen. These natural antisense S transcripts co-exist with several less abundant sense S transcripts. The accumulation of sense and antisense S transcripts is differentially regulated during pollen and silk development.

However, because the sex morphs differ in several floral features, it is not readily apparent which specific traits generate differential pollinator service. In this study, we sought to understand the basis of pollinator preferences for hermaphrodites to females of gynodioecious Fragaria virginiana. We extend a previous study that revealed that lack of pollen-filled anthers and shorter petals were not solely responsible for small bee and fly discrimination against females, by investigating the roles of other morphological features, reward characters, and floral context in bringing about pollinator discrimination. Using floral manipulations we revealed that small bees preferentially visit flowers with wide petals, more nectar, intact stamens, as well as flowers located in hermaphrodite-dominated patches. Specifically, bees were able to remotely detect nectar presence. In addition, bees were attracted to both the anther sac and the filament regions of the stamen, indicating that not only anthers, but also filaments may function as visual or olfactory cues to pollen reward. Furthermore, pollinator preference for flowers in hermaphrodite-dominated patches serves to intensify their discrimination against female flowers which occur predominantly in female-dominated patches. For the most part, preferences of flies mirrored those of the bees with the exception that flies also showed a significant preference for flowers held high over those held closer to the ground. These results indicate that a suite of character differences contributes to pollinators' preferences for hermaphrodite to female flowers. Furthermore, they suggest pollinators could mediate selection on both floral morphology and reward in this species.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033849856

Donors homozygous for the B allele sired more seeds than C-allele donors. Single-donor crosses indicated than C-donor-sired seeds are aborted more often than are B-donor-sired seeds, suggesting that the B-allele donor's advantage in mixed pollinations was a result of differential abortion. A negative relationship between pollen load and the siring success of B-allele donors implies that pollen from B-allele donors has reduced performance relative to C-allele donors when pollen loads are high.

Thus, it is concluded that with the use of the A4 cytoplasmic male-sterile system, it would be possible rapidly to develop a maintainer version of any population without detrimental effects on grain yield and agronomic traits. Male sterility of populations developed from these maintainers will be highly stable, paving the way for their effective utilization as seed parents in breeding inter-population hybrids.",Inter-population hybrid; Male-sterile population; Pennisetum Glaucum; Recurrent selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033862016

Initially, Arabidopsis plants expressing the FLP site-specific recombinase were crossed with plants transformed with a vector containing kanamycin-resistance gene (npt) flanked by FRT sites, which also served to separate the CaMV35S promoter from a promoterless gusA. Hybrid progeny were tested for excision of the npt gene and the positioning of 35S promoter proximal to gusA. GUS activity was observed in the progeny of all crosses, but not in the progeny derived from the self-pollinated homozygous parents. We then induced male sterility in Arabidopsis plants using the antisense expression of a pollen- and tapetum-specific gene, bcp1, flanked by FRT sites. Upon cross-pollination of flowers on the same male-sterile plants with pollen from FLP-containing plants, viable seeds were produced and the progeny hybrid plants developed normally. Molecular analyses revealed that the antisense expression cassette of bcp1 had been excised in these plants. These results show for the first time that a site-specific recombinase can be used to restore fertility in male-sterile plants, providing an alternative method for the production of hybrid seeds and plants.",Antisense; Arabidopsis; FLP/FRT; Hybrid; Male-sterility; Site-specific recombination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033863262

Chemische Okologie, Carl-Zeiss-Promenade 10, 07745 Jena, Germany","After herbivore attack, plants launch a suite of direct and indirect defense responses that must be coordinated if plants are to realize a fitness benefit from these responses. Here we characterize the volatile emissions in the native tobacco plant, Nicotiana attenuata Torr. ex Wats., that are elicited by tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta L.) attack and are known to function as attractants for parasitoids. To provide the first ecophysiological comparison of examples of both types of defense in the same species, we characterize the elicitation and signaling mechanisms, the resources required, and the potential costs and benefits of the volatile release and compare these traits with those of the well-described induced direct defense in this species, nicotine production. The release of (E)-?-ocimene, cis-?-bergamotene and linalool is dramatically induced within 24 h by application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), caterpillar feeding, and the treatment of mechanical wounds with larval oral secretions (OS), but not by mechanical damage alone. Plants from different geographic locations produce volatile blends that differ in composition. The most consistently released component from all genotypes, cis-?-bergamotene, is positively related to the amount of MeJA and the level of wounding if OS are applied to the wounds. The volatile release is strongly light dependent, dropping to undetectable quantities during dark periods, even when temperatures are elevated to match those of the light period. Inhibitors of wound-induced jasmonate accumulation (salicylates and auxins), which are known to inhibit wound-induced nicotine production, do not inhibit the release of volatiles. By individually inducing different leaf positions with OS and, on other plants, excising them after induction, we demonstrate that the emission is largely a systemic, whole-plant response, which is maximally triggered when the second fully expanded leaf is induced. We conclude that while both are wholeplant, systemic responses that utilize recently acquired resources for their production and are activated by the jasmonate cascade, the elicitation of the volatile release exhibits greater tissue sensitivity and utilizes additional signaling components than does nicotine production. In contrast to the large investment of fitness-limiting resources required for induced nicotine production or the resources used in benzyl acetone release from flowers for pollinator attraction, the resource requirements for the volatile release are minor. Hence the argument that the volatile release incurs comparatively large physiological costs cannot be supported in this system.",Cis-?-bergamotene; Diurnal variation; Jasmonic acid; Manduca sexta; Nicotine; Oral secretion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17744402346

They occur in many cereals, but little is known of their expression and roles. Permatin cDNA clones were produced and used to study expression in developing barley and oat seeds. Actin and CDC48 mRNAs declined rapidly following inoculation of barley spikes with Fusarium graminearum. Despite this, permatin mRNA levels remained constant or increased slightly. Studies of permatin gene expression in healthy plants revealed that developing barley and oat seeds accumulate permatin mRNA in an unusual bimodal pattern. Permatin mRNA and protein are highly abundant around the time of pollination and then decrease rapidly to near-zero. A second peak occurs in the doughy stage of development. Antibody and DNA probe hybridization studies showed that expression initially occurs in the ovary wall and then switches to the aleurone and ventral furrow of developing seeds, reaching a peak in the doughy stage. Small amounts of permatin mRNAs also occur in certain vegetative tissues. The barley and oat permatin sequences provided sufficient comparisons between cereal TLPs to suggest that deletions or additions in specific elements could have led to the divergence of leaf- and seed-specific TLPs.

This diploid outcrossing species was domesticated in Asia but has been grown in orchards and home gardens in Scandinavia for many years. In situ and ex situ assessments of phenotypic variation in sweet cherry accessions were performed to determine the reliability of such assessments, and to determine relationships between Nordic populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on in situ data revealed that accessions were mostly clustered according to their country of origin. PCA based on ex situ assessment of accessions that were propagated by seed at Hornun (Denmark) did not agree with the PCA based on in situ data. These contrasting results suggest that phenotypic assessment in sweet cherry depends on the environment, genotype, and the interaction between them. Phenotypic diversity accounted for by in situ assessment may not be always true, while phenotypic differences determined by ex situ assessment may be confounded by the genotype-by-environment interaction, or could depend on the new genotypes arising from open pollination after seed propagation. Our research also suggests that ecotype differentiation could occur in wild Scandinavian sweet cherry. Fruit descriptors were among the best to distinguish between Scandinavian populations.

Lab., 2000 E. Allen Road, Tucson, AZ 85719, United States","Mature pollen possesses or lacks starch grains. Many wind-pollinated and self-pollinated species possess starch grains. This apparent association has led some researchers to hypothesize that starchiness of pollen is functionally related to pollen consumption by pollinators. This hypothesis assumes that starchy pollens contain less oil than starchless pollens, and predicts that pollen-consuming insects will be deterred by starchy pollens because of an inability to digest starch or attraction to more oily pollens due to a greater caloric reward. We assembled a database of 207 plant species for which starchiness of pollen and pollination mode are known. We organized these species into a phylogeny based on published cladograms and tested three hypotheses concerning the concordance of pollen starch and pollination mode. We found that starchiness of pollen arose at least 19 times among the 207 species. Using the concentrated changes test, we found that starchiness of pollen did not arise unusually often in wind-pollinated lineages. We found that shifts to starchy pollen did not result in an unusual number of shifts away from bee, fly or beetle pollination. Furthermore, shifts to starchy pollen did not result in an unusual number of shifts away from pollen consumption. There is little evidence to show a general trend of starch avoidance by pollen-consuming insects. Of the three plant species containing the greatest concentration of pollen starch, among the 89 species for which starch has been quantified, corn (Zea mays) and English plantain (Plantago lanceolata) are readily collected by bees, and cattail (Typha latifolia) is commonly used in the artificial rearing of bees.

We examined whether altering the time interval between pollination of florets within an ear or between ears could affect final kernel number per plant. Synchrony of pollination was varied by natural- and hand-pollination of four hybrids, contrasting in prolificacy (ears plant-1). Plants were grown in the field at low (2.5 and 3 plants m-2) and high (7.5 and 9 plants m-2) plant populations, without water or nutrient stress. Increasing plant population generally delayed silk appearance, but most silks were exposed within 5 d after silking (DAS). Synchronous pollination of all exposed silks on apical and sub-apical ears 5 DAS improved kernel number (KN) per plant and the rioter fertility index (FFI = number of kernels/ number of pollinated silks), relative to open-pollinated plants. At low plant populations, the KN plant-1 increase resulted primarily from a large increase (39-535%, depending upon the hybrid) in kernels on sub-apical ears. At high plant populations, only apical ears set kernels. Synchronous pollination increased KN in these ears 8 to 31%, depending on the hybrid. Thus, timing of pollination had a large impact on kernel set, and the disadvantage associated with an ontogenetic delay in silk emergence could be partially overcome by synchronous pollination. Because delayed pollination of early-silking ovaries allowed a greater number of the late-silking ones to set kernels, factors other than assimilate availability per fertile floret likely are involved in controlling kernel set.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343006840

To this end, I investigated various aspects of the pollination ecology of a population of the herb Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. vulgaris in northwest Spain over 5 yr. By observing floral visitors, I found that the most important pollinator species was the long-tongued bee Anthophora acervorum, which accounted for -45% of recorded insect visits. However, just over 45% of visits were by the nectar-robbing bumble bees Bombus terrestris and B. jonellus. Although the incidence of robbing differed considerably over 5 yr of study, the frequency in every season was very high (66.4-76.5% of robbing) except for 1997 (0% robbing). Despite this high frequency of robbing, robbed flowers had a higher probability of setting fruit than nonrobbed flowers in all years of the study (mean: 82.0 vs. 51.0%; excluding 1997). This increased fruit set in robbed flowers is directly related to bumble bee behavior because the robbers' bodies came into contact with both the anthers and stigmas while robbing. Thus, the robbers effect pollination. These results suggest that the effect of nectar robbers on plant reproductive success is dependent both on the robbers' behavior and on flower/inflorescence structure. The importance of nectar-robbing bumble bees on the reproductive success of A. vulneraria and its yearly high frequency suggest that the relationship between robbers and this plant is part of a successful long-term mutualism.",Anthyllis; Bombus; Bumble bees; Fabaceae; Nectar robbing; Pollinator behavior,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033942085

In the present work, the regulation of post-pollination ethylene was investigated in various floral organs. Ethylene production and petal abscission increased as the number of stigmatic lobes pollinated increased. Direct application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to the stigma induced ethylene production and petal abscission only at high concentrations, which are not naturally present in the pollen. Application of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), an inhibitor of ACC synthase activity, to the stigma effectively prevented pollination-induced ethylene production and petal abscission. Pollination increased the levels of ACC 46-fold in stigma plus style tissue and 6-fold in the basal portion of petals. Enhanced accumulation of N-malonyl-ACC (MACC), a conjugated form of ACC, was also observed in stigma and style tissues after pollination. Pollination increased the activity of ACC synthase 2.5-fold in stigma and style tissues and 3-fold in the basal portion of petals. At 2 h after pollination, a 4-fold increase in the expression of the ACC synthase gene GAC-1 was detected specifically in the stigma and style. In vivo activity of ACC oxidase was 1.5-fold higher in pollinated than in unpollinated or wounded stigma and style. In the lower part of the pistil, the activity of ACC oxidase was lower than in the upper pistil, regardless of treatment. The activity of ACC oxidase was significantly higher in the basal portion of petals than the upper portion of petals. Pollination had no effect on the activity of ACC oxidase in petals. Treatment of florets with cycloheximide effectively prevented pollination-induced petal abscission, but ethylene production was completely unaffected, providing evidence for the post-transcriptional regulation of ethylene production. Stigma and style tissues accounted for 57% of the total ethylene production in the flower following pollination. When the stigma and style were removed and the top of the sterile ovary pollinated, there was no pollination-induced ethylene production or petal abscission. We propose that rapid petal abscission in response to pollination results from increased ethylene production, which occurs via activation of ACC synthase primarily in the stigma and style. This contrasts with post-pollination ethylene production in some wilting-type flowers in timing, lack of autocatalytic ethylene and predominantly post-transcriptional regulation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033924553

The growth of the male gametophyte was accompanied by the active evolution of ethylene from sporophytic tissues of the pistil. Over the first 4 h after pollination, the growth of the pollen tube was accompanied by a twofold acceleration of ethylene evolution from pistil tissues, but this rate decreased slightly over the subsequent 4 h. Pollination also stimulated the CO2 evolution, which indicates the implication of ethylene in oxidative processes during the pollen tube growth. It is concluded that the stigma is the main site of ethylene synthesis, both in pollinated and nonpollinated pistils.

O. ascendens is a self-incompatible species whose sexual reproduction depends on cross pollination by the native bee Trigona nigra. We recorded pollinia removal and fruit production during three consecutive years. On average, pollinia removal was three times higher in the well-preserved habitat patch than in the disturbed patch. The rate of pollinia removal increased by about 7% through the 3 years in the forest patch but decreased by 5% in the disturbed site. Fruit production remained relatively constant from year to year in the well-preserved site and decreased in the disturbed patch. On average, fruit production was two times higher in the forest site than in the disturbed patch. Currently O. ascendens is common in both areas, but these results suggest that agricultural activities disrupt pollination and may eventually alter the overall reproductive success and persistence of the orchid population.

Both pollinators preferred plants with many and large flowers. Strong directional selection for increased flower display was found in all years of the study, regardless of the technique used. Indirect selection due to a high significant correlation with flower display occurred on flower colour and size. SEM showed that pollinators played only a minor role in this observed phenotypic selection. The analysis of the phenotypes of F1 plants showed that flower display actually increased across generations. In addition, white flowers were significantly more frequent in the offspring population than in the parental one, mostly due to the association between flower display and white coloured flowers. This suggests that both direct and indirect selection can play a role in the evolution of correlated traits in this crucifer.",Floral evolution; Indirect effects and correlational selection; Lobularia maritima; Natural selection; Pollinator preference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642633524

Flies transfer fungal spermatia (gametes) among fungi as they visit their hosts for oviposition. Fly larvae consume the products of cross-fertilization (ascospores). We tested whether the cost to the fungus of engaging in the obligate mutualism rises as fly visitation increases and whether mechanisms operate to prevent excessive exploitation of the fungus. Fungi and flies were monitored over 3 years. We recorded the reproductive output of fungi, the amount of feeding by fly larvae on host reproductive tissues, and the mortality of fly eggs and larvae. In two of three years, fly eggs were randomly dispersed; eggs were clumped in the remaining year. The reproductive output of fungi did not decrease with increasing egg load; rather, fungal reproductive output tended to increase as more eggs were laid on fungi. Larval feeding was only weakly associated with the number of eggs on fungi. The lack of over-exploitation of the fungus by the fly shows that the interaction was stable during the period of time we conducted our study. Our data suggest the stability was primarily due to high fly egg/larval mortality that increased as egg load increased.",Botanophila; Epichloe; Mutualism; Mycophagy; Pollinating parasites,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033852634

Love = Agropyron spicatum Pursh: Poaceae) is a cross-pollinating perennial grass native to western North America. Two bluebunch wheatgrass cultivars, Goldar and Whitmar, are currently available for large-scale rangeland seeding. However, cultivars may lack the genetic diversity and adaptation necessary for dynamic non-local environments. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare genomic DNA variation within and between Goldar, Whitmar, and Generation 2 of P-7, a multiple-origin polycross (MOPX2) of 25 naturally diverse bluebunch wheatgrass collections. We assayed 1043 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) products and 88 monomorphic AFLP products from three sample populations of 22 plants. The number of polymorphic loci (and unique alleles) within sample populations of P-7, Goldar, and Whitmar was 898 (99), 813 (49), and 746 (59), respectively. Conversely, the number of fixed AFLP loci within sample populations of P-7, Goldar, and Whitmar was 233, 318, and 385, respectively. The overall nucleotide-sequence diversity [? ± SE (x 1000)] estimated for P-7, Goldar, and Whitmar was 100.2 ± 7.1, 80.1 ± 6.6, and 79.4 ± 6.7, respectively. By all measures, genetic variation within P-7 is significantly higher than genetic variation within cultivars. However, the estimated number of inter-population nucleotide differences per site [d(x) ± SE (x 1000)] between Goldar and Whitmar, e.g., 36.6 ± 1.6, is only slightly higher than ? within these cultivars, therefore the net nucleotide-sequence divergence [d(A) ± SE (x 1000)] between these cultivars is relatively small, e.g. 2.5 ± 0.3. These results indicate that selectively neutral genetic diversity has not been dramatically reduced or inadvertently lost via genetic drift that may have occurred since the divergence of Goldar and Whitmar. No AFLP markers completely distinguish Goldar and Whitmar, therefore discrete morphological differences between these cultivars (e.g., the presence and absence of awns) most likely result from natural or artificial selection.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033846285

In soybean [Glycine max(L.) Merr.], progeny of chimeric plants are a source of nuclear and cytoplasmically inherited mutants. Self-pollinated progeny of a single chimeric plant derived from tissue culture of PI 427099 (Jilin 3) included plants with green foliage, chimeric foliage, yellow foliage (viable), and yellow foliage (lethal). Our objectives were to determine (1) inheritance, linkage, and allelism of the lethal-yellow mutant with known chlorophyll-deficient mutants; (2) inheritance, linkage, and allelism of the viable-yellow mutant with known chlorophyll-deficient mutants; (3) allelism of the lethal-yellow mutant with the viable-yellow mutant; and (4) male and female gamete transmission of the viable-yellow mutant trait. The viable-yellow mutant was allelic to T323, y20 y20 (Ames 2) Mdh1-n Mdh1-n (Ames 2) and was assigned genetic type collection number T361 and gene symbol y20 y20 (Ames 24) Mdh1-n Mdh1-n (Ames 22).

The two chlorophyll-deficient mutants were not linked to each other. There was no significant difference in F1 male or female gamete transmission of the viable-yellow mutant. However, many cross-combinations gave significant deviations from the expected 3 green plants:1 viable-yellow plant in the F2 generation.

The petals of mutant flowers are folded inward and do not extend fully, producing a vestigial corolla (vc), while other floral parts remain normal. The style extrudes through a gap between the rudimentary keel and the folded standard. Consequently, the stigma and style extend beyond the corolla and are exposed. The spatial separation between stigma and anthers could facilitate hand-pollination as it eliminates the need for emasculation. The objective of this study was to determine the fertility of L. corniculatus genotypes expressing vc floral characters. Sixteen genotypes of L. corniculatus expressing the vc phenotype were collected from field grown populations. Pollen from vc genotypes was compared with pollen from genotypes of the germplasm MU-81 used as controls. All vc genotypes produced some pollen that appeared normal, although the quantity of such pollen was variable among the vc genotypes. Mean pollen germination among vc genotypes was 22%, compared with 50% for MU-81. Only five of 16 vc genotypes produced pods when crossed to genotypes of MU-81 and both pod and seed set were less than in control crosses. Normal and abnormal ovules were observed in ovaries of vc genotypes and the reduced fertility may have resulted from smaller, incompletely developed ovules. Unidirectional reversion of the vc genotypes, from abnormal to normal flower morphology, was common. Using the vc mutant to eliminate the need for emasculation in hand-pollination programs depends on its fertility. The combination of phenotypic instability and reduced fertility make the vc mutant less desirable for use in breeding programs.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033841636

For the self-fertile plants, mean fruit-set from self-pollinations (10.0%) was significantly lower than that from cross-pollinations (35.1%), but the relative success of self-versus cross-pollination varied between plants. Fruits produced from self-pollinations contained significantly lower total seed mass and a higher proportion of unfilled seeds than did those from cross-pollinations. Pollen competition experiments were also performed, in which individual flowers received both self- and cross-pollinations in stigmatic chambers leading to different ovaries. The results showed no evidence of increased abortion of self-pollinated fruits under conditions of competition with cross-pollinated fruits within the same flower or between flowers within umbels. Instead, the success of self-pollinations appeared to increase in flowers that had also received cross-pollinations.

The delayed dehiscence1 defect is caused by a delay in the stomium degeneration program. The gene disrupted in delayed dehiscence1 encodes 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, an enzyme in the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway. We rescued the mutant phenotype by exogenous application of jasmonic acid and obtained seed set from previously male-sterile plants. In situ hybridization studies showed that during the early stages of floral development, DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulated within all floral organs. Later, DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulated specifically within the pistil, petals, and stamen filaments. DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA was not detected in the stomium and septum cells of the anther that are involved in pollen release. The T-DNA insertion in delayed dehiscence1 eliminated both DELAYED DEHISCENCE1 mRNA accumulation and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase activity.

Based on the other hypothesis of postzygotic selection, the segregation ratio did not show a significant deviation from the expected 9:3:1 ratio, thereby indicating that embryo abortion caused the segregation distortion (SD).

In Papaver rhoeas, the induction of SI is triggered by a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that results in the rapid and S allele-specific inhibition of pollen tube tip growth. Tip growth of cells is dependent on a functioning actin cytoskeleton. We have investigated the effect of self-incompatibility (S) proteins on the actin cytoskeleton in poppy pollen tubes. Here, we report that the actin cytoskeleton of incompatible pollen tubes is rapidly and dramatically rearranged during the SI response, not only in our in vitro SI system but also in vivo. We demonstrate that nonspecific inhibition of growth does not result in similar actin rearrangements. Because the SI-induced alterations are not observed if growth stops, this clearly demonstrates that these alterations are triggered by the SI signaling cascade rather than merely resulting from the consequent inhibition of growth. We establish a detailed time course of events and discuss the mechanisms that might be involved. Our data strongly implicate a role for the actin cytoskeleton as a target for signaling pathways involved in the SI response of P. rhoeas.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033898396

Several self-pollinated generations of all purple plants were unsuccessful in stabilizing anthocyanin expression. In this study we investigated the inheritance and stability patterns of leaf traits using the Purple Ruffles variety. The results from the complete diallele crosses indicated anthocyanin expression in vegetative tissue is controlled by two dominant genes and ruffled leaf texture is controlled by a single recessive gene. Genes controlling leaf margin and leaf base structures were tightly linked to leaf texture. Essential oil production and oil constituents in leaves did not change as a result of the reversion in color. Color stability in cuttings was affected by the environment and the location where cuttings were taken. An accumulation of secondary metabolites (apigenin, genistein, and kaempferol) in green-reverted sectors on purple leaves was detected using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis; this suggested a potential block in the anthocyanin pathway.

In an undisturbed, natural population of D. montana, female fecundity was not significantly influenced by distance to neighbours or by flower numbers on neighbours. In the same population fruit set was also unrelated to the angular dispersion of neighbours. On the other hand, in an altered population of this species in which conspecifics are extremely isolated due to human activities, insect visitation and fruit set were strongly and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest male. Moreover, the number of insects and fruit set in the natural population were significantly higher in the natural population than in the altered population. In the natural population, trees of large girth produced larger numbers of flowers in both sexes and females which produced larger numbers of flowers, also produced more fruits and fruit set (fruits/flower). In the altered population, fruit numbers and fruit set in female trees were unrelated to the flower numbers, which is possibly due to pollination limitation as a result of inadequate pollinator visits at female trees. Sex ratios were male-biased (3 7:1) in the natural population and female-biased (1:2) in the altered population of D. montana, as well as in G. talbotii (1:3:8) and D. sylvatica (1:12 2) populations where the lower girth classes are mainly cut. The girth class distribution of G. talbotii and D. sylvatica populations was skewed towards larger girths suggesting that future recruitment will be severely affected.

In diploid x tetraploid crosses the development of embryo was normal until 3 days after pollination, when it reached 3-celled proembryo stage. However, endosperm around the growing embryo showed large vacuolar spaces and depletion of cell contents leading to embryo starvation and abortion. In tetraploid x diploid crosses a well-developed endosperm was observed in most of the developing seeds. However, the zygote degenerated immediately after fertilization, leading to the formation of embryoless seeds in which the maternal tissue development was normal.

In order to determine what aspect of reproductive development is affected by microgravity, we studied pollination and embryo development in Brassica rapa L. during 16 d in microgravity on the space shuttle (STS-87). Brassica is self-incompatible and requires mechanical transfer of pollen. Short-duration access to microgravity during parabolic flights on the KC-135A aircraft was used initially to confirm that equal numbers of pollen grains could be collected and transferred in the absence of gravity. Brassica was grown in the Plant Growth Facility flight hardware as follows. Three chambers each contained six plants that were 13 d old at launch. As these plants flowered, thin colored tape was used to indicate the date of hand pollination, resulting in silique populations aged 8-15 d postpollination at the end of the 16-d mission. The remaining three chambers contained dry seeds that germinated on orbit to produce 14-d-old plants just beginning to flower at the time of landing. Pollen produced by these plants had comparable viability (93%) with that produced in the 2-d-delayed ground control. Matched-age siliques yielded embryos of equivalent developmental stage in the spaceflight and ground control treatments. Carbohydrate and protein storage reserves in the embryos, assessed by cytochemical localization, were also comparable. In the spaceflight material, growth and development by embryos rescued from siliques 15 d after pollination lagged behind the ground controls by 12 d; however, in the subsequent generation, no differences between the two treatments were found. The results demonstrate that while no stage of reproductive development in Brassica is absolutely dependent upon gravity, lower embryo quality may result following development in microgravity.",Brassica; Embryo; Microgravity; Seed; Spaceflight,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034082344

Floral studies, floral visitor observations, and pollination studies were conducted over four summers at six different sites to examine floral traits and determine the relative importance of diurnal vs. nocturnal pollinators. Agave chrysantha appears to have developed minor shifts in several floral characters that enhance diurnal pollination. Although floral shifts towards diurnal pollination were fewer in A. palmeri, stigmas were diurnally receptive and copious floral rewards were available in the morning, indicating that some adaptations exist to allow for multiple pollinators. Differences in fruit and seed set between naturally day- and night-pollinated umbels for both species were either not significant or significantly higher in day-pollinated plants. Bats were not important pollinators of A. chrysantha, and the mutualistic relationship between A. palmeri and the lesser long-nosed bat was found to be asymmetric 'Bat-adapted' floral traits appear to be flexible enough to respond to the climatic and pollinator unpredictability experienced by avages at the northern edge of their distribution.

The European species N. lutea and N. pumila in Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany are pollinated by bees and flies, including apparent Nuphar specialists. This contrasts with reports of predominant beetle pollination in American N. advena and N. polysepala. We studied pollination in N. ozarkana in Missouri and N. advena in Texas to assess whether (1) there is evidence of pollinator shifts associated with floral-morphological differences between Old World and New World species as hypothesized by Padgett, Les, and Crow (American Journal of Botany 86: 1316-1324. 1999) and (2) whether beetle pollination characterizes American species of Nuphar. Ninety-seven and 67% of flower visits in the two species were by sweat bees, especially Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) nelumbonis. Syrphid fly species visiting both species were Paragus sp., Chalcosyrphus metallicus, and Toxomerus geminatus. The long-horned leaf beetle Donacia piscatrix was common on leaves and stems of N. ozarkana but rarely visited flowers. Fifteen percent of visits to N. advena flowers were by D. piscatrix and D. texana. The beetles' role as pollinators was investigated experimentally by placing floating mesh cages that excluded flies and bees over N. advena buds about to open and adding beetles. Beetles visited 40% of the flowers in cages, and flowers that received visits had 69% seed set, likely due to beetle-mediated geitonogamy of 1st-d flowers. Experimentally outcrossed 1st-d flowers had 62% seed set, and open-pollinated flowers 76%; 2nd-d selfed or outcrossed flowers had low seed sets (9 and 12%, respectively). Flowers are strongly protogynous and do not self spontaneously. Flowers shielded from pollinators set no seeds. A comparison of pollinator spectra in the two Old World and three New World Nuphar species studied so far suggests that the relative contribution of flies, bees, and beetles to pollen transfer in any one population depends more on these insects' relative abundances (and in the case of Donacia, presence) and alternative food sources than on stamen length differences between Old World and New World pond-lilies.",Bee pollination; Beetle pollination; Fly pollination; Nuphar; Nymphaeaceae; Pollinator spectra; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034046457

Here we examined the pollination ecology of A. lycoctonum. We investigated pollinator community and frequency in four populations at two altitudes over two years. We found that flowers were more often visited at low elevation than at high elevation. However, because flowers lived longer at high elevation than at low elevation, and plants at high elevation had more flowers than at low elevation, the overall chance of a plant being visited may be greater at high elevation. Breeding system experiments showed that at least some populations of A. lycoctonum were self-compatible and also were not completely protandrous. Thus selfing, especially by geitonogamous pollen, will be common if pollinators often visit several flowers within a plant, as we found to be true for the main pollinator (bumblebees) of A. lycoctonum. Although the stereotypical behavior of bees is to move upwards, 17% of the within-plant movements of the main pollinator (Bombus gerstaeckeri) were downwards, i.e. from a male-phased to a female-phased flower because the flowers open from the bottom to the top of the plant. Other pollinators of A. lycoctonum moved less often within plants.

Between 0900-1100 hours, however, this preference was no longer evident, and all 3 species visited new and old flowers with similar frequency. E. erythrochlora and P. graminea spent more time harvesting pollen during 1) initial (first or second) visits to new flowers than initial visits to old flowers and 2) initial visits to new flowers than final (seventh or later) visits to new flowers. Similar, although not statistically significant, trends were evident for B. pullatus as well. An experiment using pollinator exclusion bags revealed that the reduced foraging effort at individual flowers was resource-dependent and was not simply a time-dependent phenomenon.",Apidae; Buzz pollination; Costa Rica; Foraging behavior; Halictidae; Solanum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033949004

If nectar production is energetically expensive, then resources utilized to produce fruits and seeds may be even more limited in pollinator-rewarding orchids than in non-rewarding ones. Thus, resource adjustments may be more dramatic or entirely different in nectar producing plants. In this study, we performed artificial hand-pollinations for two consecutive flowering seasons in the nectar producing orchid Comparettia falcata, and tested whether or not fruit set, seed set, and seed viability were limited by the quantity of pollinations or by resources. In addition, we compared mechanisms of short-term (fruit abortion within seasons) and long-term consequences (percent change in leaf length and change in flower number per plant between seasons, probability of shoot and inflorescence production, and mortality) between hand- pollinated and unmanipulated plants. The relationships among plant traits related to vegetative size and reproduction also were examined. Hand-pollinations showed some negative effects. Fruit set was higher in hand-pollinated plants in the first season but was similar to the controls in the second. Seed set was significantly lower and abortions were higher than in unmanipulated plants. On the other hand, some of our measurements were unaffected by the hand-pollination treatment. Unexpectedly, there were no significant differences between groups in percent change in leaf length, change in flower number per plant between seasons, or the probability of shoot and inflorescence production. Although there was a strong correlation between leaf size and the number of flowers produced within a season, associations between leaf size and traits related to current or future reproduction were not consistent. Like other epiphytic orchids, pollination limitation occurred within a single season in C. falcata, but increases in fruit production also resulted in reduced lifetime fitness as estimated by a compounded fitness index. Contrary to all other epiphytic orchids studied, long-term adjustments to increased fruit production in C. falcata through reduction in future growth or flower and inflorescence production were either minor or lacking. Our results suggest that the nature of plant strategies associated with resource constraints during sexual reproduction may be dependent on whether or not plants have evolved traits that are costly.",Comparettia falcata; Floral rewards; Hummingbird pollination; Nectar; Orchid; Pollen limitation; Puerto Rico; Reproductive ecology; Resource constraint,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343628735

I examined the effect of habitat fragmentation on reproduction of four species found in mallee woodlands of central New South Wales, Australia: Acacia brachybotrya, Senna artemisioides, Eremophila glabra, and Dianella revoluta. At six sites I surveyed plants in a reserve and in a nearby linear strip of vegetation. Two additional sites were established in a large reserve. Many effects were apparent at the extreme end of fragmentation, revealed by two-way analysis of covariance comparing reserves and linear strips at each site. The nature of the response differed among species. Flower production was greater in most linear strip fragments for S. artemisioides and E. glabra. Fruit set efficiency was significantly greater in linear strips for S. artemisioides and significantly lower for A. brachybotrya, E. glabra, and D. revoluta. Fruit predation was lower in most linear strips for E. glabra. For A. brachybotrya, fruit predation was significantly lower in linear strips. The net effect of these changes was a significant increase in whole-plant seed production for S. artemisioides, a significant decrease in whole-plant seed production for A. brachybotrya and in whole-plant fruit production for D. revoluta, and no consistent effect on whole-plant fruit production for E. glabra. In contrast, the only pattern apparent when the effect of fragment size was considered over a range from linear strips < 40 m wide to a reserve > 140,000 ha was a positive correlation between the fragment size and fruit-set efficiency of A. brachybotrya. These results suggest that habitat fragmentation can significantly alter important reproductive functions of species, by changing both the plant's physical environment and its interactions with animals.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034082231

We applied pollen mixtures to stigmas to determine how pollen interactions affect siring success and the frequency of hybrid formation between two species of Ipomopsis (Polemoniaceae) in Colorado. Plants of both parental species and natural hybrids were pollinated with I. aggregata and I. tenuituba pollen in ratios of 100:0, 80:20, 50:50, 20:80, and 0:100 by mass. Plants were homozygous for different alleles at an isozyme marker, allowing us to distinguish the type of pollen parent for 2166 viable seeds from 273 fruits. In contrast to studies of many other hybridizing taxa, there was no evidence of an advantage to conspecific pollen, nor did composition of the stigmatic pollen load affect seed set. Instead, the frequency of seeds sired by a given species was proportional to its representation in the pollen load. In this hybrid zone, both the frequency of first-generation hybrid formation and the relative male fitness of the two parental species should be predictable from the rates of pollen transfer to stigmas.",Gene flow; Hybrid zone; Hybridization; Interspecific pollen competition; Ipomopsis; Male fitness; Polemoniaceae; Pollen interactions; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034095824

About 60 percent of the population was reproductive, and of these, nearly equal numbers exhibited female or male characteristics. Plants that bore fruit and small sterile anthers were characterized as female; those that lacked fruit but produced pollen in large anthers were characterized as male. The morphology, receptivity, and developmental phenology of pistils were identical in both forms.

Dioecious fig phenology provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of climate and sexual specialization on the obligate fig-fig pollinator/ovule parasite interaction. Leaf phenology was strongly correlated between sexes. Trees dropped leaves during drought and initiated new leaf growth after the renewal of rain. Before the production of large crops of syconia, trees shed their leaves and then new leaves and syconia were initiated together. Syconia were produced in synchronous crops with asynchrony between trees maintaining a relatively even production of syconia within the tree group. Syconia abortion on male but not female trees, was negatively correlated with the proportion of trees with male phase syconia. A severe drought in early 1998 significantly disrupted the phenology thereafter. The duration of crop development was approximately twice as long on female trees as on males, and total syconia production was much higher on male trees. Plots of syconia diameter versus dry weight suggest sexual specialization in the investment profile during crop development. Male trees also sometimes produced a small crop of syconia immediately before a large crop, probably to supply wasps for the main crop. Sexes had different growth strategies with male trees growing more as small individuals and slightly delaying reproduction. Diameter at breast height was significantly correlated with total syconia production in male trees but not in females.

From January to March 1998 northern Borneo suffered a very severe drought linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation event of 1997-1998. This caused a substantial break in the production of inflorescences on dioccious figs and led to the local extinction of their pollinators at Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malayasia.

Three possible effects of the introduced honey bee were examined. Firstly, honey bee impact on the reproductive success of heather, an important weed species in Tongariro National Park, was examined. Insect visitation rates on heather flowers were low at each of four study sites within the park. Bagging plants to exclude insect flower visitors had little effect on the level of seed set. The potential of other pollen vectors, wind and thrips, as pollinators of heather was also examined. The studies indicate that none of these vectors significantly effect the amount of viable seed produced so it is concluded that heather is capable of autonomous self-pollination. The second part of the study examined the impact of honey bees on the pollination systems of a native plant species. Flax is thought to be predominantly bird pollinated, but the floral resources are also utilised by a variety of native and introduced insect species including honey bees. Fruit and seed set was found to be significantly higher at sites with bird visitation. The results also suggest, however, that flax has a flexible pollination system that enables it to maintain a range of fruit and seed set levels under different pollinator regimes. In the third study, competition between native flower visitors and honey bees was examined for two common alpine shrubs- manuka and Hebe stricta. The abundance and diversity of insect visitors varied considerably between sites, and between observational periods. Some of this variation may be ascribed to differences in the weather or to altitude.

The expectation, therefore, would be that populations of Juniper are genetically diverse with little structuring between them. In Britain, the species has two main centres of distribution: a highland zone in the north and west, in which populations are still large and sexually reproducing, and a southern zone on chalk downlands in which populations are small and fragmented and individuals suffer from a decline in fertility. Thus, one would expect the large sexually viable populations in the north to exhibit high levels of within-population genetic variation, while the declining southern populations would be genetically depauperate. The analysis of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) was used to test this hypothesis. Surprisingly, all populations studied showed high levels of genetic variation although there was clear structuring between populations. On the basis of the geographical structuring of the populations it was hypothesized that J. communis colonized Britain via three separate routes.",AFLP; Conservation; Diversity; Juniperus communis; Polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034049015

In this study, factors limiting reproductive success were studied with two terrestrial orchid species in Central Finland during 1996 and 1997. In a field experiment using a factorial design, plants of nectar-producing Platanthera bifolia and nectarless Dactylorhiza incarnata were treated with nutrient application and hand-pollination. Inflorescence size was considered as an indicator of attractiveness to pollinators as well as of the general condition of the plant. In 1996, fertilizer treatment increased relative capsule production in P. bifolia plants with small inflorescences, indicating poorer store of resources in the underground corm and dependence on nutrient availability during capsule maturation, which was not found in large plants. Hand-pollination and large inflorescence size in P. bifolia did not affect capsule initiation, but increased the proportion of mature capsules. P. bifolia may thus be regarded as both resource- and pollination-limited within a year. Pollination success was observed to be the only factor limiting reproduction of the nectarless D. incarnata within a year, because hand-pollination increased capsule production, and there were no significant effects of fertilizer treatment or inflorescence size in 1996. Capsule production in 1996 did not affect the probability of P. bifolia flowering in the following year, while high capsule production decreased the subsequent probability of flowering in D. incarnata. Species with different pollination strategies differed in the use of resources. The nectar-producing P. bifolia had a lower fruit/flower ratio than the nectarless D. incarnata, also after hand-pollination.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034022352

Calochortus, a genus of about 60 species with its center of diversity in California, has flowers with a wide range of appearances. Insects visiting Calochortus flowers in 25 species were censused at 40 sites. Visitors at coflowering plants were also censused at each site. Calochortus flowers attracted insects in several orders, especially beetles that feed at glands on the petals and bees that often collect pollen. Species in Calochortus section Calochortus had a somewhat narrower spectrum of visitors than species in section Mariposa. The diversity of visitor species at Mariposa flowers was often greater than the diversity at coflowering species. On the whole, Calochortus flowers seem to be generalists in terms of their pollinators. Differences in visitor assemblage were greater between Calochortus populations at different sites than between visitors to Calochortus versus coflowering species at a site. Nevertheless, there were always significant differences in the proportions of various insects at Calochortus versus coflowering plants. In addition, proportions of visitors also differed between species of Calochortus at the same site. Thus, Calochortus flowers have diverged in the visitors they attract, and evidently they have done so without permanently specializing (except to a limited degree at the sectional level).

T6G 2E9, Canada","Yuccas initiate far more flowers than they can mature as fruit, thereby providing opportunities for them to mature flowers of the highest quality. Flower quality in yuccas has both intrinsic and extrinsic components. Intrinsic components relate to flower morphology and inflorescence architecture. Yucca moths (Tegeticula spp., Incurvariidae), the sole pollinators and primary seed predators of most yuccas (Yucca spp., Agavaceae), mediate extrinsic components of flower quality through their ovipositions in flowers, and the quantity and quality of pollen that they transfer. In addition, intrinsic and extrinsic components interact as a function of flowering phenology and moth activity within inflorescences. We investigated selective abscission of flowers in Y. kanabensis with respect to various combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. First, we considered the effect of high and low pollen loads delivered to different subsets of flowers and in different presentation orders. In the absence of moth ovipositions, Y. kanabensis is sensitive to the amount of pollen that moths deliver and tends to retain high pollen flowers, even when all flowers receive sufficient pollen for full fertilization. However, pollen delivery sequence and the position of flowers with an inflorescence modify this high pollen effect. We then considered the interplay between high and low pollen combined with moth ovipositions and found that the number of ovipositions dominated the pollen effect. Finally, we considered number of ovipositions in conjunction with different flowers in the blooming sequence while controlling pollen levels and found that the clear effect of ovipositions on flower fate can be tempered by where the flower is in the blooming sequence. These results have implications for the regulation of the mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths, indicating that yuccas are capable of regulating costs, retaining flowers of relative high quality and selectively abscising the rest. Yucca sensitivity to several intrinsic and extrinsic factors allows the plant to respond flexibly to the pollination environment and several species of moths.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034022491

The poly(A)-PABP complex is central to the efficient translation initiation and control of poly (A) tail length and is required in some pathways of mRNA decay. A large gene family encodes PABPs in Arabidopsis thaliana. In striking contrast to the floral and root specific expression of three previously reported Arabidopsis PABPs, we demonstrate that RNA and protein for one highly diverse member of this family, PAB2, are expressed in roots, stems, leaves, flowers, pollen and siliques of Arabidopsis. However, cell-type specific analysis of a PAB2 reporter gene fusion revealed that PAB2 is spatially and temporally regulated in each organ. For example, strong expression was detected only in the stele and meristem region of roots and a dramatic decrease in expression was observed upon fertilization of ovules. Furthermore, the PAB2-reporter construct gave a nearly identical expression pattern in transgenic tobacco, demonstrating that PAB2 expression is under strong selective constraint. The PAB2-reporter was also strongly expressed in the transmittal tissues of both Arabidopsis and tobacco, raising the possibility of its involvement in the pollination-dependent poly(A) tail shortening of transmittal tissue specific mRNAs previously reported in tobacco (Wang et al., 1996, Plant J. 9, 715-727). In view of its potential role in poly(A) tail shortening, we demonstrated the strong and distinct presence of PAB2 protein in transmittal tissues of Arabidopsis. The evolutionary and functional implications of the expression pattern of PAB2 and its possible functional roles in post-transcriptional regulation in transmittal tissues are discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034033177

An extensive survey of populations of the two species in SW France revealed a wide range of style-morph frequencies, particularly populations with significantly more long-styled than short-styled plants. Here we employ experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate potential selective mechanisms governing the variation in style-morph frequencies. Controlled pollination of both species demonstrated that N. assoanus is moderately self-sterile whereas N. dubius is highly self-compatible. Both intra- and intermorph crosses of N. assoanus were: equally fertile, indicating that the species does not exhibit heteromorphic incompatibility. Estimates of female fertility (fruit- and seed-set) and multilocus estimates of outcrossing using allozyme markers provided no evidence of morph-specific differences in maternal components of reproductive success in natural populations of the two species. This result suggested that differences between the morphs in male fertility may be largely responsible for the observed morph-ratio variation. To investigate this hypothesis we developed a mating model that incorporates the genetics of stigma-height dimorphism and contrasting rates of assortative and disassortative mating in the style morphs. Simulation results demonstrated that stigma-height dimorphism will always be maintained when levels of disassortative mating are greater than assortative mating, and that the observed L-biased populations in Narcissus spp. probably result from greater levels of assortative mating in this morph in comparison with the S-morph.",Disassortative mating; Female fertility; Mating system; Plant sexual polymorphism; Self-sterility; Stigma-height dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033947826

Experiments examined various aspects of horticultural performance: days to flower, flower senescence after pollination and without pollination, fruit set and ripening, and adventitious root formation on vegetative stem cuttings. The development of EI plants was altered in several ways. Time from seed sowing to first flower anthesis was decreased by a week for EI plants grown at 26/21 °C. Flower senescence in nonpollinated and self-pollinated flowers was delayed in all EI plants compared to wild-type plants. Fruit set percentage on EI plants was slightly lower than on wild-type plants and fruit ripening on EI plants was delayed by up to 7 days. EI plants produced fewer commercially acceptable rooted cuttings than wild-type plants. There was a basic difference in the horticultural performance of the two EI lines examined due to a difference in the genetic backgrounds used to generate the lines. EI plants displayed better horticultural performance when grown with day/night temperatures of 26/21 °C than 30/24 °C. These results suggest that tissue-specific ethylene insensitivity as well as careful consideration of the genetic background used in transformation procedures and growth conditions of etr1-1 plants will be required to produce commercially viable transgenic floriculture crops.

Yet the means through which insects detect amino acids can be complex and arise from pre- and post- ingestive mechanisms. Furthermore, the response to an amino acid can change depending on an insect's nutritional status. Here we use a sensitive feeding assay and Proboscis Extension Response (PER) conditioning in the honey bee to assay the effect of glycine, which is a common constituent of nectars and pollens. Subjects preferred to feed on a sucrose stimulus that contained glycine, and the highest relative preference was recorded for the highest concentration of glycine. However, the highest response rate occurred at lower than maximal concentrations and differed depending on the physiological status of the subjects. These results are consistent with a model in which subjects attempt to maintain a physiological target amount of glycine/amino acid relative to other nutrients. All concentrations of glycine enhanced the rate and magnitude of a conditioned response to an odor in the PER assay, which demonstrates that animals can learn to modify their responses to an odor conditioned stimulus based on the presence of amino acid. This capability would enhance a honey bee's ability to evaluate the quality of floral nectars, which are associated with, among other things, odor cues given off by flowers. In future studies these techniques will allow us to evaluate the physiological roles that amino acids play in honey bee diet and choice behavior.

We detected a significant interaction between seed addition and surface soil disturbance on seedling recruitment over 2 years of establishment. Plots that received both supplemental seed addition and disturbance established 10.5 times as many rosettes as control plots. We did not detect main or interactive effects of caging on seedling establishment. We explored the importance of density-dependent recruitment by investigating the number of rosettes per experimental plot through time. In addition, we used planned contrasts to compare the absolute and percent changes in control and treatment plot rosette densities between the study years. We found significant downward concave curvature to the seedling recruitment curve, suggesting negative density-dependent recruitment across the experimental range of rosette densities. We found a significant difference between the control plots and the seed addition-disturbance plots in terms of absolute changes in plot density from 1997 to 1998. Greater net mortality occurred in plots that received both seed addition and disturbance. However, we found no differences among treatments in the percent change in rosette density across the study years. Our study demonstrates that seedling recruitment in natural plant populations may be limited by the interaction of seed and microsite availability, and that seedling recruitment in scarlet gilia may be negatively density dependent.

M5S 3B2, Canada","An unusual stylar dimorphism occurs in Narcissus, a plant genus of insect-pollinated Mediterranean geophytes. To determine the characteristics of the sexual polymorphism, we investigated floral variation in 46 populations of N. assoanus (section Jonquillae) and 21 populations of N. dubius (section Tazettae) in SW France. Flowers possess two stamen levels in each morph that occupy slightly different positions within the floral tube. In long-styled plants (L-morph), the stigma is located within or slightly above the upper-level stamens, whereas in short-styled plants (S-morph) the stigma is placed well below the lower-level stamens. The stigma-height dimorphism is distinct from heterostyly because the reciprocity of stigma and anther positions in the two style morphs is only weakly developed and there are no differences between the style morphs in pollen size or production. In both species, mean stigma-anther separation is much greater in the S-morph than the L-morph. In N. assoanus, population style-morph ratios vary from isoplethy (1L:1S) to L-biased, whereas in N. dubius they are usually strongly L-biased or occasionally contain only the L-morph. Populations fixed for the S-morph, or with S-biased morph ratios, were not observed. In N. assoanus, style-morph ratios were associated with population size: large continuous populations always exhibited 1:1 morph ratios, whereas smaller, fragmented populations were often L-biased. This pattern was not evident in N. dubius. We argue that biased style-morph ratios largely result from morph-specific differences in assortative mating.",Amaryllidaceae; Disassortative mating; Heterostyly; Morph ratios; Population size; Stigma-height dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033948315

Pollen fitness and zygote survival was estimated from the zygote survival and paternity of seeds. Self pollen had a lower fitness than outcross pollen, and selfed zygotes were less likely, or as likely, to develop into seeds. Hybrid zygotes survived as frequently or more than local zygotes, and pollen from one of the populations fertilized most ovules in both populations.

The image of the lone genius inventing from scratch is a romantic fiction. Businesses that constantly innovate have systematized the production and testing of new ideas, and the system can be replicated by practically any organization. The best innovators use old ideas as the raw materials for new ideas, a strategy the authors call knowledge brokering. The system for sustaining innovation is the knowledge brokering cycle, and the authors discuss its four parts. The first is capturing good ideas from a wide variety of sources. The second is keeping those ideas alive by playing with them, discussing them, and using them. Imagining new uses for old ideas is the third part--some knowledge brokers encourage cross-pollination by creating physical layouts that allow, or even force, people to interact with one another. The fourth is turning promising concepts into real services, products, processes, or business models. Companies can use all or part of the cycle. Large companies in particular desperately need to move ideas from one place to another. Some will want to build full-fledged consulting groups dedicated to internal knowledge brokering.

Yields after one single visit were more than five times higher in flowers visited by O. cornuta than in those visited by A. mellifera nectar gatherers. This is attributed to the lower rate of stigma contact in A. mellifera visits, rather than to insufficient deposition of compatible pollen when the stigmas are contacted. A. mellifera pollen collectors had very high rates of stigma contact, but they were very scarce (3%) on 'Delicious' flowers despite the presence of abundant brood in their hives. One single visit per flower by O. cornuta produced commercial fruit set (27.4%) and fruit size (>70 mm diameter). Based on cell production, average number of trips required to provision a male and a female cell, and flower visiting rates, it is estimated that a mean of 22,252 apple flower visits per female O. cornuta were made during the 15-d flowering period.

We characterized the pollination-induced petal senescence process in Petunia inflata using a number of cell performance markers, including fresh/dry weight, protein amount, RNA amount, RNase activity, and cellular membrane leakage. Membrane disruption and DNA fragmentation with preferential oligonucleosomal cleavage, events characteristic of PCD, were found to be present in the advanced stage of petal senescence, indicating that plant and animal cell death phenomena share one of the molecular events in the execution phase. As in apoptosis in animals, both single-stranded DNase and double-stranded DNase activities are induced during petal cell death and are enhanced by Ca2+. In contrast, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, one commitment step in signaling of apoptosis in animal cells, was found to be dispensable in petal cell death. Some components of the signal transduction pathway for PCD in plants are likely to differ from those in animal cells.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033994441

Three classes of egg cell were distinguished: type A - small, non-vacuolated cells with a central nucleus; type B - larger cells with small vacuoles surrounding the perinuclear cytoplasm located in the middle of the cell; type C - big cells with a large apical vacuole and the mid-basal perinuclear cytoplasm. The less-dense cytoplasm of the vacuolated egg cells usually contained numerous cup- or bell-shaped mitochondria. The three egg types appear to correspond to three late stages of egg cell differentiation. The frequencies of each of the three egg types were monitored in developing maize ears before and after pollination. In young ears, with the silks just extending out of the husks, small A-type cells were found in about 86% of ovules. Their frequency decreased to about 58% at the optimum silk length, remained unchanged in non-pollinated ears, and fell to 16% at the end of the female receptivity period. However, after pollination and before fertilisation the frequency of these cells decreased to about 33%, and the larger vacuolated egg cells (types B and C) prevailed. At various stages of the receptivity period, pollination accelerated changes in the egg population, increasing the number of ovules bearing larger, vacuolated egg cells. Experiments with silk removal demonstrated that putative pollination signals act immediately after pollen deposition and are not species-specific.",Egg cell (differentiation); Embryo sac (maturity); Female receptivity; Pollination signal; Zea (egg cells),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343237802

They are summarized as three types: explosive type, strong-wind type and long-filament type. Flowers with the explosive type correspond to the group of the smallest pollen size. They grow in moderately windy environment like gaps in woods. Their pollen grains can float much longer in the air after discharge from anthers to reach to stigmas. Flowers with the strong-wind type are equivalent to the group of medium pollen size. They, including many woody and weedy species occurring in wastelands, are able to make better use of stronger wind than the explosive type flowers for pollen dispersal. Flowers with the long-filament type correspond to the group of the largest pollen size.

The elongated staminal column is adnate to the gynophore and the ten anthers are grouped at the tip of this column. The ovary with a short style ending in a simple stigma projects beyond the anthers and stays in an erect position. The flowers open daily at 0300-0330 h and are visited by birds and insects during daytime. The flowers characteristically change their colour, being bluish-grey on day one (d1), changing to light red on day two (d2) and dark red on day three (d3). Birds collect nectar more frequently from d2 and d3 flowers. Bees collect nectar and pollen mostly from d1 flowers. The flowers are not apomictic, but compatible for auto-, geitono- and xenogamy. The bees Ceratina and Trigona mediate autogamy and geitonogamy by remaining mostly on the same flower while Pseudapis and Amegilla promote xenogamy by their frequent inter-tree movement. The birds quaker babbler Alcippe poioicephala and Indian myna Acridotheres tristis largely promote xenogamy because stigma receptivity continues up to the second day of flower life. Since the two bird species implicated in pollination are not entirely nectarivorous, total dependence on them for pollination may not be an ideal strategy, and receiving pollen-collecting bees may help in the reproduction of H. isora. Floral damage caused by the red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer and by the blister beetle and the insect larvae is detrimental to H. isora reproduction.

We studied reproduction and offspring performance in relation to population size in the declining self-incompatible perennials Primula veris and Gentiana lutea. In both species, reproduction was strongly reduced in small populations, where plants produced fewer Seeds per fruit and per plant. Total seed mass per plant was higher in large populations, but individual seeds were smaller, indicating a tradeoff between seed number and size. Reproduction was depressed most strongly in populations consisting of less than c. 200 (P. veris) and c. 500 plants (G. lutea), respectively. 2. The inclusion of plant size (an integrated measure of habitat quality) in the statistical models did not change the relationships between fecundity and population size. Pollen limitation or inbreeding depression in small populations are therefore more likely explanations for these patterns than is habitat quality. 3. Germination rate and survival of seedlings in a common environment was not related to population size in either species, although P. veris developed into larger rosettes when seeds were derived from large populations. This suggests that inbreeding depression occurs in small populations of P. veris. 4. In a factorial fertilizer-by-competition experiment with P. veris, offspring from larger populations grew significantly larger and responded more strongly to fertilizer. For this declining species genetic deterioration as a result of habitat fragmentation may therefore aggravate the effects of environmental changes such as habitat eutrophication. 5. Our results suggest that small populations may face an increased short-term risk of extinction because of reduced reproduction, and an increased long-term risk because they are less able to respond to environmental changes.",Density; Fecundity; Genetic drift; Germination; Inbreeding depression; Plasticity; Pollinator limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342614963

The flowers are obligately out-crossed. Though they are hermaphroditic, out-crossing is enforced by self-incompatibility. Protandry of flowers is more a device to avoid stigma clogging. Geitonogamous pollen discounting is reduced by the staggered anther dehiscence and the consequent spreading of pollen on day1 and day2 of flower life which lasts four days. The style maintains growth for three days and is about 4 mm long by the third day of flower life when the stigma becomes receptive. Nectar is secreted on the four days of flower life but resorbed everyday by about 1100 h. Its sugar concentration is relatively low (4-18%). Bees and flies are dominant floral visitors collecting nectar and rarely pollen. Resorption of nectar forces the flower visitors to move en masse from one tree to another conspecific, thus promoting xenogamous pollination. Despite large floral display, pollinator density is very low, presumably due to precipitation during the flowering season. Natural fruit set is very low, and varies between 1% and 2% of total flower production as against 80% of fruit set realised in hand-pollinations. Such low fruit production is attributed to the lack of adequate pollinators.",Bees and flies; Cross-pollination; Nectar resorption; Protandry; Self-incompatibility; Terminalia tomentosa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343193236

Natural hybrid populations between the red-flowered Iris fulva and the blue-flowered Iris brevicaulis are found in southern Louisiana. The genetic structure of these populations reflects a lack of intermediate genotypes. We observed pollinator behaviour in an experimental array with five plants each of I. fulva, I. brevicaulis, their F1, and the first backcross generation in each direction, to obtain data on flower type preferences and transitions between flower types. The most abundant visitors were Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) and workers of the bumblebee Bombus pennsylvanicus. Hummingbirds visited I. fulva twice as often as I. brevicaulis and visited hybrids at intermediate frequencies. Bumblebee workers preferred the purple-flowered F1s and visited plants of I. fulva and the backcross to I. fulva more often than I. brevicaulis and its backcross. Overall, F1 flowers were visited most frequently. Both hummingbirds and bumblebees visited nearest neighbours in almost 80% of the interplant movements. This meant that a majority of movements were between different flower types, rather than between plants of the same type. Findings from the present study suggest that pollinator preference is not a major causal factor for the lack of intermediate genotypes in natural iris hybrid populations. Instead, pollinator behaviour in our array promoted mixed mating between flower types belonging to different pollination syndromes. However, owing to predominant nearest-neighbour visitation, the spatial distribution of parental and hybrid genotypes (in concert with pollinator behaviour) will have a strong influence on mating patterns and thus the genotypic structure and evolution of Louisiana iris hybrid zones.",Bumblebees; Hummingbirds; Louisiana irises; Natural hybridization; Nearest-neighbour visitation; Pollination; Pollinator preference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034001686

Recent studies suggest that foraging insects may use a perceptual mechanism akin to a search image to detect flowers, in a manner analogous to the way that predators search for prey. This has emerged as an alternative (but not mutually exclusive) explanation for flower constancy to that proposed by Darwin, who suggested that it may result from a limited ability to learning or remember the handling skills appropriate for particular flowers. However, search images are thought to be a mechanism for locating cryptic prey. Plants which are pollinated by animals have evolved brightly coloured flowers to attract the attention of their pollinators. It thus seems implausible to argue that flowers may actually be cryptic. One possible explanation for this apparent contradiction is that flowers are effectively cryptic when viewed against a background which contains many other flowers of similar colour. I present experimental evidence which suggests that a background of flowers of similar colour does reduce foraging efficiency of bumblebees, but that a background of dissimilarly coloured flowers has no effect. This I interpret as evidence that flowers may be cryptic, suggesting that pollinators may indeed use a search image in location of flowers. However, the relative importance of constraints on foragers' abilities to locate flowers versus their abilities to handle them as causes of flower constancy remain to be elucidated.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034096560

We also used indirect techniques (F(ST) analyses) to estimate gene flow rates among subdivisions of the study population and among five widely separated populations. Within the main study population limber pine exhibited a polymorphism level of 50%, observed heterozygosity of 0.159, and 2.36 alleles per polymorphic locus. Mountain populations were slightly more variable The main study population showed significant differentiation in allozymes among neighbouring subpopulations. The mean F(ST) was 0.031 and the gene flow rate among subpopulations was estimated as 7.8 migrants per generation. Among widely separated populations the mean F(ST) was 0.035 and the gene flow rate was estimated as 6.9 migrants per generation. The paternity analysis indicated a best estimate of 6.5% pollen immigration (minimum 1.1%) from populations 2 km to 100+ km away. For 4% of the seeds examined, paternity could be ascribed to a single tree in the study population. Fractional paternity and likelihood methods were used to estimate pollen dispersal distances for the remainder of the seeds. Mean pollen dispersal distance was estimated at 140 m using the fractional method, similar to results from the other techniques. This compares with a mean distance of 172 m between potential mates. These results suggest near-panmictic pollen dispersal over this population, which covers about 15 ha. The observed allozyme differences and surprisingly low estimates of among-subpopulation gene flow are ascribed to a probable restriction of gene dispersal by seeds.",Gene dispersal; Gene flow; Mating systems; Neighbourhood size; Paternity analysis; Pinus flexilis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034091971

The flowering behavior of buffelgrass is such that the stigmas are exserted from the floret prior to anthesis, which is referred to here as the protogynous interval. This investigation was conducted to determine the duration of the protogynous interval in 447 buffelgrass accessions and to ascertain stigma receptivity during the protogynous intervals. Protogynous intervals in a field nursery near College Station, TX, for all accessions ranged from 1 to 4 d. Six accessions with protogynous intervals ranging from 1 to 3 d were used to investigate stigma receptivity under both self- and cross-pollinated conditions in a greenhouse. Pollen germination and tube growth were observed with fluorescent microscopy at different time increments following pollination. Across all accessions, pollen germinated within 15 min of contacting the stigma, and pollen tubes grew to the micropyle within 2 to 6 h, depending on the accession and pollen source, Mean seed set ranged from 11 to 76% and from 22 to 80% among accessions following self-and cross-pollination, respectively.

Although considered to be hypoallergenic, numerous cases of allergies caused by Pinus pollen have been cited and different authors believe that its allergenicity should be studied in more depth. In the city of Vigo several patients have tested positive for Pinus pollen extracts in skin tests, some of them being mono-sensitive to such pollens. In order to ascertain the behaviour of Pinus pollen and its correlation to the main meteorological factors, we carried out an aerobiological study in the city of Vigo from 1995 to 1998 by using a Hirst active-impact volumetric sporetrap, model Lanzoni VPPS 2000, placed on the left bank of the Vigo estuary (42°14'15""N, 8°43'30""W). Pinus has high quantitative importance in the airborne pollen spectrum of the city. It is one of the best represented taxa constituting 13%-20% of the total annual pollen levels. The quantity of Pinus pollen present in the atmosphere of the city of Vigo throughout a year is 5751 grains (as the average for the sampled years), with a very long pollination period, from the middle of January until May. The maximum concentration was recorded in 1998 with 1105 grains/m3 on 3 March, a much greater value than those for the previous years. At the end of its pollination period there is usually a final increase in Pinus pollen concentrations coinciding with the pollination of Pinus silvestris, which are more abundant in mountainous areas far from the city. © ISB 2000.",Airborne pollen; Correlations; Meteorological factors; Pinus; Pollen concentrations; Pollinosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042138475

Its host specificity has been debated since early this century, when cross-inoculation experiments indicated the existence of host-specific lineages. Recently, on the basis of spore ultrastructure, all presumed host races were lumped within M. violaceum. To measure gene flow among natural populations of anther smuts from different host species, we used microsatellite variation at 5 loci among samples from 8 Silene, 2 Saponaria, 2 Dianthus and 1 Gypsophila species. Most of the 326 M. violaceum samples investigated originated from the Swiss Alps and close surroundings. Microsatellite variation revealed almost perfect isolation among anther smut fungi from different host species. In addition, differentiation was supported by the nonrandom distribution of null alleles among samples from different host species and host genera. Null alleles were most abundant in anther smut samples from non-Silene hosts. The resolution of genetic differentiation among anther smuts from different host species was highest in those from Silene species. Genetic relationships among samples as indicated by Neighbour-Joining analysis based on genetic distances are discussed with respect to host phylogeny and host ecology. One sample was identified as Ustilago gausseni because it had verrucose instead of reticulate spores and was collected from Silene italica. Neighbour-Joining analysis revealed that this sample was similar to the M. violaceum samples from other Silene host species. Therefore, our data question spore morphology as a reliable character for anther smut systematics.",Caryophyllaceae; Host races; Host-parasite specialization; Plant-pathogen; Pollinator-borne disease; Ustilago violacea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034003131

Population structure and genetic variability may represent important factors in a species' ability to adapt to global-scale environmental change without experiencing major alterations in current range limits. Genetic variation and structure in sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) were examine across three regions, between two stands within regions, and among four to five open-pollinated families within stands (total N = 547 genotypes) using 58 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Differences within open-pollinated families account for the largest portion of the total variation (29%), while differences among regions represent less than 2% of the total variation. Genetic diversity, as indicated by estimates of percent polymorphic loci, expected heterozygosity, fixation coefficients, and genetic distance, is greatest in the southern region, which consists of populations with the maximum potential risk due to climate change effects. The high level of genetic similarity (greater than 90%) among some genotypes suggests that gene flow is occurring among regions, stands, and families. High levels of genetic variation among families indicate that vegetational models designed to predict species' response to global-scale environmental change may need to consider the degree and hierarchical structure of genetic variation when making large-scale inferences.",Gene flow; Genetic variation; Global warming; Population structure; RAPDs; Sugar maple,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034104480

Under some circumstances, a negative genetic correlation between investment in stamens and investment in ovules or seeds is expected. Moreover, if fitness returns for investment in male and female function are different with respect to size, sex allocation theory predicts size-specific gender changes. We studied sex allocation and genetic variation for investment in stamens, ovules and seeds at both the flower and the plant level in a Dutch population of the wind-pollinated and predominantly outcrossing Plantago coronopus. Data on biomass of floral structures, stamens, ovules, seedset and seedweight were used to calculate the average proportion of reproductive allocation invested in male function. Genetic variation and (genetic) correlations were estimated from the greenhouse-grown progeny of maternal families, raised at two nutrient levels. The proportion of reproductive biomass invested in male function was high at flowering (0.86 at both nutrient levels) and much lower at fruiting (0.30 and 0.40 for the high and low nutrient treatment, respectively). Androecium and gynoecium mass exhibited moderately high levels of genetic variance, with broad-sense heritabilities varying from 0.35 to 0.56. For seedweight no genetic variation was detected. Significant among-family variation was also detected for the proportion of resources invested in male function at flowering, but not at fruiting. Phenotypic and broad-sense genetic correlations between androecium and gynoecium mass were positive. Even after adjusting for plant size, as a measure of resource acquisition, maternal families that invested more biomass in the androecium also invested more in the gynoecium. This is consistent with the hypothesis that genetic variation for resource acquisition may in part be responsible for the overall lack of a negative correlation between male and female function. Larger plants had a more female-biased allocation pattern, brought about by an increase in seedset and seedweight, whereas stamen biomass did not differ between small and large plants. These results are discussed in relation to size-dependent sex allocation theory (SDS). Our results indicate that the studied population harboured substantial genetic variation for reproductive characters.",Plantago coronopus; Reproductive characters; Sex allocation; Size-specific gender; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033998881

Sexual segregation may reduce self-pollination among flowers within inflorescences (geitonogamy), thereby increasing the pollen available for export to other plants. To assess these complementary roles we manipulated the simultaneously hermaphroditic (adichogamous) flowers of Eichhornia paniculata to produce ten-flowered inflorescences with either female above male flowers (female/male inflorescences) or male/female inflorescences, which competed for mating opportunities with five-flowered adichogamous inflorescences. Because of the upward movement of bumble-bees, selfing increased upward in adichogamous inflorescences (overall female selfing rate s?± s.e. = 0.320 ± 0.026). Female flowers of male/female inflorescences selfed less than flowers in corresponding positions in adichogamous inflorescences so s? fell to 0.135 ± 0.027. In contrast, all-female flowers of female/male inflorescences selfed similarly to upper flowers on adichogamous inflorescences, elevating s? (0.437 ± 0.043). During 1997, male/female inflorescences sired more outcrossed seeds than female/male or adichogamous inflorescences, whereas during 1994 flowers on male/female inflorescences received fewer visits than those of adichogamous inflorescences, reducing their outcross siring success. Hence, sexual segregation limits geitonogamy and enhances outcross siring success when it does not affect pollinator behaviour, illustrating the importance of both female and male function in inflorescence design.",Dichogamy; Geitonogamous self-pollination; Inflorescence design; Monoecy; Outcross siring success; Pollen discounting,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034701107

I tested this hypothesis using experimental populations of Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae) that contained different proportions of tetraploids and diploids. Fitness, measured as total seed production over the entire flowering season, was calculated from a census of flower number and estimates of ovule number per flower and proportion of seed set per fruit. The fitness of tetraploids relative to diploids was frequency dependent, increasing from 0.4, when tetraploids were rare, to 0.7 when at 50% and 1.15 when they were in the majority (67%). This pattern exists because of a negative relationship between tetraploid frequency and seed set per fruit in diploids. Seed set in tetraploids was independent of cytotype frequency. The frequency-independent effect in tetraploids reflects higher assortative mating, partly because of non-random patterns of bee visitation. Bees visited a disproportionately high number of diploid inflorescences; however, the proportion of successive flights between tetraploids increased above random expectations as the frequency of tetraploids decreased. These results provide the first experimental test of frequency-dependent fitness in diploid-polyploid mixtures and suggest an important role for more gradual, population processes governing the evolution of polyploidy in natural populations.",Fireweed; Frequency dependence; Phenology; Pollinator visitation; Polyploid; Reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034615027

The historical biogeography (20,000 years before present to the present) of the desert-limited plant, creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), is remarkably complete. This history coupled with the distribution pattern of its bee fauna suggests pollen specialization for creosote bush pollen has evolved repeatedly among bees in the Lower Sonoran and Mojave deserts. In these highly xeric, floristically depauperate environments, species of specialist bees surpass generalist bees in diversity, biomass and abundance. The ability of specialist bees to facultatively remain in diapause through resource-poor years and to emerge synchronously with host plant bloom in resource-rich years probably explains their ecological dominance and persistence in these areas. Repeated origins of pollen specialization to one host plant where bloom occurs least predictably is a counter-example to prevailing theories that postulate such traits originate where the plant grows best and blooms most reliably. Hostplant synchronization, a paucity of alternative floral hosts, or flowering attributes of creosote bush alone or in concert may account for the diversity of bee specialists that depend on this plant instead of nutritional factors or chemical coevolution between floral rewards and the pollinators they have evolved to attract.",Biogeography; Environmental variation; Foraging; Insect-plant interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034615126

Rehd were investigated in detail. The results showed that mature pollen was one-celled, irregular in shape, nonsaccate, and the surface was covered with orbicules. When pollen became hydrated, the intine swelled and the exine bursted. The exine usually remained on the surface of water or on the pollination drop all the time, while the rest portion of the pollen sank into the drop of water or the pollination drop. In the late August, the down-curved female buds could be observed in the field trees. The downturning of the female buds was an characteristic feature discriminating from the vegetative buds. At this stage ovular primordium was present in the female bud with a dome-shaped nucellar primordium encircled by a rudimentary integument. The integument grew fast and overgrew the nucellus. In the March of the following year, the ovule formed a micropylar canal about 1 000 ?m in length, 200-300 ?m in width. Except the micropyle, the other part of the ovule was enclosed by 20-25 scales. During the early stage of the ovule development, the nucellar surface clearly showed cell configuration; but a membrane-like structure covering the nucellar apex appeared in the late stage of the ovule development, and subsequently broke down with nucellar cell disintegration before pollen shedding. The disintegrated cell products might partake in the formation of the pollination drop. Before and during pollination, the nucellar cells contained abundant mitochondria, endospermic reticulum and dictysomes with vesicles; the plasma membrane was undulated and there was no accumulation of electron-dense substances in the pericytoplasm. Pollination drops usually occurred at night, and disappeared by noon in the field tree. 15 days before pollination, the in vitro ovules from the field trees already had the capability of producing pollination drops, which could last for 4-5 days indoors. However, after these drops received pollen, they did not withdraw noticeably compared with the unpollinated ones. The retraction of the pollination drop was presumed not to be a nonmetabolic outcome but rather a result of evaporation.",Nucellar ultrastructure; Ovule development; Pollen; Pollination drop; Taxus chinensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0012181006

Plants typically developed more slowly in space and often failed at the reproductive phase. Short-duration experiments on the Space Shuttle showed that early stages in the reproductive process could occur normally in microgravity, so we sought a long-duration opportunity to test gravity's role throughout the complete life cycle. During a 122-d opportunity on the Mir space station, full life cycles were completed in microgravity with Brassica rapa L. in a series of three experiments in the Svet greenhouse. Plant material was preserved in space by chemical fixation, freezing, and drying, and then compared to material preserved in the same way during a high-fidelity ground control. At sampling times 13 d after planting, plants on Mir were the same size and had the same number of flower buds as ground control plants. Following hand-pollination of the flowers by the astronaut, siliques formed. In microgravity, siliques ripened basipetally and contained smaller seeds with less than 20% of the cotyledon cells found in the seeds harvested from the ground control. Cytochemical localization of storage reserves in the mature embryos showed that starch was retained in the spaceflight material, whereas protein and lipid were the primary storage reserves in the ground control seeds. While these successful seed-to-seed cycles show that gravity is not absolutely required for any step in the plant life cycle, seed quality in Brassica is compromised by development in microgravity.","Brassica (development, spaceflight) Microgravity; Seed; Spaceflight; Starch",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034013603

We found that flower senescence is advanced by deposition of pollen grains on the stigma but that there exists a minimum longevity (13.64 days in 1996 and 12.20 days in 1997) during which the flower never abscises, even if it is pollinated with a sufficient number of pollen grains. 2. We suggest that this floral longevity does not exist to benefit the female function, because the time needed for corolla abscission reacting to ovule fertilization was not so long and the female function was completed within about 3 days. 3. Flowers of E. japonicum do not react to pollen removal, as shown by the fact that anther removal experiments did not affect floral longevity. However, it would be advantageous to have some duration of longevity which benefits male success such that most of pollen grains can be expected to be exported. The duration needed to disperse most pollen grains of a flower was about 12 days, very close to the minimum floral longevity. 4.

Unpollinated wild-type Madrigal (MA/wt) and Cuarenteno (CU/wt) ovaries degenerated, but GA3 application induced parthenocarpic fruit growth.

Pollinated MA/wt and parthenocarpic MA/pat-2 ovary development was negated by paclobutrazol, and this inhibitory effect was counteracted by GA3. The main GAs of the early-13-hydroxylation pathway (GA1, GA3, GA8, GA19, GA20, GA29, GA44, GA53, and, tentatively, GA81) and two GAs of the non-13-hydroxylation pathway (GA9 and GA34) were identified in MA/wt ovaries by gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring. GAs were quantified in unpollinated ovaries at flower bud, pre-anthesis, and anthesis. In unpollinated MA/pat-2 and CU/pat-2 ovaries, the GA20 content was much higher (up to 160 times higher)and the GA19 content was lower than in the corresponding non-parthenocarpic ovaries. The application of an inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases suggested that GA20 is not active per se.

Movements by bumblebees Bombus lapidarius were studied in arrays of plants of oil-seed rape Brassica napus cv Westar. In the arrays, plants were arranged into either a uniformly dispersed configuration or a patchily dispersed configuration. 2. Progress across an array was measured as the distance bumblebees had moved away from an original plant location after eight subsequent, successive plant visits. Movements were analysed in units of both metres and inter-plant spaces. In both units, bumblebees progressed more slowly across patchily dispersed arrays. 3. Plant dispersion had a detectable effect on certain components of bees' individual inter-plant moves (e.g. move length in metres) but not on others (e.g. mean turning angle). In some cases, the effects of aggregation on the components of individual moves were probably too small to detect statistically and only emerged in their cumulative effect on bees' progress. 4. Over short sequences of plant visits, bumblebees revisited plants rarely, but the frequency of revisits was almost twice as high in patchy arrays as in uniform arrays, and economic penalties may result from foraging among highly aggregated plants. 5. The effects of plant dispersion on pollinator movements detected in this study are unlikely to have a major impact on pollen transfer in B. napus because differences in pollinator progress only emerged after several successive inter-plant flights away from a potential pollen source, by which time the limited extent of pollen carryover in this species means that fertilisations from the source plant would be very rare.",Bombus; Brassica; Dispersion; Foraging; Spatial heterogeneity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033993490

Somatic embryogenesis occurred principally when using the combinations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid plus kinetin. Using a-naphthaleneacetic acid or 6-benzylaminopurine reduced the incidence of somatic embryogenesis. Conversely, formation of cotyledon-like structures, leaves, shoots and roots was enhanced. The addition of 0.1 mg l-1 3-indolebutyric acid to the inductive medium was beneficial to the induction of somatic embryogenesis. In a few cases, secondary somatic embryos formed and well-developed somatic embryos germinated. Of the three cultivars tested, 'Scharo' was less responsive than 'Gerema' and 'Schattenmorelle' when cultured under equivalent conditions.

We examined 27 populations ranging in size from 9 to over 75,000 flowering ramets in two regions of the state of Iowa (eastcentral and northwest) in 1993 and 1994. We collected flowers from each population and scored them for pollen arrival to stigmas and number of pollen tubes. We collected fruiting ramets from each population at the end of the Phlox growing season and scored them for height, biomass, and reproductive variables, including the number of flowers initiated and opened and the number of capsules initiated and matured. In both years, population size was significantly correlated with the number of capsules matured per ramet. Differences between populations in capsule production were set primarily at the pollination stage. In 1993, pollen arrival to stigmas was significantly lower than in 1994 and was correlated with population size in eastcentral Iowa populations, indicating that lower reproduction in small populations that year was at least partially due to inadequate amounts of pollen being moved. In 1993, weather conditions likely depressed pollinator activity, but absolute capsule formation was high because of high flower production per ramet and high population densities. In 1994, when pollen arrival to stigmas was relatively high and unrelated to population size, outcross pollen movement was greater in larger populations. Increased efficacy of outcross pollen movement in 1994 may have resulted from lower flower production and less dense populations forcing greater pollinator movement between ramets or from variation between years in fine-scale spatial genetic substructuring of populations. Our results indicate that the viability of Phlox pilosa can be best ensured by protecting and creating populations of at least 1000-2000 flowering ramets.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034075051

The full-sibs segregated into four compatibility classes, suggesting that late acting self-incompatibility is controlled by a single gene (S- locus). Crosses between plants sharing one or both alleles at the S-locus are incompatible. An additional diallel cross was done among full-sib progeny from a cross of a self-sterile and a self-fertile plant.

Among 91 saplings analysed, 24 (26%) had both parents, 31 (34%) had one parent and 36 (40%) had no parent within the watershed. The proportion of genes in saplings inherited from the adults within the watershed was 43%, and therefore 57% were from outside the site, indicating active gene exchange across the watershed area. Average distance between parents and saplings (264.6 ± 135.3 (SD) m) was significantly smaller than that of pairs randomly chosen between adults and saplings (436.7 ± 203.0 (SD) m). The distance of pollen movement inferred from the distance between the two parents of each sapling ranged from 3.2 m to 540 m with an average of 131.1 m ± 121.1 m (SD). Because 34% (= 31/91) of saplings had only one parent within the watershed, the estimate of average pollen movement must be smaller than the actual one.

White flowers set less fruit than magenta flowers and mutants with flat petal epidermal cells set less fruit than flowers with conical cells. Here we analyse the causal pathway underlying this phenomenon through a study of floral characteristics and bee behaviour. Results indicate that bees recognized plants with magenta conical-celled flowers at a distance and did not approach white flowers or magenta flat-celled flowers so frequently. Petal cell shape interacted with colour in determining whether an approaching bee landed on a flower within a plot and whether a bee landing on a flower would probe it. The intrafloral temperature of flowers with conical petal cells was shown to increase with solar irradiance, unlike the intrafloral temperature of flowers with fiat petal cells. The difference in fruit set may reflect pollinator discrimination between genotypes as a consequence of the effect of intrafloral temperature on nectar quality and quantity.",Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon); Epidermal cell shape; Intrafloral temperature; Mutation; Nectar; Pigmentation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034047918

It apparently shares this peculiarity among aroids only with the distantly related genus Arisarum. In addition to previous records from Japan and North America, systematic collections from nine Arisaema species during several expeditions in the Himalayas in Nepal showed that, although other less efficient insect groups may participate, the nematoceran families Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae are the principal pollen vectors; they best fit the pollination apparatus of the mainly (para)dioecious kettle trap blossoms. A total of 16 fungus gnat genera (both Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae) comprising 47 identified species (among them one genus and 22 species new to science) were observed. Usually members of more than one taxon are attracted per Arisaema species, and both sexes of gnats are involved. Visitor sets differed to some degree, depending on host species, area, and altitude; they do not, however, represent the complete fungus gnat fauna of a region. Relevant traits of growth habit and inflorescence structure are surveyed, and a detailed description of the pollination process is given, based on observations made on specimens cultivated in Europe, where vicariant fungus gnats are the pollinators. Attraction is deceptive by mimicking olfactory, visual and tactile cues characteristic of fungi where the gnat sexes normally meet and females oviposit. Odours produced by osmophores (the spadix appendage or spathe tip) play the most important part. The identified volatile compounds are mainly short-chained aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols. Flagelliform osmophores of some species, up to several dm long, reach the substrate and serve as conducting paths. Gnats become imprisoned when they inadvertently slide down the inner wall of the spathe tube. Its surface including the spadix is covered with ablative wax particles that inactivate the insects' tarsal pulvilli. This gliding device, in some species reinforced by zones of imbricate papillae, is irreversible, and no movements of floral parts allowing escape via the spathe mouth occur. Anthesis lasts several weeks. In the male spathes, victims are forced to wade through the pollen masses that have accumulated at the spathe's bottom; there they find an exit hole formed by local gaping of the spathe rims. The female spathes lack such an aperture. After potentially depositing pollen on the stigmas during their efforts to escape, gnats are detained until death. Except for an autogamous subspecies of A. flavum Schott, the few monoecious taxa of Arisaema are protogynous and possibly self-sterile. In monoecious A. tortuosum (Wall.)Schott, exit forming is delayed until pollen release. Three Arisarum species that are suspected to deviate in their floral syndrome are discussed along with araceous genera possessing similar one-way pitfall mechanisms.

Flowers of L. maritima were visited during the 2 years of study (1996 and 1997) by more than 50 pollinator species belonging to about 30 families of disparate taxonomic affiliation, notably ants and flies. There was significant seasonal variability in insect abundance and type. Ants, especially Camponotus micans (Formicidae), visited the flowers of L. maritima in summer, representing 81.2% of the visits during this season. This ant species acted as a pollinator of L. maritima, with flowers visited exclusively by ants producing significantly more seeds than flowers from which all pollinators were excluded, whereas flowers visited by only winged insects did not differ from self-pollination. Ant-pollinated flowers produced seeds with a germination rate comparable to the other treatments. Moreover, seedlings from these seeds emerged as fast, and survived at the same rate as controls. Consequently, both ants and winged insects had similar overall effects on host plant recruitment probability (0.6 and 0.7% of initial ovules produced flowering offspring, respectively), a result similar to that of open-pollinated flowers (1.0%). This study demonstrated that the overall effectiveness of the ant C. micans as a summer pollinator of L. maritima was as high as that of other winged insects, contributing not only to the seed production of this crucifer but also to the recruitment of new flowering offspring.",Ant pollination; Cruciferae; Female fitness; Pollinator effectiveness; Progeny performance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17544393602

Pollen is an important source of nitrogen for specialist flower-feeding mammals in Australia. However, its value for a generalist rodent species such as A. namaquensis had not previously been assessed. Casein is often used as the source of protein in studies of wildlife nutrition, as the use of a single purified protein makes it easier for researchers to compare their results with those from other studies. The apparent digestibility of casein was significantly higher than that of pollen, 75.6 % vs 58.4 %, but the biological value was significantly lower, 39 % vs 49 %. As a result of the lower biological value the truly digestible maintenance nitrogen requirements of A. namaquensis on the casein diet were almost double those on the pollen diet (158 mg N/day vs 66 mg N/day).

Field observations showed that reproductive success was very low, because only 3% of the marked flowers developed fruits in 1996 and none in 1997 and 1998. Several experiments were performed to investigate the reasons for reproductive failure in this species. Pollen viability was on average 85%, showing that reproductive failure is not due to poor pollen quality. Two hand-pollination experiments showed that all flowers are potentially able to develop fruits throughout the flowering period, suggesting that no aberration occurs in sporogenesis, fertilization or post-zygote processes in R. aculeatus and that low reproductive success in the field occurs because of lack of pollination. This hypothesis was tested by looking for pollen on the stigmatic surface of randomly sampled flowers, but without success. Moreover, the bodies of insects trapped in the proximity of the female plants were carefully checked for pollen but none was found. The number of pollen grains produced per flower is lower than that reported for wind-pollinated species. Nevertheless, we showed with empirical probes that the possibility of wind pollination cannot be ruled out. The breeding system and reproductive characteristics of R. aculeatus seem to match the traits of the sclerophyllous taxa remnants of the tropical Tertiary, flora. Moreover, the climatic fluctuation of the Quaternary, and the establishment of the mediterranean climate might have changed the conditions of a good pollination process. At present, the low sexual reproduction of R. aculeatus is due to the lack of pollen transport. Within a population of R. aculeatus, genetic variability is revealed by seeds from the few developed fruits which have been shown to be viable. However, maintenance of the individual plants in the population relies on the resprouting capacity of the species in question.

Using a plant-pollinator system as a model, I tested the prediction the presence of a competitor for pollination influences the strength and/or direction of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. I measured phenotypic selection via female fitness on five floral traits of Ipomopsis aggregata in seven populations. Four contained only conspecifics (I only) and three also contained the competitor Castilleja linariaefolia (C + I). Directional selection via fruits/plant and conspecific pollen deposited/flower on corolla length was positive and significantly stronger in C + I populations. This difference in selection was apparently driven by interpopulation variation in the degree to which reproduction of I. aggregata was pollen limited. Consistent with expectations of interspecific competition, I. aggregata plants in C + I populations received less conspecific pollen per flower and set fewer seeds per fruit and fruits per plant than those in I only populations. Ipomopsis aggregata's corollas were also significantly longer in C + I populations, suggesting that there had been a response to a similar selective regime in past generations. Phenotypic correlations between corolla length and width, which determine the variation in I. aggregata's flower shape, were significantly weaker in C + I populations. These data suggest that competition for pollination can influence the strength of selection on and patterns of correlations among floral traits of I. aggregata. If I. aggregata populations with and without competitors for pollination are linked by gene flow, then measuring selection in competitive and noncompetitive environments maybe necessary to accurately predict how floral traits will evolve.",Competition; Ipomopsis aggregata; Natural selection; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033694418

Here we measured the effects of a nectar-robbing bumblebee, Bombus occidentalis, on realized male reproductive success (seeds sired) in a hummingbird-pollinated plant, Ipomopsis aggregata. To determine the effects of nectar robbing on paternity, we used a series of experimental populations of plants containing a known allozyme marker. In each population, we experimentally controlled the levels of nectar robbing on each I. aggregata plant by cutting a hole in the corolla with dissecting scissors and removing nectar with a micro-capillary tube. We measured hummingbird-pollinator foraging behavior and fruit and seed production (maternal function) for each plant. We then genotyped seeds for the allozyme marker to determine the number of seeds sired by plants with known levels of robbing. Heavy nectar robbing (> 80% of flowers robbed) significantly reduced the number of seeds sired, as well as the number of seeds produced due to pollinator avoidance of heavily robbed plants. Total plant reproduction, both male and female contributions, were reduced by 50% due to high levels of robbing. To date, no other studies have measured the effects of nectar robbing on realized male function (number of seeds sired). Ours is the first study to demonstrate that robbing can simultaneously decrease realized male reproductive success as well as female reproductive success, and that the effects are incurred indirectly through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants.","Bombus occidentalis; Hummingbird-pollinator behavior; Ipomopsis aggregata; Male function; Nectar robbing, effect on plant reproductive success; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Colorado, USA); Siring success",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033850555

This study tests the prediction that L. latifolia flowers exposed to pollination regimes differing in pollinator composition should differ in their expected contribution to population recruitment in the field, as measured in terms of established seedlings, because of differences in seed production, progeny quality, or both. Using a randomized complete block design, two pollination regimes were induced during a 3-wk period on each of 15 L. latifolia plants by alternately exposing flowers in the two halves of each shrub to natural pollinators during two nonoverlapping diurnal periods (0930-1630, MD regime; dawn to 0930 and 1630 to dusk, R regime). The two pollination regimes differed in pollinator composition. The importance as flower visitors of butterflies and small bees was greater during the MD regime, which was also characterized by higher flower visitation rate and higher probability of visitation per time unit of individual flowers. MD flowers set proportionally more fruits, and each fruit contained more seeds, than R flowers. Seed production per inflorescence was also greater in MD than in R half-plants. Seeds from the MD and R regimes did not differ significantly in either mean mass, probability of germination under laboratory conditions, or probability of producing a seedling when planted in a greenhouse. When planted in the field, seeds originating from MD flowers had a greater probability of producing a seedling than those originating from R flowers, the difference being greatest where soil characteristics were most adverse for early seedling growth. In the field, MD and R seedlings did not differ in post-emergence survival rate and size of eventual survivors. The estimated average probability (± 1 SE) of one ovule eventually producing one third-year, established seedling in the home environment was significantly greater for MD (0.0192 ± 0.0041) than for R (0.0085 ± 0.0020) flowers. This demographic advantage of MD ovules was mainly accounted for by the greater seedling emergence rate of MD seeds, and only secondarily by the greater fruit- and seed-set of MD flowers. Observed patterns may be explained by a combination of increased outcrossing derived from the greater relative importance of small bees and butterflies as pollinators, and increased gametophytic competition resulting from increased overall visitation rates to individual flowers during the MD pollination regime. This study suggests that even relatively minor differences in pollinator composition and abundance may have a measurable demographic impact on plant populations.",Generalized linear mixed models; Insect pollination; Labiatae; Lavandula latifolia; Mediterranean habitats; Pollination consequences; Pollinator composition; Seed production; Seedling recruitment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033960890

Pollen limitation was common under natural conditions, and S. sachalinensis relied more on insect pollination for seed production than S. miyabeana. Meteorological factors such as precipitation and hours of sunshine during the flowering season influenced the potential reproductive activity of the willow between years. In the wet and cloudy spring of 1996, clones which obtained high seed set depended more on insect pollination for both species, whereas in the dry and sunny spring of 1997, such clones depended more on wind pollination for S. miyabeana.

The work was carried out during three flowering seasons (1993-1995) in a Swedish population. Fitness was estimated as the number of pollinia removed (male fitness) and fruits produced (female fitness). Targets and patterns of selection were compared between years and sex functions by the use of multiple linear regression (including correlational selection estimates, i.e., of combination of traits), analysis of covariance, and projection pursuit regression (PPR). Results from the nonparametric surface-fitting-method PPR showed that selection was mostly linear, thus justifying the use of the parametric methods. In all study years, male and female fitness were highest in plants with many flowers. This reflects that flower number sets an upper limit to fitness and that a large inflorescence attracts more pollinators. In 1994, the summer was dry and the average spur length of P. bifolia was shorter than in the other years. In this year, male and female fitness were positively related to spur length, apparently because the spur of short-spurred plants was somewhat too short relative to the tongue length of the local pollinator for optimal pollen export and import. Additionally, the dry weather in 1994 caused a tendency for correlational selection, which was not found in the other years of study. Among small individuals (apparently more sensitive to drought than large ones), early-flowering plants had higher male and female fitness. The results show that patterns of selection may vary both between years and between sex functions in perennial hermaphroditic plants.

Nearly all females continued to nest at shelters that were moved short (0-3 m) distances. Moves of intermediate distances (135-235 m) resulted in considerable (30-76%) bee loss (dispersal), and many females flew back to the original nesting site. At long distances (3-240 km), dispersal was higher (63-78%) and no bees were seen hovering at the original site. Moving distance was correlated positively with dispersal and with orientation (zigzagging) flights made by females when they first exited their nests after the moves. The addition or removal of supplementary visual landmarks (2 by 1.5-m banner with colored patterns) at the nesting shelter did not affect dispersal rates. Bees appeared to respond to supplementary landmarks but used other signals as primary orientation cues.

Here, we outline its implications in the context of bee- and bird-adapted species of Penstemon and Keckiella (Scrophulariaceae). PPT models the optimal schedule of pollen presentation, based on the frequency of visits by pollinators, and the capacities of those pollinators to remove and deposit pollen. High visitation rates, high removal and low deposition all favor plants that present pollen in many small doses. Dosing is achieved through gradual opening of anthers and through anthers opening only narrowly. We hypothesize that bees have higher rates of removal and lower rates of deposition than birds; therefore, bee-pollinated species should have anthers that open more gradually and less completely than bird-pollinated species. Before presenting preliminary results that affirm this prediction, we critically discuss the characterization of species by pollination syndrome. PPT sheds new light on why plants may specialize on particular pollinators. Stebbins' most effective pollinator can be recast as the pollinator that deposits more of the pollen that it removes, thereby making other visitors into conditional parasites. Pollinator shifts might occur when a pollinator with low removal and high deposition becomes abundant; the plants would then be selected to discourage their previous pollinators who are now parasites. Bird-pollination may favor anthers that open quickly and widely, thereby making bees wasteful parasites. Bee-pollination may favor anthers that open slowly and narrowly, thereby making birds ineffective pollinators. In paired comparisons of closely related species, the hummingbird-visited species were redder, had narrower or longer floral tubes, more exserted anthers and stigmas, less pronounced landing platforms, more inclined orientation, produced more nectar of a lower concentration, and had anthers that dehisce faster and more extensively.","Anther; Bee; Dehiscence; Hummingbird; Keckiella; Penstemon, pollen deposition; Pollen removal; Pollinator shifts",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033867653

Within the genus Grevillea, mating systems are potentially complex. They may vary among species and among populations within a species, reflecting variation in pollinator behaviour and diversity ('potential' mating systems) and in breeding system (the 'preferred' mating system). We used a combination of pollinator observations, pollination experiments and electrophoretic analysis of seed from open pollinations, to examine variation in potential and preferred mating systems in two populations of each of two 'spider-flowered' Grevillea species: G. mucronulata (visited by honeyeaters and honeybees, although only birds effected pollen removal and transfer) and G. sphacelata (visited only by honeybees, which made frequent contact with pollen and stigmas). Almost all observed bird and insect foraging bouts on either species involved movements among inflorescences within plants or among inflorescences on closely neighbouring plants. On the basis of these data, the mating system was predicted to involve a high level of selfing or inbreeding. However, the pollination experiment revealed that both species were highly self-incompatible and showed a clear preference for outcross pollen in mate-choice experiments. For both species, fruit set through autogamy was lower than 0.7% and fruit set from self-pollinations was always significantly lower than for outcross pollinations (0-11% cf. 25-33% for G. mucronulata and 0% cf. 4.2-8.8% for G. sphacelata). Allozyme studies revealed that genotypes in open-pollinated seeds on 20 G. mucronulata and 20 G. sphacelata plants were surprisingly uniform, best explained by outcrossed matings between close neighbours. We found little between-population variation in any aspect of the mating system for either species. These studies reveal that the preferred mating system of the plant and the pattern of pollinator behaviour interact to determine the mating system in a population, emphasising the need for a multifaceted investigation of mating systems, especially in predicting the fates of populations that have pollination systems altered by disturbance, small size, isolation and introduced species such as the honeybee.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033911854

Different developmental stages responded differently to the various temperature regimes. Fluctuating temperatures averaging 22°C significantly shortened the dormant prepupal stage, and, as a result, bees developed faster than at the equivalent constant temperatures.

In other words, pollination is abiotic and occurs via the fluid media, not an animal vector. Whereas some early concepts considered abiotic pollination to be largely a stochastic phenomenon, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that wind pollination (i.e. anemophily) and water pollination (i.e. hydrophily) have deterministic features and are sophisticated fluid dynamic solutions to the problem of pollen release, dispersal, and capture. An abiotic pollination syndrome is defined in which there is spatial or temporal separation of carpellate and staminate flowers, which are drab, a reduction in perianth parts, stigmas and anthers are exposed to the fluid, and typically unclumped pollen may be produced in large amounts. Separate pollination syndromes are defined for anemophilous (i.e. wind-pollinated), ephydrophilous (i.e. surface-pollinated), and hydrophilous (i.e. submarine-pollinated) plants. Distinctions are based on habitat and physical conditions for pollination, pollen size, shape, and ultrastructure, morphology and ultrastructure of stigmas, and outcrossing rates. For example, anemophilous pollen are spherical and small, ephydrophilous pollen are spherical or reniform and large, while hydrophilous pollen are filiform (i.e. filamentous) or functionally filiform.

In the obligate mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths, selective abortion of flowers that receive many moth eggs or receive poor pollen load has been suggested as a mechanism that can prevent evolution of excessive exploitation by moths. Using controlled pollinations, varying pollen amount and source, we asked whether variation in pollination quality of the magnitude seen among moths affects patterns of selective abortion. Pollination experiments in two Yucca filamentosa populations revealed that both pollen quantity (large/small) and quality (self/one-outcross/two-outcross donors) affected fruit retention, seed set, and seedling growth rate. A pollen load larger than that typically provided by moths increased fruit retention. Outcrossed flowers were selectively retained to fruit, and flowers receiving a mixed outcross load were selectively retained over single-outcross flowers in one population. Seed set per fruit was significantly lower with a small pollen load, and lower when a single outcross source was used than in self or mixed outcross treatments. Outcross seeds germinated at a greater frequency and produced plants that grew faster than those that resulted from self-pollination, yielding a cumulative inbreeding depression of 0.73-0.81. Early fruit abortion is a major mortality factor to the yucca moth's progeny, and the female can increase retention by providing high-quality pollinations. Nonetheless, individual pollen loads are usually below levels that provide higher probability of retention, and commonly observed geitonogamous pollinations also appear to conflict with expected strong selection on moths to provide pollinations that give high retention probability. Other factors, such as combined visits by multiple females, floral position effects on retention, and possible costs of moth movement among plants, may interact with the pollination-mediated effects in molding female behavior. These factors do not diminish the potential of selective abortion to promote evolutionary stability of the interaction as they do not provide the moth with a mechanism to circumvent selective abortion.",Fruit retention; Mutualism; Pollen load; Pollination; Pollinator behavior; Progeny performance; Seed quality; Selective abortion; Tegeticula; Yucca; Yucca moth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033948291

Most pollen proteins are likely to be enzymes that function during pollen tube growth and subsequent fertilization, but the vast range of protein quantity may not reflect only pollen-pistil interactions. Because numerous vertebrate and invertebrate floral visitors consume pollen for protein, protein content may influence floral host choice. Additionally, many floral visitors pollinate their host plants. If protein content influences pollinator visitation, then pollinators are hypothesized to select for increased protein content of host plants. We analyzed or gleaned from the literature crude pollen protein concentrations of 377 plant species from 93 plant families. Using this database, we compared pollen protein concentration with (1) pollination mode, (2) pollen collection by bees, and (3) distance from stigma to ovule, after accounting for phylogeny through paired phylogenetic comparisons and a nested ANOVA including taxonomic rank. We found that pollen protein concentrations were highly conserved within plant genera, families, and divisions. We found that bees did not collect pollen that was unusually rich in protein, whether they pollinated or merely robbed their host plant. Plant species with vibratile pollination systems, which require visitation by pollen-collecting bees in order to transfer pollen, tended to have very protein-rich pollen, but it was not clear whether this was due to plant enhancement of pollinator rewards or to the possession of very small pollen grains. We found that zoophilous species were not statistically richer in pollen protein than anemophilous species after accounting for phylogeny, although the three most species-rich anemophilous clades surveyed were generally poor in protein. Plant genera hosting specialist pollen-collecting bees did not have particularly protein-rich pollen. Both mass of protein per pollen grain and pollen grain volume were correlated with stigma-ovule distance. We suggest that the need for growing pollen tubes probably plays a more important role in determining pollen protein content than rewarding pollinators.",Anemophilous; Pollen protein; Pollen volume; Pollination; Pollinator reward; Style length; Zoophilous,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033740577

As part of a larger study on the effects of changes in land use on fen grassland vegetation, factors influencing the seed set of a short-lived, endangered wetland plant, Pedicularis palustris, were studied. We conducted field pollination experiments in one large and one small population. To investigate the effect of pollen source on seed set, individual flowers of caged plants were left unpollinated or were pollinated with pollen from the same flower, the same population or another population. To study pollen limitation and flower display, whole plants were subjected to pollinator exclosure, hand pollination or natural pollination. Self-compatibility was high, but differed between populations (61% and 97% of seed set after cross-pollination within populations). Cross-pollination between populations did not significantly alter seed number per capsule. Pollinator exclosure resulted in a very low seed set (< 15% of natural seed set), despite high self-compatibility. The most likely explanations for high self-compatibility in combination with low autofertility are geitonogamy as reproductive assurance, selective neutrality of self-compatibility and phylogenetic constraints. Because of low autofertility, the seed set in P. palustris depends on pollinators. In the study populations, natural pollination was clearly sufficient for maximum seed production per plant, but seed set per capsule was significantly pollen-limited in the smaller population. Plants in this population also had a higher maximum percentage of simultaneously open flowers than those of the large population (31% vs. 13%), while flower longevity was generally extended without pollination. It is concluded that P. palustris may influence pollinator behaviour and therefore the risk of pollen limitation by flower display. P. palustris showed a flexible reaction to differing pollination regimes without losses in overall seed set in the study populations.",Autofertility; Field pollination experiment; Flower display; Pollen limitation; Population persistence; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033822763

We studied interactions between an epacridaceous plant (the honey bush, Richea scoparia) and a lizard (the snow skink, Niveoscincus microlepidotus) near the summit of Mount Wellington, Tasmania. The lizards gain access to the plant's nectar by tearing the fused petals (the calyptra) from the flower, thus exposing the plant's reproductive organs. Snow skinks forage selectively on flowers with higher-than-average nectar content, suggesting that this behaviour has evolved in response to plant characteristics. Lizard foraging may benefit R. scoparia, because calyptra remain attached unless a lizard tears the flower open. Our experiments demonstrated that the lizard's calyptra removal dramatically increased the plant's seed release. In 60 fruits from flowers with their calyptra intact, no seeds at all were released. However, 57 out of 60 (87%) fruits from flowers with their calyptra removed by the lizards successfully released their seeds. This system appears to involve reciprocal evolutionary changes in the interacting species (behaviour in the lizards and reproductive morphology in the plant). Thus the system seems to provide an unusual case of coevolution. (C) 2000 The Linnean Society of London.",Coevolution; Lizard foraging; Pollination and seed setting,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033787329

These compounds are being extensively tested for control of forest-feeding lepidopterous insects in North America; optical brighteners may thus become a common ingredient in commercial baculovirus formulations in the near future. Many flower species use UV signals to attract insects and to direct them to the nectaries. We examined a possible consequence of field applications of optical brighteners: their effects on the ability of pollinators to find and handle flowers. In field studies carried out in Mexico and the United Kingdom on three different flower species, application of dilute (0.1% or 1%) concentrations of the optical brightener Tinopal CBS reduced recruitment of bees to flowers. Bees that approached flowers were less likely to land and feed on flowers treated with Tinopal than on controls. On one plant species, Trifolium repens, the time taken for bees to handle inflorescences was longer following applications of Tinopal. It seems that this optical brightener may both reduce recruitment of insects to flowers and interfere with their ability to locate rewards. Field-scale applications could reduce pollination of crops, weeds, and wildflowers and adversely affect bee populations. These possibilities should be examined in more detail before widespread applications of these compounds to the environment are made.

It usually divides the corolla into two compartments, enclosing the main nectar bulk behind two adjacent filament bands. Four independent floral characters are involved in the structure of the filament curtain: a fusion of the filaments, decurrent filaments along the corolla wall, a slanting border between the synstapetal and apostapetal corolla regions (i.e. stamen corolla tube and corolla tube s.s.), and geniculate lower, lateral corolla lobe traces at this border. The distribution of a filament curtain within Acanthaceae suggests an enlarged tribe Ruellieae s.l., including Louteridieae and Trichanthereae, excluding subtribe Barleriinae, and raises a question mark as to the systematic position of the genera Calacanthus, Glossochilus, Lankesteria and Whitfieldia. The evolutionary origin of the filament curtain is probably connected with its functions in pollination biology, which are proposed to be those of restricted nectar access, prevention of nectar evaporation, lever ann function facilitating dorsal pollen deposition, and stabilizing of posticous position of anthers and Style, Four types of filament curtains are distinguished: phaulopsoid, corolla fold, reduced and strobilanthoid. Variation in the filament curtain structure appears to be related to different pollination syndromes of the flowers. Mapping of this variation on to an existing phylogeny shows an evolution from a phaulopsoid type diverging into the other three types, possibly a development responding to shifts of pollinators.

Previous studies suggest that the foraging behaviour of insect pollinators may select for early blooming and colour polymorphism. I tested whether pollinator behaviour can also favour aggregated flowering in these species, in a two-stage laboratory experiment on naive bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.). In the first stage, the bees were allowed to forage on three colours of artificial flowers that contained sucrose rewards. In the second stage, I added nonrewarding flowers of a fourth colour and recorded the bees' visits to them. The four types of artificial flowers were either arranged in spatially distinct clusters, or were randomly intermingled. I used two reward schedules for each spatial arrangement: constant refilling of reward-containing flowers and probabilistic refilling. Bees that foraged on clustered flowers flew more often to the nonrewarding patch, and made more visits to nonrewarding flowers, than bees that foraged on intermingled flowers. This tendency was obtained both in the constant reward and in the probabilistic reward schedules. The results support the hypothesis that pollinator attraction may select for clustered, synchronized blooming in flowers that do not contain nectar and pollen rewards.

Field observations indicated that both D. pulchra and W. lepida are pollinated by the long-tongued fly, Philoliche aethiopica (Tabanidae). The hypothesis that D. pulchra is a floral mimic of W. lepida was supported by choice experiments, which showed that, in terms of visits to inflorescences, flies do not discriminate between the two species. However, flies probed fewer flowers and spent less time on D. pulchra inflorescences than on Watsonia inflorescences. Thus the absence of nectar in the flowers of D. pulchra may reduce the risk of geitonogamy and pollen discounting. A breeding system experiment showed that fruits of D. pulchra that arise from self-pollination contain relatively few viable Seeds Compared with outcrossed fruits. These findings support the hypothesis that deception: in orchids evolved under selection for more efficient mating systems.

This could occur if pollinators are more likely to move between flowers on the same plant, causing self-pollination, when flowers are abundant. The hypothesis has practical implications for agricultural production because self-pollinations produce fewer seeds per pod than do cross-pollinations in alfalfa. We simulated seed set in a model that included published movement patterns of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), and estimates of seed set when a series of flowers on the same plant are hand pollinated. Seed set from a fixed number of pollinations averaged only ?6-7% higher when standing crop was low than when standing crop was high. This small increase in seed set would be difficult to detect experimentally because of high variability between plants. M. rotundata appears to move with a 56% probability of leaving a given raceme and a given plant; this foraging behavior results in few flowers visited per plant. A pollinator with a higher probability of leaving racemes and plants could set slightly more seed than M. rotundata, whereas a pollinator with a lower probability of leaving racemes and plants would be more affected by flower standing crop than is M. rotundata. The distribution of flowers visited per raceme by bees in alfalfa can be predicted by superimposing the movement probability on the distribution of open flowers per raceme. This conceptualization of bee movement on flowers differs from (but is not mutually exclusive of) resource-driven optimal foraging models, and is useful for predicting geitonogamy.",Alfalfa; Foraging behavior; Medicago sativa; Megachile rotundata; Pollination ecology; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033786349

Floral thermogenesis is widely distributed throughout the extant basal angiosperms (Nymphaeaceae, Illiciaceae, Aristolochiaceae, Magnoliaceae, and Annonaceae), into the basal monocots (Araceae) and extends into the advanced monocots (Arecaceae and Cyclanthaceae) and eudicots (only one family, Nelumbonaceae). The cycads are the only other plant group with heat-producing reproductive structures (male and female cones). Flower temperatures of thermogenic plants are in the range required by endothermic insects for purposes of mating and flight, and it is hypothesized that floral heat is a direct energy reward to insects (a resource).

For example, damage to floral and vegetative structures may influence the pattern of pollen movement within and among individual plants. In obligately outcrossing species, enhanced movement of self pollen (geitonogamy) can negatively impact fitness if self pollen clogs stigmas, interferes with stylar transmitting tracts, usurps ovules, or increases fruit abortion. We investigated whether early season browsing affects the fitness cost of self-pollination in the obligately outcrossing species scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata, using clipping and emasculation treatments. We found that clipping significantly reduced the production of flowers, fruits, and seeds whereas emasculation significantly increased the production of these components of female fitness. In addition, we detected a significant interaction between the clipping and emasculation treatments when considering four components of fitness simultaneously; emasculation led to an increase in the fitness of unclipped plants but not clipped plants. We propose two nonexclusive mechanisms to explain this pattern. First, damaged plants may experience reduced self-pollination due to reductions in pollinator visitation or effectiveness. Alternatively, damaged plants may simply lack the resources (or the ability to allocate resources) to benefit from emasculation.

In addition, hurricanes commonly reduce populations of bird pollinators. I measured both resource and pollination limitation of fruit set for Bahama Swamp-bush (Pavonia bahamensis) on San Salvador Island in the Bahamas before and after two seasons of hurricanes. Before the hurricanes in the winter flowering season in 1994-1995, fruit set of P. bahamensis was 100% for most shrubs. After a mild hurricane, in 1995-1996, fruit set was 48%. After the severe Hurricane Lili (Category 2) in 1996-1997, mean fruit set was only 11%. In both years after the hurricanes, lower fruit set reflected resource limitation. In 1996-1997 after Hurricane Lili, fruit set was severely reduced an additional 74% by pollination limitation. Pollination limitation was caused by declines of the two bird pollinators, Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars. In 1994-1995, both species were frequent visitors to flowers, but in 1996-1997 these birds were rarely seen on the island. A concurrent mist-netting study indicated that Bananaquit populations were decimated after Hurricane Lili in 1996. Nectar removal was virtually absent, and pollen deposition on stigmas was low. In 1994-1995, 98% of the stigmas had received pollen by the end of floral life. In contrast, in 1996-1997, 51% of the flowers had received no pollen, supporting the conclusion that pollination limitation of fruit set was strong. There was no compensatory pollination by other pollinators, either other bird species or insects. These results indicate that severe hurricanes can affect fruit set directly through resource limitation and indirectly through reducing bird pollinators and causing pollination limitation of fruit set. Reduced fruit set after a hurricane could be especially disadvantageous because hurricanes can create sites for plant recruitment. Although resource limitation of fruit set may affect many plant species, bird-pollinated species may be faced with a double jeopardy of resource limitation of fruit set and pollination limitation of fruit set. Whether this disadvantage affects the recruitment of bird-pollinated plants after hurricanes or their adaptations for recruiting after hurricanes remains to be examined.",Bahama Swamp-bush; Bahamas; Bananaquit pollination; Fruit set; Hurricane effects; Island plant pollination; Nectarivorous birds; Pavonia bahamensis; Pollination limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033942046

At three localities in the range of the two species, individuals with flowers that appeared different from previously known species were found. To test whether these were hybrids between V. claviculata and V. barbellata, 11 morphological floral characters were recorded at seven populations and allozyme profiles of the three taxa compared. Principal component analysis on the morphological characters gave three distinct groups with minor overlaps. The first component axis reflects variation in overall size of the flowers, while the second component reflects variation in the size of the distal aperture of the labellum. Allozyme data revealed that the putative hybrids have a significant surplus of heterozygotes (F(IS)=-0.65) as expected in a F1 generation. Both data sets support the hypothesis that the individuals are hybrids, which is further augmented by interspecific pollination experiments between the putative parental species. This is the first case of natural hybridization reported in the genus Vanilla.

Thus, a selected array of floral attributes as well as the frequency and duration of insect visits were studied in the field under ambient or ambient plus supplemental UV-B radiation, simulating a 15% ozone depletion over Patras (38.3°N, 29.1°E). Video-recording revealed two categories of visitors, i.e. true pollinators (bees) and nectar thieves. The frequency of visits to both control and UV-B treated plants was the same and independent of whether the UV-B tubes were on or off during video recording. UV-B radiation had no effect on gross floral morphology (petal surface area, number of pollen grains, stamens and ovules, optical properties of petals and stamens), yet nectary size was almost doubled. In addition, the duration of insect visits was significantly longer on UV-B treated plants, provided that the UV-B tubes were off during monitoring. The differences were abolished during the part of the day that the tubes were on, indicating that the insects were annoyed by supplemental UV-B radiation. These results are consistent with the nectaries producing larger quantities of nectar, which caused the insects to stay longer on flowers of UV-B treated plants and improved pollination success.",Cistus czeticus; Nectary size; Pollinators; UV-B radiation; Visit duration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034012475

Contrary to other Taxus species, T. brevifolia staminate strobili are usually located on 2-year-old foliage although they may occur on foliage from 1 to 5-years-old. This delayed staminate strobilus development may be an adaptation to the low light environment where T. brevifolia grows. Microsporogenesis occurred in the autumn preceding pollination. Successive divisions produced isobilateral tetrads visible as early as mid-October. Over-wintering staminate strobili usually contained separate microspores. In 1996 to 1999, pollination occurred in March and April in two natural forest sites on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The low amounts of airborne pollen and prolonged pollination period indicated low pollination success within T. brevifolia. Female receptivity was measured by the presence of a pollination drop. Protandry up to 18 d was observed. In vitro pollen germination was moderate to good, ranging from 65 to 88 % depending on the tree and year.

Hummingbirds visit both species but visit P. barbatus at a higher rate. We compared several traits and asked whether the species differed in specialization for hummingbird pollination. The corollas of P. pinifolius were 30% narrower than those of P. barbatus, but they were similar in tube length. Although a narrower corolla appeared to decrease access by large insects, small halictid bees were the only common insect visitors, and they gathered nectar from both species. Species differences in nectar production rate and concentration were minor, being smaller than within-species differences between dry and rainy periods. Taller inflorescences and a wider corolla tube may contribute to greater hummingbird use of P. barbatus. Penstemon pinifolius was fully self-compatible and weakly autogamous, whereas P. barbatus was strongly self-incompatible and had a longer flower life. Exclusion of hummingbirds reduced seed set fourfold in both species, supporting the inference from morphology and rewards that hummingbirds are the primary pollinators. In the absence of hummingbirds, halictids increased the seed set of P. barbatus relative to exclusion of all visitors, but they did not increase the seed set of P. pinifolius.

Small populations were found to have significantly fewer polymorphic loci than larger populations, but all populations maintained the same common allelic variants. The degree of isolation of individual populations did not affect the amount of genetic variation. Offspring arrays revealed a very high outcrossing rate (0.96). The field study demonstrated a very high level of gene flow between populations considering that small insects are thought to be the main pollinators of this species. An experiment to verify whether pollen transport by wind could explain the results from the field study demonstrated long-distance transport from isolated plants to bagged plants.

While islet size seemed to be unimportant, both pollinator activity and seed set increased with increasing patch and tussock size, whereas the frequency of aborted seeds decreased.

Long-proboscid fly pollination appears to comprise three discrete guilds of flies in the genera Prosoeca, Moegistorhynchus, and Stenobasipteron (Nemestrinidae) and Philoliche (Tabanidae). Flies in the three guilds are on the wing at different times of the year and pollinate different suites of plant species, sometimes with different floral characteristics. The three pollinator guilds operate for the most part in different parts of the subcontinent. Where there is geographical overlap, the periods of activity differ. Plants pollinated by long-proboscid flies have flowers with an elongate, cylindrical floral tube, mostly 35-60 cm long, a perianth of specific colors and marking, a floral reward of nectar, and lack floral fragrance. Pollen is not eaten by these flies, and anthers and pollen are often cryptically colored. Flowers are usually zygomorphic and bilabiate, and the petal or tepal lobes have characteristically shaped nectar guides. With few exceptions, the flowers offer ample nectar of sugar concentration mainly in the 20-30% range. Several orchids and one Pelargonium using long-proboscid flies for pollination offer no nectar, and pollination is accomplished through floral mimicry and deception. In long-proboscid fly pollination systems, placement of pollen on the insect's body is highly specific, and there are at least six mutually exclusive sites of pollen deposition on an insect's body. When two or more long-proboscid-fly-pollinated plant species co-occur, each typically utilizes a different pollen deposition site. This suggests that pollen contamination is detrimental to reproductive success and that differential pollen deposition sites are important for plants pollinated by long-proboscid flies. Since these flies are the sole or main pollinators of at least 120 plant species and the inferred pollinators of at least 80 more species in southern Africa, they must be considered keystone species in the ecosystems where they occur.",Co-evolution; Floral ecology; Long-proboscid flies; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033923139

The visitors, which in Central Europe almost exclusively utilize the nectar, are passively covered with pollen because of the morphology and the mobile suspension of the flowers.

Although attempts to extract nectar with the microcapillary method failed, rinsates of the flower interior yielded considerable amounts of sugar, yet with high interplant variation. Enzymatic microassays revealed that secreted sugar is adsorbed onto the surfaces of the numerous filaments surrounding the nectary, on the dense pubescence of the ovary surrounded by the nectary and on the yellow base of the purplish-pink, free, obovate petals. The conclusion that C. creticus is an efficient nectar donor was further strengthened by video recording the behaviour of bees and by the high frequency of nectar thieves. We propose that the shallow flower shape and the overheating caused by solar tracking facilitate evaporative concentration of nectar. Alternatively (or in addition), the morphological proximity of the nectary to the filaments and the ovary pubescence facilitates adsorption and the capillary action of the cell walls works antagonistically to glass microcapillaries precluding nectar collection. Addition of artificial nectar in the field had no effect on bee visit frequency but it increased visit duration significantly and decreased abortion rates. In addition, seed yield was increased, especially under insect-limited conditions.

Similarities include the mode of formation of the pollination drop and its response upon pollination. In both genera, pollination triggers pollination drop retraction and drop secretion ceases. Neither NMR imaging nor conventional histology of Phyllocladus ovules revealed any specific tissue beneath the ovule which could be responsible for pollination drop retraction. It is more likely, therefore, that the drop is channelled into the vascular supply or the apoplast.

Direct effects on female plant fitness occur when decreased seed production is due to decreased resource availability from loss of leaf area and its attendant photosynthesis or through consumption of reproductive structures. Indirect effects occur when folivore- and florivore-mediated changes in floral traits influence pollinator preference and/or pollinator efficiency, thus reducing pollen receipt. We examined the effects of both leaf and floral herbivory (bud damage) and determined the relative contribution of direct and indirect effects of damage on female fitness through changes in floral traits for Oenothera macrocarpa (Onagraceae). The experiment was a two-factorial design that manipulated both leaf damage (~25% leaf area removed by hand) and pollen receipt (supplemental hand pollination). We then measured effects of leaf damage on floral traits (corolla diameter, floral tube length, and flower number) and fruit and seed set. Because herbivores damaged corollas in the bud stage in this experiment, we were also able to determine the effect of florivores on subsequent female reproduction. Plants in the increased leaf damage treatment (33.4% leaf area loss) produced fewer flowers than natural leaf damage plants (6.5% leaf area loss), and their flowers had smaller corolla diameters and shorter floral tube lengths. Experimentally damaged plants also had 18% lower fruit set and produced 33% fewer seeds compared with natural leaf damage plants. Hand pollination increased fruit set by 60% and total seed number by 38% above that of naturally pollinated plants, demonstrating that female fitness was pollen-limited. Bud damage significantly decreased corolla diameter and floral tube length, and it led to a 68% reduction in fruit set. Hawk moths were observed preferentially visiting flowers with larger corollas, and study flowers with larger corollas had significantly increased probability of setting fruit. Additionally, seed number per fruit was positively related to floral tube length. In path analysis, we found no significant path between percentage leaf damage and female reproduction, suggesting that herbivores did not reduce seed production directly through decreased resource availability. Instead, we found a significant indirect path from percentage leaf damage to seed number through corolla diameter. We conclude that decreased female reproduction was due to changes in floral traits from both leaf and floral bud damage, which affected hawk moth preference (flowers with smaller corollas received fewer visits) and hawk moth efficiency of pollen delivery (flowers with shorter floral tubes had fewer seeds). This study demonstrates that herbivores can mitigate the mutualistic relationship between plants and pollinators through their effects on floral traits.",Direct and indirect effects; Floral herbivory; Hawk moths; Herbivory; Leaf herbivory; Missouri Ozark glade communities; Oenothera macrocarpa; Path analysis; Plant-pollinator interactions; Pollen limitation; Pollinator efficiency; Pollinator preference,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033980970

A number of its features are consistent with ornithophily in other Epacridaceae, including a tubular pendant odourless corolla, a winter peak in flowering and a copious diurnal nectar flow. However, the flower largely retains the white, insect-attractive colour of its congeners. Male plants have more and larger flowers, begin flowering earlier in the season, and yield significantly more nectar per flower than female plants. The fruits produced on female plants were 22% larger than the few produced on male plants. These findings are consistent with recent theories on the biology of dioecy.

Although all flowers are complete, with seemingly fertile stamens and pistils, differences in fruit production and detailed field, anatomical, and morphological studies indicate they are functionally unisexual, and the species is consequently dioecious. A comparison of 15 features demonstrated significant differences between the sexes. The populational sex ratio is 1:1. Nectaries located between the filaments produce small amounts of floral nectar with similar sugar composition in both sexes. There are x? = 33,357 (or x? = 133,429) pollen tetrads (or pollen grains)/male flower and x? = 109 ovules/female flower. No tetrads in either hand self-pollinated or open pollinated male flowers showed any pollen germination. Tetrads on open- and hand-pollinated female flowers germinate. Female flowers do not show autogamy or apomixis. During more than 80 hours of field observation, we recorded only seven floral visitors (representing three insect species). In spite of this, open-pollinated female flowers have abundant fruit and seed-set. Thus, we conclude that pollen is transferred abiotically and the ever-present wind over the exposed ridges of the islands is the likely dispersal agent. A number of anemophilous features, such as dry pollen and exposed habitat, support this conclusion. Thus, dioecy and anemophily have evolved independently, in situ, in this species in this remote locality. Preservation of habitat and elimination of competitive invasives are the primary conservation challenges.

The theory of electrostatically mediated pollen transfer between insect pollinators and the flowers they visit is described, including recent studies which confirmed that the accumulated charges on airborne honey bees are sufficient for non-contact pollen detachment by electrostatic forces (i.e., electrostatic pollination). The most important morphological features in flower adaptiveness to electrostatic pollination were determined by means of two theoretical models of a flower exposed to an approaching charged cloud of pollen; they are style length and flower opening.

Selective visitation could also constrain or promote the phenotypic divergence of the sexes. In this study, I explored the causes and consequences of selectivity by generalist pollinators of a gynodioecious wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) and thus provide insight into potential pollinator-mediated selection for dioecy and sexual dimorphism. I found that flowers of F. virginiana show pronounced sexual dimorphism in petal length, stamen length, nectar and pollen production, and that this results in dramatic and consistent levels of sex-differential visitation by ants, bees, and flies. I performed manipulations of hermaphrodite flowers to understand the basis of selectivity and found that much of bee and fly preference for hermaphrodite flowers derived from their strong preference for longer petals, but also from a more subtle preference for pollen-filled anthers. These studies also revealed that other traits contribute to the observed discrimination against females. A stronger relationship existed between bee visitation and pollen receipt in females than between bee visitation and pollen removal from hermaphrodites. An analysis of natural variation in petal and stamen length confirmed the central role of petal length and also showed a lack of an effect of vestigial stamen length in pollination success of females. It also revealed a significant effect of stamen length, but not of petal length, on pollen removal. The data suggest that pollinator selectivity may affect the evolution of floral sexual dimorphism, both by exerting selection that could lead to the maintenance of stamens in females and by exerting selection to increase petal length in females.",Dioecy; Flowers; Fragaria virginiana; Gynodioecy; Petal length; Plant reproduction; Pollen removal and receipt; Pollination; Pollinator selectivity and discrimination; Pollinator-mediated selection; Sexual dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033850248

Moreover, there is evidence that A. mellifera may not always be the most efficient pollinator. Introduction of A. mellifera into crops may be unnecessary, and even detrimental to non-Apis bee populations, which should be considered as an alternative for crop production improvement. Evaluating the pollination efficiency of non-Apis bees is one of the first steps in planning successful strategies for their conservation. In this study, we evaluated the pollination efficiency of Peponapis limitaris and A. mellifera in plots of Cucurbita moschata: pollen removal and deposition; pollinator visit frequency; and the pollinator visit-nectar production relationship. The results show P. limitaris to be the most efficient pollinator as: (1) both males and females remove and deposit almost four times as much pollen as A. mellifera; (2) they make significantly more floral visits than A. mellifera; and (3) their visit frequency shows a strong relationship to C. moschata nectar production during anthesis. Recommendations arising from this study are: (1) the introduction of A. mellifera be avoided in C. moschata crops; and (2) basic research be done on the biology of P. limitaris that contribute to its conservation and greater exploitation.",Apis mellifera; Mexico; Non-Apis bee conservation; Pollination efficiency; Yucatan,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034524537

We have investigated the regulation of pollination-induced ethylene synthesis in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) using flowers of the dialytic (dI) mutant, in which pollination can be manipulated experimentally, with the aim of developing a model system to study tomato flower senescence. Ethylene synthesis increased rapidly in dl pistils following pollination, leading to accelerated petal senescence, and was delayed in ethylene-insensitive Never-ripe (Nr) pistils. However, Nr pistils eventually produced more ethylene than dl pistils, suggesting the presence of negative feedback regulation of ethylene synthesis following pollination. LEACS1A expression correlated well with increased ethylene production in pollinated dl pistils, and expression in Nr revealed that regulation is via an ethylene-independent mechanism. In contrast, the induction of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidases, LEAC01 and LEAC03, following pollination is ethylene dependent. In addition, the expression profiles of ACS and ACO genes were determined during petal senescence and a hypothesis proposed that translocated 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid from the pistil may be important for regulating the initial burst of ethylene production during petal senescence.

Cientificas, Apartado 1056, E-41080 Sevilla, Spain","Using an experimental approach, this study addresses the following two questions for the perennial herb Paeonia broteroi (Paeoniaceae) at a location in southeastern Spain. (1) What are the relative magnitudes of the effects of pollinators and herbivores (invertebrates and vertebrates feeding on flowers and developing fruits) on maternal fecundity (total seed production per plant)? (2) Are the effects of pollinators and herbivores on fecundity additive, or is there some significant interaction between them? A two-factor ('Pollinators' and 'Herbivores,' each with two levels, 'present' and 'excluded') experimental design was used, with individual plants being treated as experimental units and maternal fecundity as the response variable. On average, the effects of pollinators and herbivores were of opposite sign and roughly similar absolute magnitude (~7.5 seeds per plant), thus approximately canceling each other. A significant interaction (non-additivity) between factors did exist, with plants exposed to pollinators experiencing a disproportionately higher incidence of herbivores than those from which pollinators had been excluded. This was mainly due to mammals browsing only on the larger fruits from flowers that had been exposed to pollinators. Only in the absence of herbivores did pollinators account for a significant amount of between-plant variance in maternal fecundity. It is concluded that the interaction between pollinators and herbivores will lead to variable, herbivore-dependent 'opportunity for selection' (sensu Arnold and Wade 1984) on P. broteroi by its pollinators. Regional variation in herbivore incidence experienced by P. broteroi populations will presumably generate local variation in the degree of adaptedness of the plant to its pollinators.",Fruit selection; Herbivory; Indirect interactions; Mammalian herbivores; Maternal fecundity; Mediterranean; Non-additive effects; Paeonia broteroi; Perennial herbs; Pollination; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033857372

While the majority of species are represented by magnoliids and basal monocotyledons specialized, beetle-pollinated systems have evolved independently in 14 families of eudicotyldons and six families of petaloid monocots. Four, overlapping modes of floral presentation in plants pollinated exclusively by beetles (Bilabiate, Brush, Chamber Blossom and Painted Bowl) are described. Chamber Blossoms and Painted Bowls are the two most common modes. Chamber Blossoms, found in magnoliids, primitive monocotyledons and in some families of woody eudicots, exploit the greatest diversity of beetle pollinators. Painted Bowls are restricted to petaloid monocots and a few families of eudicots dependent primarily on hairy species of Scarabaeidae as pollen vectors. In contrast, generalist flowers pollinated by a combination of beetles and other animals are recorded in 22 families. Generalist systems are more likely to secrete nectar and exploit four beetle families absent in specialist flowers. Centers of diversity for species with specialized, beetle-pollinated systems are distributed through the wet tropics (centers for Brush and Chamber Blossoms) to warm temperate-Mediterranean zones (centers for Painted Bowls and a few Bilabiate flowers). It is unlikely that beetles were the first pollinators of angiosperms but specialized, beetle-pollinated flowers must have evolved by the mid-late Cretaceous to join pre-existing guilds of beetle-pollinated gymnosperms. The floras of Australia and western North America suggest that mutualistic interactions between beetles and flowers has been a continuous and labile trend in angiosperms with novel interactions evolving through the Tertiary.",Chamber Blossom; Chewing mouthparts; Coleoptera; Cretaceous; Magnoliids; Monocotyledons (basal vs. petaloid); Painted Bowl; Scarabaeidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033934241

Treatment with CPPU increased fruit set in both seeded and seedless melons. Even at low concentrations, CPPU had a strong effect on fruit set in the seeded melons. In seedless melons, CPPU induced 100% parthenocarpic fruit set when applied with 10 mg·L-1; lower concentrations were much less effective. Treatment with BA increased fruit set in seeded melons, but was not particularly effective in the absence of pollination. During the first 10 days after anthesis, CPPU promoted fruit growth, but between 8 and 13 days after anthesis, the growth rate was lower than in the controls. Treatment with CPPU had little effect upon soluble solids (SS) levels in seeded fruit. SS content was significantly lower in seedless than in seeded fruit; this difference was larger in the placenta than in the mesocarp. Sucrose levels of both seeded and seedless fruits were consistently higher than glucose and fructose levels. High concentrations of CPPU reduced sucrose levels in the placenta of seedless fruit.

On the other hand, as is known from the Impatiens - 'pollen basket', threads or ropes may be involved in pollen presentation. In addition, for the first time two new examples of 'pollen baskets' in Boraginaceae and Scrophulariaceae are reported. In Echium the basket is formed by cellular elements from the modified septal regions, whereas in Esterhazya a similar effect is achieved in an analogous manner by trichomes of the epidermal layer of the thecal wall. There is obviously a different function of these seemingly very similar baskets: in Echium the feature acts preferably as a pollen presentation agent, whereas in Esterhazya the primary function is to prevent all the pollen from being dispersed too soon.",Angiosperms; Anthers; Echium; Esterhazya; Pollen; Pollination ecology; Secondary pollen presentation; Sporopollenin; Viscin threads,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033936601

These foraging profiles were analysed to determine whether they were characteristic of various floral morphologies in predictable ways. It was found that although visitor profiles were sometimes consistent with classic pollination syndromes, these syndromes were unreliable predictors of floral visitors. Very few flowers were exclusively bird-pollinated, and none were strictly fly-, beetle-, wasp-, or butterfly-pollinated. The majority of flowering plants were unspecialized in their morphology, and consequently hosted a diverse array of visitors. In addition, visitor profiles to congeners with similar floral morphologies, and even to conspecifics, differed between habitats. Altitude was a major factor in determining visitors, with flies being the most abundant visitors above 700 m. However, congeners in several genera of Epacridaceae, as well as the genus Correa, which differed in floral morphology also differed in visitor profiles. Tubular flowers were associated with birds, while flowers with more accessible nectar were visited by insects. The only taxa exhibiting a bee-pollination syndrome that were largely visited by bees were the Fabaceae and Goodenia ovata Sm. Several species with purple or pink flowers were also predominantly visited by bees, but did not strictly conform to the melittophilous syndrome. In contrast, other flowers exhibiting an ostensibly mellitophilous syndrome hosted very few bees. Of these, species that occurred at high altitude were mainly visited by flies, while others received very few potential pollen vectors.",Birds; Colour; Flowers; Foraging profiles; Insects; Shape; Visitor profiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000924838

Two polymorphic stigmatically-expressed S-locus genes, thought to participate in the perception of 'self' pollen have been characterized to date. One, the SRK (S-receptor kinase) encodes a transmembrane receptor kinase likely to be activated by the binding of an S-specific pollen-borne ligand. The other, SLG (S-locus glycoprotein), encodes a secreted cell wall glycoprotein whose role in self-incompatibility (SI) is less clear and increasingly questioned. The pollen coating in Brassica is known to carry the male determinant of SI as well as factors crucial for competent pollen-stigma interactions. Characterization of the coating has revealed the presence of several families of gametophytically expressed small cysteine-rich proteins (PCPs - pollen coat proteins). PCPs are strongly implicated in playing a central role in SI and other aspects of the pollen-stigma interaction. PCP-A (for PCP, class 'A') class proteins have specific affinities for stigmatic S- and S-related proteins and these, along with other recently characterized groups of PCPs, are abundant components of fractions having S-specific activity in pollination bioassays. The role of the pollen coating, and particularly PCPs and their expression patterns, will be discussed in the perspective of the pollen-stigma interaction and SI.

Variation in foraging behaviour of hummingbird pollinators is a consequence of the interaction between plant density and number of flowers per plant. Territorialist pollinators are common in high density areas but visit few flowers on each plant, thereby promoting outcrossing. In areas of low plant density, trapliners and rare territorialists visit several flowers per plant, thus increasing selfing. Our results indicate that outcrossing rate is a dynamic parameter, with the extent of variation depending on a number of ecological factors.

However, coexistence may be facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype mating and increase assortative mating. 2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of the frequency of triploid offspring. 3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering periods overlapped by 51%, with diploid stems flowering earlier. 4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering simultaneously, only 26% of all bee flights were between flowers on different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15% were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for intercytotype mating from 49% expected if mating is random to about 2% of the total number of pollinator flights. 5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6%, similar to the proportion of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4%). 6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour (as influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.",Fireweed; Phenology; Pollinator behaviour; Polyploidy; Reproductive isolation; Triploids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033837361

In O. sphegodes, visits by pollinators are rare. Because of this low frequency of pollination, one would expect the evolution of strategies that increase the chance that males will visit more than one flower on the same plant; this would increase the number of pollination events on a plant and therefore the number of seeds produced. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, we identified more than 100 compounds in the odor bouquets of labellum extracts from O. sphegodes; 24 compounds were found to be biologically active in male olfactory receptors based on gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD). Gas chromatography (GC) analyses of odors from individual flowers showed less intraspecific variation in the odor bouquets of the biologically active compounds as compared to nonactive compounds. This can be explained by a higher selective pressure on the pollinator-attracting communication signal. Furthermore, we found a characteristic variation in the GC-EAD active esters and aldehydes among flowers of different stem positions within an inflorescence and in the n-alkanes and n-alkenes among plants from different populations. In our behavioral field tests, we showed that male bees learn the odor bouquets of individual flowers during mating attempts and recognize them in later encounters. Bees thereby avoid trying to mate with flowers they have visited previously, but do not avoid other flowers either of a different or the same plant. By varying the relative proportions of saturated esters and aldehydes between flowers of different stem positions, we demonstrated that a plant may take advantage of the learning abilities of the pollinators and influence flower visitation behavior. Sixty-seven percent of the males that visited one flower in an inflorescence returned to visit a second flower of the same inflorescence. However, geitonogamy is prevented and the likelihood of cross-fertilization is enhanced by the time required for the pollinium deposited on the pollinator to complete its bending movement, which is necessary for pollination to occur. Cross-fertilization is furthermore enhanced by the high degree of odor variation between plants. This variation minimizes learned avoidance of the flowers and increases the likelihood that a given pollinator would visit several to many different plants within a population.",Andrena nigroaenea; Chemical communication; Learning behavior; Ophrys sphegodes; Pollination by sexual deception; Reproductive success; Scent variation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034491675

Bag X01, Scottsville. 3209, South Africa","Cohesive masses of pollen known as pollinia have evolved independently in two plant families - Orchidaceae and Asclepiadaceae. Yet, the bilateral symmetry of orchids has allowed a greater degree of specialization in pollination systems and a much greater diversity in the morphology of pollinaria - units comprising the pollinia(um) together with accessory structures for attachment to the pollinator. Pollinaria differ in the degree of cohesion of pollen in the pollinium, which may be soft, sectile (comprised of sub-units known as massulae) or hard. A single hard pollinium may contain more than a million pollen grains, yet pollen:ovule ratios in orchids are several orders of magnitude lower than in plants with powdery pollen due to the lack of wastage during transport to the stigma. Attachment of pollinia to the pollinator is usually achieved by means of a viscidium that adheres most effectively to smooth surfaces, such as the eyes and mouthparts of insects and beaks of birds. The stalk connecting a pollinium to the viscidium may be comprised of a caudicle (sporogenous in origin) and/or a stipe (derived from vegetative tissue), or be lacking altogether. Caudicles and stipes may undergo a gradual bending movement 20 s to several hours after withdrawal from the flower, the main function of which appears to be to reduce the possibility of geitonogamous pollination. Other mechanisms that promote outcrossing and pollen export in orchids include pollen carryover (achieved by sectile or soft pollinia), temporary retention of the anther cap, protandry and self-incompatibility (rare among orchids).

Following pollination, pollen hydrates on the stigma surface before germination takes place. Rehydration is an essential step for the success of pollination and depends on the movement of water from the stigmatic cells. This water flow has been shown to be biologically regulated, and components of both pollen and stigma surfaces have been demonstrated to play a role in the control of pollen hydration. Regulation of water transport between animal or plant cells involves membrane proteins, designated aquaporins, which possess water-channel activity. Such molecules may be candidates for controlling pollen hydration, and consequently we investigated whether aquaporins are present in the pollen and stigma cells in Brassica oleracea. Here, we report the identification of two new aquaporin genes, Bo-PIP1b1 and Bo-PIP1b2, which are highly homologous to PIP1b from Arabidopsis thaliana. Both Bo-PIP1b1 and Bo-PIP1b2 proteins are active water channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of Bo-PIP1b1 and Bo-PIP1b2 was observed in reproductive organs as well as in vegetative tissues. Interestingly, the use of a Bo-PIP1b2 cDNA probe revealed that PIP1-like transcripts were not present in the pollen grains or in the stigma papillae, but were present in the stigma cell layers underlying the papillar cells. This observation suggests that water flow between the pollen and stigma papillae may be dependent on aquaporins expressed in cells that are not directly in contact with the pollen grain.",Aquaporin; Brassica; PIP; Pollen hydration; Stigma papillae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033762615

(Proteaceae) is a common shrub in southeastern Australian bushland that generally flowers only once after each fire. However, little is known of the details of this post-fire flowering. Lomatia silaifolia has flowers well-spaced along its conflorescence axis, unlike many other Proteaceae species, thus allowing close examination of the influence of flower position, mate choice and flowering sequence on fruit production. We examined breeding system, flowering phenology and spatial patterns of fruit set in the species, after a fire in September 1992 at Bulli Tops, New South Wales. Flowering occurred in December-January, but only in the first and second summers after the fire. The species is partially self-compatible: only 25% of self-pollinated conflorescences initiated fruits compared with 100% of cross-pollinated conflorescences. Fewer flowers initiated fruits after hand self-pollination (3.0%) than after cross-pollination (35.4%). Self-pollinated flowers produced fewer viable seeds (22.2% viable) than cross-pollinated flowers (62.9% viable). Pollen tubes were found in 72% of the self-pollinated flowers examined, suggesting that there is no early stylar self-incompatibility in the species. There was a high level of herbivory on flowering and fruiting branches, with 69% of unbagged branches completely destroyed. This may significantly affect recruitment in the species, given the limited opportunities for reproduction in the post-fire environment. In this study, fruits were evenly distributed along the conflorescence axis unlike some other species in the Proteaceae with more compressed, spike-like flowering structures where fruits are typically concentrated in some parts of the conflorescence axis (e.g. Telopea and some Banksia spp.).

This may be explained by water stress, caused by a higher evapotranspiration (cf. the mean temperature of July which increases towards the east) - obligate autogamy shortens the time span from anthesis to fruit set due to a rapid pollination process.

Analysis of morphological and genetic data suggests that when subjected to significant gene flow through cross-pollination, ear characteristics are maintained through farmers' selection even though other characteristics may continue to evolve. Because the effects of farmers' selection practices are confined largely to ear characteristics, their practices appear to offer only limited scope for variety improvement. Farmers' expectations of what they can achieve through seed selection are similarly limited.

Following maturation and passage of the pollen tube or gamete nuclei, a series of equivalent gates close, some serving a prophylactic role (particularly in the Gramineae), others related to incompatibility reactions or conservation of water. The roles of the micro-ecology of the stigma and style, and of the gates, are discussed in the light of the success of angiosperms as a group, and analogies are made with the success of the mammals in the animal kingdom.

Charles Darwin assumed that nectar robbers had a negative impact on the plants that they visit, but research done in the last 50 years indicates that they often have a beneficial or neutral effect. Several studies document that robbers frequently pollinate the plants that they visit. Robbers may also have an indirect effect on the behavior of the legitimate pollinators, and in some circumstances, the change in pollinator behavior could result in improved fitness through increased pollen flow and outcrossing. The effects of nectar robbers are complex and depend, in part, on the identity of the robber, the identity of the legitimate pollinator, how much nectar the robbers remove, and the variety of floral resources available in the environment.",Bombus spp. bumble bee; Cheater; Foraging; Hummingbird; Indirect effects; Mutualism; Nectar robbing; Plant fitness; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033782235

We examined variation in the size and number of open flowers in wild daffodils (Narcissus). Our analysis of published data on 45 taxa showed that flower number varied negatively with flower diameter among Narcissus species, which supports the widespread assumption that there is a trade-off between these traits. In contrast, field measurements indicated a positive relation between flower number and diameter within two populations of Narcissus dubius, and no relation was evident after we controlled for variation in bulb size. The discrepancy between inter- and intraspecific patterns may have occurred because variable resource levels obscure trade-offs when variation in flower size is low (e.g., within species). Size-related increases in floral tube length were half as great as corresponding increases in flower diameter, a result that is consistent with stronger stabilizing selection on tube length. Staggered flowering within N. dubius inflorescences limited the mean number of open flowers to <66% of total flower number, and slow expansion by later opening flowers resulted in significant differences in flower size throughout flowering. Although pollinators preferred large flowers, experimental reductions in flower diameter did not affect seed production. Our results illustrate how the relative importance of the factors influencing floral display can vary among levels of biological organization. Interspecific variation in flower size and number appeared to be constrained by allocation trade-offs, but intraspecific variation in both traits was more greatly influenced by plant resource status. Within plants, the size and number of open flowers reflected the relative age of individual flowers and floral longevity.",Amaryllidaceae; Ecology; Flowering phenology; Plant size; Reproductive biology; Resource allocation; Size-number trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033997334

The small, white or pale pink flowers with stigmas above anthers appeared from late March to early April in the study years, and produced abundant pollen, but no nectar. Pollen:ovule ratios were 17 185 ± 2175. Every flower opens only once and remains functional for 10-12 h. Pollen remains viable for the same period. During anthesis, flowers were visited only by single species of thrips (Taeniothrips sp., Thripidae). No airborne pollen grains were collected throughout the blooming season, indicating that flowers are not wind-pollinated. About 28% of stigmas of unopened flowers were found with germinated pollen grains and seed set took place in single flowers that were bagged at the bud stage, which indicated autogamy and autonomous self-pollination. Ovary walls ruptured 4-5 days after fertilisation, allowing seed production to occur. About 75% of ovules were fertilised and developed into young seeds, but only 12.5% developed into mature seeds in open pollination treatments. The remainder of ovules were aborted or destroyed by insects or animals during the long developmental phase from April to December. Individuals of O. xylorrhizus commonly produced a single inflorescence with 2-24 flowers (15.3 ± 6.5, n = 33), and 1-43 seeds (12.7 ± 6.7, n = 33) during the study period.

When pollinated with N. undulata, growth of the pollen tube was arrested in the middle of the style and showed abnormal morphology similar to that with N. rustica, but when pollinated with N. paniculata the pollen tube reached near the base of the style and was almost normal in appearance. These observations suggest that the factors responsible for the pollen tube abnormality of N. rustica are derived from the N. undulata genome.

For a given species, analysing overall inbreeding down to its component parts can be useful in explaining how and why inbreeding is maintained in a population. Kalmia latifolia, a long-lived evergreen shrub, was chosen for this study for two reasons: its unique floral morphology suggested that it was specially adapted to assure reproduction in the delayed mode of self-fertilization, and previous studies had suggested that populations that were more limited by pollinators showed higher rates of within-flower self-fertilization when pollinators were excluded. Floral manipulations, controlled pollinations, and paternity analysis were performed to determine the most common form of inbreeding within a flower, among flowers of one individual, or among related individuals. Although plants are capable of setting seed within a flower, the overall rate of inbreeding was low. Among the modes of inbreeding within one individual, a negligible selfing rate among emasculated flowers suggests that selfing is more prevalent within a flower than among flowers on the same plant. In addition, as the multi-locus estimate of inbreeding was less than the single-locus estimate, inbreeding among related individuals also contributes to the natural level of inbreeding.

Birds missed the openings of lipless flowers more often than lipped flowers and thus spent more time attempting to insert their bills into them. Once their bills entered the floral tube, handling times of hummingbirds were significantly longer at lipped than at lipless flowers. Contact durations with anthers and amounts of pollen removed by hummingbirds were significantly greater at lipped than at lipless flowers. Videotapes indicated that lips enhanced pollen removal by slowing a hummingbird's bill insertion into the floral tube, which increased the amount of time that a bird was positioned under a flower's anthers. Unlike the conventional view of hummingbird-flower evolution, which argues for the loss or reduction of lips, our results suggest that lower lips may be maintained in some hummingbird flower species, because they are preadaptations that act as nectar guides for hummingbirds and positioners for optimum pollen removal, in addition to possibly serving as landing platforms or attractants for secondary pollination by bees.",Flower morphology; Hummingbirds; Monarda didyma; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033662288

This study investigated differences in volatile emanation in this species by varying flower color of the sampled material or time of flower collection. Chemical determinations were made by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. The first investigation examined volatile concentration in clones characterized by seven different color ratings. Significant variation among colors was found with a trend for greater emanation from dark- than from light-colored flowers. This trend could bear an evolutionary significance to compensate for the possibly lower visibility of dark flowers in a stand. The second investigation analyzed volatiles from intact inflorescences and from florets and rachises taken separately. A substantial similarity of volatile amount and composition among the three kinds of samples was observed. The final investigation assessed the volatiles produced at different times of the day in each of the first three flowerings of the growing season, during which alfalfa pollination was expected to take place. Confirming previous evidence, temporal patterns of emanation were observed, with a sharp increase from the flowering in May to those in July and August and a strong time-of-day effect during the two summer flowerings (burst of volatiles around midday). The marked seasonal effect appeared somewhat related to temperature increase while the daily variation of emanation in summer paralleled that of solar radiation.

The family has undergone extensive radiation in flower form, leaf shape, habit, and habitat. To analyze the evolution of these distributions and traits, we derived a molecular phylogeny for representatives of 14 genera, based on sequence variation in the chloroplast-encoded ndhF gene. The lowland subfamily Rapateoideae is paraphyletic and includes the largely montane subfamily Saxofridericioideae as a monophyletic subset. Overall, the morphological/anatomical data differ significantly from ndhF sequences in phylogenetic structure, but show a high degree of concordance with the molecular tree in three of four tribes. Branch lengths are consistent with the operation of a molecular clock. Maschalocephalus diverges only slightly from other Monotremae: it is the product of relatively recent, long-distance dispersal, not continental drift - only its habitat atop rifted, nutrient-poor sandstones is vicariant. The family appears to have originated approximately 65 Mya in inundated lowlands of the Guayana Shield, followed by: (1) wide geographic spread of lowland taxa along riverine corridors; (2) colonization of Amazonian white-sand savannas in the western Shield; (3) invasion of tepui habitats with frequent speciation, evolution of narrow endemism, and origin of hummingbird pollination in the western Shield; and (4) reinvasion of lowland white-sand savannas. The apparent timing of speciation in the Stegolepis alliance about 6-12 Mya occurred long after the tepuis began to be dissected from each other as the Atlantic rifted approximately 90 Mya. Given the narrow distributions of most montane taxa, this suggests that infrequent long-distance dispersal combined with vicariance accounts for speciation atop tepuis in the Stegolepis alliance.",Amazonian savannas; Continental drift; Guayana Shield; Hummingbird pollination; ndhF; Rapateaceae; Seed dispersal; Tepuis; Vicariance biogeography,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034496721

Overall, F1 hybrid flowers produced the highest amounts of nectar and nectar sugar over their life spans. These results, together with previously obtained data on pollinator choice in mixed arrays of the same flower classes, show that F1 hybrids between these species do not suffer from reduced attractiveness to pollinators.

In a wild population of L. vulgaris we found that 96 % of open flowers were robbed. Five species of bumblebee were observed foraging on these flowers, although short-tongued species (Bombus lapidarius, B. lucorum and B. terrestris) robbed nectar whilst longer-tongued ones behaved as legitimate pollinators (B. hortorum and B. pascuorum). Nectar rewards were highly variable; on average there was less nectar in robbed than in unrobbed flowers, but this difference was not statistically significant. The proportion Of flowers containing no nectar was significantly higher for robbed flowers compared with unrobbed flowers. Secondary robbers and legitimate pollinators had similar handling times on flowers and, assuming they select flowers at random to forage on, received approximately the same nectar profit per minute, largely because most flowers had been robbed. There was no significant difference in the number of seeds in pods of robbed flowers and in pods of flowers that were artificially protected against robbing. However, more of the robbed flowers set at least some seed than the unrobbed flowers, possibly as a consequence of the experimental manipulation. We suggest that nectar robbing has little effect on plant fecundity because legitimate foragers are present in the population, and that seed predation and seed abortion after fertilization may be more important factors in limiting seed production in this species. © 2000 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",Bombus spp.; Common toadflax; Corolla perforation; Foraging behaviour; Nectar rewards; Pollination; Secondary robbers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034530705

To test predictions concerning the occurrence of pollen limitation, species were classified categorically for six life-history traits (self-compatible vs. self-incompatible, autogamous vs. non-autogamous, specialized vs. unspecialized floral morphology, nectariferous vs. nectarless, monocarpic vs. polycarpic, herbaceous vs. woody) and two ecological conditions (presence in open vs. forested habitats and temperate vs. tropical biomes). Pollen limitation of species in contrasting categories was compared using non-parametric tests (TIPs analysis) and phylogenetically-independent contrasts (PICs). The results of TIPs and PICs analyses were generally congruent, although fewer significant contrasts were evident with PICs, probably because of low statistical power. Overall the results suggest that the influence of phylogenetic history on the intensity of pollen limitation was not particularly strong. Nonetheless, significant variation in the degree of pollen limitation was demonstrated among seven angiosperm families suggesting some phylogenetic component to the phenomenon. With both TIPs and PICs, pollen limitation was less intense in self-compatible and autogamous species. TIPs analysis demonstrated that herbaceous, nectariferous, and temperate species were less likely to be pollen-limited, but using PICs this could only be corroborated for those that were self-incompatible. None of the traits were singularly unambiguous predictors of pollen limitation, possibly reflecting the stochastic nature of pollinator service.

Relationships among other floral traits of animal-pollinated plants, including pollen size, stigma area and depth, and the pollen-bearing area of the pollinator may affect pollen number and also provide a model to examine how change in one trait may elicit change in other traits. The model provides a conceptual framework for appreciating intra- and inter-specific differences in these traits. An equivalent model is presented for wind-pollinated plants. For these plants the distance between putative mates may be the most important factor affecting pollen number. I briefly consider how many pollen grains must reach a stigma to assure fruit set. I use pollen-ovule ratios (P/Os) to examine how breeding system, sexual system, pollen vector, and dispersal unit influence pollen grain number. I also compare the P/Os of plants with primary and secondary pollen presentation and those that provide only pollen as a reward with those that provide nectar as part or all of the reward. There is a substantial decrease in P/O from xenogamy to facultative xenogamy to autogamy. Relative to homoecious species the P/Os of species with most other sexual systems are higher. This suggests that there is a cost associated with changes in sexual system. The P/Os of wind-pollinated plants are substantially higher than those of animal-pollinated plants, and the available data suggest there is little difference in the pollination efficiency of the various animal vectors. The P/Os of plants whose pollen is dispersed in tetrads, polyads, or pollinia are substantially lower than those of species whose pollen is dispersed as monads. There was no difference in the P/Os of plants with primary and secondary pollen presentation. The P/Os of plants that provide only pollen as a reward were higher than those that provide nectar as a reward.

This allows investigation of the effects of tiller flowering phenology on allocation to resource-producing photosynthetic biomass, sexual functions, and thus tiller gender. All tillers of plants of two families collected from individual maternal plants (represented by 33 and 31 plants each) were analyzed. In both families, allocation to aboveground vegetative biomass decreased as flowering was delayed. On average, late-flowering tillers were 65% smaller than the first ones to flower. The proportion of biomass allocated to reproduction significantly increased with the flowering rank of the tillers, suggesting that translocations of assimilates occurred between early- and late-flowering tillers. In both families, late-flowering tillers produced significantly fewer pollen grains per stamen than early-flowering ones, and female reproductive allocation (expressed as seed mass per tiller) was also affected by flowering phenology. Tillers became increasingly female as flowering phenology progressed. This gender variation is possibly adaptive because pollination efficiency is maximized by plant height. Natural selection may favor a shift toward femaleness to maximize reproductive fitness in small, late-developing tillers.",Allocation to sexual functions; Ecology; Gender; Modular structure; Pearl millet; Poaceae; Pollination regime; Reproductive biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034003715

The species showed both protandry and a self-incompatibility mechanism. The stigma was wet and papillate with a distinct groove in the middle. The anthers dehisced prior to anthesis, when the perianth opened. Stigmatic receptivity began 1 d after anthesis, with the greatest pollen germination rates and longest pollen tubes obtained 2 d after anthesis. Nectar secretion commenced with pollen dehiscence and was abundant at anthesis. Most stigmatic grooves opened widely 1-2 d after anthesis and stigmas showed taller papillae and abundant secretion. Controlled pollinations gave a greater fruit set from cross-pollination (5.9 % in April and 17.5 % in July) than open-pollination (0.1 % in April and 3.3 % in July). No fruit set from self-pollination was obtained in April, and very few fruit set for geitonogamous (two out of 1622; 0.1%) or for autogamous (one out of 2707 flowers; 0.04 %) pollination treatments in July. Following self-pollination, growth of pollen tubes was poorer than in other treatments, and was generally arrested in the upper style. Cross-pollinated flowers produced normal and straight pollen tubes, while self-pollen tubes had growth abnormalities. Most of the open-pollinated flowers were found without pollen or with only self-pollen on their stigmas indicating that the amount of cross-pollen reaching the stigma under open-pollination may be a factor limiting seed production. Flowers shed soon after the fertilization phase were those with ungerminated pollen or no pollen. Although a very low rate of selfing may occur, G. robusta presents a self-incompatibility system and allogamy is its primary breeding behaviour.

Mimulus nudatus and Mimulus guttatus are two closely related species that are isolated by a postzygotic barrier operating at the seed provisioning stage. On several sites on the serpentine soils of Lake and Napa counties, California, M. nudatus and M. guttatus live in sympatry and flowering times of the species overlap, so the species are sometimes flowering next to each other. We investigated whether there was any reduction in fertility of M. nudatus and M. guttatus caused by interspecific crosses when growing in sympatry. The pollinators of M. nudatus and M. guttatus were identified. Small sweat bees, Dialictus sp., preferentially visited the smaller flowered M. nudatus species and honey bees, Apis mellifera, preferred the larger flowered M. guttatus. In spite of most pollinator visits being intra-specific, individuals of both bee species made transitions between the Mimulus species. This will result in greater pollen transfer from M. guttatus to M. nudatus than vice versa becausc firstly, M. guttatus produces more pollen and secondly, the sweat bees were too small to touch the stigma of a M. guttatus flower. This asymmetry in gene flow was detected by a greater reduction in viable seed produced by M. nudatus plants when surrounded by M. guttatus plants than vice versa. Only when M. nudatus was the maternal parent could any hybrids be detected in field produced seed. To enable M. nudatus and M. guttatus to co-exist in sympatry, the two species may thus need to be sufficiently ecologically different. Such ecological differentiation was attributed to the greater drought tolerance of M. nudatus. In addition, greenhouse experiments suggested that M. nudatus may have evolved greater tolerance to calcium deficient soils.

The main selective pressures in our study sites were ungulates and pollinators. However, the importance of each kind of interacting organism differed among populations. Our results indicate a selection mosaic among populations of H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada caused by the spatial variation in the relative importance of different interactions as selective pressures. We found two main selective scenarios, depending on the presence or absence of ungulates. In the populations with low ungulate pressure, there was positive phenotypic selection in flower number per plant and in flower density (mediated by nectarivorous pollinators). In the two populations with high ungulate pressure, there was a strong positive, ungulate-mediated selection in thorn density. Our results suggest that the application of SEM to several populations simultaneously monitored might help to isolate the major selection pressures on local populations and identify potential differences in selection among populations, becoming a useful exploratory approach to study the geographical variation of selection in complex systems.",Evolutionary ecology; Multispecific systems; Plant-animal interactions; Spatial variation in selection; Structural equation modeling; Ungulate herbivory,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034022087

Pollen dispensers did not increase fruit-set percentage and yield in the 1: 1: 1 planting design in which (a), pollinizer rows were planted on either side of the main cultivar rows; and (b), bloom overlap was good between the pollinizers (cv.

In contrast, pollen dispensers increased fruit-set percentage and yield in the 1: 2: 1 (one pollinizer row: two Nonpareil rows: one pollinizer row) planting design in which the branches of the two Nonpareil rows facing each other were more distant from effective pollinizers, and bloom overlap between Nonpareil and one of its pollinizers (Mission) was suboptimal. The increase in fruit set and yield, attributable to the use of pollen dispensers occurred primarily on Nonpareil branches facing the adjacent Nonpareil row. The impact of pollen dispensers was significant at 50 m but not at 150 m from the hive.

Males of the melon fly acquire the floral essence and selectively store it in the pheromone gland to attract conspecific females. Males of B. papayae, however, convert zingerone to zingerol in the crop. The latter compound is stored in the rectal gland and subsequently released to attract females.

The PCR-based DNA-fingerprinting technique amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) is a powerful new genetic marker for mating system analysis because it enables the unambiguous assignment of paternity to progeny. Mating patterns following natural pollination were characterised by paternity assignment using AFLP in a natural population of Persoonia mollis subsp. nectens (Proteaceae). This study serves as a comparison for future studies of the mating system of the threatened close relative P. mollis subsp. maxima. Twelve seeds from each of 21 plants (252 seeds in total) were analysed for paternity. Of these, 199 were assigned paternity unambiguously to one of the known potential sires. The remaining 53 seeds were sired by plants outside the known population. Three seeds were presumably selfed as they possessed only maternal alleles, giving a population outcrossing rate of 98.8%. Realised pollen flow distances showed a leptokurtic distribution, with a mean of 24.7 m (s.e. = 2.0; range = 0-137 m). Mean realised pollen dispersal distance to and from each plant varied markedly from 0 to 57.4 m, and was largely influenced by the immediate density of plants. The seeds of all plants had multiple sires, with an average of 5.3 sires for 10 seeds (s.e. = 0.3; range = 2-8). Individual paternal success varied from one to 24 seeds sired (mean = 9.1; s.e. = 1.2). Individual maternal success varied from a percentage fruit set of 5.2 to 37.9 (mean = 18.3; s.e. = 2.1). Male and female reproductive success, measured as the number of seeds sired and percentage fruit set, respectively, was positively correlated.

Science and Management, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia","The literature contains much debate about whether pollen limitation results in a cost to plants. A population of the waratah, Telopea speciosissima (Proteaceae), was found to be pollen limited in 1985. The present study examines the consequences and causes of this pollen limitation. In the 2-3 years following the original experiment, there was no difference in vegetative growth, flower production or fruit production between the hand-pollinated or control plants. There was no difference in inflorescence or fruit production between these two plant groups up to 9 years later. There was no cost of the experimental increase in reproduction. Experiments in 1988 failed to reveal further pollen limitation, suggesting that it may only occur in some years in this population. The retention of self-pollen on stigmas after anthesis was implicated as a cause of the original demonstration of pollen limitation because the waratah is self-incompatible, has highly synchronous flowering and, typical of the Proteaceae, deposits self-pollen on its stigmas at anthesis. These traits should provide a continuing influence on fruit set in all years. However, plants did not produce more fruits when the self-pollen was experimentally removed. This suggests that the waratah experiences pollen limitation in years when pollination and nutrient levels are not in equilibrium. Further studies of pollen limitation are required to fully understand the fitness consequences of this phenomenon, and to fully describe its frequency among different plant families and among plants with differing flowering strategies.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034029232

The cerrados are Neotropical savanna plant formations in Central Brazil.

Despite the marked winter/dry - summer/wet seasonality, different species were encountered in flower throughout the year, although with a peak at the end of the dry season. Seven pollination guilds were identified, ranging from very small insects (body size less than 5 mm) to bats, but bee pollination was predominant, and overall pollination biology of the cerrado community was similar to that reported for evergreen neotropical forests. Most species were outbreeding in that self-pollinations yielded very few fruits, but heteromorphic and homomorphic self-incompatibility were rare and control of selfing was commonly exercised by ill-defined post-zygotic mechanisms. The results indicated that the reproductive biology of woody cerrado species is not markedly different from other tropical forest communities and suggested the adaptation to seasonal habitats did not always lead to simplification or changes in breeding features of the cerrado species.",Breeding system; Cerrado; Community ecology; Guilds; Pollination; Savanna,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034484986

The present analysis supports a narrow conception of Durioneae (excluding Camptostemon and Papuodendron) and confirms a close relationship with Helicteres, Reevesia, Ungeria, and Triplochiton (all of traditional Sterculiaceae). Phylogenetic relationships within Durioneae were inferred from a combined analysis of ndhF and ITS sequences. These data suggest that Neesia is sister to a clade comprising all other five genera of core Durioneae, and that Coelostegia + Kostermansia form a clade that is sister to Cullenia + Boschia + Durio. Various morphological features support these relationships. However, characters usually considered diagnostic for the entirety of Durioneae, such as a densely lepidote lower leaf surface and uni- or polylocular anthers, appear to be apomorphic within this clade. Likewise, spiny fruits and large arils covering the seeds are not plesiomorphic for Durioneae, in contradiction to Corner's classic Durian Theory. The phylogeny suggests that bat- and bird-pollination evolved from beetle-pollination and that this transition was coincident with extensive androecial modification. Similarities due to convergent evolution of floral traits in relation to pollination by birds and mammals probably account for the erroneous, traditional placement of Durioneae in Bombacaceae.",Bombacaceae; Durian Theory; Durioneae; Floral evolution; ITS; Malvaceae; ndhF; Phylogenetics; Pollination; Sterculiaceae; Systematic s,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033804813

Several of the senior members had a profound influence upon breeding theory: J.K. Nestler, Professor of Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Olomouc, left a collection of influential writings. In the context of sheep breeding he defined 'inheritance capacity' (Vererbungsfahigkeit), 'hereditary history' (Vererbungsgeschichte) and 'developmental history' (Entwicklungsgeschichte). His linking of the last two terms, as two sides of the same coin, puts Mendel's use of the second one in context. Professor F. Diebl taught the same topics as Nestler at the Philosophical Institute in Brno, with a bias towards plants. Diebl's lectures were attended by Mendel who gained top marks in three examinations. Diebl stressed the importance of artificial pollination to produce new varieties and recognised peas and beans as suitable subjects for the procedure. Prelate Cyrill Napp, abbot before Mendel, had a deep interest in heredity and how it was transmitted through both sexes. He generously supported Mendel's research. A happy blend of economic and academic influences, together with original talent and inner drive, led to Mendel's great discovery (C) 2000 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.",Artificial pollination; Brno; Developmental history; Diebl; Inheritance capacity; Mendel; Napp; Nestler; Sheep breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033638975

The purpose was to test the hypothesis that an artificial habitat would have fewer or less effective pollinator visits than natural vernal pools and that, as a result, the plants would have lower fecundity. The effect of differences in flowering phenology and plant size among pool types on pollinator visitation and seed set was also evaluated. The most frequent insect visitors to P. abramsii flowers were the Eurasian honey bee, Apis mellifera, two anthophorid bees, Exomalopsis nitens and E. torticornis, and three species of bee flies, of which Bombylius facialis was by far the most abundant. All species of insect visitors displayed density-dependent foraging on P. abramsii, with greater numbers of visits per unit area where flower density was greater. Nevertheless, visits per flower were negatively correlated with flower density. Flowering phenology of P. abramsii was delayed in most created compared to natural vernal pools, which affected the frequency by species of insect visitors to created compared with natural vernal pools. Peak flower densities were significantly lower in created than in natural vernal pools. The created pools had more visits per flower. Plants were smaller in created pools compared to natural pools, and seed production was positively correlated to plant size. Seed set in P. abramsii was greater than one per plant in both created and natural pools but was significantly lower in created vernal pools. Most of this difference could be attributed to the larger size of plants in the natural pools. We conclude that pollinator limitation should not preclude the sparser populations of smaller plants in the created pools from having a positive growth rate. Subsequent establishment and persistence of populations in a majority of created basins on this site confirms this assertion.",Apis mellifera; Bombylius facialis; Density dependence; Endangered; Exomalopsis spp.; Flowering phenology; Insect visitation; Pogogyne abramsii; Pollination; San Diego County; Seed set; Vernal pool,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033922045

It is concluded that RAPD fingerprint analysis is a suitable technique to discover identity or non-identity in H. perforatum populations.

K7L 3N6, Canada","The fitness consequences of self-fertilization are largely determined by how self-pollination occurs. Within-flower self-pollination (autogamy) may be advantageous, since it can provide reproductive assurance without much seed or pollen discounting. In contrast, between-flower self-pollination (geitonogamy) provides no reproductive assurance and can cause severe seed and pollen discounting. I used floral emasculations with marker-gene analysis to estimate the components of self-fertilization in a tristylous, self-compatible, clonal, mass-flowering plant, Decodon verticillatus. This species produces 30% of progeny through selfing. I assessed the contribution of autogamy to selfing by comparing pollen deposition, seed production, and the selfing rate of flowers emasculated before anther dehiscence with intact flowers. Emasculation had no effect on pollen deposition, caused a small increase in seed production, and only reduced self-fertilization by 14%, suggesting that most selfing occurs through geitonogamy. Geitonogamy can be due to self-pollination between flowers on the same branch, different flowering branches of the same plant, or different ramets of the same clonal genet. I assessed the contribution of within-branch geitonogamy by emasculating all flowers on a branch, which reduced selfing from 0.29 ± 0.03 (mean ± 1 SE) to 0.19 ± 0.04. Between-branch geitonogamy was estimated by comparing the selfing rate of plants with only a single flowering branch (0.16 ± 0.07) to plants with multiple flowering branches (0.27 ± 0.04). Selfing rates of individual branches also correlated positively with the daily number of flowers open on nonfocal branches of the same plant. Between-ramet geitonogamy was suggested by significant self-fertilization by single-branch plants, even when all flowers were emasculated (0.10 ± 0.07). Selfing rates of individual branches also correlated negatively with measures of local clonal diversity. Based on these results, autogamy accounts for only 18 ± 14% of self-fertilization, with the remainder (82 ± 17%) due to geitonogamy, which occurs about equally through pollination within branches (31 ± 22%), between branches (38 ± 32%), and between ramets (31 ± 28%). Because selfing occurs mostly through geitonogamy and is associated with strong inbreeding depression, it seems disadvantageous. Selfing in D. verticillatus has probably not been selected directly, but is a by-product of self-compatibility, large plant size, mass-flowering, and clonal propagation.",Autogamy; Clonal reproduction; Decodon verticillatus; Geitonogamy; Inbreeding; Lythraceae; Marker genes; Mass-flowering; Mating systems; Pollination; Self-fertilization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033918412

Flowers are hermaphroditic, protandrous, offer nectar, and exhibit secondary pollen presentation involving pollen collecting hairs on the style. These features imply allogamy and biotic pollination. However, male and female phases overlap and no effective pollinators were observed. Experimental data indicate these taxa are self-compatible and facultatively autogamous, a conclusion also suggested by the pollen/ovule ratios. Selfing is accomplished when the stigmatic lobes reflex and touch the style, except for W. berteroi where they do not reflex completely. Autogamy is accomplished in the latter when pollen grains deposited on the inner surface of the corolla throat by the 'pollen brush' are gathered by stigmatic lobes when shaken by wind. The degree of autogamy, and perhaps self-compatibility, seems to be inconstant, as implied by the variable natural seed set (overall range 21-188 seeds per fruit). A mixed mating system - primarily outcrossing/entomophilous, but also autogamous-must have been present in the continental ancestors of these taxa.

Commercial bumble bee colonies were used to deliver the biocontrol agent in 1994 and 1995 and five-frame nuclear honey bee hives were used in 1995- 1997. Each honey bee exiting the hive carried about 1 x 105 colony-forming units of T. harzianum, with the majority found on the bee's legs (58%). Flowers collected from the bee-delivered treatment generally had half the density of T. harzianum as those from the sprayed treatment. However, during the 4 years of this study, T. harzianum delivered by bumble bees or honey bees provided better Botrytis control than that applied as a spray. In addition, the bee-delivered T. harzianum provided the same or a better level of control of Botrytis as commercial fungicides applied at bloom. Strawberries collected from the bee-visited treatments averaged 22% more seeds and weighed between 26 and 40% more than berries in nonvisited treatments. The number of seeds per berry and berry weight were reduced by 7-12% in plots treated with fungicides and visited by bees, indicating that the use of some commercial fungicides at bloom may impact pollination and yield. Bee delivery of T. harzianum 1295-22 is a viable option for strawberry growers interested in controlling Botrytis with minimal fungicide use.

The death of petal cells is preceded by a loss of membrane permeability, due in part to increases in reactive oxygen species that are in turn related to up-regulation of oxidative enzymes and to a decrease in activity of certain protective enzymes. The senescence process also consists of a loss of proteins caused by activation of various proteinases, a loss of nucleic acids as nucleases are activated, and enzyme-mediated alterations of carbohydrate polymers. Many of the genes for these senescence-associated enzymes have been cloned. In some flowers, the degradative changes of petal cells are initiated by ethylene; in others, abscisic acid may play a role. External factors such as pollination, drought and temperature stress also affect senescence, perhaps by interacting with hormones normally produced by the flowers. Signal transduction may involve G-proteins, calcium activity changes and the regulation of protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The efficacy of the floral system as well as the research tools now available make it likely that important information will soon be added to our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in petal cell death.",Flower petals; Hormones; Membrane permeability; Pollination; Programmed cell death; Senescence; Senescence-associated genes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034476834

Mutualisms involving animalmediated pollination and seed dispersal, and symbioses between plant roots and microbiota often facilitate invasions. The spread of many alien plants, particularly woody ones, depends on pollinator mutualisms. Most alien plants are well served by generalist pollinators (insects and birds), and pollinator limitation does not appear to be a major barrier for the spread of introduced plants (special conditions relating to Ficus and orchids are described). Seeds of many of the most notorious plant invaders are dispersed by animals, mainly birds and mammals. Our review supports the view that tightly coevolved, plant-vertebrate seed dispersal systems are extremely rare. Vertebrate-dispersed plants are generally not limited reproductively by the lack of dispersers. Most mycorrhizal plants form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which, because of their low specificity, do not seem to play a major role in facilitating or hindering plant invasions (except possibly on remote islands such as the Galapagos which are poor in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi). The lack of symbionts has, however, been a major barrier for many ectomycorrhizal plants, notably for Pinus spp. in parts of the southern hemisphere. The roles of nitrogen-fixing associations between legumes and rhizobia and between actinorhizal plants and Frankia spp. in promoting or hindering invasions have been virtually ignored in the invasions literature. Symbionts required to induce nitrogen fixation in many plants are extremely widespread, but intentional introductions of symbionts have altered the invasibility of many, if not most, systems. Some of the world's worst invasive alien species only invaded after the introduction of symbionts. Mutualisms in the new environment sometimes re-unite the same species that form partnerships in the native range of the plant. Very often, however, different species are involved, emphasizing the diffuse nature of many (most) mutualisms. Mutualisms in new habitats usually duplicate functions or strategies that exist in the natural range of the plant. Occasionally, mutualisms forge totally novel combinations, with profound implications for the behaviour of the introduced plant in the new environment (examples are seed dispersal mutualisms involving wind-dispersed pines and cockatoos in Australia; and mycorrhizal associations involving plant roots and fungi). Many ecosystems are becoming more susceptible to invasion by introduced plants because: (a) they contain an increasing array of potential mutualistic partners (e.g. generalist frugivores and pollinators, mycorrhizal fungi with wide host ranges, rhizobia strains with infectivity across genera); and (b) conditions conducive for the establishment of various alienalien synergisms are becoming more abundant. Incorporating perspectives on mutualisms in screening protocols will improve (but not perfect) our ability to predict whether a given plant species could invade a particular habitat. © 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biological invasions; Global change; Invasibility; Mycorrhiza; Nitrogen fixation; Pollination; Prediction; Risk assessment; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034011761

Fruit-set was significantly higher in the unburned area for three out of the four plant species. The lower fruit-set in the burned area was possibly the result of low activity of solitary bees which are the main effective pollinators of the examined species. We hypothesize that the populations of the solitary bees were diminished or extirpated either directly by the fire, or indirectly by the scarcity of nectar in the early post-fire years due to dominance of young pine and Cistus spp. seedlings.

The probability of a pollen tube growing through the style was higher for male than for hermaphrodite pollen donors, and males sired twice as many fruits as hermaphrodites.

M5S 3B2, Canada","We recognize four major classes of stylar polymorphisms in flowering plants: The heterostylous conditions distyly and tristyly, stigma-height dimorphism, and enantiostyly. These polymorphisms differ in the relative positions of sexual organs and in the number of floral morphs that occur within populations. In heterostyly, stigma and anther heights are reciprocally positioned in the two or three floral morphs; in stigma-height dimorphism the two morphs vary in style length but not anther height; whereas in enantiostyly, flowers differ in whether the style is deflected to the left- or right-side of the flower. We distinguish two forms of enantiostyly depending on whether both style orientations occur on the same plant (monomorphic enantiostyly) or on different plants (dimorphic enantiostyly). Stylar polymorphisms have originated independently in numerous animal-pollinated flowering plant families. Both heterostyly and enantiostyly involve distinct floral syndromes suggesting functional convergence in which the position of the pollinator is important for pollen dispersal and male reproductive success. The function of stigma-height dimorphism remains enigmatic although the occurrence of populations with 1 : 1 style-morph ratios suggest that, like heterostyly and dimorphic enantiostyly, they are maintained by disassortative mating. We interpret these sexual polymorphisms as floral designs that increase the precision of cross-pollination and reduce lost mating opportunities associated with self-interference, especially geitonogamy.

However, highly effective pollination by bumblebees in alpine populations can compensate for low visitation rates. In this study we hypothesized that, because of highly effective pollination by bumblebees, alpine populations of Campanula rotundifolia would not experience more frequent cycles of pollinator limitation than low-elevation populations and would therefore exhibit comparable levels of genetic variability and inbreeding to those found in foothill populations. Enzyme electrophoresis was used to assess genetic variability at nine putative loci in alpine and foothill populations of C. rotundifolia in Colorado. Genetic variability in C. rotundifolia was found to be comparable to that reported for other long-lived herbaceous perennials. Measures of genetic variability and fixation indices did not differ between high- and low-elevation populations and were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg expectations.

A comparison was also made between plants of 3 and 4 years of age at two field locations. The duration of flowering was 4 weeks and was similar in plants of both age groups grown in the two environments; however, 4-year-old plants produced an average of 40% more flowers (100 per plant in total) compared to 3-year-old plants. Flowers were comprised of five greenish-colored petals, five stamens, and an inferior ovary consisting of predominantly two fused carpels and stigmatic lobes. Anthers dehisced in staggered succession within individual flowers, and flowering began with the outermost edge of the umbel and proceeded inwards. At any given time during the 4-week flowering period, 10% of the flowers in an umbel had recently opened and were producing pollen. Stigma receptivity was associated with separation of the stigmatic lobes; this occurred at some time after pollen release. Growth of pollen tubes through the style in naturally pollinated flowers was most evident when the stigmatic lobes had separated. The proportion of flowers that developed into mature berries (pollination success rate) was in the range of 41% to 68% for both 3-year-old and 4-year-old plants. However, when the inflorescence was bagged during the flowering period, berry formation was increased by 13% to 21% in 4-year-old plants, depending on location. A majority of the berries (92% to 99%) contained one or two seeds in an almost equal frequency, with the remaining berries containing three seeds. In 4-year-old plants, the frequency of two-seeded berries was increased by 13% by bagging the inflorescence. These observations indicate that P. quinquefolius is highly self-fertile and that several physiological and environmental factors can affect seed production.",Berries; Flower development; Pollination; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033857572

Although clonal reproduction in fertile, sexually reproducing hybrid populations could have important evolutionary consequences, little attention has been paid to quantifying this parameter in such populations. In the present study, we examined the frequency and spatial patterning of clonal reproduction in two Louisiana iris hybrid populations. Allozyme analysis of both populations revealed relatively high levels of genotypic diversity. However, a considerable amount of clonality was apparent. Nearly half of all genets (47%) in one population and more than half (61%) in the other had multiple ramets. Furthermore, both populations exhibited relatively high levels of genetic structuring, a pattern that resulted from the aggregation of clonal ramets. The occurrence of clonal reproduction in hybrid populations could not only facilitate introgression through an increase in the number of flowering ramets per genet and/or the survivorship of early generation hybrids, but might also influence the mating system of such populations. Any potential increase in the selfing rate due to cross-pollination among ramets of the same genet may, in turn, increase the likelihood of homoploid hybrid speciation.",Clonal reproduction; Clonal structure; Genotypic diversity; Hybrid speciation; Louisiana irises; Natural hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034026045

Visits by bumble bees, the primal pollinators, were significantly affected by plant size measured as the number of flowers, and differences in visit rates among plants were explained by size differences among these. On average, larger plants had bigger corollas. The mean corolla area affected pollen deposition positively whereas deposition did neither affect seed set (number per flower) nor seed weight. Insects reaction to corolla size was dependent on plant size, and thus we found the effect of corolla size on pollen deposition to decline with plant size. Instead pollen deposition per plant seemed to be correlated to overall floral display. We argued that resource status of the individual plants could explain corolla size and seed set variation.

Plants from an autogamous population of Arenaria uniflora (Caryophyllaceae) exhibit complete pollen discounting relative to closely related outcrossers, as do morphologically intermediate F1 hybrids between the two populations. However, the low cumulative male fitness of hybrids probably results from reduced pollen number or competitive ability, rather than a nonlinear relationship with floral morphology. When surrounded by selfers, plants from the outcrosser population self-fertilize at nearly the same rate as selfers (&gt;80%), but have much lower self male fitness due to reduced fruit set. Because outcross siring success is also extremely low (&lt;8%) in this treatment, these mate-limited outcrossers are at male fitness disadvantage to both pseudocleistogamous selfers and nonlimited outcrossers.

Evidence for the operation of such a mechanism is rare in this context, however. Here, I report an experiment that used oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv. Westar) as the basis of a model system in which the spatial disposition of flowers' sexual organs was manipulated in order to characterize the relationship between form and function. Specifically, individual flowers were manipulated by replacing a section of the style with a length of fine wire in order to produce flowers with pistils of various lengths. The pollination performance of these virgin, model flowers was then assessed by measuring the amount of pollen removed and deposited during a single bumblebee visit. There was no evidence that pollen removal was affected by pistil length. Variation in pistil length, however, was associated with a pronounced optimum in pollen deposition, which was attained by only a narrow range of pistil variants of intermediate length. These results suggest that stabilizing selection may maintain the architectural invariability of animal-pollinated flowers.","Bombus; Brassica; Bumblebees; Flower architecture, stabilizing selection; Formfunction relationship; Pistil length, optimum; Pollination performance; Stabilizing selection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033749215

Pollen odor, which originates from pollenkitt, comprises volatiles that belong to the same chemical classes found in flower scents, that are in species-specific mixtures, and that contrast with odors of other floral parts. Pollen can also take up volatiles from surrounding floral odors, but this adsorption is selective and varies among species. Pollen odors are more pronounced in insect- than bird- or wind-pollinated plants, suggesting that volatile emission evolved in part under selection to attract pollinators. Pollen-feeding insects can perceive pollen odor and use it to discriminate between different pollen types and host plants. Pollen odor influences bee foraging, including the location of pollen sources, discrimination of flowers with different amounts of pollen, and host-plant recognition by pollen-specialist species. In the few wind-pollinated plants studied, odors of male flowers or pollen are comparatively high in ?-methyl alcohols and ketones; these volatiles may serve in pollen defense, with some known to repel insects. Pollen odor often includes chemicals with documented defense activity, which is probably aimed mainly at nonpollinator pollen-feeding insects and pathogens; an involvement in pollen allelopathy is also possible. Pollen volatiles comprise chemically diverse compounds that may play multiple roles, and their emission in pollen odor undoubtedly evolved under the principle, and often conflicting, selective pressures to both protect the male gametophyte and increase its dispersal by animals.",Flowers; Plant defense; Pollen foraging; Pollenkitt; Pollination; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033938781

Sixteen years of pollen counts were used. The start date of the pollen season in this period varied between 26th February and 7th April. Chilling requirements and heat accumulation were taken into account although no significant correlation between chilling hours and the start date was observed. Five different predictive methods based on heat accumulation were compared in this paper: 1) Number of days over a threshold; 2) Heat Units (accumulated daily mean temperature after deducting a base temperature); 3) Growing Degrees Days (Snyder 1988), as a measure of physiological growing time; 4) Accumulated maximum temperatures; and 5) Mean maximum temperature. Results indicated that the optimum base temperature for heat accumulation was 11°C. This threshold was used in the first three methods mentioned above. Good statistical results were obtained with the five methods, yielding high levels of explanation (p = 99%). Nevertheless, the most accurate method appeared to be the Growing Degree Days (GDD°) method, which indicated that a mean of 127.3 GDD° must be accumulated from the end of the chilling period up to the beginning of the Quercus pollen season in Córdoba (South West Spain).

Nac. de Córdoba-CONICET, Casilla de Correo 495, 5000 Cordoba, Argentina","Based on the assumptions that pollen tube length is predetermined by provisions in the pollen and that it is a function of pistil length, I hypothesise that species with longer pistils will have larger pollen grains than species with shorter pistils, and that pistil length and pollen size will be positively correlated in a linear manner. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between pollen grain volume and pistil length was compared in 43 Asteraceae species from Argentina. A positive linear correlation was found between pollen volume and pistil length. This correlation remained significant even after potential effects of phylogenetic relatedness were removed. The maintenance of this correlation suggests that in Asteraceae the association between pistil length and pollen volume may reflect a functional rather than a phyletic relationship. In addition, the pistil length: pollen volume ratio (PPR) was analysed in relation to the phylogenetic position of the species. High values of PPR would imply a reduction of the male gametophyte in relation to the minimal volume that a pollen grain must have to grow and fertilise an ovule. Thus, the general pattern of pollen volume reduction in relation to pistil length previously found among many angiosperm families will be also present within a family, i.e., PPR values of derived Asteraceae would be higher than those of basal species. Results indicated that reduction of pollen volume in derived Asteraceae was three times greater than the concomitant shortening of pistil length. Consequently, PPR increased with the phylogenetic position of the taxa. This work supports the correlation between pistil and pollen characters previously found for other plant families and confirms the influence of post-pollination processes on pollen size evolution.",Common ancestry effects; Pollen diameter; Pollen evolution; Pollen tube growth; Post-pollination processes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033924322

Except for the ovary, flowers on plants from self-pollinating populations typically have shorter floral organs and have anthers that produce less pollen. A comparative study of flower development, including organogenesis, histogenesis, organ growth, and allometry, was undertaken to determine the stage in development at which differences in floral form arise. Growth rates of flower buds from 3.0 mm in length to maturity are the same in the two flower types. Earlier stages were not accessible for direct measures of growth. Growth rates of ovaries from 1.0 mm in length to anthesis are the same for both flower types. Since ovaries achieve the same final size in both flower types at anthesis, the ovary was used as an index organ by which to measure the growth of other organs in the flower from a bud size of 3.0 mm. The size of sepals, petals, long anthers, and styles in selfing flowers are smaller than in the outcrossing flowers of the same ovary length as measured using dissected buds, scanning electron micrographs, and histological sections. Flower primordia are initially the same size in the two floral types, so divergence between them can be documented in a developmental study. The earliest detected differences in organ size and form between flower types occurs after all the organs are initiated in a bud ca. 1 mm long with an ovary length of 0.3 mm. Since the allometric relationship of the organs to the ovary is the same in both flower types in buds >3 mm, the mature differences must arise during this developmental window after organ initiation and just before organ differentiation. Significant differences in pollen production in the two flower types can be attributed to formation of fewer sporogenous cells in the self-pollinating flower.",Breeding system evolution; Clarkia tembloriensis; Evolution of self-pollination; Flower development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033864760

Each monoecious fig species also shelters a community of nonpollinating chalcids, composed of both gallmakers and parasitoids. The few previous studies that took these species into account aimed at determining their potential effect on the mutualism. To go further, we argue that the fig wasps represent an interesting model for studies of community ecology. Figs and fig wasps of different groups were studied in Cote d'Ivoire to quantify local ecological interactions. Regardless of their fig host or taxonomical position, we identified three ecological groups of nonpollinating fig wasps on the basis of their timing of oviposition in the fig and on their oviposition behavior. Pollinating and nonpollinating fig wasps were shown to interact intimately, and to have a significant effect on the host plant in at least some cases. Each species of the community seems to preferentially oviposit in a part of the female flowers, depending on their depth inside the fig. Convergence in fig exploitation thus exists in various chalcid lineages, and the community structure and organization are very similar between fig species. Concepts developed in parasitoid community ecology could now be tested on this promising model.",Community structure; Competition; Ficus; Fig; Gallmakers; Guild; Interactions; Mut ualism; Niche; Nonpollinating fig wasps; Parasitoids; Path analysis; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033782482

The approach is based on closely linked, highly polymorphic codominant microsatellite markers. Initially the close linkages between three previously mapped microsatellite loci were confirmed by studies of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Then an approach to track the pollen donors contributing to maternal half-sib families (open-pollinated families) was developed by analysing haplotype arrays of closely linked microsatellite markers transmitted from the fathers to the progeny. Simulated data of five linked microsatellite loci segregating in eight open-pollinated families were used to study the relationship between the number of paternal chromosomes detected by this 'haplotype approach' and the number of diploid fathers contributing to the families. The results showed that the number of diploid pollen donors can be expressed as an exponential function of the number of paternal chromosomes inferred from the progeny. The 95% confidence interval of this regression function is used to determine the minimum number of fathers contributing to a genotyped open-pollinated family of Quercus robur. Finally this open-pollinated family is used to demonstrate the resolution obtained with the 'haplotype approach'. Six independent microsatellite loci were used to study relatedness among all pairs of pollen gametes that share a haplotype of three linked markers. The results suggest that the majority of such gametes are identical by descent from the same father. The 'haplotype approach' presented here can be used to monitor the number of contributing pollen donors in commercial seedlot samples from oak or any other outcrossing tree species for which closely linked, highly polymorphic, codominant genetic markers are available.",Linkage disequilibrium; Microsatellites; Oak; Quercus; Relatedness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034063516

During maturation, the pollen coat becomes modified, and the vegetative cell cytoplasm accumulates several types of reserve substances. In the vegetative cell cytoplasm, starch is quickly utilised whereas lipid inclusions of different dimensions, shape and composition occur during pollen maturation. Pollen from opened anthers have a thin pollen coat; the cytoplasm has mostly lipid reserves, and many small vesicles and vacuoles. It is similar in size or larger than pollen located inside the anther, and its viability does not decrease until one day after anther dehiscence. Large osmiophilic bodies, different from those of the vegetative cell cytoplasm, are present in the generative cell cytoplasm starting from the first stage of pollen development. The poorly developed pollen coat in pollen from opened anthers suggests that it plays a minor role in attracting insects for pollination.

Populations of the two species maintained low levels of all ozyme diversity (expected heterozygosity = 0.061 for A. japonica and 0.048 for A. crenata). The average genotypic diversity index for the two Ardisia species is also low, and the degree of population differentiation observed in A. japonica was high. It is suggested that populations are established (colonized) from only a few seeds via long-distance seed dispersal by birds. The resulting adult populations would consist of only a few reproductive adults (founders) and the population will experience a genetic bottleneck coupled with limited migration. The process results in lower genetic diversity within populations and increased genetic diversity among populations found in A. japonica. Genotypic diversity among populations of A. japonica was large, and no &#147;widespread genotypes&#148; were observed. These findings suggest that the present populations of A. japonica might have been founded from sexually produced seed rather than asexually by fragmentation and dispersal of preexisting clones. For A. crenata, however, one widespread genotype occurred at a high frequency due to extensively clonal spread in populations, resulting in the low genetic differentiation among populations (GST). Thus, allozyme data suggest that the pattern of colonization and clonal reproduction rather than gene flow are important factors in shaping population genetic structure in Ardisia species. © 2000 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024510155

Two putative single-copy RFLP probes revealed secondary loci in this wide cross. Recovery of the L. esculentum genome was more rapid than expected, with an average value in the BC2 generation of 97.8%, versus the expected value of 87.5%. This was due to widespread segregation distortion that favored L. esculentum alleles as well as a tendency for plants homozygous for introgressed segments to be partially or completely male-sterile, thereby preventing the fixation of S. lycopersicoides markers in many lines. Despite these difficulties, nearly every S. lycopersicoides marker (or approximately 98% of the genome, measured in centi Morgans) was represented in at least 1 backcross-inbred line, with only a region on chromosome 4L missing from the population as a whole. Although the extent of transmission and fixation of introgressed segments varied according to chromosome, overall approximately 66% of the S. lycopersicoides genome was represented by homozygous introgressions with sufficient fertility to reproduce by self-pollination. An excess of terminal (vs. interstitial) segments was noted, and putative heterozygous substitutions for chromosomes 6, 7, 8, and 10 were found. Recombination within certain introgressed regions was reduced over 100-fold. These backcross-inbred lines are expected to facilitate the genetic analysis of traits identified in S. lycopersicoides and their transfer into horticultural tomatoes.",Comparative mapping; Homoeologous recombination; Segregation distortion1; Solanaceae; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033954876

To test for such costs, I subjected plants of two populations to flower or perianth removal and then evaluated allocation to subsequently produced flowers, fruits, and seeds. Based on data from a flower removal experiment, the amount of resources allocated to flowers during the staminate and pistillate stages was about half as great as the amount of resources devoted to fruit maturation. Plants on which the perianths were removed at the bud stage produced more flowers or had a higher percent fruit set and seed viability than did plants from which the perianths were removed immediately after the growth of the sepals and petals. Removal of fully developed perianths at the onset of flowering increased flower number, fruit set, or seed viability relative to plants on which the perianths remained until senescence. Some of these effects were population specific, but plants in low and high watering treatments responded similarly to perianth removal. Given these observations, I propose that the costs of producing and maintaining floral structures represent a significant drain on the water and/or energy budget of a N. degenii plant and that some trade-offs may be specific to the population in which they have been detected.",Floral evolution; Nigella degenii; Pollination; Reproduction; Resource allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033695231

Measurements included height and dbh for 5 consecutive years, number and size of leaflets per compound leaf in 1991, thorns in 1992 and 1993, and trunk form in 1993. Data were subjected to analysis of variance while heritabilities and phenotypic as well as genetic correlations were estimated. It was found that the 14 families had a high growth rate during the study period but differences began to be insignificant for height in 1995 and dbh in 1993. The ratio of family coefficient of variation to coefficient of variation was 1/3.6. Individual heritability was higher for dbh than for height while family heritability was higher than individual one in both traits. Number of leaflets per compound leaf ranged from one to 27 and the size of thorns from 0 mm to 25 mm. The variation was much smaller within families for both leaflets and thorns. On the basis of leaf morphology and thorns two types of trees were distinguished: oligophyllous, with few but large leaflets and small thorns, and polyphyllous with many but small leaflets and long thorns. Most of Pearson correlation coefficients between the various growth and morphological characters were statistically significant, but only a few of them were high enough to explain a fair amount of the variation between the various characters. On the contrary, the correlations between height and diameter were much higher while the genetic correlations between various ages of the same factor were positive and indicate their value for early testing and selection.",Diameter; Genetic correlations; Greece; Height; Leaf morphology; Phenotypic correlations; Robinia pseudoacacia var. monophylla; Thorns,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033931365

The F2 segregating population derived from a self-pollinated F1 hybrid individual of the cross Medicago sativa ssp. quasifalcata x Medicago sativa ssp. coerulea. This mapping population was the same one which had been used for the construction of our previous alfalfa genetic map. The genetic analyses were performed by using maximum-likelihood equations and related computer programs. The improved genetic map of alfalfa in its present form contains 868 markers (four morphological, 12 isozyme, 26 seed protein, 216 RFLP, 608 RAPD and two specific PCR markers) in eight linkage groups. Of the markers 80 are known genes, including 2 previously cytologically localized genes, the rDNA and the ?-tubulin loci. The genetic map covers 754 centimorgans (cM) with an average marker density of 0.8/cM. The correlation between the physical and genetic distances is about 1000-1300 kilobase pairs per centi-Morgan. In this map, the linkage relationships of some markers on linkage groups 6, 7, and 8 are different from the previously published one. The cause of this discrepancy was that the genetic linkage of markers displaying distorted segregation (characterized by an overwhelming number of heterozygous individuals) had artificially linked genetic regions that turned out to be unlinked. To overcome the disadvantageous influence of the excess number of heterozygous genotypes on the recombination fractions, we used recently described maximum-likelihood formulas and colormapping, which allowed us to exclude the misleading linkages and to estimate the genetic distances more precisely.",Distorted segregation; Linkage map; Medicago sativa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034009419

We assessed floral trade-offs by imposing two generations of selection on flower size and number in a greenhouse population of bee-pollinated Eichhornia paniculata. We established a control line and two replicate selection lines of 100 plants each for large flowers (S+), small flowers (S-), and many flowers per inflorescence (N+). We compared realized heritabilities and genetic correlations with estimates based on restricted-maximum-likelihood (REML) analysis of pedigrees. Responses to selection confirmed REML heritability estimates (flower size, h2 = 0.48; daily flower number, h2 = 0.10; total flower number, h2 = 0.23). Differences in nectar, pollen, and ovule production between S+ and S- lines supported an overall divergence in investment per flower. Both realized and REML estimates of the genetic correlation between daily and total flower number were r = 1.0. However, correlated responses to selection were inconsistent in their support of a trade-off. In both S- lines, correlated increases in flower number indicated a genetic correlation of r = -0.6 between flower size and number. In contrast, correlated responses in N+ and S+ lines were not significant, although flower size decreased in one N+ line. In addition, REML estimates of genetic correlations between flower size and number were positive, and did not differ from zero when variation in leaf area and age at first flowering were taken into account. These results likely reflect the combined effects of variation in genes controlling the resources available for flowering and genes with opposing effects on flower size and number. Our results suggest that the short-term evolution of floral display is not necessarily constrained by trade-offs between flower size and number, as is often assumed.",Artificial selection; Eichhornia paniculata; Nectar; Ovules; Pollen; Quantitative genetics; Trade-offs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033710182

The five remaining populations from the western flank of the Pachuca and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges (Mexico) showed cytotype B + 6m+8sm+2st, having one pair of chromosomes with a satellite. The analysis of meiosis revealed heterozygotic exchanges. Analysis of MI showed three heteromorphic bivalents in cytotypes A and B.

Cells with two bridges (SAB aberrations) were observed in cytotype B.The intraspecific cytological and genical differentiation of cytotypes A and B is probably the result of geographical isolation between populations of E. nana. This suggests that this species is undergoing through a major process of genomic differentiation involving heterozygotic chromosomal rearrangements; which favors a process of speciation between both cytotypes without the occurrence of significant morphological changes.

Each provenance of C. maculata, C. variegata and C. henryi was represented by 10 seedlings from each of eight open-pollinated families, while the two C. citriodora provenances were each represented by 40 seedlings from a provenance bulk seedlot. Excised leaf discs from seedlings hardened by exposure to the Canberra winter were subjected to test temperatures of -4.2, -6.1 and -8.0°C. Damage to the discs was estimated by the electrical conductivity of leachate produced by soaking the disks in water after exposure to freezing temperatures. Exposure to -6.1°C for 1 h produced leachate conductivities corresponding to 37% of discs receiving lethal injury and gave good discrimination between tolerant and susceptible material. There were significant differences in frost tolerance between species, provenances within species, and between open-pollinated families within provenances. Corymbia variegata displayed significantly greater frost tolerance than the other three species. Species rankings were consistent across the three test temperatures. Inland, high altitude provenances of C. variegata and C. maculata had greater frost tolerance than those from lowland coastal locations, while there were no consistent trends of frost tolerance with latitude in these species. Analysis of seedling morphological characters effectively separated the different species in a manner consistent with the taxonomic review by Hill and Johnson (1995). Characters which separated C. maculata and C. variegata included the leaf pair at which the changeover from juvenile to intermediate leaf morphology occurred and the degree of pubescence of the leaves and stem, leaf size and shape. Corymbia variegata and the southern provenance of C. citriodora were separated only by the citronella scent of C. citriodora, the northern C. citriodora provenance had distinctly different leaf size and shape.

Serological and biological tests were conducted to identify the route by which the viruses reach the seed and subsequently are located in the seed. Both TYMV and TMV were detected in seed from infected plants, however only TYMV was seed-transmitted. This is the first report of transmission of TYMV in seed of A. thaliana. Estimating virus seed transmission by grow-out tests was more accurate than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay due to the higher frequency of antigen in the seed coat than in the embryo. Virus in the seed coat did not lead to seedling infection. Thus, embryo invasion is necessary for seed transmission of TYMV in A. thaliana. Crosses between healthy and virus-infected plants indicated that TYMV from either the female or the male parent could invade the seed. Conversely, invasion from maternal tissue was the only route for TMV to invade the seed. Pollination of flowers on healthy A. thaliana with pollen from TYMV-infected plants did not result in systemic infection of healthy plants, despite TYMV being carried by pollen to the seed.",Gamete transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033744284

Transgenic wheat lines were generated by microprojectile bombardment of immature embryos, using the bar-Bialaphos selection system. The bar and the phyA gene expression were controlled by the maize ubiquitin-1 promoter. To ensure secretion and glycosylation of the microbial phytase, an expression cassette was designed (Ubi-SP-Phy) where an ?-amylase signal peptide sequence was inserted between the promoter and the phytase coding region. A similar cassette was constructed without the signal peptide sequence (Ubi-Phy). Five lines of fertile wheat transformed with the Ubi-SP-Phy were generated and two lines with the Ubi-Phy construct. The inheritance of the phyA gene was monitored through three generations. Western blotting of leaf and seed derived protein revealed the presence of an immunoreacting polypeptide of the size expected for the Aspergillus phytase. Up to 25 days after pollination, the heterologous phytase was exclusively present in the pericarp-seed coat-aleurone fraction. Thereafter, it accumulated in the endosperm in amounts exceeding that found in the seed coat and aleurone. The phyA mRNA and derived protein could at no stage be detected in the embryo. The Ubi-SP-Phy transgenic seeds exhibited up to 4-fold increase of phytase activity while up to 56% increase was found in Ubi-Phy plants. It is concluded that a functional Aspergillus phytase can be produced in significant amounts in wheat grains.

Reliable sources of resistance and control methods are limited, so development of highly resistant breeding lines is desirable. Protoplasts from B. rapa and B. oleracea genotypes selected for resistance to soft rot were fused in order to combine different sources of resistance. Twelve somatic hybrids (synthetic B. napus) were obtained and confirmed by morphology, nuclear DNA content, and RAPD analysis. They were normal looking plants that easily set seeds following self-pollination and backcrossing to B. rapa. Assays of detached leaves or seedlings inoculated in a mist-chamber showed that most somatic hybrids had lower disease severity ratings than the B. rapa fusion partner and a commercial variety of B. napus. Some progeny from selfing or backcrossing of somatic hybrids to B. rapa showed much more resistance than either fusion partner. The offspring populations of the somatic hybrids (F1-S1 and F1-BC1) clearly moved to the resistant direction compared to the parents; the percentage of resistant plants increased from 21% (average of parents) to 36% (F1-S1) and 48% (F1-BC1).

The importance of cytosolic free calcium, [Ca2+](i), for the regulation of pollen tube growth is well known. We have established, using calcium imaging, that the SI response in Papaver rhoeas L. pollen involves a calcium-mediated intracellular signalling pathway. Tip growth of cells is dependent upon a typical configuration of the actin cytoskeleton, which is controlled by actin binding proteins. In animal cells, the actin-binding protein, profilin, is thought to act as a key intermediate between signalling pathways and actin rearrange ments. Profilin is an abundant component of pollen. To better understand the signalling cascades that modulate pollen tip growth and actin dynamics, we are investigating a possible signalling role for profilin. We have demonstrated that profilin modulates the phosphorylation of pollen proteins in vitro. This implicates a role for profilin in altering protein kinase or phosphatase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that profilin from pollen can be phosphorylated in vitro. This provides compelling evidence that profilin interacts with signalling pathways in angiosperms. Finally, we demonstrate that in the SI response, the actin cytoskeleton of incompatible pollen tubes is dramatically rearranged. Our data strongly support a role for the cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins interacting with signalling pathways involved in the regulation of pollen tube growth.

To improve our understanding of the physiological bases of such a phenomenon in this species, we studied the accumulation of carbohydrate and the activities of starch-synthesizing enzymes during the grain filling period in kernels from self and cross fertilization on independent ears from the same female inbred line. With one inbred line as female, selfed and grossed to an unrelated male, kernel growth was studied at 14, 21, 28, 39, and 74 d after pollination (DAP). The cross-fertilization effect on kernel dry weight was maximum at 14 DAP and then decreased about 10%. Male effects on enzyme activities and carbohydrate content were studied at 14 and 28 DAP in a 3-by-3 diallel from inbred lines. At 14 DAP, the advantage of cross-fertilization on average was 28.8% for starch content, 24.8% for ADP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.27) activity, and 24.1% for neutral invertase (EC 3.2.1.26) activity. The advantage depended on the cross for sucrose content, acid invertase activity, and sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13) activity. At 28 DAP, cross-fertilization advantage was not significant for enzyme activities or carbohydrate content but was still significant for kernel dry weight (+7.8%). At both stages, there was no correspondence between male and female effects, when both were significant. The data tend to show that differences in male effects for enzyme activities are expressed early after fertilization but are insufficient to explain male effects at the level of kernel weight.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033999257

Cold injury to needle, stem, and bud tissues was evaluated in fall 1996 and spring 1997 following artificial freeze testing of detached shoots collected from 4-year-old ramets (rooted cuttings). Variation among clones in cold-injury scores was significant (p < 0.01) for all shoot tissues in both fall and spring and averaged about three times the magnitude previously observed among open-pollinated families of this species. Thus, improving cold hardiness by within-family selection appears to hold much promise. Striking similarities in relative magnitudes of heritability estimates and genetic correlations in the full-sib family, compared with breeding populations, support the following hypotheses about the quantitative genetics of cold hardiness in this species: (i) heritability of cold hardiness (both broad-and-narrow-sense) is stronger in the spring than in the fall; (ii) cold hardiness of different shoot tissues in the same season is controlled by many of the same genes; and (iii) genetic control of fall cold hardiness is largely independent of cold hardiness in the spring.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033877034

Thus, it has been suggested that the genetic re-combinations that occur when plants hybridize might result in a breakdown in plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens. In this study, we tested whether hybrid plants are less resistant to herbivores and pathogens than the parental species under controlled environmental conditions. Two common and widespread willow species, the tree-forming Salix caprea L. and the shrub-forming S. phylicifolia Sm. (L.) and their F1 hybrids were used in the study. To control the origin of plant material used in the experiments, we hand-pollinated plants in the field to create F1 hybrids and pure parental individuals, which were potted and kept outdoors in an experimental field. During the third growing season we measured plant survival, leaf numbers, and the densities of three species (gallers and leaf-folders of sub-genus Pontania and Phyllocolpa) of galling sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) and the frequency of leaves infected by the parasitic fungus, Rhytisma salicinum. The experimental design used should minimize the influence of environmental variation on the plant characters. Therefore, the results primarily reflect genetically based differences in quality between hybrids and parental species. Hybrids and S. phylicifolia had more leaves than S. caprea. In addition, hybrids and S. caprea had higher densities of the leaf-galler Pontania pedunculi and the leaf-folder Phyllocolpa sp. than S. phylicifolia, whereas no differences were found between S. caprea and hybrids. We found little evidence suggesting a resistance breakdown in hybrids. Instead, the results are consistent with prediction from the dominance hypothesis, i.e., similar herbivore load on hybrids and one of the parental species. The density of bean-galls (Pontania bridgmanii) and the frequency of leaves infected by the tar-spot disease, Rhytisma salicinum did not differ significantly between the plant categories. We conclude that to understand the mechanisms responsible for the disease/attack patterns on hybrid plants, the life cycle/life history traits of the involved organisms must be considered.",Gallers; Herbivores; Hybridization; Parasitic fungus; Resistance; Willows,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034128612

The materials were collected from 5 sites and grouped into two main groups according to altitude level. The first group include three sites of collection at see level, whereas the second one include two sites at altitude of 2600 m above see level. Karyotype structure of the first group accessions shows high similarity recording 30m+4sm+2t. Karyotype measurements of this group recording 1.93 ?m mean length of chromosome and arm ratio of 1.15 with very low standard error reflect the low variation between chromosomes within the set. In contrast the structure of karyotype in the second group shows 26m+6sm+4t, with significant variation in chromosome length recording 2.26 ?m and arm ratio of 1.26. This in addition to the high values of standard error reflect the variation among chromosomes in length and centromere position within the set. Meiotic behavior of the first group accessions shows a low percentage of disturbed cells compared to that of the second group. In contrast to the second group, normal chromosome association was also observed in the first group accompanied with high level of chiasma frequency. Close relationship was noted between chiasma frequency and regular meiosis in form of chromosome association. A strong relation was indirectly also noted between chiasma frequency and seed set either in self or open pollination conditions for the two groups. Similarity of karyotype, normal meiosis and high pollen fertility for the first group (see level altitude) pointed to high stability in genome structure assuming a high potential for self compatibility of the accessions. The second group (2600 m altitude level) shows low fertility associated very strongly with other parameters suggest the partial self-compatible habit at such rich vegetation area which increase the probability of crossing with relatively compatible grasses.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033735221

During a 122 d opportunity on the Mir space station, full life cycles of Brassica rapa L. were completed in microgravity in a series of three experiments in the Svet greenhouse. Ultrastructural and cytochemical analyses of storage reserves in mature dry seeds produced in these experiments were compared with those of seeds produced during a high-fidelity ground control. Additional analyses were performed on developing Brassica embryos, 15 d post pollination, which were produced during a separate experiment on the Shuttle (STS-87). Seeds produced on Mir had less than 20% of the cotyledon cell number found in seeds harvested from the ground control. Cytochemical localization of storage reserves in mature cotyledons showed that starch was retained in the spaceflight material, whereas protein and lipid were the primary storage reserves in ground control seeds. Protein bodies in mature cotyledons produced in space were 44% smaller than those in the ground control seeds. Fifteen days after pollination, cotyledon cells from mature embryos formed in space had large numbers of starch grains, and protein bodies were absent, while in developing ground control seeds at the same stage, protein bodies had already formed and fewer starch grains were evident. These data suggest that both the late stage of seed development and maturation are changed in Brassica by growth in a microgravity environment. While gravity is not absolutely required for any step in the plant life cycle, seed quality in Brassica is compromised by development in microgravity.

A heat treatment of 44-46 °C severely limited the ability of the seedlings to use NADPH and ATP in the Calvin cycle, Based on visible needle damage, families with superior height-growth performance were more sensitive to heat stress than families with intermediate or inferior height-growth performance. Moreover, families with superior height-growth performance had low photochemical efficiencies in the light (?FIFm?) after heat treatment.

The results showed statistically significant and large genotypic differences in total carotene content among the 16 yellow-seeded improved, open-pollinated maize varieties. The total carotene content ranged from 143 to 278 ?ug/g. Significant genotypic variation was also observed for iron and zinc concentrations in maize inbred lines and cassava storage roots. Iron concentration ranged from 15 to 159 ppm for mid-altitude and from 14 to 134 ppm for lowland maize inbred lines; zinc concentration ranged from 12 to 96 ppm for mid-altitude inbreds and from 24 to 96 ppm for lowland inbred lines. For cassava storage roots, the range was 4 to 95 ppm for iron and 4 to 18 ppm for zinc.

Aerobiological data were obtained with 16 Durham gravimetric samplers positioned over an area of approximately 25 km2 at variable distances and in different directions to capture pollen transported by winds coming from any direction. In the first year of analysis, we carried out two kind of aerobiological monitoring positioning a Hirst volumetric trap near the closest gravimetric sampler. The two methods showed a similar trend in Platanus pollen profiles. In the following years, only Durham gravimetric samplers were used to study pollen dispersion. The data showed that there were high concentrations of pollen on the soil near the source while at distances higher than 800 m pollen concentration decreased dramatically. About 1/4 of all the pollen produced fell in an area within 400 m from the source and at a distance of 2750 m only 9 pollen grains/cm2 fell throughout the entire season.",Platanus; Pollen deposition; Pollen production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034522422

For this reason Darwin (1877) doubted whether heterostyly would occur in the Lamiaceae and recent reviews have not reported the floral polymorphism in this family. Here we describe distyly in a rare species of Salvia restricted to bluffs and seaward canyons on Santa Rosa Island (Santa Barbara Co., California) and northwestern Baja California (Mexico). Salvia brandegeei is morphologically distylous with populations composed of equal frequencies of long- and short-styled morphs differing reciprocally in stigma and anther position. Controlled hand pollinations demonstrated no significant differences in the seed set of self, intramorph or intermorph pollinations. Unlike most heterostylous species investigated, S. brandegeei does not possess diallelic incompatibility or ancillary polymorphisms of pollen and stigmas. We propose that the evolution of distyly in S. brandegeei may have been associated with an ecological shift to a new environment in which protandry failed to prevent increased levels of geitonogamy. Heterostyly was then selected because it increased the proficiency of cross-pollination. The origin of distyly in self-compatible S. brandegeei is consistent with Lloyd and Webb's theoretical model for the evolution of distyly.",Distyly; Geitonogamy; Heterostyly; Lamiaceae; Protandry; Rare plant species; Self-compatibility; Zygomorphic flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033827085

Hybrids and pollinators were grown in 12 year x location combinations in India that were grouped into three zones. Genetic components of variance quantifying the differences among these hybrids were estimated. The hybrids showed a conspicuous heterosis for grain yield, earliness and biomass yield but not for straw yield. The level and direction of heterosis for time to flowering depended strongly on the earliness of the male-sterile line. In the terminal drought stress zone hybrids made on the early maturing male-sterile line 843A had the highest level of heterosis for grain yield (88%). This was partly due to escape from terminal stress. In the other two zones the heterosis for grain yield was on average 30%. Heterosis for biomass yield and biomass yield per day was on average also positive in all three zones. For all traits, except time to flowering and biomass yield per day, pollinator effects were the only significant source of variation. Differences between hybrids were mostly caused by additive genetic effects. Significant amount of heterosis observed in landrace-based topcross hybrids for grain yield and other productivity-related traits suggested that substantial improvement in pearl millet productivity in and environments can be obtained by topcrossing locally adapted landraces on suitable male-sterile lines.",Genetic variance; Heterosis; Landrace; Pennisetum glaucum; Stress environments; Topcross hybrids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034099861

The ovary of the 28-5 ap2-1 mutant shows an oval shape because of increased numbers of enlarged cells. When the ap2-1 mutation is crossed out of the genetic background, more elongated rather than wider fruits are obtained. Normally, Arabidopsis fruits will develop to a normal size only when the ovules are present and fertilized. In the 28-5 single mutant, the siliques keep growing despite failure of fertilization and can reach nearly normal size. When wild-type pollen was used to pollinate the mutant pistil, the pollinated 28-5 silique became >10% longer and 40% wider than a wild-type silique, although producing very few seeds. The enhancer insertion in line 28-5 acts by hyperactivating a cytochrome P450 gene, CYP78A9.

For predispersal seed predators that do not themselves pollinate their host and whose larvae are sessile, females must be able to predict which flowers will ultimately be pollinated and set fruit, or be able to manipulate flowers in some way to ensure they set fruit. Otherwise, their offspring will perish. Here we describe the results of an experiment in which we tested if female Hylemya (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) are choosing oviposition sites wisely, or if they are manipulating flowers of their host, Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae), in some way to ensure fruit set. Previous work in this system established a positive correlation between oviposition and fruit set. By bagging females on flowers, we removed their ability to choose flowers on which to oviposit. We found that flowers females oviposited on, whether bagged ('no choice') or Unbagged ('female choice'), had a significantly higher probability of setting fruit than 'control' flowers that we bagged but did not cage females on. In addition, we tested if Hylemya prefer particular architectural locations of flowers and if those locations correspond with higher than average fruit set. Although flowers at the distal end of the plant, and those most proximal to the main stem, were more likely to set fruit overall, Hylemya was no more likely to oviposit on those flowers than others on the plant. Taken together, our results suggest that Hylemya is somehow able to manipulate its host to ensure fruit set and thus the provisioning of their larvae.",Female choice; Hylemya; Ipomopsis aggregata; Plant-animal interactions; Predispersal seed predators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033860370

Their sources are the wild species closely related to the cultivated form. Many open-pollinated varieties presently cultivated posses genetic resistance to three or four pathogens. With the increasing use of F1 hybrids it is possible to use varieties cumulating four to six resistances. During the last years several new resistances were identified and breeders are introducing these in modern varieties cumulating various resistances and particular qualities now required by specific markets, notably fruit long life and good taste. Some interesting resistances are difficult to select. There are the cases with the oligogenic partial resistances also when the resistance tests are difficult to carry out. In some cases using molecular markers can permit the selection. The wild species of Lycopersicon continue to be the hope to control diseases and pests.

In the present study, the role that the photoassimilates stored in the flowers might play in flower development from anthesis to fertilization in Prunus armeniaca L. (apricot), a histerant species, was explored. Starch content in individual flowers was measured with the help of an image analysis system. Starch content decreased from its highest value at anthesis and disappeared from the ovary 9 days later. This decrease was inversely related to an increase in ovary size and in cell number in the pericarp, suggesting an intraflower, self-supported development. This process is conserved in both pollinated and nonpollinated flowers and therefore seems to be inherent to the flower at anthesis. The onset of fruiting is preceded by the establishment of large differences among ovaries; while some experience continuous growth, others stop growing and eventually drop. Interestingly, large differences in starch content are found among flowers at anthesis. These results are discussed in terms of the possible implications of pre-stored starch in the flower supporting initial flower development.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034003394

Multifactorial genetic methods were used to detect and locate QTLs (quantitative trait loci) on a genetic map consisting mainly of RFLP markers for genes with known function. The genetic material was recombinant inbred lines originating from parents differing in starch structure (dent vs. flint). Kernels were harvested from field grown plants for two successive years and under two pollination systems. Main effect and epistasis QTLs were detected using two methods, composite interval mapping (MQTL) and ANOVA. Despite large year-to-year differences, physiologically meaningful co-locations were observed between trait QTLs. Moreover, the number of expressed sequences on our map allowed the search for co-locations between QTLs and genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.

The importance of this locus as a candidate gene for a starch QTL is in agreement with previous studies based either on QTL co-locations or on revertant analysis. Other co-locations were observed between amylose and amylopectin QTLs and the two loci of IVR1 invertase genes on chromosomes 2 and 10. Further comparison with previously detected QTLs for carbohydrate metabolism in maize leaves showed consistent co-location in map regions devoid of candidate genes, such as near chromosome 1S telomere. The possible contribution of regulatory genes in this region is discussed.

Box 299, St. Louis, MO, United States","Iridaceae are a well defined family of some 1800 species and between 60 and 70 genera. Molecular studies of chloroplast DNA has confirmed the position of the family in the order Asparagales, contrary to earlier work that placed the Iridaceae in Liliales. The family comprises two large assemblages of species, currently regarded as subfamilies Ixioideae and Iridaceae. The relationships of the remaining seven genera, included in subfamilies Isophysidoideae and Nivenioideae, have been rendered uncertain because of the lack of congruence between molecular and morphological studies using different outgroups and/or different data sets. Ixioideae, the largest subfamily, comprises more than half the total species in the family. Largely African, with fair representation in Eurasia, the generic phylogeny of Ixioideae is poorly understood. Most genera exhibit a considerable range of floral diversity based on floral zygomorphy and the elaboration or reduction of the perianth tube. Production of floral nectar and pollination by long-tongued insects including anthophorine bees, Lepidoptera, longproboscid flies and birds is a recurring theme but reversals to actinomorphy, often accompanied by the suppression of nectar production, has occurred in species of several genera that are pollinated by hopliine beetles. Virtually worldwide in distribution, Iridoideae comprise five tribes, the Australian Diplarrheneae, the Australasian and American Sisyrinchieae, the exclusively American Trimezieae (= Mariceae) and Tigridieae, and the Old World Irideae. Iris and Moraea constitute the major genera of this last tribe, Iris a North Temperate genus and Moraea largely sub-Saharan African. Several small genera allied to Iris or Moraea are believed to have flowers modified for different pollination strategies and have been shown by molecular data to be nested with one or other of the larger genera. Vegetative diversity, especially in the leaf and rootstock, is an important variable in Iris whereas floral divergence and vegetative uniformity characterize Moraea. Genera of Irideae appear to be primarily adapted for pollination by bees foraging for nectar and pollen transfer is passive. Specialization has shifted the pollination strategy either to a generalist system using flies, bees and beetles, or a specialist system using bees foraging for pollen, or carrion flies attracted to foul odors, or hopliine beetles that use flowers as sites for assembly and mating.",Adaptive radiation; Classification; Iridaceae; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46449115200

Prey items were primarily aphids (73%), Diptera (7.5%), and Coleoptera and Hymenoptera (both 5.4%). Pests comprised 90% of the prey; the remaining 10% was accounted for by natural enemies, pollinators and other insects. The number of insects captured in webs differed among study habitats (sunflower &gt; fiddleneck &gt; apple tree) though this difference was not statistically significant. Due to greater numbers of aphids in webs on sunflower, the mean prey length was significantly smaller on sunflowers than in other plots.

Hybrid combinations with the highest rates of successful selections are presented, as examples for two years of artificial pollination programs. The actual results of this extensive breeding work are represented by nine new rose varieties released in Romania between 19701994 (Foc de tabara, Luchian, Simfonia, Rosabunda, Romstar, Incandescent, Auriu de Cluj, Rosalinda and Vigorosa) which are destined to open-air growing either for cutflowers or as ornamentals in parks, gardens etc. The main growing characteristics of these new varieties are presented as well as their field resistance to black-spot, mildew and rust. The ornamental features of these varieties are also presented both in synthetic tables and in color photos. Additionally, the main growing and ornamental characteristics of other fourteen recent selections of rose are discussed, as well as their behavior in the National Comparative Trial Network. Finally, the prospects of rose breeding activity, at Cluj-Napoca are considered, both from a traditional point of view (for ornamental purposes) and from a new and rather exciting one as a possible means of preventing soil erosion on steep slopes on which there are no or few choices for other antierosional crops. © 2000 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347933363

To investigate whether E. azurea possesses a trimorphic incompatibility system typical of tristylous species, we conducted a controlled pollination experiment on 15 clones representing the three style morphs from a natural population near Rosario, Argentina. Comparisons of fruit and seed set following self-, illegitimate, and legitimate pollinations clearly demonstrated the presence of trimorphic incompatibility in E. azurea. Self- and illegitimate pollinations produced significantly less fruit and seed than legitimate pollinations in all three style morphs. Pollen from the two anther levels within a flower exhibited contrasting compatibility relations in self-pollinations.

Vegetative propagation to multiply selected genotypes has produced breakthroughs in the cultivation of new crops like jojoba (Simmondsia chinesis). The only available way to propagate Grindelia is by transplanting seedlings or direct seeding. Both alternatives rely on selected varieties, a process that takes several years in an open-pollinated, self-incompatible species. The objective of this study was to generate a protocol for the vegetative propagation of G. chiloensis. Two experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of the mother plant, the source of the cutting (apical or basal), and the concentration of indole butyric acid (IBA) on rooting success and root and above-ground biomass accumulation. A third study was conducted to evaluate the field survival of the propagated plants. Stems (15 cm) were cut from several mother plants growing in the field and stored in plastic containers with ice for about 4 h. Two types of cuttings were prepared from each stem: apical (upper 6-8 nodes) and basal (lower 6-8 nodes). A commercially available IBA source (Hormex, rooting powder, Brooker Chemical, Hollywood, CA) was used at six concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.8, 1.6, 3.0, and 4.5%). The cuttings were dipped in water and in the plant regulator and planted into speedlings filled with peat moss, vermiculite and sand (1:1:1, v/v/v). The speedlings were placed under a mist system in a greenhouse at 25°C. Rooting success and root weight were evaluated 30 days after the experiments were started. The position of the cutting, the IBA concentration, and the mother plant affected rooting success. None of the basal cuttings rooted even with IBA treatment. For the apical cuttings, IBA concentrations between 0.1 and 1.6% resulted in more than 64% rooting and the largest root mass (P<0.01). The control cuttings (0% IBA) did not produce adventitious roots. Accessions differed on rooting success. Transplanting survival varied between 25 and 100% depending on the clone. Vegetative propagation will allow the multiplication of Grindelia clones selected for their productive superiority.

At one site (Ashurst), the hosts Epichloe clarkii and Epichloe baconii co-occurred, while at a second site (Farm Gate), only E. clarkii was present.

However, flies ovipositing on E. clarkii at the Farm Gate site tended to prefer large fungi that occurred within small clumps of grass. Fungal characteristics preferred by the flies showed no correlation with egg/larval survivorship. Insect survival on E. clarkii varied between sites and was related to differences in egg dispersion among fungi at the two sites.

In the final phases of pollen development, starch is always stored; this occurs before the anther opens. Depending on the species, this starch may be totally or partially transformed into: (a) other types of polysaccharides (fructans and rarely callose); (b) disaccharides (sucrose); (c) monosaccharides (glucose and fructose, all situated in the cytoplasm. While awaiting dispersing agents and during dispersal, polysaccharides, especially fructans, and sucrose may be interconverted to control osmotic pressure and prevent loss and uptake of water. Opening of the anther is preceded by disappearance of the locular fluid and in many cases by partial dehydration of the pollen. Pollen generally has a water content between 5 and 50%. Pollen with a high water content may or may not be able to control water retention during pollen exposure and dispersal. Pollen may be dispersed in monads or grouped in pollen dispersing units by the following mechanisms: (i). tangling of filamentous pollen; (ii). adhesion by viscous substances (pollenkitt, tryphine, elastoviscin) derived from the tapetum; (iii). common walls. When the anther opens, the pollen may be dispersed immediately, remain until dispersed (primary presentation), or be presented to pollinators in another part of the flower (secondary presentation).",Anther; Carbohydrate reserves; Dehydration state; Dispersing units; Pollen; Pollen presentation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033948994

Fasciculata at the molecular level that correlate with such morphological shifts in these unusual sexual allotriploids. Cluster analysis based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles of these sexual allotriploids clearly indicated that substantial differences among many loci do exist between T. dactyloides and T. maizar.

Knowledge of the relative contribution of inbreeding depression in hermaphrodites and maternal sex effects to the female fertility advantage and the genetic basis of variation in female fertility advantage is central to our understanding of the evolution of gender specialization. In this study we examine the relative contribution of inbreeding and maternal sex to the female fertility advantage in gynodioecious Thymus vulgaris and quantify whether there is genetically based variation in female fertility advantage for plants from four populations. Following controlled self and outcross (sib, within population, and between-population) pollination, females had a more than twofold fertility advantage (based on the number of germinating seeds per fruit), regardless of the population of origin and the type of pollination. Inbreeding depression on viable seed production by hermaphrodites occurred in two populations, where inbreeding had been previously detected. Biparental inbreeding depression on viable seed production occurred in three of four populations for females, but in only one population for hermaphrodites. Whereas the maternal sex effect may consistently enhance female fertility advantage, inbreeding effects may be limited to particular population contexts where inbreeding may occur. A significant family x maternal sex interaction effect on viable seed production was observed, illustrating that the extent of female fertility advantage varies significantly among families. This result is due to greater variation in hermaphrodite (relative to female) seed fertility between families. Despite this genetic variation in female fertility advantage and the highly female biased sex ratios in populations of T. vulgaris, gynodioecy is a stable polymorphism, suggesting that strong genetic and/or ecological constraints influence the stability of this polymorphism.",Gynodioecy; Inbreeding depression; Lamiaceae; Outcrossing rate; Seed production; Sex ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033678176

Our objective was to determine whether ant visits enhance the sexual reproduction of either E. cyparissias or the rust fungi. Uromyces pisi is known to be obligately outcrossing, whereas a breeding system experiment established that E. cyparissias can self, but sets more seeds when outcrossed.

Using C. moschata 'Menina' as the source of ZYMV resistance and following six generations of backcrossing, a true-breeding line nearly isogenic to 'True French', designated 381e, was recovered that carried ZYMV resistance, albeit not at as high a level as in 'Menina'. 'True French, and accession 381e were crossed, and their reciprocal F1, F2, and backcross progenies were grown in a chamber and inoculated with a highly virulent, non-aphid-transmissible strain of ZYMV. Nearly all F1 plants and all plants of the backcross to 381e were classified as resistant. Segregation to resistant and susceptible individuals occurred in the backcross to the susceptible parent, in accordance with a 3:5 three-gene ratio of resistant: susceptible. The F2 segregated in accordance with a ratio of 45 resistant: 19 susceptible, which would be obtained if there was one major gene for resistance, Zym-1 (Zym), and two other genes, herein designated Zym-2 and Zym-3, both of which are complementary to Zym-1. The presence of Zym-1 and either Zym-2 or Zym-3 is necessary for resistance to be expressed in young plants, but the presence of all three might be necessary for resistance to continue to be expressed during subsequent development of the plants. Evidently, Zym-2 and Zym-3 are ubiquitous in C. moschata but their susceptible alleles are much more common in C. pepo. As the level of resistance of 381e to ZYMV is not as high as that of C. moschata 'Menina', additional, as yet unidentified, genes must be involved in conferring high resistance to this virus.",Courgette; Cucurbita pepo; Genetics; Pumpkin; Squash; Virus resistance; Zucchini; Zucchini yellow mosaic virus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034551721

In the present study, we investigated how 2, 4 or 6 d of high temperature (35 °C) affected DNA endureduplication and maize kernel development in comparison with control kernels grown at 25 °C. Data were collected on fresh weight (FW), nuclei number, mitotic index, and DNA endureduplication. Maize endosperm FW and nuclei number were reduced by exposure to 4 or 6 d of high temperature. At 18 DAP, the 2 d high temperature treatment (HTT) caused a reduction in FW and nuclei number, but had no effect on DNA endoreduplication and average DNA content per endosperm. However, when the exposure to high temperature was increased to 4 or 6 d, FW, nuclei number and the magnitude of DNA endoreduplication were progressively reduced, and the peak mitotic index was delayed compared with the control endosperm. At 18 DAP, the 4 d treatment showed 54.7% of the cells were 3 or 6 C, whereas only 41.2% were 12 C or higher. Six days of high temperature also resulted in a reduction in endosperm FW, nuclei number and a delay in the peak of mitotic index. DNA endureduplication occurred in the kernels exposed to this treatment, although the magnitude was severely reduced compared with the control kernels. Nuclear DNA content was highly correlated (r = 0.93) with kernel FW, suggesting an important role of DNA endoreduplication in determining endosperm FW. The data suggest that high temperature during endosperm cell division exerted negative effects on DNA endoreduplication by dramatically reducing the nuclei number, leaving fewer nuclei available for DNA endureduplication. However, the data also suggest that prolonged exposure to high temperature restricts entry of mitotic cells into the endureduplication phase of the cell cycle.",DNA endoreduplication; Flow cytometry; High temperature; Maize kernel development; Mitotic index; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034083767

DNA for the PCR reactions was isolated from 65 recombinant inbred soybean lines resulting from crossing PI 290, 136 and BARC-2 (Rj4), followed by self-pollination for seven generations without selection. Mapmaker 3.0, a computer package, was used for construction of the linkage map. A total of 43 polymorphic markers were identified; 30 markers were linked and distributed among 5 linkage groups while 13 markers were unlinked. Arbitrary primers revealed more polymorphisms than specific primers. A combination of arbitrary primers A5 and A18 revealed the maximum number of polymorphic bands. Five observed linkage groups can be expanded in future soybean research by using additional markers.",Glycine max; Heat shock protein; Homeobox; Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR); Simple sequence repeat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033775294

M3J 1P3, Canada","The Brassica self-incompatibility system is controlled by a multi-allelic S receptor kinase (SRK) gene. Upon contact between self-incompatible pollen and the stigmatic papillae at the surface of the pistil, this receptor kinase is predicted to initiate a signalling pathway in the stigmatic papilla leading to the rejection of the self-incompatible pollen. Several different approaches have been taken to determine the molecular events occurring in the stigmatic papillae upon activation of the self-incompatible response. Examination of cytosolic calcium levels, electrical responses, cytoskeletal organization, and callose deposition in the stigmatic papillae during compatible and incompatible pollinations fail to reveal any responses specific to self-incompatibility. However, the identification of stigmatic proteins which interact with the SRK kinase domain has led to the characterization of a novel protein called ARC1 which appears to be a substrate for the S receptor kinase and is a positive effector of the self-incompatibility response.

An image analysis program was used to extract calliper measurements of the fruit outline and calculated Fourier descriptors for each fruit outline. Five independent shape traits were identified from a principal component analysis of the Fourier descriptors. The shape traits and the proportion of the total phenotypic variation they accounted for were: fruit aspect (76.8%), asymmetric-crown (7.8%), fruit conicity (6.0%), asymmetric-sides (4.3%), and fruit squareness (2.0%). Genetic and residual variance components were estimated with data from two sites using restricted maximum-likelihood techniques to select genetically-inherited apple shape traits. Combined sites heritability was estimated to be 0.79 for aspect, 0.38 for conicity and 0.35 for squareness. Multiple regression between calliper measurements and aspect, conicity, and squareness traits showed firstly that aspect was best predicted by fruit length/width ratio (R2 = 0.97), secondly conicity could be described by both the distance of the maximum width from the base of the fruit/fruit length ratio and the calyx basin width/fruit width ratio (R2 = 0.44), and finally squareness was best described by ratio of the product of calyx basin width and distance of the maximum width from the calyx end of the fruit by the product of fruit length and fruit width (R2 = 0.19).

In 1994, studies were conducted in a model system consisting of a late-planted corn strip placed in the middle of an early-planted cornfield. The system was replicated over three fields. Large-scale variation was modeled using trend-surface regression analysis to describe the relationship between beetle counts and distance from the center of the late-planted strip. In each field, the beetle distribution became greatly skewed toward the late-planted strip when the strip was either in the tassel or silk stage and the surrounding field was ? blister stage. In 1995, studies were conducted in and at the interface of two adjacent cornfields that were planted 9 d apart. Count data were analyzed to quantify population density changes at different sampling locations within and among fields over time as crop phenology changed. Rapid positive or negative changes in beetle densities occurred within and among fields as contrasts in corn phenology changed. In both vears, the stability of the beetle distribution was strongly influenced by the length of time that a contrast in plant phenology was maintained between adjacent patches of corn. Directional movements of beetles toward pollinating corn and associated semiochemicals could be inferred from both 1994 and 1995 data analyses. Data suggest that contrasts in crop phenology at the interface and among cornfields should be considered when developing beetle sampling programs and interpreting scouting data to improve the accuracy of rootworm management decisions.",Corn silks; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera; Movement; Population dynamics; Sampling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033853263

Half-hourly honey bee (Apis mellifera) pollen foraging on C. salvifolius varied significantly within and between days even though data were only collected on clear sunny days. We found that flower observations varied between flower patches of a very restricted area. We fitted a simple linear model to half-hourly pollen foraging and used the model to predict observed pollen release. For each day, we calculated the optimal time delay between pollen foraging and pollen release. For 9 out of 10 days the time delay was between 28 min and 60 min. The average pollen foraging was about 44 min time delayed compared to average hourly pollen release. Incorporating the time delay in the pollen foraging model to predict pollen release for each of the 10 days, we found a non-significant difference between observed and predicted hourly pollen release for all days. We therefore suggest that pollen foraging of honey bees is determined by the pollen availability and that monitoring of hourly pollen release in entomophilous flowers may be done through simple observations of pollinator foraging. © 2000 International Bee Research Association.",Apis mellifera; Cistus salvifolius; Honey bees; Pollen foraging; Pollen release; Portugal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034550846

Cannabis plants are common in the Midwest. Objectives: To examine whether Cannabis might be a clinically important allergen, we determined Cannabis pollination patterns in the Omaha area for 5 years, the prevalence of skin test positivity, and the association with respiratory symptoms. Methods: Airborne Cannabis (and other weed) pollens were collected using a Rotorod air impactor, and pollen counts were done using a standardized protocol. Results: Measurable Cannabis pollen count was not recorded until the last 2 weeks of July. Peak pollination typically occurred during mid- to late-August, and comprised up to 36% of the total pollen counts. Cannabis pollen was not observed after mid-September. To determine the prevalence of skin test positivity, we added Cannabis to the multi-test routine skin test battery. Seventy-eight of 127 patients tested (61%) were skin test positive. Thirty of the 78 patients were randomly selected to determine if they had allergic rhinitis and/or asthma symptoms during the Cannabis pollination period. By history, 22 (73%) claimed respiratory symptoms in the July through September period. All 22 of these subjects were also skin test positive to weeds pollinating during the same period as Cannabis (ragweed, pig-weed, cocklebur, Russian thistle, marsh elder, or kochia). Conclusions: The strong association between skin test reactivity, respiratory symptoms, and pollination period suggests that Cannabis could be a clinically important aeroallergen for certain patients and should be further studied.

Matching plants to climate is essential for optimizing growth. Matching is usually done with field trials because of the lack of a predictive relation between laboratory measurements of physiological responses and climatic factors affecting growth. This paper evaluates the potential of using respiration parameters for selection of appropriate drainage or seed sources within a drainage for superior growth in a particular climate. The growth traits measured are tree height, stem diameter and stem volume. The respiratory parameters measured are respiratory heat rate, rate of CO2 production, and temperature dependence of respiratory heat rate. Five open-pollinated families from each of nine seed sources of river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.) were studied following selection from a larger set of seed sources planted at three plantations in California. The three plantations differ in climate, particularly in extreme temperatures, diurnal temperature variability and total rainfall. Within each plantation, growth and respiration parameters show high genetic variation [overall coefficient of variation (CV) = 14-58%, family CV = 11-33%], with at least one of these traits showing significant (P &lt; 0.10) difference due to drainage, or source within drainage, or families within source. The relationship of growth to respiration for each trait differs, depending on test plantation, origin drainage, source or family, suggesting a unique pattern for each trait. Correlation of drainage level averages between growth and respiration were strongly negative and significant (P = 0.10-0.01). Rankings for drainages between paired plantations were strong and significant (P = 0.10-0.05) only for respiration, but not for growth traits.",Climate; Eucalyptus; Growth; Metabolic rate; Respiration efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034128635

Saponins give a bitter taste sensation and are a serious antinutritional factor. Therefore selection of sweet genotypes with a very low saponin content in the seeds is a main breeding goal. However, selection for sweet genotypes is retarded by cross-pollination. Early identification of sweet and bitter quinoa genotypes before anthesis would speed up breeding considerably. The ability to distinguish sweet and bitter genotypes was investigated in a glasshouse and in a field experiment. In the glasshouse experiment the content of sapogenins was determined in leaves of sweet and bitter quinoa genotypes at successive stages of plant development and finally in the seeds. Detectable amounts of sapogenins were found earliest 82 days after sowing in leaves of both sweet and bitter quinoa genotypes. The total sapogenin content in leaves of sweet and bitter genotypes increased during plant development but remained lower than the content found in the seeds. The sapogenin content in seeds of sweet genotypes varied from 0.2 to 0.4 g kg-1 dry matter and in seeds of bitter genotypes from 4.7 to 11.3 g kg-1 dry matter. The difference in sapogenin content between leaves and seeds was much higher in bitter genotypes than in sweet genotypes. Hederagenin was the major sapogenin found in leaves, and oleanolic acid in seeds. In the field experiment it was found that the content of sapogenins in the leaves of F2 plants of crosses between both quinoa types did not differ between sweet and bitter genotypes. The obtained results demonstrated that sweet genotypes could not be selected before anthesis on the basis of the sapogenin content in the leaves. 2000 Society of Chemical Industry.","30-o-methylspergulagenate; Chenopodium quinoa; Foam test; Oleanolic acid; Phytolaccagenic acid; Sapogenins, hederagenin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033956801

A sample of primary transformants was self-pollinated, and progeny from both transformed and non-transformed plants (controls) were evaluated for salt tolerance in vitro and in vivo. Results from different tests indicated a higher level of salt tolerance in the progeny of two different transgenic plants bearing four copies or one copy of the HAL1 gene. In addition, measurement of the intracellular K+ to Na+ ratios showed that transgenic lines were able to retain more K+ than the control under salt stress.

To assess the disease response in different genotypes an in vitro method of assay has been developed. The terminal portion of excised mature leaves from carrot are incubated under lights at 25-26°C for 6 days with spores of A. dauci. After 6 days, chlorophyll and total soluble polyphenol contents of the leaves decline to a low level, whereas in the uninoculated control leaves levels of these compounds are largely unchanged. Electron microscope studies of the effect of infection on the ultrastructure of leaves from both cv. Fancy and wild plants show disintegration of the cell wall, plasmalemma and chloroplast membranes in the region close to the invading fungus. The response to A. dauci shows characteristics compatible with the presence of a phytotoxin. Seedling hypocotyls of the carrot cv. Fancy are used as a source of explants to initiate callus tissue and regenerate embryos. Regenerant somaclone plants show variation in morphology (crown number, height, leaf number, leaf shape and flowering time) and susceptibility to the pathogen as measured by the loss in chlorophyll from infected detached leaves after a 6-day period. Potentially susceptible and resistant regenerant plants are identified by the low and high chlorophyll levels, respectively, in excised leaves 6 days after infection. Selected high- and low-chlorophyll regenerant plants and seedling-derived cv. Fancy are self-pollinated, then the seeds are used to produce a progeny generation, which is assessed for morphological changes and disease resistance as before. The response of leaves of progeny plants to infection shows that the plants derived from high-chlorophyll regenerants still show a higher chlorophyll level after infection compared with leaves derived from low-chlorophyll and control plants. High chlorophyll levels in the presence of infection in the progeny of high-chlorophyll regenerants suggest that the capacity to resist infection in the selected somaclones is inherited.",Alternaria dauci; Carrot; Chlorophyll; Daucus carota; Disease bioassay; Leaf-spot disease; Somaclones,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034110331

As for many other fig wasps, all mating occurs within the confines of a syconium before females depart: We show that initially there is scramble competition between males for access to virgin females. During this time males excavated a small hole into a female's gall to mate through. These holes were just large enough for insemination, but not large enough for females to exit their galls. Males ignored mated females, and as virgin females became scarce males switched strategies and began to enlarge insemination holes until they were large enough for females to escape, showing that males enhance female fitness by means other than just mating. Syconia with experimentally reduced numbers of males had fewer liberated females, suggesting that female fitness is strongly affected by the number of males present. Females may be unable to escape their galls unassisted because of morphological adaptations to syconium founding. We argue that sex allocation should be affected not only by competition among males but also by intersexual interactions between siblings. This could potentially offset the strong female bias predicted bY local mate competition. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033672953

The percentage of the thecae dehisced in response to artificial opening of the florets by removing lemma and the mean diameter of the pollen grains measured during four minutes after the artificial opening were examined to determine the ability of the thecae to dehisce and that of the pollen grains to swell, respectively. The high temperature given on the day of flowering decreased both the percentage of the dehisced thecae and the diameter of the pollen grains but did not affect the relationship between them. The thecae of the plants which had been subjected to the high temperature for one or two days before flowering, however, showed a lower dehiscence percentage than those of the plant treated on the day of flowering against the same pollen-grain diameter. We concluded that high temperature given on the day of flowering decreased the ability of the pollen grains to swell resulting in poor thecae dehiscence, and that, besides this decrease, high temperature given just before the days of flowering lowered the function of thecae themselves to dehisce, causing poorer thecae dehiscence.",Floret sterility; High temperature; Oryza sativa L.; Pollen grain swelling; Pollination; Rice; Theca dehiscence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034503659

Temperatures were recorded as hourly means over each season. Growing degree day accumulation with a base of 10°C (GDD10) and 5°C (GDD5) were calculated, commencing at pollination. Crop loads were established at bloom to a very low level to minimize competition between fruit and provide a clear response of fruit growth to environmental conditions. Some trees were shaded with 70% shadecloth for 7 d beginning either 60 d after pollination (DAP) or 90 DAP. In the third season, other trees were thinned to a medium crop load to compare their fruit growth with that from trees bearing low crop loads. There was a highly significant correlation between GDD10 at 30 DAP and time from pollination to harvest (r2 = 0.96). On the low crop load trees, fruit weight at 50 d was closely correlated with GDD10 accumulated over the 50 DAP (r2 = 0.71). Furthermore fruit weight at 50 DAP was also significantly correlated with fruit weight at harvest (r2 = 0.68). These results support an hypothesis that a potential maximum fruit size is set by about 50 DAP, determined by total fruit cell number, resulting from a temperature-responsive cell division growth phase. Under conditions of no limitations after the cell division phase, all fruit cells would expand to their optimum size to provide the maximum fruit weight achievable for that cell number. Factors which limited carbohydrate availability, such as higher crop loads and shading of trees, reduced final fruit size. In this study, shading for 7 d at 90 DAP did not reduce final fruit size and shading at 60 DAP reduced final fruit size only in some cases. Differences in fruit weight at harvest induced by low and high crop loads were expressed only at the sites that achieved large fruit weight in that season and experienced greatest early season GDD10 accumulation (Hawkes Bay, Nelson). In a cooler region (or season), represented by Canterbury in this example, a fruit weight response to crop load was much less apparent. Ideas towards developing a practical methodology for predicting fruit weight at harvest are discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033910945

A spontaneous hypertriploid (2n = 3x + 1 = 61) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr., 2n = 2x = 40] was isolated for the first time from the progeny of the cross between soybean line T31 and a primary trisomic line T190-47-3. This line could provide a means for producing primary trisomics in soybean. The objective of this study was to report the origin, general plant morphology, cytology, fertility, and breeding behavior of a hypertriploid. The hypertriploid and a disomic sib were planted in the greenhouse for comparing general morphology. Root tips (mitotic metaphase) and flower buds (meiotic Metaphase I and Anaphase I) were used for cytological studies, and pollen grains and seed set were evaluated for fertility. Crosses with 'Clark 63' and selfed population were used to evaluate breeding behavior. Results revealed that the hypertriploid expressed more vigorous vegetative growth than the corresponding disomic sibling. At Metaphase I, an average meiotic chromosome pairing was 0.10 IV + 11.18 III + 9.43 II + 8.23 I, indicating that the four homologous chromosomes mainly formed two bivalents. The hypertriploid showed 63% pollen fertility and produced 98 seeds from self-pollination. Chromosome numbers in the selfed population of the hypertriploid ranged from 2n = 50 to 2n = 69. However, the chromosome number in F1 plants from the cross of hypertriploid x Clark 63 ranged from 2n = 44 to 2n = 48 with an exception of one plant that contained 2n = 56 chromosomes. Some plants with 2n = 44 to 2n = 47 had high seed fertility. The progenies of these aneuploid lines will segregate mostly into plants with 2n = 41 chromosomes.

From the 39 SSR primer sets tested, only two gave patterns that could not be scored and used in the data analysis. The remainder included five SSRs that gave double-locus profiles in which one locus could still be scored separately. The 37 SSRs revealed between 2 and 16 alleles per locus and a total of 339 alleles in the 14 populations. Gene diversity (D = 1-?p(i)2) ranged from 0.47 to 0.90. Two of the four Dwarf populations were homozygous at all 37 loci, which is consistent with their autogamous (self-fertilising) reproduction. One Dwarf population was heterozygous at one locus but the other (Niu Leka Dwarf), which is known to be cross-pollinating, showed high levels of heterozygosity. Generally, diversity was higher in populations from the South Pacific and South East Asia. Three SSR loci (CNZ46, CN2A5, CN11E6) gave distinct genotypes for all but two populations. The East African populations had higher heterozygosities than those from West Africa, and the populations from Tonga and Fiji generally had distinct alleles from those of the South Pacific. AFLP analysis with 12 primer combinations gave a total of 1106 bands, of which 303 were polymorphic (27%). Similarity matrices were constructed from the two data sets using the proportion of shared alleles for SSRs and a Jaccard coefficient for AFLPs. In each case cluster and principal coordinates analyses were performed, with the resultant dendrograms and plots revealing similar relationships among the populations for both approaches. There was generally a good separation of populations, and phenetic relationships were in agreement with those previously shown by RFLPs. The use of SSRs and AFLPs in genetic-diversity analysis for the establishment of germplasm collections is discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034009863

The present study utilized this unique attribute in combination with confocal and light microscopy to characterize the timing and associated structural changes during pollination events leading to double fertilization. The observation of sperm nuclei in living gametophyte tissue is an important advance in the identification, in real time, of stages leading to fertilization in angiosperms. A continuum of fertilization occurred between 12 and 16 h after pollination (hap), with peak frequency of egg and sperm fusion at 14 hap (43%). Movement of the sperm cells through the degenerated synergid took several hours and fusion between sperm and their respective female nuclei occurred simultaneously. Changes in embryo sac structure were also documented. Cell walls in the region between the synergids and egg cell were poorly developed prior to pollen tube penetration. Thickened cell wails were observed around the periphery of the synergids and egg cell following pollination, and in the central cell where it lay within the body of the ovule. Starch was observed in the cells of the embryo sac, although the number and distribution of granules varied before and after pollination. These temporal and spatial observations of the embryo sac in Torenia fournieri provide a basis for further research to determine control mechanisms operating during specific double fertilization events in angiosperms.

We have studied, under greenhouse conditions, the effect of two temperature regimes (T25 and T35) on parthenocarpic fruit set in three pepino clones; a strong parthenocarpic clone, a non-parthenocarpic clone, and the hybrid between them. The T25 regime (25°C maximum, 10-14°C minimum) was shown to be close to the optimum regime for pepino fruit set. High temperatures of T35 (maximum of 35°C) completely hampered fruit set of the non-parthenocarpic clone, but did not affect fruit set of either the parthenocarpic clone or the hybrid. High temperatures reduced pollen fertility and pollen release from the anthers in all clones, but had no significant adverse effects on pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the style. The percentage of seedless fruit varied greatly with the temperature regime, and is therefore not a good index of parthenocarpic fruit set ability.

New data based on time-lapse video microscopy of pollen on Nicotiana alata stigmas and in culture, as well as style squashes and pollinations with pollen bearing the marker gene Gus, are presented. The initial guidance of pollen tubes as they emerge from grains on the stigma is probably by a gradient in the concentration of water in the immediate environment of the pollen grain. At later stages of growth on the stigma, the probability that tube tips will encounter an opening is high because of the tendency of tubes to maintain contact with the surface. Styles support pollen tube growth either towards or away from the ovary, suggesting that they have no constitutive directionality. Guidance within solid transmitting tracts is probably by default, i.e. the architecture of the tissue means that pollen tubes can only grow in the intercellular spaces between the parallel files of cells. Pollen tubes within the ovary of N. alata do not appear to be precisely guided to the nearest ovule, and further, quantitative studies of growth in this region are needed.

Significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies were detected between populations at all polymorphic loci (p&lt;0.001), among-population genetic differentiation accounted for 12.3% of the total variation. Indirect estimates of the number of migrants per generation (Nm) (1.77, calculated from G ST) indicate that gene flow is moderate among populations of C. coreana. The allozyme diversity and population structure in C. coreana may be attributed to relatively long-distance flight of pollinators in early spring, gravity seed dispersal, restricted distribution, and high density in the standing populations of the species. © 2000 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",Allozymes; Corylopsis Coreana; Genetic Differentiation; Genetic Diversity; Genetic Structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033753215

Feistmantel) E. Knobloch (Cheirolepidiaceae), occurring mostly in the Cenomanian of Europe, is revised on the basis of the type material. Its comparison with relevant species of Frenelopsis is discussed. The ovuliferous cone associated with the genus Frenelopsis is recorded for the first time. For the associated ovuliferous cones of Frenelopsis, a new genus, Alvinia, is introduced in a new combination for the type: Alvinia bohemica (Velenovsky) comb, n. Its association with Frenelopsis alata is based on the presence of Classopollis pollen adhering to ovuliferous cone scales, and the same type of pollen found in the microsporangiate cone of F. alata, the same cuticle pattern present on ovuliferous cones, sterile twigs and microsporangiate cones of F. alata, and also the co-occurrence of ovuliferous cones or their scales and sterile twigs of F. alata. Large ovuliferous cones of Alvinia bohemica are formed by helically arranged ovuliferous scales subtended by bracts. Each ovuliferous cone scale displays one or two seeds covered by a covering flap, and three appendages, which form distally a funnel-like structure lined in its inner part by long trichomes. Numerous pollen grains of Classopollis adhere to the trichomes, and the structure is considered to function as a protostigmatic area. The ovuliferous cones of Alvinia differ from similar cones of the Cheirolepidiaceae, Hirmeriella and Tomaxellia, mainly in a high state of unification of the ovuliferous cone scale, reduction of appendages and in a presence of the protostigmatic funnel-like structure. The ovuliferous cones, Alvinia bohemica, rarely occur intact, so it is assumed that they disintegrate when mature. It seems likely that they were not woody. This assumption is supported by the flattened appearance of cones and their cone scales in the sediment, their flexibility and the absence of massive coaly matter known from cones of the Taxodiaceae and Cupressaceae. It is proposed that this type of ovuliferous cone scale indicates a specialized type of pollination. In addition, it is suggested that cone scales enclosing seeds play an important role in propagation.

To address this deficit, we examined flowering phenology in the cv. Red Hot Glory, a representative of the Longum group of peppers. Measurements of bud length and width showed that these characteristics can provide an effective index of the number of days required by a bud to reach anthesis. Anthesis itself mainly occurred during the morning with a second, smaller peak of flower opening in the afternoon. Measurements made in spring and summer suggested that the daily start of anthesis is controlled by daylength. In flowers that opened before 1700 hours, anther dehiscence took place 1 h after the buds opened; in flowers that opened later, dehiscence was delayed until the following morning. This pattern of anther dehiscence suggests that this event is partially controlled by the flower's endogenous rhythms. Controlled pollinations showed that the period of female receptivity, as judged by seed set, lasted from 5 days before anthesis to 3 days after anthesis with maximum fertility occurring on the day of anthesis. Therefore, bud pollinations are possible, and, for maximum seed set, should be made as close to the day of anthesis as possible.

Nakai] have variable degrees of self-incompatibility (SI) and can be classified into at least three groups: strong, intermediate, or weak SI; as shown by the extent of self-pollen tube growth in the style, and the percentage of fruit set following self-pollination. Following self-pollination, the elongation of pollen tubes in the detached styles of 'Kosui' and 'Kikusui' became increasingly suppressed from 4 days before anthesis (-4 DAA) to 2 days after anthesis (2 DAA). Tube growth of 'Kosui' was more suppressed than that of 'Kikusui' during this period. In 'Osa-Nijisseiki', however, the rate of tube growth did not vary with stage of stylar development, from -8 to 2 DAA. Pollen tubes elongated much better after cross-pollination than after self-pollination at all stages tested, and the extent of the elongation increased as the styles matured. The concentration of total S-protein (sum of two S-proteins per buffer-soluble protein) increased with stylar development, but the rate of increase varied with the cultivar. The rate was significantly greater in the strongly self-incompatible 'Kosui' than in the moderately self-incompatible 'Kikusui', and was slowest in the weakly self-incompatible 'Osa-Nijisseiki' at all developmental stages. During stylar maturation, the concentration of S4-protein, which is common in all cultivars, was highest in 'Kosui', followed by 'Kikusui' and 'Osa-Nijisseiki'.

Br.] is traditionally a small grain crop, a trait associated with adaption to marginal environments, there are both agronomic and usage-related reasons for seeking to increase individual grain mass (or size). Individual grain mass appears to have a low to moderate heritability in pearl millet, suggesting that genetic improvement based on some form of progeny testing is likely to be effective. The objective of this research was to quantify the percentage increase in individual grain mass that could be achieved in a modern open-pollinated millet cultivar, ICMS 7703, by two cycles of recurrent S1 progeny selection for increased grain mass and maintenance of grain yield potential. Evaluated across 10 test environments, two cycles of selection achieved an 18% increase in individual grain mass (8.05-9.52 mg per grain), with no change in grain yield per square meter. Substantial improvement in individual grain mass in pearl millet is thus possible with targeted recurrent selection, where larger seed size provides an agronomic or processing advantage, or enhances consumer preference.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033998777

Moreover vegetative propagation of E. nitens has proved to be difficult and until this problem can be overcome, seed remains the only viable option for planting programmes. We are developing a clearer understanding of mechanisms that control floral induction in E. nitens and this has helped to provide the basis for a more intensive management of seed production. The use of growth retardants in orchards has proved a useful method to increase production of genetically improved seed. Containerised systems, although expensive to manage, offer the most efficient method to produce controlled-pollinated (CP) seed. Control of the level of selfing, by chemical emasculation, could ensure the production of outcrossed seed. Screening of progeny using molecular markers to seek desirable traits should enable the early selection of elite material for use in seed orchards. While seed orchards continue to be an important source of improved seed, ongoing research is required to optimise orchard management and capture potential genetic gains. A summary of different techniques to produce genetically improved seed is provided so that one can compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Several improvements in techniques are suggested. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011274659

Thus, the proximity of croplands was found to be important in determining the magnitude of the concentrations, and this was also confirmed with a study of the concentrations measured directly in the croplands. Autumn and summer rainfall was found to affect, and also to have a certain influence on the length of the flowering period. The daily variations in pollen levels were studied in relation to meteorological parameters, finding a correlation that was positive with respect to temperature and negative with respect to atmospheric humidity and the distance travelled by the wind, i.e. airflow measured in hm with a revolving-cup anemometer. These correlations were the same in all three of the localities studied. The direction of the wind, however, was found to have different effects according to the locality studied. This is explained by their positions relative to the irrigation zones in the region. The pattern of diurnal pollen release from these taxa shows the greatest levels to be reached between 10:00 and 12:00 hours in Mérida as well as in Badajoz. In Cáceres, however, the distribution throughout the day was very even, with few hourly variations. This may be due to the sparse representation of these species in the neighbourhood of the Cáceres trap, with the pollen having been transported from sources that were farther away. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033771283

The sampled vegetation includes all major community types: maritime turf and grassland, sedge flushes, dwarf forest, scrub, cushion bog, tussock grassland, and high altitude graminoid turfs and tundra. Macrophyllous forbs - characteristic plants of subantarctic islands - are common throughout. Most taxa have highly restricted pollen dispersal, largely due to the short stature of the vegetation and the high proportion of insect-pollinated species. Percentages of pollen or spores of the dominant taxa have a significant positive correlation with the percent vegetation cover of the corresponding species, the exceptions being the widespread ferns Polystichum vestitum and Blechnum spp., and the ubiquitous macrophyllous forb, Bulbinella rossii. The relationship between the vegetation cover of a given taxon and its pollen representation was usually not strong enough to give confidence in a quantitative reconstruction based on pollen frequency alone. However, the broad vegetation groupings have characteristic pollen and spore spectra clearly related to the abundance of their dominant plant species. Detrended correspondence analysis of the pollen spectra grouped most sites according to their source vegetation type and generated a pattern similar to that of vegetation data analysed in a similar fashion in previous studies of the island.

In this study we report on mapping of a DNA fragment introgressed into cultivated tomato presumably from the wild species L. hirsutum Humb. and Bonpl. and found to be associated with TYLCV resistance. To locate introgressions of wild tomato alleles in TYLCV-resistant tomato line H24, its DNA was digested with six restriction enzymes and probed with 90 RFLP markers evenly spaced throughout the genome. This polymorphism survey revealed the presence of one wild tomato introgression each on chromosomes 8 and 11. Plants of a F2 cross between H24 and a susceptible tomato line were probed with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RFLP) markers linked to the targeted regions of F3 families were developed by self-pollination of F2 plants that carried none, one, or both introgressions in either homozygous or heterozygous states. Plants of F1 families, parents, and control tomato line Ty52 (homozygous for the Ty-1 allele for TYLCV tolerance) were exposed to viruliferous whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci Gennadius) in greenhouses at the Asia Vegetable Research and Development Center, Taiwan, and the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India. Results indicated that F3 families homozygous for the introgression on chromosome 11 were resistant to TYLCV at both locations.

Pollinations were made on either individually bagged branches or trees covered entirely with polyethylene using mixtures of pollen of five genotypes to minimize low cluster set due to single incompatible combinations. Percent cluster set, seed germination, and hybrid seedling survival were determined. Hybridity of seedlings was verified by inspection of morphological traits. Based on percent cluster set, seed germination, and hybrid seedling survival along with observed morphological similarities, Corylus species were placed in three groups: 1) the tree hazels C. colurna L.

The pre-fertilization barriers observed were anomalous and stunted growth of pollen tubes in the style.

After floral induction, the first act of reproductive development in some plants is the selective killing of cells destined to differentiate into an unwanted sexual organ. Production of functional pollen grains relies significantly on deterioration and death of the anther tapetum, a tissue whose main function appears to nurture and decorate the pollen grains with critical surface molecules. Degeneration and death in a number of anther tissues result ultimately in anther rupture and dispersal of pollen grains. Female sporogenesis frequently begins with the death of all but one of the meiotic derivatives, with surrounding nucellar cells degenerating in concert with embryo sac expansion. Female tissues that interact with pollen undergo dramatic degeneration, including death, to ensure the encounter of compatible male and female gametes. Pollen and pistil interact to kill invading pollen from an incompatible source. Most observations on cell death in reproductive tissues have been on the histological and cytological levels. We discuss various cell death phenomena in reproductive development with a view towards understanding the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes.",Fertilization; Male sterility; Pollination; Sex determination; Tapetum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034483033

One relatively underexamined factor is the timing and intensity of attack by herbivores that feed on flowers or developing seeds. This study tests the hypothesis that herbivores that feed on developing seeds of wild sunflower, Helianthus annuus (Asteraceae), impose selection on flowering phenology. First, the study population was found to contain genetic variation for mean date of flowering, so this trait could evolve if natural selection were operating. Next, the phenological pattern of abundance of five seed-feeding herbivores was documented. Damage by three herbivores, Haplorhynchites aeneus (Cucurlionidae), the head-clipping weevil, Homoeosoma electellum (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), the sunflower moth, and Suleima helianthana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), the sunflower bud moth, was highest early in the flowering season, and declined as the season progressed. Damage by one herbivore, the seed fly Gymnocarena diffusa (Diptera: Tephrididae), was lowest early in the flowering season and increased as the season progressed. Finally, damage by two seed weevils, Smicronyx fulvus and S. sordidus (Curculionidae), whose damage was not distinguished, was constant through the flowering period. Third, damage by Haplorhynchites, Homoeosoma, and Suleima was found to be detrimental to plant fitness, suggesting that plants that flower when these herbivores are not abundant should have higher fitness. Finally, two phenotypic selection analyses were performed. The first included damage by Homoeosoma and Suleima, as well as flowering date, leaf area, and inflorescence diameter, as characters predicting plant fitness. In this analysis directional selection was found to act to decrease damage by the two herbivores, but did not act on flowering date. The second selection analysis was identical except that damage by the two herbivores was not included. In this analysis significant directional selection was found to favor later-flowering plants. Comparison of these two analyses suggests that all selection on flowering phenology is attributable to damage by Homoeosoma and Suleima: plants that flower later avoid damage by these two herbivores. While other influences on flowering phenology, such as pollination, mate availability, and seasonality, have been well documented, this study is one of few to demonstrate natural selection on flowering phenology that is a direct consequence of insect attack.",Flowering phenology; Helianthus annuus; Herbivory; Natural selection; Resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033951530

All the populations were found to be diploid, with a chromosome number 2n=2x=16, including a pair of nucleolar chromosomes, and the karyotype was fairly homogeneous. Microsporogenesis analysis showed an almost normal meiosis, with only bivalents at diakinesis. Quite a good percentage of fertile pollen was found in all six populations, but considerable variability was observed in the percentage of flowers with 2, 3 and 4 ovules, both between and within populations. Bagging experiments showed a distinct prevalence of allogamy. Self-pollination resulted in a very low production of pods and seeds, with the Mostaganem population even scoring zero production. Blooming time and duration varied to some extent from one population to another. For the whole of the characteristics considered, the widest differences were observed between Tipaza and Mostaganem, two populations which belong to two extreme climatic areas.","Cytogenetics; Hedysarum spp., Karyotype; Reproductive systems",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033932613

Our objective was to determine female response to pollen availability in Amaranthus cannabinus (L.) Sauer, a dioecious annual. Plants from two southern New Jersey tidal marsh populations (fresh, FW; salt, SM) were grown under spring greenhouse conditions until initiation of flower development. Females of each population were then paired as to height and vigor, and one of each pair was placed in a closed greenhouse room without males. The other females, surrounded by males, were placed in a comparable greenhouse room. One month later at harvest, seed-bearing plants were senescing, while pollen-deprived plants were green with clusters of turgid stigmas at the base of almost every petiole and branch as well as at the end of branches. There were no changes in sex expression; those females without pollen produced only female flowers. There were no significant differences in total biomass between treatments but striking differences in resource (biomass) allocation. Pollen-deprived plants allocated 61% (FW) and 37% (SM) more biomass to reproductive structures other than seeds. For plants from both populations, the pollen-deprived plants allocated at least 68% more to stems, and 37% (FW) and 57% (SM) more to leaves. Confirming the earlier senescence of the pollinated plants, leaf drop at the time of harvest was 24% (FW) and 33% (SM) greater. Overall, females of freshwater and salt marsh populations showed a similar pattern in their allocation responses to pollen availability.",Amaranthus cannabinus; Dioecy; Pollen availability; Resource allocation; Sex expression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034105258

MAS can be used to pyramid several R-genes into a single host genotype. However, this may not provide durable genetic resistance because the pathogen is exposed to a full homozygous pyramid during hybrid seed production and to a full heterozygouS pyramid in the resultant hybrid. Alternative gene deployment strategies that generate genetic variability were analysed, for hybrid cereal cultivars of pearl millet, maize, sorghum and rice, using maintainer lines (B-lines) with two smaller complementary pyramids. An F1 seed parent, produced on two such B-lines, can be used to produce a three way hybrid. All target loci are heterozygous for resistance alleles in the F1 seed parent, and the pathogen is exposed in the hybrid to a host population that is heterogeneous and heterozygous for alleles at the resistance loci targeted by MAS. Alternatively, single-cross hybrids can be made on seed parents that are maintained by two B-lines that differ for the complementary resistance gene pyramids. In a cross-pollinated crop, the B-lines are allowed to intermate to produce a synthetic B-line. In an inbreeding crop, the B-lines are equivalent to a two-component multiline variety. In inbreeding crops, because there is no intermating between the B-line components, the resultant synthetic seed parents have a higher frequency of genotypes with resistance alleles (R-alleles) at several resistance loci. However, in both cross-pollinated and inbreeding crops the genotypic structure in the hybrids is almost the same. All alternatives to a single-cross hybrid having a full pyramid produce hybrid cultivars having lower frequencies of resistance alleles. The frequency of genotypes having R-alleles at several loci increases greatly in both seed parent and hybrid when the overall frequency of R-alleles in the maintainer lines increases. This is simply done by adding a maintainer line that has a full pyramid or by the component lines having overlapping pyramids.",Durable resistance; Hybrids; Maize; Marker-assisted selection; Pearl millet; Resistance gene deployment strategies; Rice; Sorghum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034009522

At temperatures of 20/10°C (day/night) stigmas of white clover remained receptive to additional pollination up to 32 h after an initial compatible pollination and 40 h after an incompatible pollination.

An essential element in this color change is the fact that after pollination the leucoplasts which are present at anthesis start turning into chloroplasts. These show ultrastructural features indicating photosynthetic activity, contain high levels of a complete set of chlorophylls and carotenoids, photooxidize 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as an indicator for the presence of photosystem I, and synthesize light-harvesting complex proteins (LHC II) attributed to photosystem II. The photosynthetic capacity ultimately attained by the sepals, expressed in ?mol O2/hour/g fresh weight (or dry weight), is about half that of the leaves present at the same time, while the respective values per mg of total chlorophylls are identical within the limits of experimental error. Leaves in this species emerge during the final stages of fruit ripening, fully expand after seed maturity, and will survive until next spring, to die back at anthesis of the next generation of flowers or shortly thereafter. During fruit development, the chloroplasts in the sepals are thus a major source of assimilates. The metamorphosis of the sepals into photosynthetically active organs only occurs in fruit-bearing flowers and is arrested at a very early stage in controls in which the pistils are removed before pollination.",Carotenoid; Chlorophyll; Fruit-induced morphogenesis; Helleborus niger L; Perianth; Photosynthesis; Plastid metamorphosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033735728

The proportion of buzzes was greater when the colony was deprived of pollen than when it was deprived of nectar. When deprived of both resources, pollen collection behaviour was yet more frequent, suggesting that pollen can serve, at least in part, as a substitute for nectar.

The capacity for MPR was lower in the early-ripening cultivars as compared to the late-ripening ones. Changes in embryo transparency within an intact ear (an index characterizing embryo development) were monitored visually during the period between 6 and 12 days after artificial pollination in a climatic chamber. During this period, completely transparent embryos became opaque at the axis, then at the scutellum, and, finally, they became completely nontransparent. This process proceeded more rapidly in the early-ripening cultivars. We suggested that the cause of the lower level of MPR in the early-ripening cultivars was the accelerated development of their embryos and, as a result, the shortening of the period for which they were capable of MPR.",Early ripeness; Embryos; Hordeum vulgare; Plant regeneration in vitro,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033634116

Our results revealed that the actin cytoskeleton displays dramatic changes in the egg apparatus and appears to coordinate the events of synergid degeneration, pollen tube arrival and gametic fusion during fertilization. Synergid degeneration occurs after anthesis and is accompanied by actin fragmentation and degradation. The actin cytoskeleton becomes organized with numerous aggregates in the chalazal end of the degenerating synergid, and some of the actin infiltrates into the intercellular gap between synergids, egg and central cell, forming a distinct actin band. An actin cap is present near the filiform apparatus after anthesis and disappears after pollen tube arrival. In the egg cell, actin filaments initially organize into a network and after pollination become fragmented into numerous patches in the cortex. These structures, along with the actin in the degenerating synergid and intercellular spaces form two distinct actin coronas during fertilization. The actin coronas vanish after gametic fusion. This is the first report of changes in actin organization in the living egg apparatus. The reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the egg apparatus and the presence of the actin coronas during fertilization suggest these events may be a necessary prelude to reception of the pollen tube and fusion of the male and female gametes.",Actin; Egg apparatus; Fertilization; Microinjection; Torenia fournieri,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033935408

Fresh F1 and back-cross grains were generated, so the material could be handled either as the standard set of basic generations on a whole-plant basis, or as an extended set on an embryo or endosperm basis. The experiment was repeated. Mature grains were harvested and the starch particle size distribution was analysed in 3284 grains from 111 plants. Means and variances were partitioned into additive, dominance and interaction components. Grains from cross-pollinations had B-granule contents between parental values, rather than of the maternal parent, indicating an involvement of the grain genotype. Quantitative models based on endosperm genotype gave a better fit to the data than those based on embryo genotype. The difference in starch B-granule content between the parents was largely due to additive genes. Dominant genes were also indicated, with the first dose in the triploid endosperm having a large effect while the second dose had little or none. Non-allelic interactions were significant in the second experiment where the use of more types of backcross made them more detectable. There were also small and significant residual effects of the maternal plant in the first experiment, attributed to the vigour of the F1 mother plant and to the cytoplasm of Sunco. Narrow-sense heritability was low, between 0.05 and 0.18 depending on the generation. Transgressive segregation was not found, suggesting that all alleles tending to increase the B-granule content were found in the Sunco parent and none in ME71. There was also no detectable heterosis in this character. The results show that breeding and selection for a low B-granule content should be possible but a further red fiction will require new and complementary genes.",A granules; B granules; Quantitative analysis; Starch quality; Triploid endosperm; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034039760

In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) embryos, there are two peaks in levels of ABA during development: the first occurs 25 days after pollination (DAP) and the second from 35 to 40 DAP. The first peak of ABA appears to be associated with the development of the embryo's sensitivity to ABA since such sensitivity was altered in seeds on ears that were incubated in a solution of ABA from 15 and 20 DAP. In the embryos of Kitakei wheat, a line that exhibits dormancy, the second peak, at around 35 DAP, was more prolonged in comparison to Chihoku, a non-dormant line. The results support the proposed involvement of ABA in the formation and maintenance of seed dormancy during middle and late embryogenesis. When developing embryos were incubated in water, embryonic ABA leaked out from the embryos, in particular between 30 and 40 DAP. Premature germination observed between 30 and 40 DAP might be related to such leakage of ABA from embryos.",Abscisic acid (ABA); Dormancy; Premature germination; Seed; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034099884

Total biomass and the relative contribution of the above- and below-ground compartments weremeasured, as well as the shoot density and phenological parameters of vegetative and fertile shoots. Flowering and seed production were also investigated and the stages of Spathe maturation were recorded. Total biomass was highest in summer and lowest in autumn; the relative contribution of the above-ground compartment, mainly composed of leaf blades. Was highest in summer and lowest in autumn, when it accounted for about 40 % and 7 %, respectively. Below-ground organs (rhizomes and roots) accounted for a higher fraction during the autumn-winter period. Shoot density and all the phenological features of vegetative shoots, except the number of leaves per shoot, changed widely throughout the year with maxima generally occurring in spring-summer and minima in autumn-winter. With regard to the sexual reproduction, the flowering of Z. marina was at the initial stage and the density of fertile shoots m-2 was lower in winter than in spring (6 vs 265 fertile shoots m-2), when ripe fruits occurred on spathes. In summer, the fertile shoots still present (5 fertile shoots m-2) were dark-brown coloured with evident signs of decay. A pollination success of 55 % was observed and a potential of seed production of more than 20000 seeds m-2 was estimated in spring. The seasonal plant dynamics and the timing of the sexual reproduction of Z. marina at Grado seem to be similar to those observed in the Lagoon of Venice and in some areas outside the Mediterranean Sea. The results of this paper and the published data emphasise the great variability in the temporal dynamics, phenological features of both vegetative and reproductive shoots, and in the potential seed production of Z. marina. In this respect, the well known phenotypic plasticity of this species may account for its ability to live in variable environmental conditions. The high potential of sexual reproduction, however, is apparently in contrast with the absence of records of seedlings in the northern Adriatic Sea.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033645999

We also measured ten pitcher characteristics and examined their relationship to variations in 24 h sugar amount. Sugar amount was higher at night for both bagged and non-bagged pitchers. During the day nonbagged pitchers had lower sugar amounts than bagged pitchers, perhaps due to removal of nectar by insects. A similar, but less pronounced, difference was observed at night.

Research Foundation, Forest Research Institute, Terma Alkmanos, Athens 11528, Greece","In January 1987 a 10 ha clonal seed orchard of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) was established in the area Amphilochia, Greece. The orchard comprises 76 clones derived from intensively selected trees in the natural forests of Euboia island. In November 1986, two open pollinated progeny tests were established in central west Greece proximal to Nafpaktos and Stamna. Seedlings from 63 to 70 families, including a commercial check, were planted at the Stamna and Nafpaktos locations, respectively. One year later (Spring, 1988) an additional planting including 32 families plus the commercial check was established in the area of Limni on Euboia island. Assessments were made in 1997 when trees were 10 years (Nafpaktos and Stamna) and 9 years (Limni) from planting and the following results were obtained. Variation among families for growth (height, DBH, volume), bark thickness, branch angle, cone production, straightness, and crown form were considerable. The mean annual height increment was greater at Stamna (75 cm) followed by Nafpaktos (46 cm) and Limni (43 cm). The mean annual growth at Stamna (75 cm) is considered very satisfactory and indicates the high potentiality of Aleppo pine when planted in relative good sites. Narrow sense heritability estimates on individual tree basis (h2) were variable depending on the characteristic and the location of the experimental planting. Heritability values for height were 0.45, 0.43 and 0.42 for Nafpaktos, Stamna and Limni plantings, respectively. The corresponding h2 values for branch length, branch thickness and branch angle were 0.22, 0.26 and 0.42. Cone production was the stronger inherited trait with h2 = 0.68 for Limni and h2 = 0.57 for Stamna. Realized genetic gains were calculated for growth characteristics (height, DBH and volume) using the pooled data of the two (Nafpaktos and Stamna) experimental plantings; Limni site was not considered due to low number of families (32) included in the planting. The performances of the improved materials were compared to unimproved materials (commercial check). From the selection made in natural stands the realized gain was 5.2% for height, 7.68% for DBH and 13.0% for volume over the commercial check. When 20 % of the total number of clones with the lower breeding value are removed (rogued) from the seed orchard an additional gain of 2.7% for height, 2.71% for DBH and 8.19% for volume over the unrogued seed orchard is resulted. Thus, the total realized genetic gain for first generation, genetically tested, seed orchard of Aleppo pine is summed to 7.9% for height, 10.38% for DBH and 21.25% for volume. These results clearly show that selection of Aleppo pine followed by clonal seed orchard establishment and progeny testing is very profitable.",Breeding value; Heritability; Pinus halepensis; Realized genetic gain; Rogued seed orchard,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033944264

The measurement of the risk of inadvertent dispersal of transgenes must include the assessment of accidental dispersion of pollen. Factors to be considered include the rate of pollen spread, the maximal dispersion distance of pollen, and the spatial dynamics of pollen movement within seed production fields; none of which are known for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), an insect- pollinated crop species. Using a rare, naturally occurring molecular marker, alfalfa pollen movement was tracked from seed and hay production fields. Results indicated that leafcutter bees (Megachile spp.) used in commercial seed production show a directional, non-random bias when pollinating within fields, primarily resulting in the movement of pollen directly towards and away from the bee domicile. Within-field pollen movement was detected only over distances of 4 m or less. Dispersal of pollen from alfalfa hay and seed production fields occurs at distances up to 1000 m. By examining widely dispersed, individual escaped alfalfa plants and their progeny using RAPD markers, gene movement among escaped alfalfa plants has been confirmed for distances up to 230 m. The outcrossing frequency for large fields was nearly 10-times greater than that of research-sized plots. A minimum isolation distance of 1557 m may be required to prevent gene flow in alfalfa. Data suggest that complete containment of transgenes within alfalfa seed or hay production fields would be highly unlikely using current production practices.",Escaped plants; Gene flow; Medicago sativa L.; Megachile spp.; Pollen dissemination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033929308

Its flowering phenology corresponds to the sub-annual frequency class of Newstrom et al., with a major burst in November. Flowers lasted for 3 to 4 days and produced abundant hexose-dominant nectar with its chemical composition and concentration (ca. 22%) constant across all flowering stages. Most of the total nectar was secreted by buds. When the flowers first opened, most (> 50%) of the total nectar was available to pollinators. As flowers faded, a resorption period began. The overall sugar production was not affected by nectar removal. Hand crosses showed that this species is self-compatible. Crossed fruits showed significant differences from hand-selfed ones (autogamy and geitonogamy). Xenogamous fruits and seeds showed the highest values for many traits (fruit mass, total seeds per fruit mass, mean seed mass, and seed germination percentage). Approximately 6% of the flowers set seeds in natural populations. Hymenopterans (carpenter bees and honeybees) and hummingbirds (four species) assiduously visited the trees in all the areas sampled and can be assumed pollinators. Almost 93% of recorded flowers were visited by bees, with the rest visited by hummingbirds. Phylogenetically, this species was included in the basal clade for the genus and characterized as passerine/hummingbird pollinated. However, we found that not only birds but bees functioned as major pollinators. This observation may indicate that this basal clade may represent an intermediate step from entomophily (typical of tribe Phaseoleae) to ornithophily (typical of Erythrina).",Breeding system; Erythrina; Fabaceae; Flower visitors; Nectar features; Nectary,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033949005

These structures reflected unstructured, autoregressive, banded correlation and random regressions models. The residual matrix (R0) was unstructured, and the block and plot strata matrices were autoregressive. The best model for G0 considering the likelihood value and number of parameters was the autoregressive correlation form with age-specific variances and time on a natural logarithm basis. The genetic correlation between successive measures ranged from 0.93 at age 1 to 0.99 at age 14 years. Heritability increased with age from 0.09 (age 1) to 0.24 (age 7) and then declined to 0.13 at age 15. Heritabilities from the unstructured model were similar, while heritabilities assuming banded correlations were lower after age 7. The covariance structure implicit in the random regressions model was considered unsatisfactory. Using structures in G0 facilitated model fitting and convergence of the likelihood maximisation algorithm.

A 709-bp fragment of DDC has been sequenced in 32 species, including representatives of all major lineages of Heteroneura plus outgroups from more basal lepidopteran groups and the related order Trichoptera. Pairwise divergences across the first and second codon positions and amino acids increase with depth throughout the taxonomic hierarchy, indicating that non-synonymous substitutions are not fully saturated; whereas, divergences across the third codon position level off at the family to superfamily level. Inclusion of non-neolepidopteran outgroups results in phytogeny estimates that contradict well established groups, almost surely due to sparse taxon sampling and high character divergence. When these taxa and an equivalently divergent basal ditrysian are excluded, DDC trees show nearly complete recovery of ten uncontroversial basal heteroneuran 'test clades' of family rank and higher, about half with strong bootstrap support. Thus, DDC clearly carries phylogenetic signal at these levels. Bootstrap support for resolution of the controversial relationships among the five main heteroneuran groups (four monotrysian superfamilies plus Ditrysia) is individually low, but two of three previous hypotheses were statistically rejected overall by DDC. DDC trees within the primitive heteroneuran superfamily Incurvarioidea, though modestly supported, closely resemble a previous morphological hypothesis, while removing the requirement for reversal in a possible 'key adaptation'. the larval case. Taxon overlap with a previous mtDNA study of Prodoxidae (Incurvarioidea), which includes much-studied mutualist pollinators, permits a comparison of substitution rates with the conservative mitochondrial COI + COII region, as well as combined-data re-examination of generic reltionships. Non-synonymous substitution is about 25% slower in DDC than in COI + COII, though synonymous substitution is faster. With additional taxon sampling, and in combination with other genes, DDC, promises to be a powerful tool for reconstructing among-superfamily relationships within Lepidoptera and probably other insect groups. © 2000 The Linnean Society of London.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034348620

Here, experiments conducted to determine the mechanism of the recovery phenotype and whether enhanced resistance could be obtained by combining transgenes from susceptible and recovery plants are reported. Upper leaves of SqMV-3 plants were sampled for Northern analysis at 17, 31 and 45 days after germination (DAG) and a proportion of plants were inoculated with SqMV. SqMV-3 plants inoculated at a young stage (17 DAG) showed susceptible or recovery phenotypes. However, a number of plants inoculated at later developmental stages (31 or 45 DAG) were resistant to infection. Resistance of recovery plants was due to PTGS that was activated at a later developmental stage, independent of virus infection. Similar results were observed with plants grown under field conditions. To investigate the interactions of transgenes, progeny of crosses between SqMV-127, -3 and -22 were inoculated with SqMV. Progeny with the transgene of line 127 were resistant. However, a number of plants with transgenes from the recovery and susceptible lines or the self-pollinated recovery line were resistant even when inoculated at a young stage.

As many as three generations of inbreds (I1, I2, and I3) from self-pollinations were created using rapid generation cycling. Female and male fertility levels of the parents and all derived inbred populations were assessed using outcross seed set and pollen stainability, respectively.

Self-incompatibility reactions occur on the stigma surface at an early stage after pollination, and result in the complete arrest of pollen germination such that no seed is set. In a genetic analysis of 224 plants of diploid I. trifida, collected from six native populations in Central America, we identified 49 different S-alleles that showed a linear dominance-recessive hierarchy. We also obtained a spontaneous self-compatible mutant and showed that this self-compatibility trait is due to mutation at the S-locus. To investigate the molecular basis of sporophytic self-incompatibility in Ipomoea, we analysed stigma proteins and mRNAs extracted from several different S-genotypes, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and AFLP-based mRNA fingerprinting (AMF), respectively. From the 2D-PAGE analyses, S-locus-linked stigma proteins (SSPs) were identified. The amino acid sequences of these proteins have a high homology to non-metallo short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases reported in several plant species. The SSP gene was mapped at a distance of 1.2 cM from the S-locus. In the AMF analysis, we obtained a clone homologous to the Brassica SRK, which showed no genetic linkage to the S-locus of Ipomoea. This suggests that the sporophytic self-incompatibility system of Ipomoea is mediated through a different molecular mechanism to that of Brassica.

The species flowers in spring, its fruits ripen in autumn and has a latent ovary period during the summer. Vegetative growth starts immediately after anthesis (end of March) and finishes by the second week of June. Bud sections showed that flower induction occurred a few weeks after shoot development. However, no change in the overall appearance of the buds was noticeable before the following spring. Flowering is very synchronous within a plant, and a clear overlap in the flowering times of the two sexes occurred in the population studied. Although P. lentiscus seems to be highly reproductive because of the numerous fruits generally found on the plants in autumn, its reproductive success (as percent of flowers which develop fruits with seed) is low. Very large numbers of flowers never develop fruit and drop at different stages during fruit development. Moreover, numerous fruits have no seed because of partheno- carpy, embryo abortion or insect damage. In P. lentiscus, low reproductive success is not uniform within the population because the number of empty fruits per plant is highly variable between the plants. Our observations suggest that rain at flowering can make pollination a limiting factor for fruit set because of the reduction in the quantity of available pollen. Since these results are in agreement with those reported for populations in Israel and Spain, such phenomena could be genetically determined, and therefore common to this species throughout the Mediterranean region. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Mediterranean; Phenology; Pistacia lentiscus; Plant reproduction; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034541443

To detect the polarity in sculpture evolution, pollinia of three species (Restrepia elegans, Myoxanthus ceratothallis. Octomeria grandiflora) were studied with TEM. Compared with other taxa of the subfamily Epidendroideae, the Pleurothallidinae reveal a strong tendency towards sporoderm reduction. Besides a primitive surface there are 5 derived types which have evolved along two major morphological lines: psilate-reticulate-octomerioid and psilate-granulatelepanthoid/hamulate/gemmate. Caudicular regions generally show an undifferentiated exinous layer. Even primitive representatives of the subtribe have a reduced stratification compared with the classic angiospermous tectate-columellate pollen wall. Starting with a partially baculate sporoderm, which already lacks the nexine (Restrepia) we find a highly reduced pollen wall with a compact sporopollenin-layer and a stratified intine in Octomeria and Myoxanthus. Pollen walls of the inner pollinium consist only of a bi-layered intine. In Octomeria inner tetrads are separated by a partially perforated cell wall comparable to the callose wall of the pollen mother cell. Palynological data and their systematic implications are summarized in a diagram. Except for Pleurothallis and Masdesvallia, which seem to be paraphyletic, surface types are consistent with the genera. However, some of them have apparently evolved independently several times. Reduction patterns coincide with major trends of orchidaceous sporoderm evolution. Some of the surface types, however, have been undocumented in the family so far. They show the subtribe as a highly derived natural taxon, which is still actively evolving. Adaptations to very small pollinators (dipterans) and short dispersal distances of the pollen, along with the high humidity of the natural habitat, have apparently triggered the reduction processes of the pleurothallid sporoderm.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034464834
