The ornithophilous and sphingophilous species are sympatric over large areas and remain distinct in some sites where they grow close together. Floral isolation-a combination of mechanical and ethological isolation-plays a significant role in the reproductive isolation. The primary pollinators of the ornithophilous taxa are the common western American species of hummingbirds, and the primary pollinators of the sphingophilous taxa are western hawkmoths. The ornithophilous and sphingophilous flowers are adapted to their respective primary pollinators. A corollary of these specializations is that the differences between the two types of floral mechanisms significantly reduce interspecific pollination. The floral isolation is incomplete. However, it acts not alone but in conjunction with ecological and seasonal isolation, which are also incomplete. The combination of these three incomplete external isolating mechanisms is sufficient to maintain the distinctness of the ornithophilous and sphingophilous species in some areas of sympatric coexistence.",coadaptation; hawkmoth pollination; hummingbird pollination; Ipomopsis aggregata; mechanical isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027092365

Mardler to test if a particular stage of endosperm development was critical in determining the final grain weight. The basal four florets of emasculated spikelets (controls), and the third and fourth florets of spikelets where the two basal ovaries were removed (ovary-removed), were sampled at various times up to 360 h after hand-pollination. The coenocytic phase in endosperms ended about 84 h after pollination regardless of both grain position and the treatment. The onset of the cellular stage was characterized by the final large fluctuations in the mitotic index reflecting the culmination of the synchronous nuclear division of the coenocytic stage. Thereafter, the mitotic index fluctuated with smaller amplitudes and, by 216 h after pollination, was < 1%. Neither floret position in the spikelet nor the treatment affected the pattern of alteration to the mitotic index. However, ovary removal from first and second florets resulted in significantly heavier grains and higher endosperm cell number in the 3rd and 4th florets compared with the controls. In all florets, mean endosperm cell number peaked at 280 h but decreased by 360 h after pollination. At this time, the mean cell numbers in endosperms of the 3rd and 4th florets of ovary-removed spikelets were significantly higher than in the corresponding endosperms in the controls. Thus, a key contributory factor in determining the final endosperm cell number may be the number of cells which are lost during the late period of the cellular stage of endosperm development. © 1992 Oxford University Press.",Endosperm cell number; Florets; Grain weight; Mitotic index; Triticum aestivum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000421950

However, whatever the dose used and the duration of its application, ABA was unable to induce dormancy because after transfer of treated embryos to control (without ABA) medium, germination occurred. Thereafter, exogenous ABA became effective and allowed the dormancy to develop in 13 and 17 DAP embryos, i.e. in embryos which after isolation were still able to germinate in high percentage. After embryo dormancy was well established (21 DAP), application of fluridone allowed the germination to occur very quickly on control medium. Isolated dormant axes were also induced to germinate by an application of fluridone. Radioimmunological analysis showed that 24 hours after these treatments, endogenous ABA levels were drastically reduced in the axes. When these fluridone-treated embryos were cultured on ABA medium, germination was again inhibited as long as exogenous ABA was present but germination occurred as soon as embryos were transferred to control medium.

Preliminary controls on the capture efficiency of both samplers have been conducted. The results of this survey have shown that the symptom score cards of the eight patients enrolled for the study, have always been well correlated with the average daily pollen concentration of the fixed station (Pearson correlation), and the data obtained by the two samplers have pointed out remarkable differences in the pollen concentration. According to the PVAS, placed near patients, the concentrations were twofold to sixfold as compared to those of the fixed station. This was probably due to the different height of the samplers.

Inhibition of putrescine and polyamine synthesis resulted in a rapid drop in the levels of putrescine and spermidine without resulting in a concomitant increase in ethylene production. These results indicate that polyamine synthesis is not involved in the control of ethylene synthesis through its effect on the availability of S-adenosylmethionine, and is confirmed by the results obtained with pollinated flowers. Treatment with polyamines may stimulate or suppress ethylene production in the corolla, depending on the concentrations applied. In unpollinated flowers the onset of the climacteric rise in ethylene production was accelerated after treatment with polyamines. However, in pollinated flowers this process was delayed as a result of treatment with low concentrations of polyamines. The effects of exogenous polyamines on ethylene production in both pollinated and unpollinated flowers indicate that ethylene synthesis in these flowers is not regulated by a feedback control mechanism. Although polyamines do not play a key role in the control of ethylene production during the early stages of senescence through their effect on the availability of S-adenosylmethionine, it appears that they play an important role in some of the other processes involved in senescence. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.","Ethylene synthesis; Petunia (ethylene, senescence); Pollination; Putrescine; Senescence; Spermidine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000770003

To test the pollinator-limitation hypothesis, we compared the seed production of plants whose flowers were supplementarily pollinated with outcross pollen to that of control plants receiving natural pollination only. To test if fruit production by early flowers suppresses fruit and seed formation by late flowers, a third group of plants was prevented from producing seed from the first 50% of the flowers to open (stigmas were excised at flower opening). Finally, to test if seed maturation and flower initiation are correlated with photosynthetic capacity, we performed a defoliation experiment in which either the stem leaves within the inflorescence, the stem leaves below the inflorescence, or the rosette leaves were removed during late flowering. Plants that reccived supplemental pollination produced 1.5-1.6 times more seeds than control plants. We found no difference between hand-pollinated plants and controls in mortality, flowering frequency or number of flowers produced in the year following the experiment. In both control and hand-pollinated plants, the fruit set and total seed production of early flowers were more than twice as high as those of late flowers. In one of the two populations, plants whose early flowers were prevented from setting seed produced significantly more seeds from their late flowers than did control plants. Seed predation was low and did not differ between early and late flowers. Leaf removal did not affect seed number or size in the year of defoliation, nor did it reduce survival or flower production in the subsequent year. This suggests that the plants were able to compensate for a partial defoliation by using stored resources or by increasing photosynthetic rates in the remaining leaves. Taken together, the results demonstrate that both pollinator activity and resource levels influence patterns of seed production in G. maculatum. While seed production was pollinatorlimited in both populations, a seasonal decline in resource availability was apparently responsible for the low seed production by late flowers. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Geranium maculatum; Pollinator limitation; Resource limitation; Seed production; Temporal variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027011557

All of the plants of these plots, which were naturally self pollinated, were individually harvested, and most of their progenies (92.5%) segregated seedlings carrying chlorophyll deficiencies (CD) as determined by greenhouse analysis. The majority of the mutant seedlings (84.3%) showed a pattern of longitudinal chlorophyll sectors. The spectrum of CD was wide among the solid mutant seedlings and consisted of three main types (albina, viridis and discontinuous). In association with some CD types morphological changes were frequently observed. Non-CD-associated morphological changes and diminished seed-set were scarce and, so far, none of them has proved to be inherited. Analysis of CD in reciprocal crosses and backcrosses proved that while CD were transmitted cytoplasmically their induction was controlled by a single nuclear mutator gene, active when homozygous. In addition once the CD were induced, they were expressed independently of the nuclear constitution. The results suggest that the mutator gene induces diverse mutational events on chloroplast (cp) DNA. In barley, as in other monocots, nuclear genes which are inductors of cytoplasmic genetic changes have been reported. However, all of them produced a narrower spectrum of CD and had a more rapid sorting-out of the cytoplasmic mutants than what we observed. On this basis a distinction between chloroplast and mitochondrial (mt) mutator genes is proposed. Accordingly, the chloroplast mutator here described would be the first one reported for monocots. Increased knowledge on this subject can play a fundamental role in elucidating organelle heredity and its interactions with the nuclear genome. Moreover, this material could be a valuable source of variability of the otherwise conservative genetic information encoded in the chloroplast. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Barley (Hordeum vulgare); Chlorophyll deficiencies; Cytoplasmic inheritance; Mutator gene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038050608

In this study, I investigated the effects of manipulating seed production on reproductive allocation within a season and between seasons in females and hermaphrodites of gynodioecious Sidalcea oregana ssp. spicata. Plants were either hand-pollinated to ensure maximum seed set (seed plants), or prohibited from pollination and seed set (no-seed plants). These treatments were effective; seed plants produced an average of 120 seeds whereas no-seed plants produced no seeds. Within a season, seed plants and no-seed plants produced similar numbers of flowers, but seed plants significantly reduced the amount of biomass allocated to each flower compared to no-seed plants. The sexual morphs differed in per-flower allocation: hermaphrodites allocated significantly more biomass to most floral structures (except to ovules) relative to females. Nonetheless, the sexual morphs exhibited similar proportional reductions in flower size in response to seed production. When allocation to floral display was characterized by petal length, the sexual morphs responded differently during the season; hermaphrodites, in both seed treatments, maintained larger petals over the season while females greatly reduced theirs. This could be interpreted as adaptive if pollen removal is positively related to petal size. In the season following the manipulations of seed production, plants which produced seeds in 1989 had reduced allocation to influorescences (and flowers) in 1990 compared to plants which did not produce seeds in 1989. A similar trend was not detected for vegetative growth between seasons. The sexual morphs did not differ significantly in their between season responses to the seed treatment. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Cost of reproduction; Floral allocation; Floral display; Gynodioecy; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027028120

In S. rufus, bill length averages 18.9 mm in females and 17.3 mm in males. Maximal tongue extension approximates bill length, suggesting that birds can feed from floral tubes up to 33.5 mm in length. However, their ability to do so is limited by two factors. First, the maximal depth at which S. rufus can extract nectar decreases with the width of the floral tube. Second, feeding time is shortest in short floral tubes and progressively increases as the tubes lengthen because of increased time required for tongue extension and retraction. Hence, nectar foraging occurs with optimal efficiency in moderately broad floral tubes with lengths that do not exceed or only slightly exceed the bill length plus ?5-mm tongue extension. In most ornithophilous taxa of Ipomopsis and Aquilegia, the floral tubes have lengths and widths in the optimal range for nectar foraging by S. rufus, whereas in the sphingophilous taxa, the basal nectar either may be reached but at much higher cost or, more frequently, is beyond reach of bills and tongues.

Raritan Formation of New Jersey. The fossils have a combination of floral and pollen characters found in various genera of modern entomophilous and anemophilous Hamamelidaceae and anemophilous Platanus (Platanaceae). The floral characters of the fossils, including a sepal cup, staminal tube, and apparently nectariferous staminodes, indicate that this taxon was probably insect pollinated. The juxtaposition of character complexes in an extinct taxon from disparate modern taxa provides an interesting phylogenetic perspective on the origins of Hamamelidaceae and is a striking example of a fossil that is a mosaic of familial level characters relative to modern taxa. Of even broader interest, however, is the occurrence of staminodal nectaries that have structural characters intermediate between the fossil's functional stamens and modern hamamelidaceous petals. This transitional staminode morphology in the context of the other fossil characters suggests a staminodal origin of petals in the hamamelid-rosid lineage. This hypothesis is supported by the apparent staminode position within the fossil flowers where petals are found in modern genera. The character complex of morphologically transitional staminodes, a staminal tube, and sepal cup can be viewed as prehypanthial, lacking only fusion of the staminal tube to the sepal cup. The appearance of the character complex embodied in these flowers during the late mid-Cretaceous may signal the early stages of the relationship between specialized pollinators, such as bees, and the hamamelid-rosid-asterid lineage of angiosperms, arguably one of the most important events in angiosperm radiation.",Angiospermae; Hamamelididae; Phylogeny; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026730330

All the visitors were winged insects, except P. longiseta, a species which alone made up more than 80% of the total number of insects found on the flowers. All pollinators of H. spinosa had similar foraging patterns, with 98% of total movements made between flowers within the same plant. Ants always made contact with the plant reproductive organs when foraging for nectar, and transferred large numbers of pollen grains. However, pollen exposed to ants for brief periods exhibited reduced percentage of germination. P. longiseta is both the most abundant and spatio-temporally predictable flower visitor of H. spinosa. These characteristics, weighted by their flower visitation rate, make worker ants the pollinator that maintains the strongest mutualistic interaction with H. spinosa. The exclusion experiments show that workers behave as true pollinators, since they contribute to increase the number of viable seeds produced by H. spinosa. The key factor of this interaction is mainly the great density of workers throughout the flowering period. In short, the H. spinosa-P. longiseta mutualistic interaction mainly depends on its high probability of occurrence. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Ant pollination; Exclusion experiments; Highmountain ecology; Hormathophylla spinosa; Proformica longiseta,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027037808

More than 55% of flowers in the gorge were pollinated and set fruit compared with less than 25% of flowers in the valley. These differences are explained by the preference of Meneris tulbaghia (Satyridae), the exclusive pollinator of the orchid, for rocky, sheltered habitats.

Differential screening of this library led to the isolation of cDNA clones that correspond to genes preferentially or specifically expressed in the pistil. Seven of these cDNA clones encode proteins containing repetitions of the pentapeptide Ser-Pro4, which is a typical motif found in extensins. Unlike extensin genes, the extensin-like genes described here are not induced under stress conditions. RNA gel blot hybridizations demonstrated the organ-specific expression of the extensin-like genes and their temporal regulation during pistil development. After pollination, the transcript levels of the pistil-specific extensin-like genes change relative to levels in unpollinated pistils.

Accumulation of ?-galactosidase, a cell wall hydrolase, during endosperm development was analyzed by isoelectric focusing, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with Western blotting and immunolocalization on tissue sections. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 15 amino acids showed homology with amino acids 71 to 85 of the sequence reported for the mature guar protein. Four forms of the enzyme with isoelectric points ranging from 4.4 to 5.2 appeared by 11 weeks after pollination, and all forms remained until maturity. A major band of 41 kDa and several lower Mr, lightly staining bands cross reacted with the anti-?-galactosidase antiserum. The major band remained until maturity while the lightly staining bands gradually disappeared. In the mobilizing endosperm of germinated seeds, two darkly staining bands were observed at 41 and 40 kDa. At 9 weeks after pollination, the endosperm was cellular and the silver enhanced gold label localizing ?-galactosidase occurred predominantly in the cell periphery. By 11 weeks, the label was present in the cytoplasm, but lacking on the thickening cell wall. ?-Galactosidase accumulated in the protein bodies along with the storage protein. At 13 to 17 weeks, the label accumulated and then was lost in a centrifugal pattern (from the middle lamella inward) from the cell walls as they matured and was lost in the cytoplasm. The mature endosperm cells had intense label present only over the protein bodies and over the inner cell wall.

No single ""global"" manager can build these capabilities. Rather, groups of specialized managers must integrate assets, resources, and people in diverse operating units. Such managers are made, not born. And how to make them is--and must be--the foremost question for corporate managers. Drawing on their research with leading transnational corporations, Christopher Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal identify three types of global managers. They also illustrate the responsibilities each position involves through a close look at the careers of successful executives: Leif Johansson of Electrolux, Howard Gottlieb of NEC, and Wahib Zaki of Procter & Gamble. The first type is the global business or product-division manager who must build worldwide efficiency and competitiveness. These managers recognize cross-border opportunities and risks as well as link activities and capabilities around the world. The second is the country manager whose unit is the building block for worldwide operations. These managers are responsible for understanding and interpreting local markets, building local resources and capabilities, and contributing to--and participating in--the development of global strategy.

A lack of chalcone synthase activity has a pleiotropic effect in maize and petunia mutants: pollen fertility as well as flavonoid synthesis is disrupted. Both maize and petunia mutants are self-sterile due to a failure to produce a functional pollen tube. The finding that the mutant pollen is partially functional on wild-type stigmas led to the isolation and identification of kaempferol as a pollen germination-inducing constituent in wild-type petunia stigma extracts. We show that adding micromolar quantities of kaempferol to the germination medium or to the stigma at pollination is sufficient to restore normal pollen germination and tube growth in vitro and full seed set in vivo. Further we show that the rescue ability resides in particular structural features of a single class of compounds, the flavonol aglycones. This finding identifies another constituent of plant reproduction and suggests that addition or removal of the flavonol signal during pollen germination and tube growth provides a feasible way to control plant fertility.",maize; petunia; pollen germination; pollen tube,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026654039

In this study, I examined the role of interplant distance, plant size, and flower morphology on Ipomopsis aggregatás (Polemoniaceae) attractiveness to a pre-dispersal seed predator, Hylemya sp. (Anthomyiidae) and to hummingbird pollinators. The attractiveness of I. aggregata individuals to Hylemya was nonlinearly related to interplant distance in experimental arrays. Clumped and highly dispersed plants were preyed upon more frequently than those at intermediate distances. I found no relationship between interplant distance and visitation rates by hummingbird pollinators in these experimental arrays. However, in natural populations studied, clumped plants were more frequently approached by hummingbirds than those growing more widely dispersed. Display size was unrelated to visitation by Hylemya on inflorescences I clipped and maintained as ""large"", ""small"" and ""control"". Display size was also unrelated to the total number of visits by hummingbird pollinators to each of these experimental plants, however ""large"" display plants were more likely to be visited first in any given visitation sequence. Of various morphological measurements, corolla length showed the strongest positive correlation with Hylemya egg presence. To the extent that plant spacing and morphology is correlated with pollinator visits and ultimate seed set, Hylemya could be choosing flowers optimally, and playing a role in the evolution of floral traits. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Floral display; Hylemya sp.; Plant spacing; Pollination; Pre-dispersal seed predation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027066327

The R. meliloti host-range nodH gene has been postulated to mediate the transfer of a sulfate to a modified lipo-oligosaccharide, which in its sulfated form is a specific nodulation factor for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). We found that alfalfa was capable of effective nodulation with signal-defective and non-nodulating nodH mutants (Nnr) defining a novel gene-for-gene interaction that conditions nodulation. Bacteria-free nodules that formed spontaneously at about a 3-5% rate in unselected seed populations of alfalfa cv 'Vernal' in the total absence of Rhizobium (Nar) exhibited all the histological, regulatory and ontogenetic characteristics of alfalfa nodules. Inoculation of such populations with nodH mutants, but not with nodA or nodC mutants, produced a four- to five-fold increase in the percentage of nodulated plants. Some 10-25% of these nodulated plants formed normal pink nitrogen-fixing nodules instead of white empty nodules. About 70% of the S1 progeny of such Nnr+ plants retained the parental phenotype; these plants were also able to form nodules in the absence of Rhizobium. If selected Nar+ plants were self-pollinated almost the entire progeny exhibited the parental Nar+ phenotype. Segregation analysis of S1 and S2 progeny from selected Nar+ plants suggests that the Nar character is monogenic dominant and that the nodulation phenotype is controlled by a gene dose effect. The inoculation of different S1 Nar+ progeny with nodH mutant bacteria gave only empty non-fixing nodules. Our results indicate that certain alfalfa genotypes can be selected for suppression of the non-nodulation phenotype of nodH mutants. The fact that the Nnr plant phenotype behaved as a dominant genetic trait and that it directly correlated with the ability of the selected plants to form nodules in the absence of Rhizobium suggests that the interaction of plant and bacterial alleles occurs early during signal transduction through the alteration of a signal reception component of the plant so that it responds to putative signal precursors. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Medicago sativa; Nitrogen fixation; Nodulation (spontaneous); Symbiosis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011363491

Pollination of the F1 hybrid with 'Chinese Spring' resulted in 22 BC1 seeds with an average seed set of 1.52%. Five BC1 plants with 39-41 chromosomes were raised using embryo rescue techniques.

Both synergids measured about the same as the egg and contained relatively high concentrations of calcium, potassium, and magnesium. The sister synergids remained identical even in an aberrant case where a pollen tube had penetrated, but not discharged into a synergid. After 30 min post-pollination (after pollen-tube discharge), typically one of the sister synergids was reduced in size and devoid of high concentrations of elements. The other synergid initially remained unaltered and only later underwent slight size reduction; however, it retained high concentrations of elements.

In the 'cut-silk' method, ovaries with silks were placed on medium in vitro, whereafter the silk was cut and the upper part of the silk was pollinated. Pollen tubes were not able to bridge the space between the two silk parts. Even when silk parts were tightly connected, pollen tubes still were not able to pass the cut ends and reach the lower silk part. Pollen-tube growth rates and the direction of tube growth were not influenced by the presence or absence of an ovary. Prepollination did not have any influence on pollen-tube growth rate. Measurements of pollen-tube growth rate also showed that there was no 'population effect', i.e. growth rate was not stimulated by pollination with an excess of pollen grains. We found that the direction in which maize pollen grew was determined only by the positioning of the silk hairs. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",In vitro pollination; Maize; Pollen-tube growth regulation; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744865591

Two methods of combining the elements of this system, re-transformation and cross pollination, were found to produce different degrees of excision in the resulting plants. Two linked traits, ?-glucuronidase (GUS) and a gene encoding sulfonylurea-resistant acetolactate synthase (ALSr), were integrated into the genome of tobacco and Arabidopsis. The ALSr gene, bounded by loxP sites, was used as the selectable marker for transformation. The directed loss of the ALST gene through Cre-mediated excision was demonstrated by the loss of resistance to sulfonylurea herbicides and by Southern blot analysis. The ?-glucuronidase gene remained active. The excision efficiency varied in F1 progeny of different lox and Cre parents and was correlated with the Cre parent. Many of the lox × Cre F1 progeny were chimeric and some F2 progeny retained resistance to sulfonylureas. Re-transformation of lox/ALS/lox/GUS tobacco plants with cre led to much higher efficiency of excision. Lines of tobacco transformants carrying the GUS gene but producing only sulfonylurea-sensitive progeny were obtained using both approaches for introducing cre. Similarly, Arabidopsis lines with GUS activity but no sulfonylurea resistance were generated using cross pollinations. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Arabidopsis; loxP-Cre; Nicotiana (tobacco); Selectable marker deletion-Site-specific recombination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026766430

Detailed investigations have contributed to an understanding of the interactions between euglossine males and flowers as a pollination system. The role which the collected perfume plays in the reproductive behaviour of euglossine bees is not fully understood. A favoured hypothesis suggests that the collected fragrances are used as precursors for male sex pheromones and thus serve to attract conspecific males or females. It is not known how perfume collection behaviour evolved. Here, an evolutionary approach presents a new hypothesis which suggests that the evolution of perfume collection in euglossine males is based upon pre-existing signals which were attractive to females and males. It is further suggested that, at the evolutionary outset, flowers mimicked nest sites to deceive nest-seeking euglossine bees. In addition, a comparative study was undertaken on the phenomena of nest-mimicking flowers in related bee families. © 1992 Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart.",Apidae; bee pheromones; Euglossinae; euglossine flowers; euglossophily; floral fragrant exudates; Hymenoptera; mating behaviour; nest mimicry; nesting behaviour; perfume collection; signal evolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002442039

The pattern of protein synthesis in developing maize embryos is distinct from that during germination and subsequent seedling growth. Premature desiccation at 35 DAP elicits a pattern of protein synthesis upon rehydration which is similar to that in germinated embryos from mature dry kernels. Fluridone-induced viviparous germination is accompanied by changes in the synthesis of some proteins to a post-germinative pattern, but some developmental proteins continue to be synthesized. Embryos isolated from developing kernels at 35 DAP germinate when incubated on water; they also produce some developmental proteins during germination. Kernels from developing cobs at 35 DAP which are detached from the mother plant and maintained in an atmosphere of high relative humidity (moist controls) do not germinate, but neither do they continue a clearly defined pattern of either developmental or germinative protein synthesis. Drying is thus critical to effect a clear transition of protein synthesis from a developmental to a germinative mode in maize embryos.Abscisic acid within the developing embryos is reduced by fluridone, but to a lesser extent by premature drying or maturation drying. Changes in sensitivity to abscisic acid by the developing embryo may be as, or more, important in permitting germination, and the attendant synthesis of proteins, than changes in abscisic acid content. © 1992 Oxford University Press.",Abscisic acid; Desiccation; Germination; Maize (Zea mays L.); Vivipary,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000493949

Willow flowers attract insects, but also abundantly produce wind-dispersed pollen. I demonstrated pollen limitation in single branches bearing 2-4 inflorescences (catkins) in a field experiment with five species by artificially increasing or decreasing the pollen load. Because the responses by single branches might be explained by diversion of resources to better-pollinated branches within a plant, a second experiment with one species tested both pollen limitation of whole plants and the autonomy of catkins. Seed set of single willow catkins is unaffected by experimental alterations of seed set in other catkins on the same plant. Hand-pollination of single catkins and of whole plants increased seed set to the same degree, suggesting there is little or no competition for resources between catkins only 5-10 cm apart. Thus, seed set in willows appears to be pollen limited, favoring insect pollination and the evolution of entomophilous traits. The data support previous views that willows have a dual pollination system utilizing wind and insects. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Entomophily; Pollination; Reproduction; Salix; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027094879

Buckwheat cotyledons were excised from imbibed seeds, co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens and subjected to previously reported protocols for callus and shoot regeneration. The transformation with oncogenic strains was confirmed by opine and DNA analyses of tumour tissue extracts. Plants were regenerated on cotyledon fragments incubated with strain A281, harboring pGA472, which carries the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene for kanamycin resistance. The transformation of resistant shoot clones was confirmed by NPTII enzyme assay and DNA hybridization. A large number of transformed shoots were rooted and fertile plantlets were raised in the greenhouse. Transgenic plants comprised pin and thrum clones, which were allowed to cross-pollinate. In about 180 R2 seeds tested for kanamycin resistance, the ratio of resistant to sensitive seedlings was roughly 3:1. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Agrobacterium tumefaciens; buckwheat; Fagopyrum esculentum; NPTII gene; transgenic plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006365655

They were applied to the receptive conelets after controlled pollination. Simulated wet deposition significantly affected (P &lt; 0.05) seed set per bract. However, the trends were in different directions for the two species. Acidity increased apparent pollination effectiveness in red pine but was inhibitory in white pine. This difference apparent in response was also related to the pH sensitivity of the pollen in the two species. Previous experiments have shown that red pine pollen has a substantially lower pH threshold for germination inhibition than white pine. The effects of Cu and Pb were generally not significant; however, they did appear antagonistic to the effect of pH. The direct effects of wet deposition and its chemistry on pollination effectiveness has implications in terms of fertility selection, gametic selection, and the possible manipulation of the pollination mechanism in pines. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026849064

Mayapple flowers do not produce nectar, but depend on infrequent visits by nectar-seeking queen bumble bees for pollination. In all years female reproductive success in mayapple colonies was influenced by colony size (number of flowers), by the distance to neighbouring colonies and by proximity to lousewort plants (Pedicularis canadensis), a prolific nectar producer heavily visited by bumble bees. In all years fruit and seed set were greater in mayapple colonies <25 m from lousewort flowers than in matched colonies which were >50 m from lousewort. In 1985 and 1987 the frequency of queen bumble bee visits to flowers in colonies close to lousewort was about four times greater than to distant colonies. In 1986 I removed about 80% of lousewort flowers to test whether the enhanced fruit and seed set in mayapples close to lousewort was pollinator mediated. Mayapple colonies close to flowerless lousewort patches did not differ in fruit or seed set from matched colonies >50 m from lousewort. In contrast, mayapples close to flowering lousewort patches had greater fruit and seed set compared with distant colonies. Over all years, a larger proportion of mayapples close to flowering lousewort patches had enhanced fruit and seed set compared with colonies close to louseworts without flowers.

During late summer in the Sandia Mountains, central New Mexico, they defend the wasp- and bee-pollinated Scrophularia montana from other hummingbirds. Both hummingbirds and hymenopterans exploit Scrophularia nectar during the early part of its flowering period. As summer colony growth increases the densities of the eusocial hymenopterans by 100-150%, their exploitation of Scrophularia nectar lowers its mean standing crop in flowers by 200-300%. Sometime during the summer, Rufous Hummingbirds abandon and do not further use this resource for the remaining 3-4 weeks of its flowering period. The abandonment always occurs when the mean standing crop of nectar is approximately 0.2-0.3 ?L/ flower. This paper describes a model of Rufous Hummingbird energetics, that shows abandonment occurred 1-3 days after they passed the threshold at which the resource could have provided their minimum daily energy requirements. I suggest that constraints imposed by a highly competitive social environment severely reduced the options available to the hummingbirds, and caused them to continue to defend a resource that could no longer meet their energetic requirements. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Nectarivores; Patch choice; Selasphorus rufus; Territoriality; Territory/foraging energetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027094913

Pair-wise mixtures of pollen from individuals with high and low self-fertility were applied in controlled pollinations. Electrophoretic markers identified seed paternity. The pollen donors did differ in all three pollen traits but, as a class, the low self-fertility donors had neither inferior pollen nor low paternal success in outcrossing.

Although clones tended to reach peak flowering on the same date, they differed in the proportion of their total flowers produced around that date (flowering synchrony). Clones also differed in the number and density of flower heads presented at any one time to pollinators and herbivores (floral display). Both of these characteristics had consequences for herbivory and plant reproductive success. The proportion of flower heads damaged by insect herbivores was greater for clones that concentrated flowering activity during the main flowering period for the population as a whole (high synchrony) compared to clones that spread flowering out temporally. The primary reason for this result was that clones with low flowering synchrony produced a significant proportion of their flower heads during the fall and therefore, escaped attack by the tephritid fly, Tephritis ovatipennis. Clones with intermediate synchrony had lower seed success (total number of viable seeds produced over the year) than clones with either low or high synchrony.

The hydrophobic domain is rich in cysteine and is similar to seed proteins, mainly to a soybean hydrophobic seed protein. In maize, HyPRP is encoded by a single gene, and its mRNA accumulates in immature maize zygotic embryos, with a maximum accumulation between 12 and 18 days after pollination. The HyPRP mRNA can also be detected in ovary prior to pollination.

This variation is associated with the breakdown of tristyly and the evolution of self-fertilization. Differences in morph frequencies could result from selection pressures due to variable levels of insect visitation to populations and contrasting foraging behavior among the floral morphs. We estimated pollinator densities in 16 populations and quantified visitation sequences to morphs in five populations of E. paniculata in northeastern Brazil. Foraging behavior among floral morphs was measured as the frequency of visits to morphs relative to their frequency in the population (preference) and number of flights between inflorescences of the same versus different morphs (constancy). Pollinator density (number/m2/minute) was not correlated with population size, plant density or morph diversity. Pollinator densities varied most among populations of less than 200 plants. Whether pollinators discriminated among the morphs, depended on whether they primarily collected nectar or pollen. In four populations, nectar-feeding bees (Ancyloscelis and Florilegus spp.) and butterflies showed no consistent preference or constancy among the morphs. In contrast, pollen-collecting bees (Trigona sp.) visited a lower proportion of longstyled inflorescences than expected and tended to visit more mid-and short-styled inflorescences in succession, once they were encountered. Pollinator constancy for morphs did not result from differences in inflorescence production or spatial patchiness among the morphs. Although non-random pollinator visitation to morphs in heterostylous populations could potentially affect mating and hence morph frequencies, the observed visitation patterns in this study do not provide evidence that pollinators play a major role in influencing floral morph frequencies. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Behavior; Constancy; Eichhornia paniculata; Pollination Northeastern Brazil; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027060623

Tests were undertaken to examine whether in vitro culture of pollen grains can serve as a useful tool for understanding the self- and cross-pollination mechanisms among species. Characteristics of pollen germination were interpreted in relation to mating system and floral biology. Four annual species (Campanula kremeri, C. dichotoma, C. afra, C. lusitanica), and two perennial species (C. rotundifolia and C. persicifolia) were investigated. In the annual species pollen germinability is controlled by (1) the age of pollen and/or (2) in what position pollen is deposited around the style. Correlations were found between pollen germinability and mating system in three of the four annual species. No correlations were found either between germinability and age of pollen or position on the style in the perennial species. Pollen germinability reached its maximum in the middle of the male phase in all species, except for C. dichotoma, which had a decreasing germinability throughout anthesis. The germinability was lowest at the time of stigma receptivity for all species except for C. persicifolia, where the stigma did not develop as long as pollen remained on the style. The pollen collecting hairs and pollen removal have been found to play an important role controlling the stigma development, thus affecting self-pollination. This was especially pronounced in C. persicifolia. Further studies will be undertaken to elucidate factors influencing pollination within the genus Campanula. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Campanula; pollen collecting hairs; pollen germinability; Pollination biology; self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000990609

Observations of pollinated pearl millet ovaries by fluorescence microscopy revealed that pollen tubes enroute to the embryo sac exhibit specific directional turns in the regions of the style base/ovary juncture, the basal placenta, and the micropyle. The placenta and the micropylar regions have water-soluble periodic acid Schiff positive-substances as well as protein; this extracellular material and the walls of the micropylar nucellar cells appear to have associated calcium (Chaubal and Reger 1991). In vitro assays of pollen-tube behavior in response to a range of external stimuli revealed that pearl millet pollen tubes exhibit directional turns in response to: (1) diffusate from excised pistil tissues; (2) glucose, but not to several other carbohydrates; (3) calcium (unwashed polygalacturonic acid-calcium gel); (4) an ovarian water soluble, low molecular weight, acidic protein.

This paper reviews methods of measuring gene dispersal and current information on patterns of dispersal within local populations of forest trees. Recently, a number of statistical procedures for investigating gene movement based on the use of large numbers of isozyme loci have been described. These procedures include various forms of parentage analysis and the fitting of mating models to genotypic arrays of offspring from individual maternal plants. With the levels of genetic discrimination currently possible in forest trees, the model approach appears to be the most reliable means of estimating gene dispersal parameters. Too little data are available to draw general conclusions about patterns of gene movement within natural populations. Nevertheless, reports to date indicate that dispersal by both pollen and seed can be considerable. For any one mother tree, the bulk of effective pollen in conifers may come from distant males in the same stand or from surrounding stands (gene flow). In insect-pollinated angiosperms, gene flow may also be substantial, but cross-fertilization within stands may primarily be between nearest flowering trees. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",gene dispersal; genetic structure; mating patterns; paternity analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001552504

Forty-eight chromosomes are derived from N. tabacum (2n=4x=48); 12 from N. glutinosa (2n=2x=24). Homologous pairs of N. tabacum chromosomes usually pair normally at meiosis. Trivalents incorporating a glutinosa chromosome do occur but usually these remain as univalents.The fertility of the hybrid is low but some products of self-pollination were obtained. These carry the complete N. tabacum genome with a few glutinosa chromosomes, some of which form supplementary bivalents at meiosis. All derivatives studied were mixoploid but progressive selfing reduces the extent of abnormality of mitotic divisions. The study of morphological and developmental traits indicates that the addition of even a few chromosomes of N. glutinosa to the N. tabacum complement can modify the tabacum phenotype substantially. There is considerable variation among the derivatives and scope for fixing desirable qualities through selection. The presence of only a haploid set of glutinosa chromosomes in the original hybrid makes the return to a desirable genotype more efficient than that achieved through more conventional breeding methods. © 1992 Oxford University Press.",Cytology; Gametosomatic hybrid; Nicotiana; Selfed progeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345250783

An early degeneration and withdrawal of maternal cells from the endosperm of homozygous miniature (mn mn) seed mutants were arrested if mn plants were pollinated by the wild-type Mn pollen. Similarly, the stability of the wild-type, Mn mn, maternal cells was also dependent on whether or not these cells were associated with the normal (Mn) or the mutant (mn) endosperm on the same ear. Biochemical and cellular analyses indicated that developing mn kernels have extremely low (<0.5% of the wild type) to undetectable levels of both soluble and wall-bound invertase activities. Extracts from endosperm with a single copy of the Mn gene showed a significant increase in both forms of invertases, and we suggest it is the causal basis of the wild-type seed phenotype. Collectively, these data provide evidence that invertase-mediated maintenance of a physiological gradient of photosynthate between pedicel and endosperm constitutes the rate-limiting step in structural stability of maternal cells as well as normal development of endosperm and seed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000879303

The existence in Italy of two subspecies, i.e. subspp. morio and picta, is not supported by allozyme data. No genetic heterogeneity was found between morio-like and picta-like samples and specimens. Moreover, morphological transition between the two forms was observed in different Italian populations. The parameters of genetic variability estimated for O. morio populations are consistent with those found among monocotyledon plants, and among those outcrossing, animal-pollinated and with wind-dispersed seeds. Genetic diversity of Italian O. morio is mostly within populations. Correspondingly, low values of interpopulational genetic distance were found. This appears to be due to high levels of gene flow, which were estimated with different methods. The lack of O. longicornu from Italian samples, as well as of any hybrid with O. morio (F1, backcrossed or recombinant individuals) is demonstrated on the basis of genetic data.

The amount of nectar a bee receives from an individual flower was estimated by measuring the time elapsed since the previous bee visit to that flower. Measurements of nectar accumulation in experimentally emptied flowers indicated that this time interval is an accurate predictor of nectar volumes in flowers. We found that nectar rewards influence the probability of departure from individual plants, as well as distances of movements within plants. The probability of departure from individual plants was negatively related to the amount of reward received at the two lastvisited flowers. This result indicates that the bees used a probabllistic departure rule, rather than a simple threshold departure rule, and that rewards from both the current and the previously visited flower were important in determining departure points. Distances of inter-flower movements within plants were negatively related to the amount of reward received at the current flower. The overall results suggest that the pollinators of A. strigosa make two types of departure decisions-departures from the whole plant and departures from the neighbourhood of individual flowers-and that they use different departure rules for each scale.

(Fabaceae) using a combination of pollen and seed dispersal studies and a recombinant DNA technique. The population is spatially heterogeneous and grows with Empetrum nigrum. L. corniculatus is pollinated by the pollen-collecting bumblebee Bombus lapidarius L. Most pollinator flights occurred within patches, as bees usually visit nearest-neighbour plants, show no marked directionality, and forage mostly within patches. Gene flow by seeds is also limited, reinforcing the pattern of gene flow within patches. However, 2.6% of pollinator flights are between patches and considerable pollen carryover also occurs. Thus, gene flow between patches is potentially sufficient to retard or prevent genetic differentiation in spite of the patchy sub-structuring of the population. A sub-set of the population was analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) to document the actual gene flow pattern of the population. The DNA analysis revealed significant levels of genetic differentiation between the patches. The level of gene flow that can be inferred from the distribution of genetic variation is surprisingly restricted, as compared to gene flow inferred from pollinator behaviour, and emphasizes that stochastic processes like genetic drift and founder effects may have a strong impact on the prevailing genetic structure. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Gene flow; Genetic variation; Lotus corniculatus L.; Patchiness; Pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027084384

In this paper, we show that an A. thaliana S-related sequence, designated AtS1, is expressed specifically in flower buds. Sequence analysis suggests that AtS1 encodes a secreted glycoprotein that is most similar to the Brassica S-locus related protein SLR1.

Quantitative autoradiographic studies of silver grains accumulating over the nuclei of wild-type endosperm demonstrated that the rate of transcription increased sixfold in the period from 3 to 7 d after pollination (DAP). Based on this observation, and the fact that cell-wall formation is initiated at 6 DAP, it is concluded that at least a proportion of the transcripts encode proteins involved in cell-wall formation. A similar study was also undertaken with the two barley sex mutants B7 and B15, in which developmental arrest at the syncytical stage leads to a complete lack of endosperm cell walls. This study showed that [3H]uridine is incorporated into the nuclei of the mutant syncytia, although at a rate different from that in the wild-type. Thus, the lack of cell-wall formation is not caused by a total block of gene transcription in these mutants, but rather by the lack of a gene product essential for cell-wall formation in the endosperm. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",Endosperm development; Gene transcription (endosperm); Hordeum (sex mutant); Mutant(barley),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0010977815

Flowers on males produced over four times as much nectar, but the standing crop of nectar did not differ between the two sexual morphs in nature. Overall, pollinators preferred to visit flowers on male plants, but different species of pollinators responded differently to the two morphs. Fruit set on the females was not significantly limited by pollen; hence, the fewer visits by pollinators to this morph seems sufficient to insure maximal fruit set given the resources available. The greater number of visits to males is in response to their pollen production and to their greater nectar production, but an ideal free distribution is set up in nature, which insures a sufficient number of visits to the females. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026527033

If the number of pollinator visits is independent of the flowering strategy, then it is immaterial how many flowers are presented at the same time in a self-compatible (SC) species, whereas presenting flowers one at a time is optimal in a self-incompatible (SI) species. Depending on the values of other parameters, mass blooming can be an evolutionarily stable strategy if plants that practice it attract more pollinators.

Thirteen species were studied, and species growing at high altitudes (above 500 m) were compared with species growing at lower altitudes. The genus has specialized flowers pollinated by Cecidomyiidae (Asynapta sp. and other genera) that lay eggs chiefly in male flowers since these are more easily accessible than female flowers due to their morphology. Several traits ensure that pollen transfer is accomplished: 1. long flowering of individuals and single flowers; 2. specific floral morphology (unisexuality, landing platform, restricted pore) allowing the flowers to be visited by Cecidomyiidae seeking egg?laying sites, and 3. a low number of ovules that have to be pollinated in each flower. The low number of ovules per flower results in a high pollen?ovule (P/O) ratio even though pollen production in male flowers is only moderate. High altitude species had larger flowers, higher pollen?ovule ratios, fewer ovules per female flower, and longer periods of anthesis. Gender differences were seen in the longer functionality of female flowers; the larger numbers of male flowers produced; and the average diameter at breast height (DBH) biased for one of the two sexes depending on the species investigated, with no clear trend in the size distributions of individuals of both sexes. Sex ratios departed significantly from unity both to male and female bias but usually were in favour of males. There were no general differences in the ratio of functional male to female flowers at the time of observation nor in the sizes of male and female flowers. The evolution of unisexual flowers in Siparuna can be explained as a result of the differential predation by larvae: unimportant in male flowers, destructive if occurring in female flowers.

E. plantagineum is self-compatible, so that germination and pollen tube growth of both cross- and self-pollen to the ovules at the style base occur. The technique utilized virgin flowers, bagged as buds and which subsequently opened within the bags. After careful unbagging, the majority (93.5%) of initial visitors to these previously-unvisited flowers were honey bees (Apis mellifera). The technique demonstrated that although autogamy was possible, it was not predominant in E. plantagineum because permanently-bagged flowers had very low numbers of pollen tubes at their style bases (usually none), and emasculated and intact flowers exposed to single honey bee visits usually had the same numbers of tubes. Within treatments (intact, emasculated), honey bee visits for pollen, nectar or both, did not result in differences in pollen tube number, nor was there any connection between degree of pollination and time spent by a single honey bee per virgin flower. Although most honey bees attending virgin flowers carried pellets of E. plantagineum pollen on their hind legs, as a result of grooming actions to gather grains from their bodies, they were still as effective as pollinating agents as bees lacking corbicular pollen. Because one-third of single honey bee visits to emasculated virgin flowers (bearing receptive stigmas) introduced sufficient pollen to achieve fertilization of all four ovules, and almost two-thirds of such visits resulted in pollination, it appears that honey bees were effective cross-pollinators of E. plantagineum.

Here I present the systematics, pollination ecology and evolution of one of these interactions. I have documented and analysed the phylogenetic and geographic associations between Trollius (Ranunculaceae: 18 spp.) and Chiastocheta (Diptera: Anthomyiidae; 17 spp.), a host?specific genus of seed?parasitic flies that pollinate their host plants to varying extent. Their interactions are usually facultative mutualisms, but in the specialized T. europaeus three fly species are obligate mutualists and a fourth species is an antagonist. The distribution patterns of fly species among Trollius species suggest that the flies evolved in associations with five highly derived Trollius species, and secondarily colonized four more primitive taxa in the parts of their ranges that overlapped with primary hosts. In general, host specificity is maintained primarily through allopatry, with colonization occurring in regions of overlap between parapatric taxa. Fly speciation has occurred in allopatry, both within and among host taxa. Cospeciation is not evident, but convergent evolution in Trollius flowers of several traits, viz. orange sepals, elongated staminodia and increased carpel number per flower, may be the result of mutualism with Chiastocheta.

Number of flowers was positively associated with annual rainfall. Echinomastus is self-incompatible and thus requires insect vectors for pollination. Flower visitors are mostly solitary, polylectic bee species, largely Andrenidae, Anthophoridae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae, but the primary pollinators in each of two years were Megachile palmensis (Megachilidae) and Diadasia rinconis (Anthophoridae).

Biologia Animal, Facultat Biologia, Universita Barcelona, Diagonal 645, Barcelona, 08028, Spain","The potential threat of parasites to Osmia cornuta populations managed for almond pollination was analysed. Rates of parasitism were measured in both managed and wild trap-nested populations. Only two parasites, the drosophilid fly Cacoxenus sp., and the clep-toparasitic mite Chaetodactylus osmiae, were found in wild populations, but their rates of parasitism rarely exceeded 10%. Cacoxenus was never found in managed populations, but the torymid wasp Monodontomerus obsoletus caused serious damage in some populations when bee cocoons were made accessible by extricating them from nesting materials in the laboratory. Chaetodactylus osmiae was also present in managed populations but in low numbers. In 1991, a population of O. cornuta was released in an almond orchard. As opposed to other releases in which clean populations were used, in this release some cells infested with C. osmiae, Cacoxenus sp., and M. obsoletus were intentionally introduced with the bee population. No cell was repara-sitized by Cacoxenus sp., because by the time these drosophilids became adults the flying season of the O. cornuta population was almost over. On the other hand, the number of cells infested with C. osmiae mites increased to six times the number of infested cells originally introduced. Most M. obsoletus developed normally, and parasitism by this wasp increased slightly (from 20 to 30 cells). As O. cornuta flies very early in the season when few species of parasites or nest destroyers are active, the diversity of associated fauna is usually lower in O. cornuta nests than in nests of other, related, later-flying species such as O. ruf a and O. tricornis. © 1992 International Bee Research Association.",Cacoxenus sp; Chaetodactylus osmiae; Monodontomerus obsoletus; Osmia cornuta; Parasitism; Pollinators; Spain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863935093

Floral biology and pollinators of three co?occurring Cistus species (Cistaceae). The pollination of three species of Cistus, Cistus albidus L., Cistus salvifolius L. and Cistus monspeliensis L. is studied. Insect visitors were censused and some were captured to analyse pollen distribution on their bodies. Floral phenology, breeding systems, some aspects of floral biology (pollen and nectar production, pollen?ovule ratios) and floral morphology were also studied for each species. Flowers of C. albidus produce more pollen and nectar than the other two species studied, and attract more insects, especially those with higher nutritional requirements. All three species are highly self?incompatible, but C. salvifolius and C. monspeliensis show some features that hinder xenogamy, and they have lower pollen?ovule ratios than C. albidus. As a result, this latter species apparently receives higher levels of cross?pollination, but at the cost of a higher investment to attract and reward reliable pollinators.

Birds visited inflorescences in the early, mid and late flowering seasons. In contrast, honeybees visited only on days in the late flowering period when maximum temperatures exceeded 15°C. Self pollen remained on pollen presenters of flowers for up to 5 days in the early and mid periods. In the late period, when honeybees visited inflorescences, self pollen was removed within 2 days. Pollen removal was similar for caged (birds excluded) and open inflorescences in the late period, indicating that most pollen was removed by honeybees. In the early and mid periods, honeyeaters pollinated 22% and 27% of flowers on open inflorescences, respectively. In the late period, when both birds and bees visited inflorescences, 6473% of flowers on open inflorescences were pollinated. Foraging by honeybees resulted in pollen deposition as 38% of flowers on caged inflorescences were pollinated. Throughout the flowering season a similar number of pollen grains was deposited per stigma. There were 3.03.7 pollen grains per stigma on open inflorescences in the late period, although only 2.0 grains per stigma on caged inflorescences. In the early and mid periods, fewer caged than open inflorescences produced fruits, indicating the importance of honeyeaters to reproductive success at these times. In contrast, in the late period when honeybees visited inflorescences, fruit?set was similar on caged and open inflorescences. Overall, these results indicate that honeybees were effective pollinators of B. spinulosa. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026476435

In addition, pollinators may return more often to rewarding plants and/or probe more of their flowers during each visit. The authors investigated how each of these behaviors influences pollination success of the hummingbird-pollinated scarlet gilia. Increasing the nectar standing crop of a flower from 1 to 5 ?L significantly increased probe duration, but this had no detectable effect on pollination success through the female sexual function (pollen deposited on stigmas) or male sexual function (pollen removed from anthers and number of fluorescent dye particles exported to other flowers). Both male and female pollination success increased with the number of times a hummingbird probed a flower. For male function, there was at best a weak tendency for pollen export to diminish with successive probes, in contrast to strongly diminishing returns reported for bee-pollinated flowers. This difference may reflect foraging mode; hummingbirds hover and remove a small fraction of available pollen with each floral probe whereas bees land and remove most pollen with the first probe. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026499415

Flowers were visited and pollinated mostly by bombyliid flies, solitary bees, and G. politella. Bombyliid flies alone composed 68-88% of visits recorded over two yr. Although both male and female G. politella visited the flowers and probed for nectar, thereby passively transferring to the stigma pollen adhering to the abdomen. Visitation to flowers by all pollinators averaged 0.3-1.9 visits/h during daylight hours. Consequently, most flowers were visited multiple times during the several days that stigmas were receptive and 77% of the flowers tagged during the four yr had some developing seeds. Pollination did not depend upon visitation by G. politella. Flowers receiving G. politella eggs had the same probability of producing some seed and the same mean number of developing seeds as flowers visited only by other insects. Most flowers received the eggs of only one G. politella female, and larvae ate 15-27% of the developing seeds. Overall, G. politella females have the potential to be mutualistic with L. parviflorum; they are effective pollinators, generally visit most plants and about half the flowers in the population, and impose a fairly small cost on seed output. Nonetheless, the abundant and effective co-pollinators, which do not eat the developing seeds, swamp Greya's mutualistic effects. Under the current conditions at Granite Point, Washington, the relationship between G. politella and L. parviflorum may be mostly commensalistic. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027064029

The normal duration of EPP is 4 days and fruit set decreases sharply 6 days after emasculation. In some years and cultivars this sharp fall happens as early as 4 days after emasculation. Stigma receptivity proceeds in a way similar to EPP and in general it can be said that the limiting factor of EPP is the short duration of the stigma receptivity. However, when the climatic conditions or the cultivars' behaviour are such that there is still a good stigma receptivity on Day 6 after emasculation other factors become responsible for the limitation of EPP. On Day 6, even when the stigma remains receptive, there is frequently an important decrease in fruit set. © 1992.",Apricot; effective pollination period; Prunus armeniaca L; stigma receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001844290

In favourable weather, specialist (Melissodes apicata) and generalist bees (Bombus spp.) visited this plant so intensively that they removed 95% of the pollen produced by midday. From flower opening until the end of pollen availability, P. cordata flowers produced nectar with an energy content of 0.82±0.084 J. During the subsequent 4h that the flower remained open they produced an additional 0.63±0.184J of nectar energy. Therefore, these flowers expended 45.1% (median) more energy on nectar production than was necessary to ensure pollen dispersal. This apparently extra cost of animal pollination could be selectively advantageous if it maintains the attention of generalist pollinators or if it provides a bet-hedging mechanism to promote pollination in weather that is unfavourable to pollinator activity. Regardless of whether this post-pollination nectar is advantageous, its production probably involves little physiological expense as nectar comprises only 3% of the energy content of each P. cordata. This small investment contrasts with findings for Asclepias syriaca, which expends up to 33% of its daily photosynthetic production during flowering on nectar. Regression analysis of the relation between ""per flower' nectar production and inflorescence size for 27 species indicates that A. syriaca produces an unusually large amount of nectar, whereas P. cordata produces the amount expected given its flower production. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027062057

Phacelia populations in five of eight areas separated by 2-80 km had species of flower visitors that were not collected at the seven other sites. In plant populations in one of these areas, the relative abundances of 12 common groups of pollinators varied significantly over the season within sites, at the same site between consecutive years, and between sites 2km apart in the same year. Some groups that were very common in one experimental population were rare or absent in the others. The ten most common groups of visitors varied in their behavioural responses to flower gender, flower size, and flower number. Four groups arrived at hermaphrodite plants at a significantly higher rate than at female plants. Hermaphrodites have larger flowers than females, and in two insect groups that preferred to visit hermaphrodites, their preference was all or in part a correlated effect of their preference of large-flowered plants. One group, Pseudomasaris spp. (Hymenoptera; Masaridae) preferred to visit female plants. Arrival rate of nine insect groups increased with flower number. Arrival rate of beetles and of four relatively large-bodied bees increased with hermaphrodite flower size, while arrival rate of a small bee, the Phacelia specialist Chelostoma minutum (Megachilidae) increased with female flower size. Five groups visited significantly more (but proportionately fewer) flowers after arriving at many-flowered plants, and two groups visited significantly more flowers per hermaphrodite than per female. Variation in the occurrence and abundance of its pollinators makes evolutionary specialization of P. linearis for particular pollinators unlikely. Variation in pollinator abundance and behaviour may cause small-scale spatio-temporal variation in selection for floral characters in this species. Selection apparently favours large-flowered hermaphrodites in populations and years in which the pollinator assemblage is dominated by large-bodied bees. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026498925

A., LAUSHMAN, R. H. & RUCKLESHAUS, M. H., 1992. Surface and submarine pollination in the seagrass Zostera marina L. Hydrophilous plants can be divided into three ecological categories depending upon whether their pollen is transported above, on, or under the water surface. A mixed mode of submarine and surface hydrophilous pollination occurs in the seagrass Zostera marina L. In the surface mode of pollination, pollen rafts or search vehicles which superficially resemble snowflakes, form at low tide and are transported on the surface of the sea by winds and water currents. Some of the search vehicles collide with the floating female stigmas, effecting pollination. In the submarine mode of pollination, small pollen masses resembling whisk brooms travel beneath the surface of the water. Although we failed to observe a submarine pollination event, SEM analysis of stigmas from subtidal populations confirms that submarine pollination does occur in Z. marina. However, observations of stigmas positioned at and below the surface of the water show surface pollination to be highly efficient. Electrophoretic evaluation of both subtidal and intertidal populations indicates significant genetic variation between populations. Given the high flux rates of surface?borne pollen and pollen viability in excess of 5 h, it is likely that surface?borne pollen is a major source of gene flow in Zostera marina populations.

In B. oleracea and A. thaliana, stigmatic response to pollination includes events in the papillar cytoplasm and changes to the stigmatic surface beneath the grain. In particular a specialized outer element of the cell wall expands prior to pollen tube penetration. The pollen tube, which enters through a foot of pollen coating, grows in a space generated between an inner and the outer element of the wall and extends to the base of the papilla where it enters the middle lamellae of the subjacent cell layer. However, in A. thaliana tubes frequently were seen to penetrate all components of the stigmatic cell wall, an event only previously recorded in immature stigmas of B. oleracea. In self pollinations of self?incompatible B. oleracea involving strong S (incompatibility) alleles no changes take place in the papillar cell wall. In P. rhoeas the stigmatic surface responds to self and cross pollination by the secretion of electron?lucent material beneath the cuticle, causing it to become detached from the outer surface of the stigmatic cell wall. The pollen tubes then penetrate the cuticle and grow towards the base of the papilla in the space thus generated. The tubes continue to grow intercellularly in the transmitting tissue which lies horizontally in rays beneath the papillae. In members of the Compositae, C. bipinnatus and H. annuus, both stigma and pollen respond to pollination by producing copious quantities of an electron?opaque matrix, which frequently causes individual papillae to adhere together. Pollen tubes, which are formed following both compatible and incompatible intraspecific pollinations, grow into this matrix and toward the base of the papillae. There, in common with the other plants studied, they grow intercellularly and enter the transmitting tissue of the style. These findings are discussed in the light of current views of the mechanisms operating during angiosperm pollination and of the significance of the stigmatic response to the functioning of self?incompatibility mechanisms.

Pollination induces an activation of the pistil. A number of changes take place in the different tissues of this organ that appear to support male gametophyte development and to assist fertilization. Thus pollination induces stigma secretion, the release of starch from the transmitting tissue and prolongs embryo sac viability. It appears that even those pollen grains that do not achieve fertilization have a synergistic role supporting others to do so. The pistil also has an effect on pollen tube growth. Pollen tube growth along the pistil is not continuous, accelerations and decelerations take place depending on the different tissues they traverse. The fact that pollen tube growth is heterotrophic, at the expenses of the pistil reserves, and that these reserves are not continuously produced confers the pistil with a role controlling pollen tube growth kinetics. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001866090

The sample size for regeneration depends on the frequency and number of alleles at a locus. Modes of gene action and interaction (neutral, recessive, dominant, codominant, or overdominant) affect the distribution of allelic frequencies in a finite population. The objectives were to: (1) study the distribution of neutral and overdominant allelic frequencies in a finite population and the relationship of the distribution to the sample size and mutation rate in seed regeneration and (2) examine the effect of a founder event (bottleneck) on the allelic frequency and number of alleles present during regeneration of small collections. Finite populations contain, on the average, up to 11 neutral alleles at low frequency and from one to three neutral alleles at intermediate frequency. In general there is no more than one neutral allele at high frequency. For a high mutation rate (5 × 10-3), samples of 100 to 250 individuals will have a large proportion of the neutral alleles at low frequency and smaller samples will contain a lesser degree of neutral polymorphism. For a mutation rate of 5 × 10-4 collections of more than 250 individuals are required for a high degree of neutral polymorphism at a single locus. Overdominance is inefficient for maintaining a large number of alleles in a finite population. The usual sample for regeneration of 100-300 individuals would not maintain many overdominant alleles if the regenerations were affected by selection. If the original collection is small (less than 10 individuals), a bottleneck effect will result in the loss of some alleles present in the original population at low frequency. Therefore, the first priority is to insure appropriate sampling during collection. A sample of at least 100 individuals from the original population should be sufficient for this purpose. It is recommend that 150 to 250 individuals and crossing procedures that maximize effective population size be utilized for the regeneration of collections of cross pollinated species containing a high level of heterozygosity. A balanced bulk should be prepared for use in further regenerations, thus avoiding changes in allele frequency caused by selection and the effects of overdominant alleles on seed production. Mutation is not a significant factor in regenerations based on 150-250 plants. © 1992.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249011196

To quantify the degree of floral similarity among the forage plants, Dillwynia hispida, Dillwynia uncinata and Pultenaea densifolia, discriminant function analysis of petal dimensions and a spectral analysis of corolla colour was undertaken. Petal size varied moderately among species resulting in 214% of specimens being misclassified, usually as D. uncinata. Subtle variation in corolla colour in the ultraviolet wavelengths contributed to the distinctiveness of each species. All three species exhibit an UV?absorbing region at the base of the standard petal which contrasts sharply with the rest of the UV?rerlecting petal. Between 450 nm and 470 nm, per cent reflectance drops for D. hispida and P. densifolia, but remains steady for D. uncinata. Above 480 nm, parts of the standard petal in all species reflect similar amounts of light with little variation exhibited among species. Nectar was only offered by D. hispida and D. uncinata, whereas P. densifolia produced an excess of pollen which may serve as a reward. Despite the subtle differences in floral morphology and rewards among these sympatric legumes, Trichocolletes bees only remained faithful to a given species in 43% of 183 interplant flights. Inconstant foraging by Trichocolletes sp. increases the pool of resources because rewards in all three legume species can be obtained in exactly the same manner. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

The pollination biology of Cynorkis uniflora Lindley (Orchidaceae) was studied on a rocky outcrop in a fragment of montane rain forest in central Madagascar. The plant was obligately pollinated by hawk?moths. Nectar was produced in a floral spur and was accessible to hawk?moths with medium?long and long tongues. All observed visits took place during the 80 min following dusk. Floral traits and visits indicated pollination association with endemic hawk?moths of the genera Nephete and Hippotion with medium tongue length and early?evening habits. The orchid pollinia had extraordinarily long caudicles (c. 16 mm) and were carried attached to the hawk?moths' eyes, thus protruding far in front of the face of the pollinator. The ratio between components of floral female and male functions within the orchid population suggested that the much elongated operative male floral parts result from strong and progressively extreme sex?specific selection for acquiring mates via hawk?moths. By far the most frequent flower?visitors of C. uniflora at the study site were long?tongued nectar thieving hawk?moths whose relative abundance probably reflected faunal imbalance caused by the destruction of nearby moth foraging habitats through deforestation.

Environmental stress represents the most limiting factor to agricultural productivity. For major crop plants, the average losses in productivity due to stressful environment is estimated at 5080% of their genetic potential. Although plants are able to tolerate some variations in their optimal growth conditions, temperature becomes lethal to the plant above a certain limit. The reproductive phase in the plant life cycle is particularly sensitive to heat stress. Because fertilization success is determined by a number of factors including pollen viability, female receptivity, and environmental influences that are impractical to test in the field, in vitro pollination is a useful technique for studying the fertilization process. Both pollination and culture are conducted under controlled nutritional and environmental conditions using this approach. The quality of male and female cells and tissues used for culture are necessary factors to ensure optimum in vitro fertilization. © 1992, Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027102099

This study compared 23 hybrids with 21 open-pollinated varieties, all developed in India and/or Southern Africa. Materials were field-tested under conditions of stored soil moisture at two levels of drought stress (dryland or one supplemental irrigation) at Bet Dagan, Israel in 1989. Irrespective of the water regime, grain yield and harvest index increased and leaf area index decreased with a shorter growth duration of the genotypes. Hybrids were earlier, had a larger leaf area index, more than double the harvest index and produced more grain compared with varieties. In spite of their longer growth duration, varieties were less water-stressed than hybrids, as judged by their midday leaf water potential, relative water content and the extent of leaf rolling. The relatively poor plant water status of the hybrids could be partly ascribed to their larger leaf area index. Hybrids produced more biomass per day than varieties under low stress while varieties produced more biomass per day than hybrids under high stress. Thus, in terms of plant water status and mean daily biomass production, varieties were more drought resistant than hybrids. However, the physiological superiority of the varieties under drought stress did not result in a higher grain yield because of their inherent relatively poor harvest index, typical of the tall and late African sorghums. The superior physiological resistance to drought stress of these varieties could be translated into a yield advantage under drought stress if their potential harvest index is improved. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

Floral symmetry was found in roughly equal proportion for actinomorphic and zygomorphic flowers. Most flowers were short?lived (612 hours); in monoecious species the female flowers were longer?lived than the male flowers. The most frequent rewards were pollen and nectar (36.4%) and pollen (30.3%). At the community level, bee? and wasp?pollination prevailed in 57.1% of plant species studies, followed by wind?

The two procedures are compared for the cases of one and five crosses under selection. If only one cross is concerned, the early selection method reduces to early line selection and it was found to supply better inbred lines than SSD.

Six modes of self-pollination are distinguished. These differ in whether they utilize specialized flowers, whether they involve the transfer of pollen within or between flowers, whether they are autonomous or mediated by vectors, and their timing relative to opportunities for outcrossing. Various modes of selfing are subject to different structural constraints. Prepotency, the preferential success of cross-pollen in achieving fertilizations when it competes with self-pollen, influences the frequency of self-fertilization in some species. The amount of self-fertilization may depend on environmental conditions and the vector species visiting each flower and may vary among the flowers of one plant. To gain information on the prevalence of autonomous self-pollination, 66 species for which the degrees of self-compatibility and autofertility (seed set in isolation) have been published were surveyed. Partially self-incompatible species(in which the seed set is lower after self-pollination than after separate outcrosses) have on average lower autofertility than self-compatible species (in which self- and cross-pollinations succeed equally well), but some partially self-incompatible species have considerable autofertility and some self-compatible species have none.

The basic predictions derived from these models are similar. While most models predict sex allocation at the fruit stage (pollen and seeds), some have examined allocation at the flower stage (pollen and ovules). Selfing rate, mode of pollination and competition among offspring of the same parent are some of the factors that can influence sex allocation among populations.

No mammal species is restricted to this habitat, and most of the regions mammal fauna uses it at least occasionally. Mammal species composition within monsoon rainforests undergoes substantial variation along an extensive environmental gradient reflecting moisture condition and rockiness. For most mammal species, variation in abundance among patches was related more to the position of the patch on this environmental gradient than to patch size or extent of disturbance. Disturbance was positively correlated with the richness and abundance in quadrats of three taxonomic groupings  rodents, other native species, and all native species (other than bats) and negatively correlated with richness and abundance of macropods. Compared with surrounding (open forest and savanna woodland) vegetation, monsoon rainforests have few grazing herbivores and small granivorous rodents, but more species that eat fleshy fruits and seeds from woody plants. The mammal fauna of monsoon rainforests in the Northern Territory is similar to that of monsoon rainforests of the Kimberley (to the west) but unlike that of wet tropical rainforests in Cape York (to the east). These differences, and the current impoverishment of the mammal fauna of the Northern Territory monsoon rainforest, are attributable to historical processes and the current small area of this highly fragmented monsoon rainforest estate.

Pollen removal was strongly influenced by the number of bee visits to donor flowers. Amount of pollen removed in turn significantly affected the number of pollen grains reaching flowers of the first recipient, but because seed production decelerates with stigma pollen load, the relationship between pollen export and paternal success at this proximate scale showed diminishing returns. The probability of reaching mates within the array also increased with pollen export.

SEM provides ""modification indices' that indicate areas where the fit of a given model is especially poor, and therefore point to further observations or models that might adequately describe the data.

All species populations flowered synchronously but Diopsyros flowered for a longer period (15 wk), than either Neolitsea (3-4 wk) or Litsea (4-5 wk). All species had small, unspecialized flowers and were pollinated by small, generalist insects. Male trees produced more flowers per reproductive shoot than females and flower production was positively correlated with tree size in males but not in females. Fruit set was not correlated with tree size in female trees. The ratio of fruit set to flowers in females was negatively related to two measurements of male to female distance (distance to the nearest male tree (all species) and mean distance to the nearest 10 (Neolitsea and Diospyros) or three (Litsea) males, termed ""local male distance'). Rate of reduction in fruit set with increasing nearest male distance was the same for all species, although Diospyros produced a higher proportion of fruit relative to flowers. The ranges of fruit set for Neolitsea, Litsea and Diospyros were 1-30%, 2-20% and 20-40%, respectively. Although the mechanism for density-dependent pollen movement is the same for all three species, the longer flowering period and more gradual production of flowers found in Diospyros allowed more time for pollen to move through the population.

Studies of related genera show that at least two of the critical behavioral and life history traits suggested to have resulted from coevolved mutualism in yucca moths are plesiomorphic to the family. Another trait, oviposition into flowers, has evolved repeatedly within the family. One species with these traits, Greya politella, feeds on and pollinates plants of a different family, but pollination occurs through a different component of the oviposition behavior than in the yucca moths. Major differences compared with yucca moths and their hosts are that G. politella only passively pollinates its host and that copollinators often contribute to pollination. This analysis suggests that evolution of mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths may have required few behavioral and life history changes in the moths. The truly coevolved features of this interaction appear to be the evolution of active pollination by the moths, the associated morphological structures in the moths for carrying pollen, and the exclusion of copollinators by yuccas.",coevolution; mutualism; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026559672

Red?bellied lemurs licked nectar from flowers while rufous lemurs ate all flower parts from the same flower species. Several hypotheses are examined to explain the significance of flower feeding in these two species. In many primate species, flower feeding functions as a keystone resource and/or primates act as pollinators while feeding on flowers. Although peak flower feeding occurred during a decline in food availability, fruit was always (the preferred food item so that flowers did not function as a keystone resource. Second, red?bellied lemurs appear to be potentially better pollinators compared to the rufous lemurs because 1) they left flower reproductive parts intact while feeding, 2) they visited more than one tree or liana of the same plant species in the same day, 3) pollen was observed on the faces of individuals as they traveled from plant to plant, and 4) they have a feathered, brush?like tip on their tongue which rufous lemurs lack. Finally, the difference in flower feeding styles between the lemur species also affected three aspects of diet: 1) feeding bout duration, 2) the size of feeding subgroups, and 3) return visits to flowering sources. These subtle differences in diet within food categories can allow these two otherwise similar lemur species to coexist. © 1992 Wiley?Liss, Inc.

There was no relation between nectar availability and sugar concentration in either year.

Seeds from an emasculation period were heavier and germinated better than when the same invididual was an intact hermaphrodite. Naturally male-sterile (female) individuals produced more fruits due to flowers staying open longer for pollen to arrive via some vector.

The average number of pods on the main inflorescence at final harvest ranged over 1.8 to 8.4, the Reproductive Index (number of seeds per gram total above-ground dry weight, excluding seeds) varied from 3.1 to 7.6, and the Harvest Index from 0.17 to 0.50. Four stages at which abscission occurred were identified (flower [ovaries 7-8 mm long], pl [pods 9-10 mm], p2 [pods 11-13 mm], p3 [pods 14-27 mm long]) and used to assess reproductive development on a week by week basis. In all treatments, losses of flowers and pl pods accounted for 92% or more of total reproductive abscission and, of this, the majority was due to flower abscission. The number of abscised pl pods was relatively stable across treatments, but the number of p2 and p3 pods which abscised varied markedly with sowing date, possibly indicating a relationship with changes in environmental conditions. Examination of ovaries following cryosectioning and fluorescence microscopy showed that pollination of ovules occurred with a similarly high frequency in flowers destined to abscise (77%) compared with those destined to form pods (88%). The difference was due to a 50% probability of pollination of the fifth ovule in ovaries of flowers forming pods and only a 25% probability in those which abscised. The data are discussed in relation to the likely physiological basis for the regulation of reproductive abscission in the species. © 1992 CSIRO.

Nectar-feeding by both primates was observed between late April and May, during which a peak in the floristic activity of M. fistulifera was recorded, in terms of both the number of trees flowering and the number of flowers available on each tree. Phenological records indicate, by contrast, that edible fruit was relatively scarce during this period, the early dry season at the study site.

Delia flavifrons Zetterstedt (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) visits flowers of Silene vulgaris (Moench) Garcke (Caryophyllaceae), where the adults feed, mate, lay their eggs, and the larvae feed on developing seeds. The objective of the study was to examine how an ovipositing female fly assures a food resource for her progeny. Ovipositing females preferred young, non?pollinated flowers over older pollinated ones. The flies did not pollinate the flowers and survival of the larvae depended on the flowers being pollinated by moths. Flowers containing fly eggs were pollinated more often than expected from chance, probably as a result of both flies and moths visiting particular flowers. Eggs were laid singly, and multiple oviposition occurred randomly. Although most eggs hatched, only about half produced larvae that made their way into the fruits. As a result, the probability of competition arising from multiple oviposition may be reduced to such an extent that selection does not favour females that avoid flowers with conspecific eggs. Moth larvae of the noctuid genus Hadena also feed on the seed pods of S. vulgaris and will kill any fly larvae they encounter. However, there was no deviation from random oviposition by the flies in relation to eggs laid by the moths, but the competitively weaker fly usually started to lay eggs towards the end of the moth's egg?laying period. The relationship between Delia flavifrons and Silene vulgaris superficially parallels that for known pollinator/predator systems, but floral adaptations to hypothetically pollinating flies seems not to have taken place.

Staminate and pistillate florets of caprifig infected by S. caprifici exhibited necrosis and cavities in the cortical parenchyma of floret peduncles and stamen filaments. Schistonchus caprifici attacked pistillate florets of commercial fig (F. carica)-, however, S. caprifici population densities were less (P= 0.05) in commercial fig than in caprifig (550 nematodes vs. 12,000 nematodes/g fresh floret tissues, respectively). Schistonchus caprifici was spread from infected to healthy caprifig inflorescences through oviposition behaviour of the wasp, Blastophaga psenes. Wasp development occurred in inflorescences concomitantly infected with nematodes, which colonized and started reproducing in the haemocoel of wasp larvae. Schistonchus caprifici persisted in the pupae and winged females (hat developed in the pistillate florets. Wingless male wasps were not infected by the nematode. Commercial fig inflorescences were not receptive to wasp development, although these inflorescences were visited by ovipositing wasps which vectored nematodes in their florets. Nematode infection may result in premature inflorescence decay. There was no evidence of any adverse effect on B. psenes due to 5. caprifici infection. The association between caprifici and B. psenes on caprifig can be defined as a parasitic relationship because of nematode reproduction in the wasps haemocoel.

Presence of Argentine ant is associated with reduced populations of many native and non-native arthropod species, including important predator species and major pollinators of native plants. Effects of ant invasion were particularly severe at higher elevations of Haleakala volcano where endemic species normally exist at low densities. Some taxa, primarily alien species, were more abundant in the presence of ants. Invasion of Argentine ant has locally reduced the abundance of many endemic species in the shrubland ecosystem.

This study was conducted to determine how different levels of soil water-deficit during emergence of tassels influence silking and yield components of maize. A rain shelter provided timely water-deficits in a field environment during 1987 on a sandy soil in Michigan. Yield reductions in excess of 90% occurred when water-deficits spanned the interval from just prior to tassel emergence to beginning of grain-fill. Emergence of tassels and silks was delayed more than two weeks. Final internode lengths reflected reductions in plant extension growth, and evaluation of lengths of individual internodes depicted the windows of development in which plants were most affected by water-deficits. Grain number was reduced in proportion to the duration of the water-deficit period. Assessment of grain and non-grain above-ground biomass 100 days after sowing demonstrated that both were reduced by severe water-deficits, but not to the same degree. There was delayed development in response to the severe water-deficits, as was apparent from 75% silking dates and biomass assessments. © 1992.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249014086

Resistant and susceptible maize hybrids (Pride K127 and Pioneer 3953) and inbreds (C0272 and C0266) were inoculated at intervals from 0 to 18 days after silk emergence by injecting a macroconidial suspension into the silk channel. Five inbreds (C0272, C0266, F7, F2, and A641) were inoculated at three stages of silk development using two techniques: injection into the silk channel and spraying onto exposed silks. At harvest, the severity of ear rot symptoms was assessed on a seven-class rating scale. In an additional experiment, silk tissue sampled from within the silk channel and from the exposed silk of the inbreds at three stages of silk development was examined in vitro for resistance to degradation by F. graminearum. Susceptibility increased immediately after silk emergence, then declined. The best differentiation among genotypes was obtained when inoculation involved injection into the silk channel at an intermediate stage of silk development. When maize ears were inoculated later than 7 days after silk emergence, it was not possible to detect differential resistance of genotypes. Fungal degradation of detached silk tissue also decreased as silk aged. Decreases in silk channel length and in water content of exposed silk as silk ages may partially account for changes in resistance observed over time within individual inbreds. The results of these experiments indicate that when silk inoculation is used to screen for resistance to F. graminearum, all plants should be inoculated at the same stage of development, preferably at the stage when the silk has elongated, has been pollinated, and may have some brown tips. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003043233

Fruiting phenologies may be dictated more by rates of fruit maturation and plant life history strategies than by environmental cues. Altered river flow due to recent construction of upstream dams may affect flowering phenologies and potentially reduce fruit and seed production. Shifts in flowering and fruiting phenologies could, in turn, influence some pollinators and seed dispersers. (See also 93L/06877). -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027094556

Each parent possessed pseudo-self compatibility (PSC), which allowed seed set following self pollination. Rapid-generation cycling (laboratory seed ripening to heart stage and subsequent embryo rescue) reduced generation time and minimized confounding maternal with zygotic inbreeding depression during post heart-stage seed development. Selection criteria were male/female fertility and PSC. Two stages of the life cycle were chosen to evaluate inbreeding depression: germination (seed development to germination) and survivorship (fertile individuals at anthesis). PSC was environmentally interactive and genotype dependent, causing variable levels of self seed set between and within populations and generations. By the end of the second generation, families from all noninbred cultivars, D. makinoi, and one F1 hybrid were eliminated from the experiment due to self incompatibility and/or inbreeding depression. Post-germination inbreeding depression was severe in several advanced inbreds. Inbred progeny of most F1 or F2 hybrids expressed less or equal amounts of inbreeding depression compared to advanced inbreds.

But given the high risk of mortality in flight between trees, adult wasps should prefer to pollinate and oviposit within inflorescences (syconia) at the same tree at which they developed. Flowering within individuals is tightly synchronous in most species, while different trees flower out of phase with each other, suggesting that fig phenology has evolved to assure outcrossing. However, some fig species show distinct within-tree flowering asynchrony. It has been suggested that such asynchrony is an adaptation by which figs in seasonal environments can reduce pollinator mortality, by permitting wasps to persist on individual trees at times when flight would be impossible. The authors have rejected the validity of this Seasonality Hypothesis for Ficus aurea near its northern range limit. Crops of individual trees were most, not least synchronous during the coldest, driest months of two years. Maximum asynchrony occurred in seasons that were probably most favourable for wasp transit between trees, but temporal overlap of the phenological stages that permit wasps to remain on their natal trees was always very rare, implying that consecutive cohorts of developing syconia may be spaced in time to limit this occurrence. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027079538

Consequently, differences among plants in flower production are expected to have a substantial impact on their relative success at fathering seed. This prediction was examined using one natural and three structured Raphanus sativus populations. A plant's relative success at fathering seed on another plant in the population (male fertility) increased with flower production, but the increase in fertility exhibited a diminishing marginal gain, with the relationship varying among populations. The relationship between the estimates of total number of seeds sired and flower production ranged from a weakly linear to strongly negative quadratic. The spatial structure of the population with respect to seed yield had a powerful effect on the total number of seeds sired because male fertility decreased exponentially with intermate distance. Other covariates important to male fertility were flower color, time, the specific identity of the male parent, and male by female interaction. The identity of the male parent consistently accounted for a large portion of the variation in male fertility, indicating that other unmeasured features of the plant influenced its success. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027069863

Twenty-six populations surveyed in N Utah contain a majority of perfect-flowered hermaphrodites, but most (22) also contain male-sterile individuals (females), at frequencies of up to 0.16. The hermaphrodite selfing rate is low (0.00-0.20 in four populations). Maternal gender does not consistently affect components of offspring vigor, such as seed size, germination rate, seedling survivorship, and vegetative size. Plants of the two genders do not differ in number of seeds per fruit or mean seed mass. Females produce significantly more fruits and seeds than hermaphrodites in natural populations. The ratio of the mean lifetime seed production of females to the mean lifetime seed production of hermaphrodites ranged from 1.31-2.52 in six natural populations. Females have greater shoot biomass than hermaphrodites and produce more seeds at any given shoot biomass than hermaphrodites, suggesting that their seed-production advantage arises from gender-specific patterns of resource allocation to growth and reproduction. Nuclear gynodioecy appears to be evolutionarily stable mainly because of resource compensation by females, without a large outcrossing advantage of females. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027047128

Tissues with primary cell walls?middle lamellae, at early stages of development, were degraded completely. In specific tissues, newly synthesised secondary walls were highly digestible whereas the primary walls?middle lamellae of these tissues were indigestible. These primary walls?middle lamellae stained positively with acid phloroglucinol but showed no fluorescence. At pollination, when secondary walls were of considerable thickness, these walls were still completely digestible even though they stained intensely with acid phloroglucinol and showed reduced fluorescence. However, at some distance from the cut end of sections, the secondary walls of the elongated tube?like cells of sclerenchyma tissue showed considerable reduction in digestibility. Cross?sectional area and dry weight measurements of different stem tissues revealed the importance of secondary wall digestion of sclerenchyma compared with the thin?walled parenchyma. Chemical treatment with KmnO4 or NaOH resulted in colourless secondary walls after staining whereas primary walls still reacted positively. It was concluded that very small amounts of phenolic compounds (lignin) located in the primary wall?middle lamella that are not removed by KmnO4 and NaOH treatment are responsible for the decrease in digestibility of tissues during plant development. Histochemical lignin reactions and fluorescence just detect phenolic compounds and cannot be correlated with degradation.

Lat. 36.5°) and contains a rich assemblage of plant and animal fossils. The chief plant families represented by pollen taxa are Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, Betulaceae, Ulmaceae, Hamamelidaceae and Pinaceae. The combined pollen and leaf data indicate that the Miocene vegetation of the Shanwang area was mixed deciduous and evergreen broad-leaved forest with a humid warm-temperate to subtropical climate. In contrast, the modern vegetation is a deciduous broadleaved forest, that contains very few subtropical elements. The average annual temperature at Shanwang was similar to that of today. The main difference between the modern and Miocene climates is that the annual temperature range has increased (colder winters), and precipitation which was evenly distributed is now highly seasonal (winter dry). A comparison between the fossil pollen and leaf evidence reveals that the chief families of both assemblages are almost identical. Various evidence implies the fossil leaf assemblages are derived chiefly from a local or an autochthonous community; however, the pollen assemblage reflects a more regional character of vegetation and climate. The leaf fossil assemblage, which includes more insect-pollinated plant taxa, affords a better picture of the local ancient flora. © 1992 by AASP Foundation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027020037

Morphological features used by plants to attract biotic pollinators can be considered in this light, because such ""attractive;' structures are prerequisite for both pollen donation and receipt. A model involving allocation of a limiting resource between attractive structures benefiting both sex functions, structures benefiting male function only, and structures benefiting female function only, is constructed and analyzed using the evolutionary stable strategy approach. Contrary to expectation, conditions resulting in large allocation to attractive structures tend to destabilize hermaphroditism, although the effect is slight. Substantial asymmetry in the benefits accruing to male and female feritlity for a given investment in pollinator attraction produces more pronounced effects, reducing the parameter space in which hermaphroditism is expected. Results of this model are used to assess the importance of ""accelerating grain' curves previously suggested for the evolution of dioecy in flowering plants. Accelerating gains associated with fruit production and dispersal represent female function only, and can be sufficient to initiate eovlution toward dioecy. Accelerating gains associated with pollinator atrraction may contribute to the evolution of separate sexes only if male function benefits from increased investment in attractive structures at a disproportionate rate compared to female function. Even in this instance, though, hermaphroditism may be evolutionarily stable. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027083838

We have used two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in search of molecular changes underlying fruit development and ovary senescence at the level of total accumulated proteins, newly synthesized proteins, and translatable, RNA populations. We have found changes in gene expression during the processes of ovary formation and ovary senescence. Stimuli that induce fruit set do not appreciably alter the overall patterns of synthesized proteins or translatable RNAs, indicating that fruit development is apparently a natural continuation of ovary formation. However, ovary senescence is an alternative pathway that involves the presence of new RNA messengers and proteins as well as the disappearance of others.

Although viable pollen is produced, pollen germination and tube growth are severely reduced both in vivo and in vitro. This results in plants that are self-sterile. Pollen from the transgenic plants is partially rescued by inbred V26 stigmas, resulting in seed set that is approximately 30% of normal. Female fertility in the transgenic petunia is unaffected by the lack of flavonoids. We propose the term conditional male fertility (CMF) to describe the state in which viable but flavonoid-deficient pollen does not function in self-crosses and is partially functional on wild-type stigmas. Although this condition has attributes of both male sterility and self-incompatibility, it is clearly different. This observation in petunia has similarities to the earlier report of Coe et al. (1981) that most pollinations made with chalcone synthase (CHS)-deficient maize pollen were unsuccessful. The possibility that normal development of the male gametophyte requires flavonoid synthesis in many or all higher plants is discussed. The dominant CHS deficiency and male sterility in petunia, taken together with the recessive CHS deficiency and male sterility in maize, suggest that flavonoid synthesis in the sporophyte rather than the gametophyte is required for fertility. © 1992 The American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027055662

Löve. Spikes of the translocation line 'Indis' were irradiated with gamma rays at dosages of 15, 20, and 25 Gy. The irradiated spikes were pollinated with 'Inia 66' pollen and the F2 and F3 generations screened for translocation mutants, using the genes for leaf rust resistance and yellow endosperm pigmentation as markers. Finally, endopeptidase polymorphisms were utilized to select mutant translocation homozygotes within each of 29 families. An investigation of polymorphisms at the alpha-Amy-D2 and Wsp-D1 loci of chromosome arm 7DL revealed that 'Indis' did not produce an alpha-AMY-D2 product, but it did produce a novel WSP-D1 protein. The mutants were characterized for their leaf and stem rust resistances and the presence of WSP-D1 and yellow flour pigments. The stem rust resistance gene could not be accurately mapped. The linear order of the remaining loci on 7DL was centromere - leaf rust resistance - Wsp-D1 and yellow pigment. The data obtained suggested that the 'Indis' translocation has homo(eo)logy to the Lr19 translocation and homoeology to 7DL of common wheat.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026846697

Outcrossing rate is highly correlated with protandry and anther-stigma separation. Both genetic and environmental variation contribute to inter- and intrapopulation variation in protandry and anther-stigma separation. Interpopulation differentiation for protandry and anther-stigma separation was polygenic. Genetic variation for protandry and anther-stigma separation within populations was demonstrated by a significant among-family variance in two populations with contrasting breeding systems. Significant variation among lathhouse benches suggests that small-scale environmental heterogeneity may affect development of flora traits. Protandry was shortened under hot summer conditions. Hence, hotter and drier habitats, typical of the more self-pollinating populations of C. tembloriensis, can promote self-pollination purely through environmental effects. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026482902

Agrarias, 46773 Moncada, Valencia, Spain","Satsuma (Citrus unshiu [Mak] Marc.) and Clementine (Citrus reticulata [Hort.] Ex. Tanaka, cv Oroval) are two species of seedless mandarins differing in their tendency to develop parthenocarpic fruits. Satsuma is a male-sterile cultivar that shows a high degree of natural parthenocarpy and a high fruit set. Seedless Clementine varieties are self-incompatible, and in the absence of cross-pollination show a very low ability to set fruit. The gibberellins (GAs) GA53, putative 17-OH-GA53, GA44, GA17, GA19, GA20, GA29, GA1, 3-epi-GA1, GA8, GA24, GA9, and GA4 have been identified from developing fruits of both species by full-scan combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using selected ion monitoring with [2H2]- and [13C]-labeled internal standards, the levels of GA53, GA44, GA19, GA20, GA1, GA8, GA4, and GA9 were determined in developing ovaries at anthesis and 7 days before and after anthesis, from both species. Except for GA8, levels of the 13-hydroxy-GAs were higher in Satsuma than in Clementine, and these differences were more prominent for developing young fruits. At petal fall, Satsuma had, on a nanograms per gram dry weight basis, higher levels of GA53 (10.4x), GA44 (13.9x), GA19 (3.0x), GA20 (11.2x), and GA1 (2.0x). By contrast, levels of GA8 were always higher in Clementine, whereas levels of GA4 did not differ greatly. Levels of GA9 were very low in both species. At petal fall, fruitlets of Satsuma and Clementine contained 65 and 13 picograms of GA1, respectively. At this time, the application of 25 micrograms of paclobutrazol to fruits increased fruit abscission in both varieties. This effect was reversed by the simultaneous applications of 1 microgram of GA3. GA3 alone improved the set in Clementine (13x), but had little influence on Satsuma. Thus, seedless fruits of the self-incompatible Clementine mandarin may not have adequate GA levels for fruit set. Collectively, these results suggest that endogenous GA content in developing ovaries is the limiting factor controlling the parthenocarpic development of the fruits.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000645043

Mixtures of protoplasts thus modified were treated with Ca2+ and polyethylene glycol to obtain heterologous fusion products. Among the fusion products were some tomato plants that were indistinguishable from the original cultivars with respect to morphology, physiology, and chromosome number (2N = 24) but exhibited various degrees of male sterility (MS): complete lack or malformation of anthers, shrunken pollen, and normal-looking stainable pollen that could not germinate. The MS thus induced in five cultivars of different growth types, including one of subspecies L. esculentum cerasiforme, was inherited maternally over several generations and is, therefore, cytoplasmically determined MS (CMS). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed that the mitochondrial genome of the CMS hybrids does not contain all elements of the mitochondrial DNA of either parent but includes sequences of a recombinational nature not present in either parent. The CMS hybrids, therefore, possess a true hybrid mitochondrial genome. The same procedure applied to fusion of tomato with Solarium lycopersicoides and Nicotiana tabacum cells did not produce CMS phenotypes. The advantages of this method over others for generating MS are as follows: (i) only one step is required; (ii) the nuclear genotype of the cultivar is unaffected; (iii) the prospect that cytoplasmic determination allows generation of 100% CMS progenies. The normal-appearing but nonfunctional pollen of certain CMS types might render them attractive to pollinating bumblebees that thus would facilitate production of hybrid seed.",Lycopersicon esculentum; Nicotiana tabacum; Solatium acaule; Solatium lycopersicoides; Solatium tuberosum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026635755

Thirteen out of 15 allozyme loci analysed were polymorphic. The level of polymorphism was relatively high for an insect-pollinated outcrossing species. In one population, which was subjected to a prolonged decline in numbers resulting in a bottleneck, probably of three plants, there was no measurable reduction in either allelic diversity of average heterozygosity. Maintenance of heterozygosity in this population could be attributed to rapid recovery after the bottleneck, the progressive elimination of selfed or otherwise inbred products during seed development and selection favouring heterozygotes as plants mature. Evidence for the latter was a significant decrease in the fixation index from younger (E = 0.28) to older plants (F = 0.14). Bottleneck-flush cycles are considered to be a major factor contributing to the relatively high level of differentiation observed between the three Wongan Hills populations, which suggests that the bottleneck observed was not atypical for these populations. The allozyme divergence between the two population systems within this taxon (D = 0.29) may be indicative of two different but morphologically cryptic species. Spatial autocorrelation techniques revealed no spatial genetic structure in one population sampled at its maximum density. It was concluded that high levels of genetic diversity in small populations are typical of 5. coroniforme, which is relatively short lived, disturbance-adapted and has population systems which probably undergo frequent bottleneck-flush cycles. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Bottleneck; Differentiation; Genetic variability; Heterozygosity; Spatial genetic structure; Stylidium coroniforme,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027040631

Pollination involves the transfer of the pollen grain (the male gametophyte) to the stigma, its adhesion, hydration, and production of a pollen tube. The pollen tube extends through the gynecium (stigma, style, and ovary), carrying the sperm cells that are delivered ultimately to the embryo sac (the female gametophyte) within the ovule. The extension of the pollen tube follows a defined secretory path within the gynecium called the transmitting tract or stylar matrix. Pollen tube extension is typically restricted to this specialized extracellular matrix (ECM). The stylar ECM that supports pollen tube growth is produced on the surface of the cells along which the pollen tube travels. The secretions produced by transmitting tract cells are frequently described as mucilage or as a fluid composed of various ingredients.

Virus was detected equally well in seed coats of the progeny in both cultivars. Analysis of virus incidence and concentration in pea seeds of different developmental stages demonstrated that in the cultivar with a high incidence of seed transmission, PSbMV directly invaded immature embryos, multiplied in the embryonic tissues and persisted during seed maturation. In contrast, the cultivar without seed transmission did not show invasion of immature embryos by the virus; there was no evidence for virus multiplication or persistence during embryo development and seed maturation.

The length of style in both P. veris and N. assoanus is dimorphic (the former being a typical distylous species); they resemble each other in flower morphology (narrow-tubed), color, and nectar characteristics. Therefore, interspecific pollen transfer between these two species shows a pattern related to these similarities. It is inferred that the pattern of interspecific pollen transfer is mediated mainly by long-tongued pollinators seeking nectar, and that of intraspecific pollen transfer by long- and short-tongued pollinators feeding on nectar and pollen, respectively. The floral features of P. tabemaemontani are markedly different, especially in flower architecture (open) and reward (pollen). Accordingly, pollen transfer to other species is reduced, the long-styled flowers of N. assoanus being the exception.

Late-flowering genets had accelerated phenology, correlated with heat accumulation per day. Individual flowers lasted for 11.7 d. Strongly protogynous flowers (female phase lasted 4.2 d), declining stigma receptivity at the time of anther dehiscence, and more or less simultaneous flowering within genets reduce the probability for self-pollination. High seed abortion in naturally pollinated flowers (seed:ovule ratio = 0.25) supports this prediction. Seed set is very low from autodeposition of pollen, and almost as low from selfing.

Additional anatomical observations and histochemical starch measurements in the peduncle of the flower and fruit showed the development of a starch depot in the vicinity of the phloem. This starch is consumed during the growth of cross-fertilized fruits. Until the abscission process has finished this starch pool is hydrolyzed in self-fertilized flowers as well.

Gene flow was documented at distances up to 0.7 km. For the 13 patches examined, interpatch pollen must have sired from 0-48.3% (mean 8.5%) of the seeds of monoecious plants (hermaphrodites). Rates of interpatch siring of seeds of pistillate plants (females) averaged 20.4% (8.6-40%) for the three patches examined. Heterogeneity among fruits in seeds sired by interpatch pollen indicates that the arrival of interpatch pollen is clumped with respect to stigmas. Within patches, plants of the same sex type usually shared identical five-locus genotypes, suggesting that clonal propagation predominates. Since c90% of seeds are sired by intrapatch pollen, seeds of monoecious plants appear to result primarily from geitonogamous (self-)fertilization.

Its oil-bearing seed contains high amounts of the hydroxy fatty acid (HFA), lesquerolic acid (C20:1-OH), suitable as a raw material for many types of industrial applications. Currently the U.S. imports castor seed oil as its chief source of HFA, used primarily in the production of lubricants and plastics. Lesquerella could complement castor oil imports as well as provide new applications and products. Lesquerella meal is being tested as a feed source. Other lesquerella species contain varying amounts and types of HFA. L. fendleri appears to be highly cross-pollinated, and as a consequence, considerable genetic variation exists for traits such as seed oil content, HFA, yield, flowering time, and growth habit. Rapid progress is being made toward full commercialization of lesquerella with private companies and government agencies working together in parallel studies on yield improvement and on finding new uses for the seed oil. Cooperative plantings began in 1990 and included 12 ha in central Arizona and Texas. Planting for 1991 has been increased to 30 ha and covered a wider range of climatic and soil conditions. The seed oil from these plantings is being used to formulate and test lubricant and cosmetics products. Agronomic management practices being investigated include planting methods, time of harvest, and irrigation scheduling. Fortunately, existing farm equipment with minor modification can be used for planting and harvesting the crop.

Kernel water potential declined in correspondence with the water potential of the medium; however, fresh weight growth was not significantly inhibited from 5 to 12 days after pollination. In stress treatments with media water potentials of -1.6 or -2.0 megapascals, endosperm tissue accumulated water and solutes from 10 and 12 days after pollination at a rate similar to or greater than that of the control (-1.1 megapascals). In contrast, endosperm cell division was inhibited in all treatments relative to control. At 10 days after pollination, endosperm sucrose concentration was greater in two of the -2.0 megapascal treatments with 0.44 or 0.58 molar media sucrose compared to control kernels cultured in 0.29 molar sucrose at -1.1 megapascals. Significant increases in abscisic acid content per gram of fresh weight were detected in two -2.0 megapascal treatments (0.29 molar sucrose plus 0.29 molar sorbitol and 0.58 molar sucrose) at 10 days after pollination.

This was due to earlier-flowering plants producing fruits with a greater number of seeds, on average, than later-flowering ones. Results fully support the prediction, based on the assumption of increasing environmental severity as the dry season proceeds, that comparatively earlier-flowering individuals should gain some reproductive advantage over later-flowering conspecifics.

Growth of kernels was proportional to the size of cob piece attached. Slicing the cob piece to disrupt symplastic but not apoplastic continuity greatly reduced uptake of 14C-sugars into the kernels. Uptake of 14C from L-glucose into cob and kernel tissues was much lower than that from D-glucose, sucrose, or fructose. Similar amounts of 14C from sucrose and 1'-fluorosucrose (an invertase-resistant sucrose analog) entered cob and endosperm tissues, but more 14C entered pedicel, pericarp, and embryo tissues from sucrose than from 1'-fluorosucrose. The non-penetrating sugar transport inhibitors p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate and phlorizin reduced sugar uptake by cob and kernel tissues. 3-Hydroxy-5,8,10-pyrenetrisulfonate (PTS), a fluorescent apoplastic tracer, did not permeate the cob tissue or enter the kernels in 24 h, while fluorescein, a symplastic tracer, permeated all tissues. These results indicate that phloem loading or uptake by cob parenchyma cells is a prerequisite to transfer of compounds from the incubation medium into the endosperm, and that invertase hydrolysis in the cob tissue does not contribute to that process. The active role of the cob tissue in absorption of compounds into the endosperm, as well as the observed barrier to apoplastic diffusion, needs to be considered in any experiments in which this culture technique is used. © 1992, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

If faster pollen tube growth rates tend to be correlated with higher fitness of the progeny sired, then most of the variation would be expected to be due to detrimental mutations, and therefore subject to purifying selection. If, however, variation is maintained in populations, it is likely that genetic factors for fast pollen tube growth would reduce fitness at other stages of the life cycle, resulting in negative genetic correlations between pollen and progeny quality.

Dye transfer among moprhs was highly asymmetric, with more frequent transfer from the short-styled morph to the long- and mid-style morphs. This suggests that shorts are performing better at pollen donation and longs and mids are performing better at pollen receipt. Hand-pollinated short-styled plants had significantly higher total seed mass and more seeds per capsule than short controls, whereas hand pollination failed to increase seed set in long and mid morphs. As predicted, short-styled morphs showed significant pollen limitation, whereas seed set in long- and mid-styled morphs was not pollen-limited.

E. spathulata and E. leptophylla were found to be highly self incompatible, setting very low levels of seed from controlled self pollination. E. cladocalyx trees ranged from self compatible to self incompatible. Reductions were seen in both the number of capsules and the numbers of seeds per capsule, from self pollination. The mechanism of self incompatibility was investigated in the pistil by following the success of cross and self pollinations with fluorescence microscopy. In E. cladocalyx and E. leptophylla no reduction in ovule penetration was seen from self pollination while in E. spathulata a significant reduction was seen in two trees but not the third, indicating that the post-zygotic mechanism of self incompatibility operates in all three species, and with mixed pre-zygotic and post-zygotic mechanisms in E. spathulata. Floral architecture differed between the three species in the structure of the inflorescence units, flower morphology, and anther, pollen and ovule numbers per flower. Pistil cytology was similar for all three species but differed in the length of the stylar canal, degree of sclerotinisation, stigma morphology and volume of transmitting tissue.

Not all hybrids performed well but a group of adapted cultivars outyielded the open-pollinated cultivars consistently. The grain yield regression equation of a leading hybrid (PNR6549) on the best open-pollinated cultivar (Kalahari Early Pearl) was y = 0,32 + l,2x (yield range: 1 t ha'1 to 8 t ha-1).

Weed control was a major determinant of yield. At the lowest level of purchased input (open-pollinated seed, no fertilizer), increasing the number of weedings from one to three raised the mean grain yield over two seasons from 1,1 t ha-1 to 2,0 t ha-1, and from 2,2 t ha-1to 3,8 t ha-1 in the treatment incorporating a hybrid cultivar and the highest fertilizer level Production objectives and labour and cash constraints in KwaZulu differ between subsistence farmers and semi-commercial and commercial farmers.

Following capture by the stigmatic papilla, the pollen grain commences hydration. in cross-pollination the grain completes hydration within a matter of minutes and extends a tube into the papilla cell wall through the point of contact between grain and stigma. Self-pollen, however, fails to hydrate, and in the presence of strong alleles, no further development takes place. Weaker S alleles result in a range of morphologies, which may include growth of the pollen tube over the surface of the stigma. Interspecific pollinations between SI and self-compatible species indicate that the stigmas of SI plants express an additional factor, which acts to prevent the entry of self-compatible pollen. Such an inference is supported by the observation that in SI plants immature stigmas fail to recognize self-pollen, only becoming competent to do so in the later stages of maturity. The direct involvement of S locus-specific glycoproteins (SLSGs) in SI is also indicated by their segregation with S alleles in breeding pedigrees. © 1992 Academic Press Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027104210

Incompatibility phenotypes are genetically controlled by a single, major gene designated S. Examples include the gametophytically controlled system of the Solanaceae and the sporophytic system that is characteristic of the Brassicaceae. in the species Brassica oleracea, a single highly polymorphic locus S determines both the incompatibility phenotype of pollen via expression in the diploid tapetum of the anthers and also that of the stigma papillae cells. The system would thus appear to be founded on a specialized form of cell-to-cell interaction between the surface of the pollen grain and that of the style. Any identity in expressed S alleles between these two partners results in a rapid and specific inhibition of self-pollen germination at the stigmatic surface.

Gene flow can be reliably modeled with an exponential probability density function; the mean of that distribution can vary with the spatial dispersion of plants. Two-dimensional arrays of plants had lower mean gene dispersal distance than did one-dimensional arrays. Degree of clumping and the size of patches of plants had no effect on gene flow, but there was an increase in mean gene dispersal distance with increased distance between clumps of plants, or between individual plants in one year.

Darwin proposed that such flower constancy occurs because flower handling methods learned on one plant species interfere with previously learned flower handling methods of other plant species. Darwin's interference hypothesis was tested by first allowing bumble bees, Bombus bimaculatus, to learn flower handling methods on one plant species (comfrey, Symphytum officinale), and then retesting the bees on comfrey after they had learned to handle flowers of a second species (vetch, Vicia cracca). The same experiment was repeated with different bees and with the order of the plant species reversed. Interference effects were detected by comparing flower access times (time to insert tongue into the flower) during the retesting period with the initial flower access times. Bees relearning handling methods for comfrey returned to their initial access times after one flower visit; bees relearning handling methods for vetch took two flower visits. The interference effects detected were 0·8 s for comfrey (a 47% increase over initial access times) and 2·0 s for vetch (a 120% increase). These results indicate that learning to handle flowers of one plant species does interfere with remembering previously learned flower handling methods. However, interference effects resulting from switches between comfrey and vetch under biologically realistic conditions appear to be relatively small, and are unlikely to account fully for flower constancy by bumble bees. © 1992 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027061733

Freshly harvested mutant seeds, in contrast to wild-type seeds, always readily germinate and even exhibit viviparous germination in overripe fruits. Crosses between mutant and wild-type and self-pollination of heterozygous plants show that in particular the ABA fraction of embryo and endosperm is decisive for the induction of dormancy. After-ripened wild-type seeds fully germinate in water but are more sensitive toward osmotic inhibition than mutant seeds. Germination of both wild-type and mutant seeds is equally sensitive toward inhibition by exogenous ABA. ABA content of mature wild-type seeds is about 10-fold the level found in mutant seeds. Nevertheless, it is argued that the differences in dormancy between the seeds of both genotypes are not a result of actual ABA levels in the mature seeds or fruits but a result of differences in ABA levels during seed development.

When 10% of a plant's leaf area was removed from single reproductive branches 3 mo before the main flowering season, those damaged braches grew less and produced 80% fewer viable seeds than did similar branches on control plants and plants that lost 10% of their leaf area, but with the losses scattered throughout the plant. Plants with damage concentrated on one reproductive branch grew less overall and produced fewer seeds than plants of the other two treatments. Thus, restricted movement of resources in P. arieianum following leaf damage to single reproductive branches resulted in decreased whole plant fitness. When this same experiment was conducted at the time of flowering, there were no differences among treatments in seed production or growth, either at the branch or plant level. Resources necessary for fruit production are thus accumulated before flowering and not subsequent to it. In 32% of plants in which damage was concentrated, seed production was reduced due to either abortion of the damaged branch (17%) or abortion of its bud inflorescences (15%). In the remaining 68% of branch-defoliated plants, neither level nor timing of flowering was affected by the experimental folivory, suggesting that reduction in seed production was due to a decrease in resource availability and not to a lack of pollinator visitation. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026471329

Hadena moths drink nectar from, pollinate, and oviposit into the flowers of the genus Silene. In the gynodioecious Silene vulgaris (Moench) Garcke (Caryophyllaceae), eggs were laid by Hadena confusa (Hufn.) females both in male phase flowers, which could not be pollinated by the moth at the time of oviposition, and in female phase and female flowers that allowed pollination. Flowers in which an egg had been laid had a lowered probability of receiving a second egg laid by another female during the same night. The degree of flower discrimination by the moth with respect to the presence of eggs was positively correlated with the proportion of flowers containing eggs. The oviposition behaviour of H.confusa is moulded by four factors: (1) a high probability of chosen male phase flowers later becoming pollinated by other moths, (2) the presence of conspecific eggs and risk for larval competition, (3) probability of presence of conspecific eggs also in neighbouring flowers, (4) capability of larvae to move to adjacent flowers.

Two hundred and seventy-three individuals were examined from 13 populations, of which ten were from a limited area in the northwest of Scotland, and one each from central Scotland, the south of England and Norway. Of the 12 enzymes studied, eight were polymorphic across the 13 populations: acid phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, ?-esterase, fluorescent esterase, malic enzyme, peroxidase, phosphoglucose isomerase and tetrazolium oxidase (equivalent to superoxide dismutase). The plants studied showed a high degree of variation. Fifty-eight multi-enzyme phenotypes, based on five enzymes, were distinguished, distributed across the 13 populations and the 263 individuals which could be analysed. Twenty (35%) of these phenotypes were represented by one individual and 36 (62%) phenotypes were restricted to one site. The two most frequent phenotypes were found in five sites and one of these was found in 21 individuals (8% of the plants studied). No population was encountered with a single multi-enzyme phenotype. Simpson's index of diversity (D) varied between 0.536 at the least variable site and 0.978 at the most variable site, with a mean of 0.792. Even for sites within one watershed, the variation was great; thus, for tetrazolium oxidase, plants at the head, middle and foot of the watershed comprised 96% Phenotype A, 100% Phenotype C and 100% Phenotype A, respectively. A cluster analysis of the populations based on the presence or absence of single- and multi-enzyme phenotypes revealed four clusters of varying composition separated at the 53% and 17% level, respectively, but these were not correlated with presence in a watershed, geographic distance or site alkalinity. The majority of the populations appeared to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for two loci (?-esterase-2 and tetrazolium oxidase-2), where analysis was possible, which suggests that sexual reproduction is common in these populations and that it occurs via random mating. Calculations for these loci using Wright's F statistics revealed that complete panmixia was not occurring (FIT = 0.498), largely because of genetic subdivisions between populations (FST = 0.469) rather than inbreeding within populations (FIS = 0.054). The possible reason for the high genetic variation uncovered here is discussed in terms of the stability of populations, frequency of the species in nearby sites, flowering frequency, pollination mechanism and the distribution of the species in different types of water body. The mitotic chromosome number was 2n = 14 for all the material studied. © 1992.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001915389

Vegetative and reproductive growth characteristics were investigated, and embryo development was observed with Nomarski's differential interference contrast (DIG) microscopy. In summer, under high temperatures and longer day?length, autumn?type varieties showed faster vegetative growth and later reproductive development as compared to summer?types. In the autumn, with generally good climatic condition for buckwheat growth in southern part of Japan, the embryo sacs and zygotes of both types developed normally. At 3 days after pollination (DAP), the embryos reached the globular stage. In summer, however, mostly abnormal embryo sacs were observed 3 DAP, leading to incomplete development, failure of fertilization or abortion of embryo. The abnormal embryo sacs were classified into 6 types. Abnormality of either type occurred in 91100 % of the tetraploids, which is higher than in the diploids (5077 %). The present study, conducted to clarify the factors causing low seed set in buckwheat under summer conditions, provides detailed information for further breeding of environment?tolerant buckwheat. Di?ploid genotypes which are less sensitive to unfavourable conditions and, thus, show more efficient fertilization in summer, should be considered for use as breeding material in buckwheat.

Agroinfection frequency was highest in the embryogenic line A188. All developmental stages tested showed Agrobacterium virulence gene-inducing activity, whereas bacteriocidal substances were produced at stages of the immature embryos competent for agroinfection.

The abundance of ACC synthase and EFE mRNAs increased and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase transcripts decreased concomitantly with the ethylene climacteric in senescing petals. The increase in abundance of ACC synthase and EFE mRNAs in aging flowers was prevented by treatment with the ethylene action inhibitor 2,5-norbornadiene. Furthermore, an increase in ACC synthase and EFE transcripts was detected in petals from presenescent flowers within 3 to 6 hours of exposure to 2 microliters per liter of ethylene. The increase in ethylene production by senescing petals was associated with a concomitant increase in ethylene biosynthesis in styles, ovary, and receptacle tissues. In all tissues, this increase was associated with increased activities of ACC synthase and EFE. The increase in EFE activities by all floral organs examined was correlated with increased abundance of EFE transcripts. In contrast, the level of ACC synthase mRNA, as detected by the cDNA probe pCARACC3, did not always reflect enzyme activity. The combined tissues of the pistil exhibited high rates of ACC synthase activity but contained low levels of ACC synthase mRNAs homologous to pCARACC3. In addition, pollinated styles exhibited a rapid increase in ethylene production and ACC synthase activity but did not accumulate detectable levels of ACC synthase mRNA until several hours after the initiation of ethylene production. These results suggest that transcripts for ACC synthase leading to the early postpollination increase in ACC synthase activity and ethylene production are substantially different from the mRNA for the ethylene-responsive gene represented by pCARACC3.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000601663

Microscopic examination of carpels from 0 to 28 days following floret maturity and pollination showed that 26-33% and 8-17% of the total seeds lost occurred within the first three days and the third through fifth day following pollination, respectively. Beyond this period occasional seed abortion was observed at all stages of seed development, but this represented a very small proportion (2-7%) of the total seeds lost. A stain clearing technique was used to examine the cytoplasmic state of the embryo sac in intact, unfertilized, mature ovules and embryos of the ovules at 3 and 5-day periods following pollination. It was found that 20-22% of unfertilized and matured ovules were sterile, suggesting that ovule degeneration before fertilization was the major cause for the high percentage of seeds lost within a 0 to 3-day period following pollination. Cytological observations revealed that abortion of developing seed was due to a sudden arrest in embryo growth and that the early development of the embryo of such aborting seed was normal.

Molec./Engenharia G., Universidade Estadual de Campinas, 13081 Campinas, SP, Brazil","Lysine-ketoglutaratc reductase catalyzes the first step of lysine catabolism in maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm. The enzyme condenses L-lysine and ?-ketoglutarate into saccharopine using NADPH as cofactor. It is endosperm-specific and has a temporal pattern of activity, increasing with the onset of kernel development, reaching a peak 20 to 25 days after pollination, and thereafter decreasing as the kernel approaches maturity. The enzyme was extracted from the developing maize endosperm and partially purified by ammonium-sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, and affinity chromatography on Blue-Sepharose CL-6B. The preparation obtained from affinity chromatography was enriched 275-fold and had a specific activity of 411 nanomoles per minute per milligram protein. The native and denaturated enzyme is a 140 kilodalton protein as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme showed specificity for its substrates and was not inhibited by either aminoethyl-cysteine or glutamate. Steady-state product-inhibition studies revealed that saccharopine was a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ?-ketoglutarate and a competitive inhibitor with respect to lysine. This is suggestive of a rapid equilibriumordered binding mechanism with a binding order of lysine, ?-ketoglutarate, NADPH. The enzyme activity was investigated in two maize inbred lines with homozygous normal and opaque-2 endosperms. The pattern of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase activity is coordinated with the rate of zein accumulation during endosperm development. A coordinated regulation of enzyme activity and zein accumulation was observed in the opaque-2 endosperm as the activity and zein levels were two to three times lower than in the normal endosperm. Enzyme extracted from L1038 normal and opaque-2 20 days after pollination was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Both genotypes showed a similar elution pattern with a single activity peak eluted at approximately 0.2 molar KCL. The molecular weight and physical properties of the normal and opaque-2 enzymes were essentially the same. We suggest that the Opaque-2 gene, which is a transactivator of the 22 kilodalton zein genes, may be involved in the regulation of the lysine-ketoglutarate reductase gene in maize endosperm. In addition, the decreased reductase activity caused by the opaque-2 mutation may explain, at least in part, the elevated concentration of lysine found in the opaque-2 endosperm.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000690359

These cells are devoted to the transport of the genetic information of the male to the embryo sac for fertilization. The structural characteristics of generative cells and male gametes in situ are investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), freeze fracture, and immunocytochemistry to observe the relationship among the different cells of the male gametophyte and the mechanism of their transmission in the pollen tube.

A novel factor, seed discounting (loss of outcrossing maternal fitness accompanying an increase in self-fertilization) is introduced, and pollen discounting is reformulated. The model incorporates the effects of five principal factors - the cost of meiosis, inbreeding depression, reproductive assurance, and seed and pollen discounting. Either complete cross- or self-fertilization is selected, depending on the values of the parameters, but a number of additional factors can lead to intermediate frequencies of self-fertilization. Specific conditions for the selection of each mode of chasmogamous self-pollination and the effects of some special circumstances are derived by substituting the appropriate values of seed and pollen discounting in the general model. Geitonogamy and facilitated selfing are primarily nonadaptive by-products of mechanisms for outcrossing. Delayed selfing is most advantageous, but competing and prior selfing may be selected when structural constraints prevent delayed selfing or the prepotency of outcrossed pollen reduces seed discounting. The model predicts environmental modification of the frequency of self-fertilization and can explain the observed associations between frequent self-fertilization and both the annual habitat and poor conditions for cross-pollination. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027028089

The spontaneous scf1 mutation described in this paper causes the stigma to be receptive to all pollen including selfpollen, but does not affect the pollination phenotype of the male gametophyte. In the stigmas of scf1 homozygotes, the S?locus?linked SLG gene and two other unlinked members of the S?multigene family, all of which encode secreted glycoproteins, are coordinately down?regulated at the RNA level, while the expression of the S?locus?derived SRK gene, which encodes a putative receptor protein kinase, is unaffected.

The breeding populations (BP) included open-pollinated (OP), control-pollinated (fullsib) and cloned open-pollinated BP; and the production populations included four different open-pollinated seedling and six clonal orchards, as well as two schemes of selecting clones for clonal forestry. Selection intensities (selection ratios) were chosen throughout to be practical and realistic. It was assumed that between-family selection ratios in the BP would be very low (two out of three families) to minimise reduction of effective population size. Gain from the OP BP was only slightly inferior to the full-sib BP under these constraints. Cloning the or BP with 4 and 10 ramets per clone and 10 clones per family resulted in gains that were considerably higher than from the seedling BPs with the same total number of trees per family. Among the production-population options the forwards selection clonal orchard with roguing showed high gains (but required an extra cycle of testing). The clonal orchard from backwards selection was even better, but with a still-longer cycle. A forwards selection clonal orchard that derived from clonal selection in the cloned OP BP gave higher gains than the equivalent forwards selection orchard, and converting the cloned BP gave a seed source of similar gain to the forwards-selection clonal orchard. The cloned BP could also form a source of clones for clonal forestry, and gains immediately available after bulking-up the best clones were higher than most seed-based options. An alternative method to produce clones for clonal forestry was by crossing the best forwards-selected clones from the BP, and gave highest gains but had a very long cycle. Comparative genetic gains from various breeding-population and production-population options were not very sensitive to heritability of the selection trait, from 0, 1 to 0, 4, though cloned options were most effective at low heritability. Combining cycle length and genetic gain as gain per year, showed highest values for the cloned BP, both for clone-within-family selection for the BP and also for clonal selection for clonal forestry, reflecting the high gains and short cycles of these options. Costs were sensitive to the number of plants involved in the tests. Highest gains % per year per dollar were found for the cloned breeding population with the lowest number of ramets per clone (four), both as a cloned OP breeding population and as clonal selection for clonal forestry. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001842757

These double-mutant seeds acquire only low levels of the major storage proteins and are deficient in several low mol wt polypeptides, both soluble and bound, and some of which are heat stable. A major heat-stable glycoprotein of more than 100 kilodaltons behaves similarly; during seed development, it shows a decrease in size associated with the abi3 mutation. In seeds of the double mutant from 14 to 20 days after pollination, the low amounts of various maturation-specific proteins disappear and many higher mol wt proteins similar to those occurring during germination are induced, but no visible germination is apparent. It appears that in the aba,abi3 double mutant seed development is not completed and the program for seed germination is initiated prematurely in the absence of substances protective against dehydration. Seeds may be made desiccation tolerant by watering the plants with the ABA analog LAB 173711 or by imbibition of isolated immature seeds, 11 to 15 days after pollination, with ABA and sucrose. Whereas sucrose stimulates germination and may protect dehydration-sensitive structures from desiccation damage, ABA inhibits precocious germination and is required to complete the program for seed maturation and the associated development of desiccation tolerance.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000308488

The influence of irrigation (at the rate of 1.1 cm week-1 during the growing season), nitrogen fertilization (at the rate of 113 kg ha-1 year-1, applied as NH4NO3 in two applications per year), site conditions (four blocks) and genetic stock (24 open-pollinated families) on productivity was assessed using a split-split plot test design with irrigation treatments as main plots, nitrogen treatments as sub-plots, and families as sub-sub-plots. After 3 years, the following observations were made. Growth of black locust was rapid during the study period, comparing favorably with hybrid poplars grown in other parts of the world. But, by the third year current annual increment was already declining in plots with the largest trees. Irrigation increased biomass production by about 80% in the first year, but the advantage dropped to 50% by the end of the third year. Nitrogen fertilization also increased biomass production, although by modest amounts in this nitrogen-fixing species - 30% in the first year, but only 12% by the end of the third year. The effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on biomass production were additive and resulted from increases in individual tree biomass; survival was unaffected by these treatments. Family differences in biomass production were large and uninfluenced by irrigation, nitrogen or block effects. From family selection alone, biomass productivity can be increased by more than 50%. Block differences in biomass yield were also large and appear to confirm numerous anecdotal reports that black locust growth is adversely affected where soil moisture, aeration and rootable depth are limited. Through 3 years of growth, biomass production of selected black locust families in the Piedmont of the southeastern USA is projected to range from about 8 to 3 Mg ha-1 year-1, depending on site and cultural conditions. © 1992.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027072782

All weedy populations exhibited high levels of genetic variation as determined by isozyme analysis. On average, 44% of the isozyme loci were polymorphic, total genetic diversity was 0.30; and number of alleles per locus was 1.65. High genetic identities, averaging 0.994 ± 0.005 between populations, indicated that little genetic differentiation has occurred among these weedy populations since the initial colonization. Lack of population differentiation could be attributed to a wind-pollinated, self-incompatible breeding system resulting in extensive gene flow among weedy populations, and between weedy populations and local cultivars of rye. Multilocus outcrossing rates of weedy populations ranged from 0.86 to 0.97. The estimated levels of gene flow using the private-alleles method were high among weedy populations, and between cv 'Merced' and weedy populations, with estimated Nm values of 14.50 and 8.21, respectively.

Calculations were applied to these data, aiming at minimum degrees of cross?incompatibility to be expected in different intercrosses, at different numbers of S?loci, with disomic and tetrasomic inheritance, the assumptions being maximal S?allele diversity for the parental plants, independent inheritance, and chromosome assortment being random. Irrespective of the presence of disomic or tetrasomic inheritance, a team of complementary 5?genes had to be assumed. The increased range of seed set of parental plants when they were pollinated by backcross plants favoured an interpretation implying tetrasomic inheritance with low degrees of chromatid assortment for S?loci, substantially reduced frequencies of compatible pollen being expected to effect reduced seed set. Most likely, a gametophytic complementary 5?gene system, similar to that in the closely related genus Ranunculus, is successfully operating in the tetrasomic state in Caltha palustris.

Two alternative directionality-generating mechanisms have been proposed: foragers may keep track of their arrival direction at a flower or cluster of flowers and prefer to depart in the same direction (arrival hypothesis), or they may show little change in orientation while foraging at a flower or flower cluster and prefer to depart in the direction they are last facing (last-faced hypothesis). Rotation of a flower or inflorescence while the forager is feeding on it will unequivocally distinguish the two hypothesis. Worker bumblebees (Bombus melanopygus and B. flavifrons) from captive colonies forage on a square grid of 25 artificial flowers. Bumblebees were able to keep track of their orientations on a flower relative to their arrival direction, and they choose to leave a flower in about the same direction as their arrival. Whether or not individual flowers or the whole flower patch was rotated 90° clockwise, departure directions were usually the same as arrival directions. Last-facing directions were better predictors of subsequent movements than were arrival direction, indicating that most compensation for experimentally- or self-imposed rotation while on a flower occurred before a bee left the flower. Directionality in foraging bumblebees is thus based on memory of arrival direction. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027040633

The numbers of species and individuals recorded decreased markedly with increasing altitude, with 63 species being observed regularly in the subalpine zone and 29 of these also occurring in the alpine zone. Bird populations showed a marked decline during autumn and winter, particularly after snow cover was established. All birds left the alpine zone for at least part of the winter period, and only six species remained throughout winter in the subalpine zone. Extensive snow-cover modified bird foraging be haviour by preventing feeding in the shrub layer and at ground level, thus restricting feeding to the trunks and foliage of snow gums and to the surface of the snow. This led to a reduction in bird diversity when compared to nearby snow-free montane habitats. In late winter and early spring an increase in arthropod fall-out on the remaining snow and flowering by the bird-pollinated shrub Grevillea victoriae, provided additional food for insectivorous birds and nectar feeders.

Growth of endosperm was accompanied by improved morphogenesis. In wheat × maize crosses, the rate of wheat haploid plant regeneration was improved by a 2,4-D treatment of florets 24 h after pollination. One wheat × maize plant regenerated contained a maize chromosome in the root meristems, but the maize chromosome or DNA were not found in the colchicine-doubled progeny. © 1992.",differentiation; embryo culture; morphogenesis; ovule culture; Triticum × Zea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000922017

Because the determination of apex development, however, requires a high degree of skill, the use of external macromorphological growth parameters of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to predict apex developmental stage was examined in this study. The growing degree days (GDD), growth period on days (DAY), number of leaves, number of surviving tillers, height of uppermost node, height of uppermost stipule and the length of ear primordium were used as growth parameters. Field trials were carried out as plot trials and on?farm trials in 1989?91. The growth parameters of three spring wheat cultivars and their ear developmental stages were determined at 2?3 day intervals after emergence to pollination in the plot trials. The relationship between the development of the ear and the growth parameters of each cultivar was studied using polynomial regression up to 3rd degree and stepwise regression analysis. The accuracy of the mathematical functions were tested against independent data determined from the farm trials. To get a reliable estimate of the apex developmental stage, DAY and GDD were found to be the most useful parameters. Furthermore, the growing time (maturation class) of a cultivar should be taken into a consideration. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

The percentage of polymorphic loci was 31.8 and the mean expected heterozygosity was 0.153. Segregation patterns for five polymorphic loci met Mendelian expectations. Outcrossing rates were estimated using single and multilocus methods, and in most cases were not statistically different from 1.0. An excess of heterozygotes, both for seeds and adults, was found, as shown by the fixation indices estimated in 1987 (mean F for adults = -0.41, mean F for seeds = -0.19). Low but significant levels of genetic differentiation were found, especially for adults (mean Fst for adults =0.040, mean Fst for seeds =0.009). There was a positive relationship for adults between trunk growth and an individuals heterozygosity. No significant correlation was found between heterozygosity and fecundity. The genetic structure of A. mexicanum appears to be the result of a balance between cross-pollination and long distance movement of pollen by pollinators (beetles) that reduce genetic differentiation among plots, and natural selection that could operate during the long life cycle of this palm, and may increase the genetic differentiation among sites and the proportion of heterozygotes. The relatively high level of genetic variation, low genetic spatial differentiation, excess of heterozygotes, high outcrossing rate and heterosis found in A. mexicanum seem to be common in tropical trees. These population genetics characteristics appear not to satisfy the conditions necessary for non-adaptive evolution, a hypothesis commonly invoked to explain high tropical tree diversity. Management and conservation strategies aimed at preserving tropical trees high intrapopulation genetic variation will probably require the maintenance of large tree populations. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Astrocaryum mexicanum; Genetic structure; Heterosis; Mating systems; Palm; Tropical rain forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027044501

B., 1992. Seed cone and ovule ontogeny in Metasequoia, Sequoia and Sequoiadendron (TaxodiaceaeConiferales). Structural features of seed cones, up to the initiation of ovules, are developed in the three genera in the summer and late fall prior to pollination in the following spring, when cones renew their further development. Bracts are initiated in a decussate manner in Metasequoia but spirally in Sequoia and Sequoiadendron. No ovuliferous scale is initiated, at most there is a shallow mound of tissue on the adaxial surface of the bract from which the ovules are developed. Metasequoia produces a single series of up to eight ovules in acropetal (centripetal order), Sequoia and Sequoiadendron produce a double series of six to nine ovules, also in acropetal order, since a second series of ovules appear distal to and alternate with the first series. Common features that unite the genera are the somewhat peltate configuration of the cone scales due to late intercalary expansion, the derivation of the vascular supply to the bract?ovule complex from a single bundle and the usual inversion of the seed during late development, to which can be added developmental features. The absence of tooth?like structures, present in some other Taxodiaceae, is discussed in relation to cone evolution in the family being determined by changes in developmental timing. Emphasis is made on the way in which features of morphogenesis, determine cone organization in the three genera independent of an interpretation that relies solely on hypothetical ancestral forms.

N1C 2W1, Canada","During tomato seed development the endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) concentration peaks at about 50 d after pollination (DAP) and then declines at later stages (60-70 DAP) of maturation. The ABA concentration in the sheath tissue immediately surrounding the seed increases with time of development, whereas that of the locule declines. The water contents of the seed and fruit tissues are similar during early development (20-30 DAP), but decline in the seed tissues between 30 and 40 DAP. The water potential and the osmotic potential of the embryo are lower than that of the locular tissue after 35 DAP also. Seeds removed from the fruit at 30, 35, and 60 DAP and placed ex situ on 35 and 60 DAP sheath and locular tissue are prevented from germinating. Development of 30 DAP seeds is maintained or promoted by the ex situ fruit tissue with which they are in contact. Their germination is inhibited until subsequent transfer to water, and germination is normal, i.e. by radicle protrusion, and viable seedlings are produced, compared with 30 DAP seeds transferred directly to water; more of these seeds germinate, but by hypocotyl extension, and seedling viability is very poor. Isolated seeds at 35 and 60 DAP re-placed in contact with fruit tissues only germinate when transferred to water after 7 d. At 30 DAP, isolated seeds are insensitive to ABA at physiological concentrations in that they germinate as if on water, albeit by hypocotyl extension. At higher concentrations germination occurs by radicle protrusion. Osmoticum prevents germination, but there is some recovery upon subsequent transfer to water. Seeds at 35 DAP are very sensitive to ABA and exhibit little or no germination, even upon transfer to water. The response of the isolated seeds to osmoticum more closely approximates that to incubation on the ex situ fruit tissues than does their response to ABA. This is also the case for isolated 60 DAP seeds, whose germination is not prevented by ABA, but only by the osmoticum; these seeds are inhibited when in contact with ex situ fruit tissues also. It is proposed that the osmotic environment within the tissues of the tomato fruit plays a greater role than endogenous ABA in preventing precocious germination of the developing seeds.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005655078

Thin-layer chromatography and depletion of phenolic substances by Dowex treatment indicated that flavonols are present in the diffusate and may be the active compounds. When added to the germination medium, flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin) but not other flavonoids strongly promoted pollen germination frequency and pollen tube growth in vitro.

Incomplete elimination of barley chromosomes occurred in crosses with T. aestivum. The degree of elimination varied with the wheat genotype and accounted for up to a maximum of 30 % of produced hybrid plants. The other plants were eu? or hypohaploid wheats (e.g., lacking chromosome 1B or 3A). Isoenzyme analysis of plants of the first backcross generation with wheat marked, in single plants, the meiotic transmission of added barley chromosomes from primary hybrids. Usability of this system of crossing the tetraploid H. bulbosum x H. vulgare hybrid with wheat is discussed with regard to genetic introgression and haploid production in wheat.

Two methods recently developed in our laboratory were applied for detection of the enzyme using light microscopy (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the first case, paraffin-embedded sections were sequentially incubated with a monoclonal anti-myrosinase antibody and with peroxidase- and fluorescein- isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. For the TEM localization a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit against a highly purified myrosinase from white mustard was used.

In the early stages of development, typical embryonic myrosinase cells could not be detected. Later they appear in cotyledons, hypocotyls, and radicles. A typical, specific, and positive LM localization of myrosinase in myrosin cells could be detected both in radicles and the cotyledons. In the radicle the positively identified cells are located in the second outermost cell layer in the peripheral cortex; in the cotyledon positively identified myrosin cells were found scattered around in the tissue.

Heterochrony, or a simple change in the absolute timing or rate of developmental events, is proposed as the evolutionary mechanism underlying the origin of the small, self?pollinating flowers from their large, outcrossing progenitors. Inflorescence growth in two autogamous populations and their related outcrossing progenitors was studied to provide the temporal data necessary for testing the hypothesis of heterochrony. All four races showed significant variation in the growth and mature length of inflorescence organs. Inflorescences of selfing races were smaller, and had slower relative growth rates and a two?fold increase in the plastochron relative to outcrossing populations. The large?flowered races were both significantly protandrous. A more detailed growth analysis of flower development in two races indicated that the selfing flowers develop at a slower rate and for a longer duration relative to outcrossing flowers. The implications of these temporal changes in floral ontogeny for the heterochronic origin of self?pollinating floral forms are considered. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

Self?incompatibility is a genetically based system which prevents self?fertilization and thereby promotes outbreeding in plants. Pollen bearing an S?allele identical to either of the S?alleles in the female sporophytic tissues is rejected. Several S?allele?specific style glycoproteins have been isolated from Solanaceous species. All have ribonuclease activity and are termed S?RNases. The cDNA clones encoding N. alata S?RNases have been used in in situ hybridization experiments which show that the genes are expressed in the transmitting tract of the style and in the epidermis of the placenta. Immunocyto?chemistry using an antibody to S2?RNase demonstrates extracellular accumulation of the enzyme in the same tissues. These tissues are the pathway through which pollen tubes must grow to reach the ovules. The microscopy data are congruent with a model in which self?pollenation is susceptible to an allele?specific cytotoxin produced by the sporophyte. 1992 Blackwell Science Ltd,immuno?cytochemistry; in situ hybridization; Nicotiana alata; pollination; Self?incompatibility; S?RNases,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026525799

In all three populations, selfing had nonsignificant effects on the number and size of seeds. Lobelia siphilitica and one population of L. cardinalis exhibited significant levels of inbreeding depression between seed maturation and germination, excluding the consideration of possible differences in dormancy or longterm viability in the soil. There was no inbreeding depression in subsequent survival in any population. In the field, significant survival differences between selfed and outcrossed progeny occurred only in two years and in only one population of L. cardinalis. For both survival and fertility there was little evidence for the expected differences among families in inbreeding depression. Compared to survival, inbreeding depression in fertility (flower number) tended to be much higher. By first-year flower production, the combined effects on survival and flower number caused inbreeding depression in net fertility to reach 54%, 34% and 71% for L. siphilitica and the two populations of L. cardinalis. By the end of the second year of flowering in the field, inbreeding depression net fertility was 53% for L. siphilitica and 54% for one population of L. cardinalis. For the other population of L. cardinalis, these values were 76% through the second year of flowering and 83% through the third year. Such high levels of inbreeding depression should strongly influence selection on those characters affecting self-fertilization rates in these two species. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026540384

Enhanced photosynthetic flux was detected following pollination, suggesting utilization of the additional respired bicarbonate and underlining metabolic interactions between the style and the elongating pollen tube.

Willd. in Denmark. Gene flow was studied by direct methods using seed and pollen dispersal distances. Pollen flow in four experimental populations, where honey-bees were pollinators, surpassed the diameter of each experimental population. Seed dispersal was restricted and was used to partition a coastal grassland population into local populations. The structure of this population was analysed with a population genetic model that formulated a sequence of hypotheses about the action of natural selection and the geographical subdivision of the total population into local populations. The variation at a morphological marker locus was used for this purpose: the presence of hairs on the flower stalk in this species is determined by a dominant allele. The estimated pollen pools in the six local populations were homogeneous, and there was no evidence of deviation from random mating in any of the local populations. The genotypic distributions were homogeneous in the local populations and accorded with Hardy-Weinberg proportions. There was no evidence of selection at the studied locus, accordingly, the studied population was panmictic and its genotypic distribution could be described with a single parameter, the allele frequency at the marker locus. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Armeria maritima; Gene flow; Population structure; Seed and pollen dispersal; Selection components,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009972670

Floral colour change was first noted almost 200 years ago1 and is known in a variety of species2-17, but the prevalence and significance of the phenomenon have gone largely unrecognized. I find that retention of older flowers increases a plant's attractiveness to pollinators from a distance, that pollinators discriminate between floral colour phases at close range, and that the discrimination involves learning.

The seed does not undergo maturation drying. Protein content during seed development peaks at 35 DAP in the embryo, while in the endosperm it exhibits a triphasic accumulation pattern. Peaks in endosperm protein deposition correspond to changes in endosperm morphology (i.e. formation of the hard endosperm) and are largely the consequence of increases in storage proteins. Storage-protein deposition commences at 20 DAP in the embryo and endosperm; both tissues accumulate identical proteins. Embryo maturation is complete by 40 DAP, when maximum embryo protein content, size and seed dry weight are attained. Seeds are tolerant of premature drying (fast and slow drying) from 40 DAP. Thirty-and 35-DAP seeds when removed from the fruit tissue and imbibed on water, complete germination by 120 h after isolation. Only seeds which have developed to 35 DAP produce viable seedlings. The inability of isolated 30-DAP seed to form viable seedlings appears to be related to a lack of stored nutrients, since the germinability of excised embryos (20 DAP and onwards) placed on Murashige and Skoog (1962, Physiol. Plant. 15, 473-497) medium is high. The switch from a developmental to germinative mode in the excised 30- and 35-DAP imbibed seeds is reflected in the pattern of in-vivo protein synthesis. Developmental and germinative proteins are present in the embryo and endosperm of the 30- and 35-DAP seeds 12 h after their isolation from the fruit. The mature seed (60 DAP) exhibits germinative protein synthesis from the earliest time of imbibition.

I report here that removal of nectar from flowers of Christmas bells (Blandfordia nobilis) increased the plant's net nectar production but reduced its ability to produce seeds. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration that nectar production entails a cost to a plant in terms of growth and/or reproduction and that both the gains and costs associated with nectar production may be estimated in the same 'currency' (seeds). As a plant's nectar production increases, there should therefore be a trade-off between pollinator-mediated increases in numbers of fertilized seeds1-3 and decreases in seed number due to the costs of producing the nectar. © 1991 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025953163

In natural populations of plants, pollinators often deposit mixtures of 'surplus' pollen from several individuals onto receptive stigmas4-7. Therefore within-flower competition among pollen-tubes for ovules could lead to nonrandom paternal success. We found that pollen competition was common in populations of wild rose mallow (Hibiscus moscheutos). Co-occurring individuals often differed in mean pollen-tube growth rates, and this trait was correlated with the number of seeds the plants sired when pollen mixtures were applied to stigmas. Differences between pairs of individuals in pollen-tube growth rates were consistent across maternal plants, suggesting that sexual selection can occur.

Low N resulted in smaller seedling size, but relatively more biomass was allocated to roots than under the high N condition. N stress generally favored biomass allocation to roots at the expense of needles or both needles and stem. Relative allocation of biomass to roots was significantly different among families with low N but not with high N. Larger seedlings exhibited greater allocation to roots possibly as a result of greater N stress. Different patterns of biomass allocation among loblolly pine families were related to their stem weight and height.

The fresh weight of ovaries increased 100% within 48 h after pollination, but did not change significantly in the absence of pollination. While sugar content per ovary increased after pollination, sugar content per mg protein was unaffected. Sucrose was not detected in nonpollinated ovaries 48 h after anthesis. Free IAA content was highest in ovaries sampled 48h before anthesis. Pollination had no immediate effect on IAA content per mg protein in postanthesis ovaries. Although detected in all ovaries sampled, ethylene production increased significantly only in nonpollinated ovaries. Activity of sucrose-phosphate synthase was the same at all stages. The specific activities of sucrose synthase and the invertases were highest in nonpollinated ovaries. The increase in rate of sugar import into ovaries following pollination was not accompanied by an increase in the specific activity of any enzyme assayed, but was coincident with an increase in the total activity per ovary of surcose synthase and acid invertase. There appears to be no direct relationship between sucrose-metabolizing enzymes, IAA or ethylene in developing pollinated ovaries but the increase in sucrose cleavage activity in nonpollinated ovaries may be related to the increase in ethylene production. © 1991 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000564774

Large annual fluctuations in the production rates of male and female inflorescences were recognized, whereas their annual trends were synchronized with each other.

F. crenata was the lowest producer of pollen among seven tree species studied: the number of pollen grains equivalent to a single ovule was in the range 6.0-14×104. Furthermore, the mean dry weight of a single pollen grain (3.77×10-5mg) was higher than for wind-pollinated species. Three factors seemed to cause the low seed fertility of F. crenata.

This allele was cloned and found to contain a 30-bp deletion within the gene and additional lesions upstream of the transcription start site. Using fine structure genetic mapping, we determined that the deletion is responsible for the mutant phenotype. In addition, the position of wx1240 on the genetic map coincided with the previously determined positions of two other waxy mutations, the spontaneous wx-C, which is reference allele, and the putative ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced wx-BL2. Molecular analysis of these alleles revealed that both contain the same deletion as wx1240, and that the wx-BL2 allele is similar to wx-C and possibly resulted from wx-C contamination. The deleted sequence responsible for these mutations is flanked by a short, 4-bp, direct repeat. Similar structures are favored sites for spontaneous deletions in other organisms.

The nucleotide sequences of genomic DNA and of cDNAs corresponding to SRK predict a putative transmembrane receptor having serine/threonine-specific protein kinase activity. Its extracellular domain exhibits striking homology to the secreted product of the S-locus glycoprotein (SLG) gene and is connected via a single pass transmembrane domain to a protein kinase catalytic center. SRK alleles derived from different S-locus genotypes are highly polymorphic and have apparently evolved in unison with genetically linked alleles of SLG.

This paper reports the effects of variation in floral display on the visitation behaviour of this species' pollinators (mainly pollen-collecting solitary bees) in several natural and three experimental plant populations, and discusses the results in terms of the consequences for plant fitness. The working hypotheses were: (1) that because female plants do not produce pollen, pollen-collecting insects would visit hermaphrodite plants at a higher rate than female plants and would visit more flowers per hermaphrodite than per female; and (2) that pollinator arrival rate would increase with flower size and flower number, the two main components of visual display. These hypotheses were generally supported, but the effects of floral display on pollinator visitation varied substantially among plant populations. Hermaphrodites received significantly higher rates of pollinator arrivals and significantly higher rates of visits to flowers than did females in all experimental populations. Flower size affected arrival rate and flower visit rate positively in natural populations and in two of the three experimental populations. The flower size effect was significant only among female plants in one experimental population, and only among hermaphrodites in another. The effect of flower number on arrival rate was positive and highly significant in natural populations and in all experimental populations. In two out of three experimental populations, insects visited significantly more flowers per hermaphrodite than per female and visited more flowers on many-flowered plants than on few-flowered plants, but neither effect was detected in the third experimental population. Because seed production is not pollen-limited in this species, variation in pollinator visitation behaviour should mainly affect the male reproductive success of hermaphrodite plants. These findings suggest that pollinator-mediated natural selection for floral display in P. linearis varies in space and time. © 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",gynodioecy; Hydrophyllaceae; Phacelia linearis; Pollination; solitary bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026339582

During a 3-day culture period in a liquid medium containing pyrimidine nucleosides these microspores develop into young pollen grains to the stage of starch deposition. Pollen maturation and transition to dormancy is achieved during a further 2- to 3-day culture period in the same medium stepwise supplemented by a concentrated solution of sucrose and l-proline. Upon transfer of the pollen to a simple germination medium containing sucrose and boric acid, up to 40% of the grains were observed to produce relatively long tubes. The in vitro-matured pollen grains can be stored at-20° C either suspended in 1.17 M sucrose and 100 m Ml-proline or separated from the medium on filter paper discs. The stored pollen germinated both in vitro and on the stigma, the pollen tubes grew through the style into the ovary and pollination produced up to 300 viable seeds per pod.

Peak stigma receptivity as measured by pollen germination was recorded at 3 d after anthesis and maximum production of stigmatic exudate at 6 d. Pollen tubes reached the base of the style by 6 d after pollination. A 5 × 5 diallel experiment was conducted and the results measured by pollen tube growth. Self-pollinations generally resulted in poorer tube growth than crosses and there was significant specific and general combining ability as well as reciprocal effects. Cross-pollination resulted in improved fruit set and seed to flower ratio over both selfing and open pollination. Spatial limitations to fertility due to infructescence size were also recorded, but the combination of outcrossing mechanisms and spatial limitation did not entirely account for the low fertility.

Irradiated (cobalt60,100 krad) kanamycinresistant Petunia hybrida mesophyll protoplasts were chemically fused with wild-type mesophyll protoplasts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Eighty-six hybrid colonies were selected on kanamycin-containing medium, and twenty-four of these could be induced to regenerate numerous shoots. Cytological analysis of the regenerants showed the presence of a few chromosome fragments in some lines, and even a metacentric chromosome in yet another line. Besides additional chromosome fragments some lines only possessed typical Nicotiana chromosomes, and this at the diploid (2n = 2X = 20) as well as the tetraploid (2n = 2X = 40) level. Biochemical analysis showed that all regenerants had neomycin phosphotransferase activity (NPTII), which suggests that intergenomic recombination and or translocation events took place at least in those lines where no additional chromosome fragments could be detected. The presence of the NPTII gene was shown by Southern hybridization. All regenerants tested were fertile, and the segregation ratios for the kanamycin gene (for self and backcross pollinations to the recipient partner) for some of the regenerants correspond with Mendelian rules for a monogenic dominant marker.

We quantified the impact that a cynipid gall wasp, Antistrophus silphii, had on growth, reproduction, and biomass allocation patterns of Silphium integrifolium growing in the tallgrass prairie of northeastern Kansas. Experimentally galled individual Silphium shoots (ramets) had reduced shoot growth, leaf and flower head production, and delayed flowering compared to gall-free control shoots. Gall formation completely halted normal apical growth in 65% of the shoots. Galling did not affect individual flower head weight, the numbers of achenes per flower head or achene weight. Silphium plants (genets) with a high proportion of galled shoots had lower total biomass, a lower proportion of total biomass allocated to flower heads, higher allocation to leaves, but no change in allocation to stems or rhizome. High gall densities reduced the number of flower heads per plant and shortened the time between flower head initiation and maturity. An adaptive interpretation of these results would be that the survivorship and future performance of galled Silphium may be promoted by maintaining allocation to rhizome. However, reduced shoot growth and delayed reproduction in galled Silphium may weaken its competitive ability and reduce pollination success, so that any adaptive advantage to Silphium's allocation responses to galls may be outweighed by disadvantages from its growth and flowering phenology responses. We conclude that a more parsimonious interpretation of these results is that gall-induced allocation changes are due to architectural constraints placed by galls on meristem activity, rather than to any adaptive response on the part of the plant. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Allocation; Gall insect; Life history; Plant insect interactions; Silphium integrifolium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026296776

Both types of intergeneric hybrids display pollen sterility, but workable ovule fertility. Unilateral incompatibility prevents their direct hybridization with staminate L. esculentum. Pollen of a self-compattible form of the related wild species L. pennellii is compatible with pistils of L. esculentum x S. lycopersicoides hybrids. This trait was backcrossed from L. pennellii to L. esculentum in order to develop bridging lines that could be used to obtain progeny from the intergeneric hybrids and to study the inheritance of bridging ability. In progeny of L. esculentum x S. lycopersicoides hybrids pollinated with L. pennellii-derived bridging lines, preferential transmission of L. pennellii alleles was observed for certain isozyme and RFLP markers on chromosomes 1, 6 and 10. The skewed segregations suggest linkage to three major pollen-expressed compatibility loci. This was confirmed by observations of pollen tube growth, which indicated that compatibility with pistils of the diploid intergeneric hybrid occurred only in bridging lines at least heterozygous for the L. pennellii markers on chromosomes 1, 6 and 10. Compatibility with the sesquidiploid hybrid required only the chromosome 1 and 6 loci, indicating an apparent effect of gene dosage on expression of incompatibility in the pistil. In an F2L. esculentum x L. pennellii population, preferential transmission of L. pennellii alleles was observed for the same markers on chromosomes 1 and 10, as well as other markers on chromosomes 3, 11, and 12, but not 6.

The objective of this study was to identify the number of loci in a maize (Zea mays L.) population segregating for tolerance to low-P stress, their approximate location, and the magnitude of their effect. Seventy-seven restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were identified and scored in a maize F2 population derived from a cross between line NY821 and line H99. The F2 individuals were self-pollinated to produce F3 families. Ninety F3 families were grown in a sand-alumina system, which simulated diffusion-limited, low-P soil conditions. The F3 families were evaluated for vegetative growth in a controlled-environment experiment. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying tolerance to low-P stress, the mean phenotypic performances of the F3 families were contrasted based on genotypic classification at each of 77 RFLP marker loci. Six RFLP marker loci were significantly associated with performance under low-P stress (P&lt;0.01). One marker locus accounted for 25% of the total phenotypic variation. Additive gene action was predominant for all of the QTLs identified. Significant marker loci were located on four separate chromosomes representing five unlinked genomic regions. Two marker loci were associated with an additive by additive epistatic interaction.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of an F2 population shows that the variant is not linked to the three known Gpc genes. However, this trait is linked to one of two genomic DNA fragments that hybridize to a fragment of the Gpc3 coding region, implying the existence of a fourth Gpc gene. Antibodies and cDNA clones were used to investigate the organ-specific expression of the Gpc genes. Results were compared with the expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (Adh1) gene. RNA and protein levels were examined in seedling roots and shoots, as well as the leaves, developing endosperm and embryo, and the aleurone. In general, it was found that Gpc3 expression behaves in parallel with Adh1 in these organs, and protein levels closely parallel that of RNA for each gene examined. Both Gpc3 and Adh1 show a marked increase in expression during endosperm development, reaching a maximum 15 days after pollination, but no expression is detected in the leaf. Gpc1 expression is similar to that of Gpc2, with an overall decrease in the level of RNA during endosperm development.

Cytological analysis revealed that functional 2n megaspores produced by normal and desynaptic clones originate exclusively from 'second division restitution (SDR)' and 'first division restitution (FDR)', respectively. SDR 2n megaspores resulted from the omission of the second meiotic division following chromosome doubling after anaphase I, whereas FDR 2n megaspores resulted from a direct equational division of univalent chromosomes at anaphase I (pseudohomotypic division). Comparative data strongly indicated that the observed mechanisms of SDR and FDR 2n megaspore formation are extremes of a continuum that is being brought about by common genes for precocious chromosome division. Depending on the relative timing of cell cycle and chromosome division, this precocious chromosome division may impose postreductional (SDR) or prereductional (FDR) 'restitution' of the sporophytic chromosome number under normal synaptic and desynaptic conditions, respectively. The observed frequencies of 2n megaspores closely correlated with seed set, following pollination by tetraploid varieties and by desynaptic diploid clones with exclusive FDR 2n pollen formation. Up to 54.0 and 21.5 seeds/ fruit were obtained from normal synaptic (SDR) and desynaptic (FDR) progeny, respectively. The high frequency of segregants with either SDR or FDR 2n megaspore formation (78.0 and 45.2%, respectively) supports the hypothesis that sexual polyploidization is the driving force behind the origin and evolution of polyploid Solanum species. The present identification of diploid potato clones with consistent FDR 2n megaspore formation extends the opportunities for direct transfer of enhanced diploid germ plasm to tetraploids, and particularly advocates the feasibility of 2x(ds-1; FDR)×2x(ds-1; FDR) breeding schemes in cultivar development and the production of relatively vigorous and uniform true potato seed (TPS) varieties.

Since dihaploids are thought to develop parthenogenetically from unfertilized ovules they were expected to be euploid (2n = 24), but somatic chromosome counts showed that 15 of the 17 dihaploids were aneusomatic. Ten of the clones were predominantly diploid (2n = 24) with a proportion of hyperploid cells that contained 25 or 26 chromosomes. Five of the dihaploids contained variable numbers of triploid cells (2n = 36). RFLP analysis was used to determine whether the additional chromosomes were from S. phureja or S. tuberosum. Unique hybridizing fragments present in S. phureja but not in 'Pentland Crown' were identified. These S. phureja-specific restriction fragments were present in some of the dihaploid offspring of 'Pentland Crown'. Of the 5 clones that contained triploid cells 4 had S. phureja type banding. Four of the 10 aneusomatic clones that contained hyperploid cells had the unique S. phureja hybridizing fragments. We propose that ovules of 'Pentland Crown' were fertilized by pollen from S. phureja and that the aneusomatic clones were derived from triploid zygotes from which some of the S. phureja chromosomes were eliminated.

Frequencies of captured pollen grains of Parthenium hysterophorus, Ambrosia and allied genera, Helianthus, and other Asteraceae were examined. Asteraceous aerospora in 1988 accounted for 22.1% of all pollen found, of which 83.4% were pollen of Ambrosia, 12.4% of Parthenium, and the remainder (4.1%) representative of other genera. Capture of native Ambrosia species and P. hysterophorus peaked in September and October in 1987 and 1988, but Parthenium pollen was also found year round with a smaller secondary peak during May, 1988 and 1989. In the winter a different Ambrosia pollen was captured which compared with A. hispida found in the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida at a time when no ragweed was flowering in the vicinity of Corpus Christi. Such a pollen capture probably represents long distance dispersal (ca. 600 miles, 965 km) on strong easterly to southerly prevailing winds. Pollen capture occurred most frequently during daylight hours when percent relative humidity was lower and near midnight when inversions occur. Comparison of pollen capture with meteorologic data demonstrated that photoperiodic responses probably account for the initiation and termination of Ambrosia flowering, and to some extent that of Parthenium, and not sharply lowered temperatures or frost for ending pollen release. Previous plant surveys have shown that P. hysterophorus is more common in the Corpus Christi area than species of Ambrosia, or any other Asteraceae, even though ragweed pollen capture proved 6.9 times greater. This disparity is most likely due to limited long distance dispersal of Parthenium pollen, less pollen produced per anther, and a less developed mechanism of wind pollination (passive dispersal or amphiphilous). Since both Parthenium and Ambrosia are significant allergenic plants, correlations between airborne pollen of Parthenium and allergic potential suggest that a prolonged pollination season and perhaps increased allergenicity of unique Parthenium pollen proteins allow Parthenium to be a major allergen despite significantly less ambient pollen.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025733783

Observations were made in the Caatinga formation of Pernambuco, NE. Brazil, on four synchronopatric species. These differ in sizes and structural details of the corolla, level of flower exposition, and habitat preferences. All legitimate visitors were Centris spp. (Anthophoridae):Angelonia hirta was mainly pollinated by C. fuscata and A. pubescens by C. hyptidis; A. bisaccata and A. hookeriana shared an unidentified species. Several exomalopsine, tetrapediine and meliponid bees exploit the flowers less descriminately for oil or pollen, respectively, without regularly contacting anthers and stigma. The flowers are protandrous, and are self-incompatible except those of the annual A. pubescens. After alighting, the Centris bees introduce their front legs simultaneously into each of the pouches and start alternate collecting movements to gather the oil from the trichome elaiophores. While doing so, they are forced by projections of the corolla floor to press their head under the anthers and stigma, whereby pollen is transferred with their frons or clypeus. On account of their collector type and behaviour, C. fuscata and C. spec. are not specialized to Angelonia but may equally exploit other nonrelated taxa for oil, whereas C. hyptidis exhibits oligolecty on A. pubescens. It possesses relatively elongate forelegs with padlike collectors suitable for sweeping the lipids from the scattered glandular hairs inside the divergent spurs of its host. It is the only species that also collects pollen (by buzzing) from the oil host. A. hirta and relatives, provided with dense elaiophore carpets, are, for their part, adapted to ""scraping""Centris species with typical oil collectors. Flower and bee phenologies, although largely dependent on the irregular rainfalls, are not always coincident. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Angelonia; Angiosperms; Anthophoridae; Centris; Oil flowers; pollination; Scrophulariaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000489913

Pollinaria removal and insertion by the insect pollinator is aided by various structural devices such as hairs or corona elements guiding the proboscis towards the entrance of the anther slit. The nectary is situated directly below this opening, thus increasing the probability of the proboscis being introduced into the anther slit during retraction. The anther slit itself often displays structural differentiation in adaptation to the guiding of the proboscis and the insertion of a pollinium in cross pollination. These mechanisms are highly elaborated so that they work as well in closed flower types, in which the pollinator does not enter the flower directly, but only introduces its proboscis (Sisyranthus, Microloma). A special feature of pollinaria removal is the variety of ways of fixing the corpusculum against the force of the proboscis when it is drawn into the cleft. - The stigma of all species except Secamone is located on the lower surface of the stigma head where it is appressed to the filament tube. In some cases a direct contact of the inserted pollinium with the stigmatic surface does not seem to be necessary for pollen tube germination, probably moistening by nectar suffices in these flowers. With Tylophora spec., a case of in situ pollen tube germination has been studied. - Concerning the path of the pollen tubes, two different strategies are followed. Secamone and Tylophora develop a structurally defined compitum, while the other five species have strictly divided stylar canals. In these higher evolved species, the pollen tubes of one inserted pollinium are all directed into one ovary only, thus enabling the plant to allocate its resources to one carpel only in the frequent case of fertilization by one pollinium. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Asclepiadaceae; autogamy; floral biology; floral structures; Pollination ultrastructure; tube germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000818926

Evidence in support of this thesis, derived from a number of different investigations, is presented in this paper.-Strong evidence comes from a controlled pollination study of the two supposed parental species, P. kawakamii and P. fortunei. F1 seedlings, derived from reciprocal crosses between the suspected parents, exhibited identical banding patterns for a number of enzymes (such as SKDH, GOT, and IDH) with P. taiwaniana, when separated by electrophoresis. Furthermore, comparative morphological studies of trichomes and wood parenchyma patterns between the purported parents and P. taiwaniana reveal that this latter qualitatively exhibits characteristics that combine features of both of the suspected parental types. Biochemically, eight enzyme systems were compared in the three species here under discussion, and, without exception, the electrophoretic banding patterns exhibited by P. taiwaniana represented a combination of the alleles of the other two species. Perhaps the most convincing evidence comes from a genetic analysis of the progeny obtained by selfing P. taiwaniana. Genotypic segregation of the offspring based on a single locus each of SKDH and PGI fit the 1:2:1 hypothesis. Genotypic segregation of the offspring based on two loci each of SP and GOT fit the ratio of 3:6:3:1:2:1. This, taken in conjunction with the other data presented, clearly suggests that P. taiwaniana is a hybrid involving P. kawakamii and P. fortunei. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Flora of Taiwan; genetic analyses; inflorescence grafting; Isozymes; morphology; P. fortunei; P. kawakamii; Paulownia taiwaniana; Scrophulariaceae; trichomes; wood anatomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249925522

Using a band-shift assay, we identified two distinct protein factors, alpha-1 and beta-1, that interacted specifically with alpha- and beta-zein gene promoter regions, respectively. Alpha-1 was present in nuclei from both endosperm and seedling tissue, whereas beta-1 was found only in nuclei from developing endosperm tissue. Mixing of nuclear extracts demonstrated that seedling tissue contained undetectable amounts of beta-1, rather than having an inhibitor for formation of the beta-1/DNA complex. Chemical footprinting analysis localized the beta-1 recognition site to a 22 bp sequence flanked by CCAT and TATA boxes. The apparent molecular mass of beta-1 was determined to be 29 kDa by southwestern blotting. Based on in vitro binding assays, the greatest concentration of the beta-1 in endosperm nuclei is at 16 days after pollination, which coincides with the time of highest transcriptional activity of the beta-zein gene. These results suggest that beta-1 may act as a tissue-specific, trans-acting regulator of the expression of the beta-zein gene in developing maize endosperm. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",DNA-binding proteins; in vitro binding assay; promoters; tissue-specific binding; transcription factor; zeins,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026230175

For example, a lack of genetic variation within marginal populations of an introduced species may slow its rate of spread into new habitats. In a glasshouse study, we examined the phenotypic variation among populations, among families, within families, and the homogeneity of variances within families for morphological and life history characters of an alien, self-pollinating annual grass, Bromus tectorum. The populations of B. tectorum studied were collected from both large, central populations in steppe habitats and small, peripheral populations in forest sites along a broad temperature-moisture gradient in western North America. Most variation in average flowering time was due to differences among seed source populations; among family variation contributed less than 20% to the total variance for flowering time. Populations from arid steppe habitats were the earliest flowering while the population from the most mesic forest habitat was last to flower. In contrast, the within-family variance was a major contributor to the total variance for plant dry weight, seed number per plant, total seed weight, and individual seed weight. The amount of total variation explained by among-family differences ranged between 18% for average seed weight to 30% for total plant dry weight. There was no consistent difference in within-population genetic variability between large, central populations in steppe habitats and smaller, potentially more isolated populations in forest habitats. Significant heterogeneity in within-family variance in some of the source populations suggest that families differ in the capacity for phenotypic response to environmental variation. Considered independently from source population, there was no consistent trend linking a particular trait to increased heterogeneity of within-family variances © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Bromus tectorum; Ecological genetics; Genetic differentiation; Heritability estimates; Invading species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026305685

Percent cluster set in these cultivars averaged 44 and 20%, respectively, but was less than 10% in 8 other cultivars investigated. Percent cluster set from pollination with 'Segorbe' averaged 62 and 41% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Self-pollination produced 40% fewer nuts per cluster and twice as many blanks as cross-pollination. All cultivars and selections have an active sporophytic incompatibility system. Evaluation of self-compatibility in seedlings from the cross 'Montebello' × 'Compton' revealed that the partial self-compatibility of the maternal parent was transmitted to some of the progeny. Self-pollination resulted in greater than 10% cluster set in two selections, OSU 41.134 and OSU 43.025, in both years, but only in 1988 in OSU 42.089 and 'Willamette'. Three other selections had very low set in both years. Results of incompatible crosses with standard testers were generally in agreement with those of self-pollination, except that the S2 tester induced greater set on 3 genotypes in 1988 and the S1 tester on 2 genotypes in 1990 than self-pollination. The partial self-compatibility of 'Montebello', OSU 41.134, and OSU 43.025 appears to be due to a failure of their stigmas to prohibit pollen tube growth in incompatible crosses. There is no evidence of a pollen-part mutation in 'Montebello', nor is there evidence that partial self-compatibility is due to the interaction of S-alleles, as 'Barcelona', which has the same alleles as these three genotypes, failed to set nuts in all incompatible crosses. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Corylus avellana; filbert; floral biology; incompatibility; self-fertility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005230990

A study of gene flow has been carried out in an orchard composed of single rows of a ""pollinating"" cultivar between every double row of the most commercially desirable cultivar, Nonpareil. This ""two-to-one"" planting pattern was repeated throughout the orchard, and several ""pollinating"" cultivars were used in various parts of the orchard in an attempt to provide flowers for cross-pollination with Nonpareil at all stages of flowering of the latter. Using isozyme markers GPI-2, LAP-1, AAT-1, PGM-1, and PGM-2 and three newly-defined isozyme markers for almond - IDH, G6PD, and SDH - it has been shown that the gene flow resulting in nut set is quite restricted, taking place most strongly between neighboring halves of cross-compatibile pairs of trees. Even that half of a tree facing away from the ""pollinating"" tree has significantly less gene flow to it, while the next tree further on has few nuts set by fertilization from the ""pollinating"" tree under consideration. This result is surprising considering the comparatively large distances that the honeybee brought into the orchard in large numbers must travel within the orchard. To explain this apparent paradox and the observation that in most cases only a small proportion (<20%) of flowers set nuts, it is suggested that the honeybee predominantly visits only one cultivar, flying along the row of the cultivar to do so, and that cross-pollination results from accidental or rare visits involving two or more compatible cultivars. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Almond orchard; Gene flow; Honeybee; Pollen,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0008656947

As a result, each seed is associated with an accessory cost that represents the costs of pollen capture and the costs of aborted ovules. Accessory costs may explain the minimum seed size among species, because these costs are likely to comprise a greater proportion of total reproductive allocation in species with smaller seeds. For very small propagules, the costs of pollination may not be worth the benefits, perhaps explaining the persistence of pteridophytic reproduction at small propagule sizes. The smallest angiosperm seeds are much smaller than the smallest gymnosperm seeds, both in the fossil record and in the modern flora. This suggests that angiosperms can produce pollinated ovules more cheaply than gymnosperms. Pollination becomes less efficient as a species decreases in abundance, and this loss of efficiency is greater for species with a higher accessory cost per seed. We propose that the greater reproductive efficiency of angiosperms when rare can explain why angiosperm-dominated floras were more speciose than the gymnosperm-dominated floras they replaced. © 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",Angiosperms; pollination; seed size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026313569

Pollen is mature and viable from shortly before anthesis until the corolla and attached anthers abscise some 9-12 days after the flowers open. Spontaneous dehiscence, however, occurs mostly in the first few days after opening. The stigma becomes receptive 6-7 days after anthesis, and nectar is produced at this time. Female gametophytes are not mature until about 10 days after anthesis. Fertilization occurs about 6-7 days after pollination, and although the endosperm commences development immediately, development of the embryo proper does not begin until some 40-45 days later.

(1) The micropyle is closed instead of a hole or canal. The inner epidermis of the integument on both sides of the micropyle is in close contact at the apex of the ovule. The boundary between the two sides consists of two layers of epidermal cuticle. (2) The micropyle contains a transmitting tissue. The micropyle is composed of an intercellular matrix produced by the epidermal cells of the integument. (3) The micropyle is asymmetrical, and is much wider on the side proximal to the funicle. On the funicle side the cells adjacent to the micropyle are similar to those of the transmitting tissue: they have large amounts of intercellular matrix and contain abundant dictyosomes, rough ER, and starch grains, and provide an appropriate environment for growth of the pollen tubes. The cells distal to the funicle are rich in rough ER and lipid bodies; they lack large intercellular spaces. (4) The micropyle is variable in the axial direction, i.e., it is much larger and more asymmetric at the level distal to the embryo sac than at a level close to the embryo sac. After pollination, one to four pollen tubes are seen in a micropyle. During their passage through the micropyle, most pollen tubes are restricted to the side proximal to the funicle. There is a greater tendency (81%) for the degenerate synergid to be located toward the funicle, i.e., at the same side as the pollen tube pathway.

In contrast, energetic considerations alone have proven successful in explaining and predicting the behaviour of feeding hummingbirds. This success may reflect the relative lack of natural predation on hummingbirds, but this study suggests that it may additionally reflect the lack of studies taking a predation perspective. In particular, when Anna's hummingbirds (Calypte anna) are faced with an obstructed view of their surroundings, they engage in behaviour suggestive of anti-predatory vigilance. In doing so, they voluntarily reduce their rate of energy intake. These birds also forgo better feeding opportunities that occur close to the ground, where observations suggest they are wary of opportunistic predators such as roadrunners (Geococcys californianus). While energy-based concepts will remain useful in the study of hummingbird feeding behaviour, the lack of predation on these birds should not be equated with an insensitivity to the risk of predation. This realization may lead to further insights into hummingbird-plant interactions, and hummingbird biology in general. © 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",Foraging behaviour; hummingbirds; plant-pollinator interactions; predation risk,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026312742

After two to four weeks in culture, embryogenic tissue derived from zygotic embryos extruded from megagametophytes was separated into individual embryos and sectors of embryogenic tissue. The paternal genotype of each resulting cell line was determined by starch gel electrophoresis. Three of thirty-six explants produced multiple cell lines with genotypic differences among the cell lines within each explant. Our results unequivocally show that it is possible to initiate embryogenic tissue from more than one zygotic embryo of a loblolly pine seed and that the resulting cell lines may be genetically different. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",conifer; genotype; isozyme; Pinus; somatic embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002442027

Two measures for the duration of phases in a dichogamous flower are distinguished; the nominal phases based on morphological features of the flower, and the effective phases reflecting the duration of their functions. Flower and phase longevity and phenotypic gender varied considerably throughout the season and among individuals. Temporal variability in phenotypic gender was loosely synchronized among the 12 plants sampled. Three effects of an environmental factor (temperature) were noted. First, increased temperatures shortened the duration of the female phase but had no effect on the duration of the male phase. Second, pollination frequency was positively correlated with temperature. These results indirectly suggest that increased pollination may shorten the duration of the female phase. Third, average population maleness, measured as the proportion of open flowers in the population on a given day which were in the male phase, was positively correlated with temperature. It is postulated that temperature indirectly influences temporal patterns of gender expression in the population through its differential effects on the longevity of the male and female phases in individual flowers. A theoretical model of bet-hedging shows that, if the direction of an environmental effect on the proportions of the sexual phases is irreversible, selection favours asynchronous dichogamy and reduces the temporal variability as much as possible. If the direction of the response is reversible, heterodichogamy is favoured. © 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",Bet-hedging; dichogamy; environmental factors; flowering; gender; Pseudowintera; Winteraceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026291306

One group was used to initiate tissue cultures. Embryos in the other group were measured (total length, cotyledon length and hypocotyl thickness) and soluble polypeptide profiles of the embryos were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Potential of an expiant to produce an embryogenic culture peaked during the eighth week following pollination, with an average of 28% of the expiants producing proembryogenic masses, and declined to near zero for mature zygotic embryos.

Quantitative evaluation of components of resistance, lesion number and lesion diameter, has been useful for determining quantitative resistance, but few breeders have applied these methods in routine selection programs. This study was aimed at determining the heritability and gain from selection for resistance to the bacterial spot pathogen based on three components of resistance. Random selections from a diverse intermated population of Capsicum annuum L. were self-pollinated for two generations to create S1 and S2 families. Thirty S1 families, corresponding S2 families and four homozygous check lines were evaluated. At forty-two days after seeding, two different leaves of each plant were inoculated by leaf infiltration with low concentrations (5×103 colony forming units) of Group 2 (XCV PT, race 1) and 4 (XCV P, race 1) of the bacterium, respectively.

Were such a size difference to exist, this might explain, at least in part, the observation that X-bearing pollen tubes reach the ovary more quickly, on average, than Y-bearing pollen tubes. We tested for such a size difference by separating pollen collected from single anthers into three size classes: small, large, and random. Fruit set (number of pollinated flowers that set fruit) and seed set (number of seeds per capsule) did not differ for these three pollination treatments. Progeny sex ratios resulting from these three pollen size classes also did not differ significantly. Thus, pollen grain size is not affected by which of the two sex chromosomes is present. Our experiment is the first direct test of this relationship. Based on our results, size differences should not be invoked to explain competitive differences in male- and female-determining microgametophytes. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Dioecy; Pollen competition; Pollen size; Progeny sex ratios; Silene latifolia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006314109

Visitation by potential pollinators was also measured by observation and by indirect methods. Nonflying mammals were frequent visitors to inflorescences of both Banksia species. The aluminium sleeves used to exclude non-flying mammals from B. integrifolia trees were associated with a reduction in both the number of infructescences produced and the number of fruit per infructescence, indicating that non-flying mammals were important pollinators. Bird-nets over trees also significantly reduced the number of fruit per infructescence, but had no significant effect on the number of infructescences produced. The results of exclusion experiments using single inflorescences were inconclusive due to low fruitset. No conclusions could be drawn from these experiments with B. spinulosa. However, results for B. integrifolia support the conclusions of whole-tree experiments. Analysis of the genotype frequencies in seed from B. integrifolia provided no support for the hypothesis that the relatively limited mobility of non-flying mammal pollinators would cause inbreeding. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Banksia; Cercartetus nanus; Fruit-set; Mammals; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026313976

There was little or no homology between the parental genomes, as shown by an overall meiotic chromosome association of 32.83 I + 4.08 rod II + 0.21 ring II + 0.18 III + 0.02 IV. The hybrids were completely sterile and so far backcrosses to wheat parent have not been successful.

Sarg.) pollen cones on cut branches were collected at different stages of development and maintained at room temperature in flasks of water to accelerate pollen-cone development and produce forced pollen. Accelerating pollen-cone development at early developmental stages reduced the number of cones that matured, decreased the quantity of pollen produced, increased the proportion of abnormally developed pollen and reduced the fertilizing potential of the pollen, as determined by seed efficiency. If the branches were collected after the pollen cones were at least 50% emerged beyond the bud scales, pollen-cone development could be successfully accelerated without decreasing pollen yield or fertilizing potential. Pollen collected from cones which were accelerated at early stages and stored for two years had a lower fertilizing potential and produced fewer seeds per cone than either unstored pollen or stored pollen collected from cones accelerated at later stages of development. The feasibility of accelerating pollen-cone development to ensure adequate supplies of pollen for controlled crosses or supplemental mass pollination is discussed. © 1991.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949278941

During endosperm development in these mutants, levels of both b-70 protein and RNA increase dramatically between 14 days and 20 days after pollination. At later stages, b-70 RNA levels decline while protein levels remain high. The increase in b-70 RNA levels is endosperm specific and dependent on gene dosage in the floury-2 mutant. In all three mutants, the increases in b-70 RNA and protein levels are inversely proportional to changes in zein synthesis. Although b-70 polypeptides can be extracted from purified protein bodies, they carry a carboxy-terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, HDEL.

Non-coding regions have a G+C content even lower (32% average) whereas coding regions are considerably richer in G+C (46%). 5-methyl cytosine was the only modified base detected and on average 23% of the cytosine residues are methylated. Immature tissues and protoplasts have significantly lower levels of cytosine methylation (average 20%) than mature tissues (average 25%). Mature pollen has an intermediate level of methylation (22%). Seeds gave the highest value (27%), suggesting de novo methylation after pollination and during seed development. Based on isoschizomer studies we estimate 55% of the CpG target sites (detected by Msp I/Hpa II) and 85% of the CpNpG target sites (detected by Bst NI/Eco RI)are methylated. Unmethylated target sites (both CpG and CpNpG) are not randomly distributed throughout the genome, but frequently occur in clusters. These clusters resemble CpG islands recently reported in maize and tobacco. The low G+C content and high levels of cytosine methylation in tomato may be due to previous transitions of 5mC?T. This is supported by the fact that G+C levels are lowest in non-coding portions of the genome in which selection is relaxed and thus transitions are more likely to be tolerated. This hypothesis is also supported by the general deficiency of methylation target sites in the tomato genome, especially in non-coding regions. Using methylation isoschizomers and RFLP analysis we have also determined that polymorphism between plants, for cytosine methylation at allelic sites, is common in tomato. Comparing DNA from two tomato species, 20% of the polymorphisms detected by Bst NI/Eco RII could be attributed to differential methylation at the CpNpG target sites. With Msp I/Hpa II, 50% of the polymorphisms were attributable to methylation (CpG and CpNpG sites). Moreover, these polymorphisms were demonstrated to be inherited in a mendelian fashion and to co-segregate with the methylation target site and thus do not represent variation for transacting factors that might be involved in methylation of DNA. The potential role of heritable methylation polymorphism in evolution of gene regulation and in RFLP studies is discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",DNA methylation; Lycopersicon esculentum; restriction fragment length polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026162046

Hybrid plants were obtained from the reciprocal cross, using as pollen parent an L. peruvianum line selected for congruity with L. esculentum. Bud pollinations to L. peruvianum, using these interspecific F1 hybrids as the pollen parent, allowed viable embryo development and plantlet recovery. Resulting backcross plants, which possess approximately 1/4 L. esculentum genome in a L. peruvianum cytoplasm, may facilitate further introgression of the L. esculentum nuclear genes into in foreign cytoplasm. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",bud-pollination; cross-incompatibility; gene introgression; interspecific hybridization; Lycopersicon esculentum; Lycopersicon peruvianum; reciprocal cross; tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0009460041

In addition, during an annual hybridization period, a few pollinations were carried out in vivo with pollen of the same origin in order to study the evolution of the fertilization results, as attested by number of achenes per resulting hips. During the period covered by the experiments, the evolution of the pollen quality detected in vitro can be related to that of seed setting success.

While failure to effect pollination or fertilization is often cited as the cause of parthenocarpy, this explanation alone is inadequate to explain why plants produce, maintain and further develop fruits. Wild parsnips (Pastinaca sativa) frequently produce parthenocarpic fruit. When parsnip webworms (Depressaria pastinacella), specialist feeders on wild parsnip, were given choices between normal fruit and parthenocarpic fruit, they exhibited a strong preference for parthenocarpic fruit. However, on parthenocarpic fruit, insects fed less efficiently and grew more slowly than insects fed normal fruit. Parthenocarpic fruits, then, may act as decoys that divert herbivores away from fruits that contain plant offspring. © 1991 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",decoys; defence; Depressaria pastinacella; fruits; furanocoumarins; parsnip webworm; Parthenocarpy; Pastinaca sativa; wild parsnip,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025526194

Alaska) ovaries. Pods contained additionally GA17, GA81 (2?-hydroxy GA20) and GA29-catabolite. The concentrations of GA1, GA3, GA8, GA19, GA20 and GA29 were higher in the ovules than in the pod, although, with the exception of GA3, the total content of these GAs in the pod exceeded that in the seeds. About 80% of the GA3 content of the ovary was present in the seeds. The concentrations of GA19 and GA20 in pollinated ovaries remained fairly constant for the first 12 ds after an thesis, after which they increased sharply. In contrast, GA1 and GA3 concentrations were maximal at 7 d and 4-6 d, respectively, after anthesis, at about the time of maximum pod growth rate, and declined thereafter.

The technique of shoot regeneration from embryo-derived callus was used to produce somaclonal variants of sunflower with enhanced levels of coumarin expression after an applied stress. Five regenerates (R1-R5) of inbred lines RHA 297 produced viable seeds following self-pollination. One of the S1 families from these plants had significantly higher concentration of scopoletin (12.75 ?g/g fresh weight) compared to the parental inbred line (5.66 ?g/g). The increased levels of scopoletin in S1 plants were partially inherited after a second self-fertilization (S2 plants). The ploidy of the regenerates and their S1 and S2 progeny was not examined. No consistent correlation between higher levels of scopoletin in stimulated S1 and S2 plants, and deterrence to feeding of Heliothis virescens (Fab) larvae on unstimulated plants was shown after in vivo assays. From inbred line HA 300, three regenerates (H1-H3) were derived which produced S1 progeny with higher or lower concentrations of ayapin or scopoletin than the parental inbred. The inheritance of increased ayapin in the HA 300-derived lines was not assessed in the S2 generation because of poor seed germination. Feeding deterrence of H. virescens larvae was not consistently correlated with ayapin concentrations in S1 progeny of HA 300 regenerates. However, a correlation (-0.61) between ayapin concentration and daily feeding score was observed in one planting of these unstimulated S1 progeny.

(annual, Scrophulariaceae) and Viscaria vulgaris Bernh. (perennial, Caryophyllaceae) were studied on a dry meadow in southwestern Sweden in June 1986 and 1988. Both species produced seeds by self-fertilization. In Melampyrum (homogamous) fruiting and seed set by selfing were much lower than by natural pollination; in Viscaria (protandrous) fruiting by selfing and by natural polination were similar, but seed set per flower was lower by selfing than by natural pollination. Sequential hand pollinations increased seed set in Melampyrum, but not in Viscaria. Thus, the number of pollinations is important for high seed set in Melampyrum, and number of pollen grains deposited one pollination is important for high seed set in Viscaria. Late flowering resulted in the production of fewer seeds in both species, although the visitation rate in pure Viscaria stands was sufficient, because of limited resources. Pollen was the limiting resource in Viscaria, because hand pollination increased natural seed set. In Melampyrum pollen was limiting in 1988 but so were consumable resources, because the seedset decreased with time despite hand pollination. Pure stands of Viscaria had sced set similar to plants in mixed stands (with Melampyrum and Rhinanthus), although plants in mixed stands received fewer visits. Many seeds produced late in the season are the result of self pollination; emasculated Viscaria flowers had a very low seedset late in the season.

We distinguished between healthy and Ustilago-infected Viscaria plants. Both species shared the main insect visitor, queens of Bombus hortorum, which collected nectar from both species but pollen from Melampyrum only. The pattern of visitation changed over the season: bumblebees preferred Viscaria early on, but changed to Melampyrum later in the season, probably because of the higher sugar content of Melampyrum nectar and the possibility of collecting both nectar and pollen from the same flower. Pollen collecting is probably of increasing importance since the need of pollen for the developing larvae will increase with time. Flowers of Viscaria received fewer visits in plots with other species than in pure Viscaria plots during one year and received more visits early than late in the season during both years. Melampyrum flowers received similar amounts of visits in mixed and pure environments. They also received more visits early than late, although this was probably a result of pollinator satiation since Melampyrum became very abundant with time. Ustilago-infected plants received far fewer visits but because of its long flowering time the proportion of open flowers receiving visits was still high. Viscaria flowers received significantly more visits than flowers of other species when bumblebees made heterospecific flower visits from Ustilago-infected plants; thus Ustilago spores were probably effectively dispersed from infected to healthy plants by the pollinators. The mechanism behind competition for pollination in this system was competition through pollinator preference, since the visitation rate to Viscaria actually decreased, but also competition through improper pollen transfer (grains of both species were found on the bodies of bumblebees) since the incidence of switching between the two species increased, probably resulting in an increased misplacement of conspecific pollen grains with time. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Bumblebees; Competition; Improper pollen transfer; Nectar preference; Spore dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026062815

The small-seeded 'XR-235' was used as the pistillate and recurrent parent. These genotypes showed polymorphisms at nine isozyme loci and at the phaseolin locus. Seed size parameters (weight, length, width, and thickness) were determined for each BC1 and F2 individual, i.e., for seeds harvested from 'XR-235' after pollination with F1 and from the F1 after selfing, respectively. A combination of starch gel electrophoresis and enzyme activity staining was used to determine the genotype of each BC1 and F2 individual at the segregating loci. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining were used to determine geno-type at the phaseolin locus. Tests for independent assortment using two-way contingency and maximum likelihood tables revealed three linkage pairs: Aco-1 - 20 cM - Dia-1; Adh-1 - 2 cM - Got-2; and Est-2 - 11 cM - Pha. Statistical comparisons were made between the means of genotype classes at each segregating locus for all seed size parameters. The results from two independently obtained BC1s and the F2 consistently indicated that the Adh-1-Got-2 segment was linked to a locus that affected seed size and overcame maternal control over seed size.

Compared to the results obtained from seed development in planta, the increase in the number of backcross progeny was generally very limited, and in some cases even a decrease was found. Raising the sucrose concentration in the ovary culture medium resulted in a higher frequency of ovules developing back seed coats but this was not followed by an increase in the number of backcross progeny obtained.

Per ovule, frequencies of micropylar penetration exceeded frequencies of backcross progeny only to a limited extent.

The self-or sib-pollinated auxotrophic parental line(s) produce lethal offspring in the absence of the required nutrient. In crosses involving functional male-sterile maternal lines and thiamine-dependent male tomato lines (or reciprocals), the described scheme works as predicted. This scheme is now being employed in the production of hybrid tomato. Although some problems were experienced during the preliminary work with barley mutants the overall results are promising. The hybrid-production scheme has various advantages: (I) it is applicable in normally selfing species, too. (II) the two parental lines can be blended in hybrid crossing blocks, thereby increasing cross pollination, (III) it involves a genetically determined built-in system for selective elimination of the plants of unwanted constitution, and the scheme can therefore be used with imcomplete male- or self-sterile lines, too. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Auxotrophs; blended parents; complementation; crossing block; F1 hybrid production system; male-and self-sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-16644392093

The KTI content of the isoline was less than 0.2% compared to Williams 82, with the exact content depending on the extent of cross-pollination of the soybeans. Steam heating of the isoline flour (121 °C, 20 min) resulted in a near-zero level of trypsin inhibitory activity, while 20% remained in the Williams 82 sample. The raw soy flour prepared from the isoline was nutritionally superior to the raw flour prepared from the standard variety, as measured by PER and pancreatic weights. The increased PER was likely due to the lower level of trypsin inhibitory activity in the isoline. Steam heating the flours for up to 30 min at 121 °C progressively increased the PER for both strains. Screening of several accessions from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection showed variation in the content of trypsin inhibitor, sulfur amino acids, and lectins, indicating that further screening studies could lead to the discovery of soybeans which yield flour that is safe and nutritious, with minimal heating. © 1991, American Chemical Society.

Effects of various herbicide treatments on the growth and regenerative capacity of callus along with the ploidy and seed set of regenerated plants were determined. Flow cytometric analysis was also used to measure changes in ploidy levels of callus cells following treatments. More than 50% of the cells were doubled in chromosome number after the haploid callus was treated with 5 or 10 ? M APM or 10 ? M pronamide for 3 days. A similar proportion of plants regenerated from the treated callus produced seed upon self-pollination. APM and pronamide did not inhibit callus growth at these concentrations and the treated callus retained a high plant regeneration capacity. Oryzalin very effectively induced chromosome doubling, but severely inhibited the growth of regenerable callus and plant regeneration. Trifluralin induced chromosome doubling in a small proportion of cells at lower concentrations (0.5 and 1 ? M), however, at a higher concentration (5 ?M) it inhibited callus growth and plant regeneration. The results indicate that APM and pronamide may be useful agents for inducing chromosome doubling of anther-derived maize haploid callus at very low concentrations. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Amiprophos methyl; Chromosome doubling; Oryzalin; Pronamide; Trifluralin; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002816274

Numerous B alleles have been described: each determines a particular pattern of pigment synthesis with respect to the tissues that are pigmented and the time during development that pigment synthesis begins. We report here a genetic analysis of one B allele, B-Peru, which regulates synthesis of pigments in both kernel and plant tissues. We used stocks with active Mutator transposable elements to produce eight mutations in B-Peru. All eight alter pigment synthesis in all the kernel and plant tissues pigmented by B-Peru, suggesting that each mutation has disrupted a region of the gene required for expression in all tissues. Six of the mutations cause a colorless phenotype, while two cause a reduction in pigment in both kernel and plant tissues. Four of the mutations are unstable, and four are stable upon self-pollination. Multiple independent revertants were isolated from each unstable allele. DNA blot analysis demonstrated that all eight mutants are the result of insertions within an ~5-kb region that encodes the B-Peru transcript. One of the four unstable alleles contains a Mu element, Mu1.7. Two others contain insertions related to the Spm family of transposable elements. Thus, our Mutator stocks also contained active transposable elements from the unrelated Spm family.

Among the pollinators, noctuid moths of the genus Hadena also acted as seed predators. Nectar?foraging female moths oviposited in flowers, and their larvae consumed flowers and seed capsules. Despite a lower percentage of pollinated flowers in the year of low pollinator abundance, similar numbers of flowers set fruit in both years, because fewer flower buds and flowers were eaten by Hadena larvae during the year of low pollinator visitation. The number of seed capsules preyed upon was also lower in the year with low pollinator abundance, resulting in a higher seed set. The positive correlation between the percentage of pollinated flowers and the percentage of seed capsules destroyed was also observed when comparing flowers opening in different parts of the season. Early flowering plant individuals had the same pollination success but suffered higher seed predation than late flowering ones. Selection for maximized pollination success through synchronous flowering, is probably the main reason for the compressed flowering period in 5. vulgaris, but the high level of predation early in the season may further increase the reproductive success of synchronous flowering individuals.

Other plant species, e.g., Polygonum bistortoides, Lupinus argenteus var. parviflorus and Valeriana sitchensis compete for space and bumblebee pollinators within the study area. Pollinator sharing, resulting from such competition, may increase the frequency of unvisited flowers of P. bracteosa var. atrosanguinea. P. bracteosa var. atrosanguinea, with blood purple nectariferous flowers, is presumed to lack intense reflections of blue spectral components from its corollas in attracting bumblebees compared to those of P. racemosa and P. groenlandica. Six species of bumblebees (Bombus) and cuckoo bees (Psithyrus) pollinate P. bracteosa var. atrosanguinea. Of these, Bombus mixtus and B. occidentalis occur in higher frequencies and are the major pollinators of P. bracteosa var. atrosanguinea. Queen and larger worker bumblebees pollinate nototribically as they probe for nectar, while smaller worker bumblebees pollinate sternotribically while scraping pollen from anthers deeply hidden in the dome?shaped galea.

Wind pollinations (anemophily) plays a dominant role in species-poor communities only. The quantity of zoophilous species increases equator-ward to up to 100% and so does the degree of integration in animal-plant interactions. Biotic pollination is pinpointed. Manifoldness and specifity of methods reduce pollen waste and mispollinations. Saturated ecosystems dispose of a complete set of pollination syndromes and the respective pollinator guilds, narrow niche widths, a high percentage of eutropic flowers, shorter flowering times, and a temporal and spatial partitioning of floral resources. In pioneer communities generalists (allotropic flowers) or autogamy prevail. Flowering times are extended and there is less biotic integration. Usually, floral contrivances favour allogamy. Genetic heterogeneity of potential sexual partners is affected by seed dispersal while gene flow results from pollen transfer. The mean range of the latter and thus the size of an individual's interaction sphere within a population (neighbourhood) are species-specific and depend on (eg) gregariousness; efficiency of the pollination apparatus; nectar quantity; kind of pollinator, its flying range, and flight direction as well as terrain features. Usually, it amounts to a few meters only. Anemophilic and generalist species suffer from a more intense pollen waste than do specialists, but compensate for it by high pollen-ovule ratios. Habitually sparse species are pollinated by trapliners or benefit synergistically from the presence of a similar dominating species. Synergism by vicariating flowering times secures the continuity of a common pool of polylectic pollinators. An oligolectic pollinator's dependency of certain flowers is often more obligatory than vice versa. Establishment of species within specialized flowers requires additional prerequisites for the existence of respective oligolectic pollinators: nectar and pollen in due proportion, nesting facilities, foodplants or prey for the larvae, climatic conditions, etc. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026401429

Huttoo at Narkanda, Himachal Pradesh, in the Indian Himalaya. Its yellow, long?tubed, nectarless flower with a curled rostrum overarched by a broad, inverted lower corolla lip was pollinated exclusively by Bombus albopleuralis and B. tunicatus workers hanging inverted from the corolla and vibrating pollen from introrse anthers concealed within the galea and releasing pollen through a small ventral opening in the galea base. The stigma, protruding from the tip of the rostrum, contacted pollen deposited on the ventral side of the insect's thorax. Corbicular pollen loads from P. megalantha pollinators indicated equal numbers of monolectic and oligolectic foragers. P. megalantha appeared to suffer from competition for pollinators by Cynoglossum wallichii at one site but to be favored in a mixed plant community with nectariferous species offering a forage resource complementary to Pedicularis pollen. As in P. punctata, the long, nectarless corolla tube of P. megalantha appears to function in extending the rostrate vibration pollination mechanism beyond the plant's foliage, which would interfere with its function. It is not an adaptation for nectar?foraging lepidopteran pollinators. P. megalantha was also found to be a root hemiparasite. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

An equivalent percentage of flowers (78%) contained pollen tubes following self-pollination and open-pollination while a significantly smaller percentage of flowers in an autogamy treatment (44%) and cross-pollination treatment (55%) contained pollen tubes. Significantly more of the inflorescences in the open-pollination (60%) and cross-pollination (33%) treatments produced fruit compared with those in the self-pollination (11%) and autogamy treatments (13%). We suggest that B. ericifolia is largely self-incompatible because fruit production did not reflect pollen tube abundances. The influence of pollination levels on fruit production was determined by reducing the number of flowers on an inflorescence to 100 (i.e. 10% of original) or fewer and hand-pollinating these with cross pollen. There was no difference in fruit production between inflorescences with reduced flower number and open-pollinated inflorescences which had their full complement of flowers. Thus, the ability of an inflorescence to produce fruit appears more likely to be determined by the type of pollen received (cross versus self) rather than by the number of pollinated flowers it contains. © 1991, CSIRO.

Flowers of hermaphrodites produced 50% more nectar sugar in the 24 h after anthesis than the flowers of females. Nectar sugar production was also significantly and positively correlated with petal length. Pollinator visitation rates were influenced more by differences in petal length than by differences in flower number per inflorescence. Consequently, hermaphrodites experienced higher visitation rates on a per-flower basis. Female flowers tended to receive pollen at a lower rate than hermaphrodites, but remained in the receptive female-phase longer than hermaphrodites. On average, length of the period of flower receptivity declined as pollen deposition rate increased. These opposing processes resulted in the sex morphs receiving equivalent levels of pollination. Seasonal varation in the rate of pollen reception was more strongly influenced by the efficiency of the available pollinator pool than by rates of visitation. Dramatic seasonal shifts in the composition of the pollinator assemblage and pollen availability were correlated with increased pollination intensity as the season progressed. Not only were more pollen grains received, but they arrived in a shorter period of time and the number of potential pollen donors (hermaphrodites) increased. Pollen competition in both sex morphs may be more intense late in the season. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026021605

In dioecious species, female wasps enter and pollinate 'female' figs that produce only seeds and within which the wasp is unable to reproduce. A resolution for three paradoxes in the biology of dioecious fig-pollinator systems is suggested: (i) why wasps enter female flowers, (ii) why they maintain structures and behaviours needed to pollinate female figs, despite the absence of any direct selection on these phenotypes and (iii) why wasps entering male flowers go through the behaviours that would be required to pollinate female figs. Whereas it is obviously in a female fig's interest to conceal her sex from the wasps, it is argued that it is also in a male fig's interest to do so, because the male will benefit only from raising female wasps that, when they leave, successfully find, enter, and pollinate female figs (even though this will be fatal to the wasps).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026363489

Individual flowers contribute to colour display for c. 4 weeks, although they are active in pollen transfer only 5-7 days (male phase = days 1-3, female phase = days 2-5). A strong, foetid smell along with nectar and pollen attract over 50 insect species, of which 19 are probable pollinators. These are mainly Diptera, but include as well Hymenoptera-Apoideae and Coleoptera. Incomplete protandry and reverse herkogamy restrict pollen-stigma interference, but self-incompatibility seems operative in avoiding self-fertilisation. Gynoecium development (from carpel inception to fruit dehiscence) lasts c. 18 weeks, starting with a 33-day-long prefloral period during which most gynoecial structures arise. The floral and postfloral phases occupy c. 18 and 73 days, respectively. The times of starting and ending of several growth processes were determined. Minimum growth rate of the ovary coincides with the active period of the flower, after which some, presumably fertilised, flowers resume ovary growth whereas other ones begin to wither. Pedicels of young fruits become erect which could be beneficial both for seed filling and explosive dispersal. Endocarp maturation apparently sets an upper limit on seed expansion and, indirectly, on size increase of the fruit.

The biogeographical restriction of extant conifers to stressful environments is also due to their inefficiency of wind pollination in species-rich environments.

Franco] was examined in two genetically similar seed orchard blocks with the aid of allozyme polymorphisms at six loci. The pollination environment (time of pollination and length of pollination season) of one block was manipulated by means of an overhead water spray cooling treatment. The cooling treatment temporarily delayed the pollination season in the treated block by 12 days relative to the untreated one. In addition, the length of the pollination season in the cooled block was shorter than the uncooled one by 12 days (18 vs. 30 days). The rate of inbreeding was significant in the uncooled block, while a perfect outcrossing rate was obtained for the cooled one. This difference was attributed to the low outcrossing rate obtained within the lower crown of the control block. It was concluded that the observed significant selfing in the uncooled block was caused by the first- pollination primacy that permitted related pollen to out-compete unrelated pollen in the extended pollination season. A shorter pollination season produced a dense pollen cloud of related and unrelated pollen, hence, early zygotic selection favoured unrelated embryos. An extended pollination season, on the other hand, permitted related pollen to succeed in pollination and fertilization without any challenge by unrelated pollen. Controllable variation in the rate of inbreeding reported in this study could be useful to improve the genetic quality of seed produced from seed orchards and consequently to maximize genetic gains from selections. © 1991 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Douglas-fir; Outcrossing rate; Pollen competition; Pollination environment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026301362

Recent studies of wind and water pollination in angiosperms also show these systems to be highly sophisticated. Although entomophily was initially advantageous to the early angiosperms, abiotic pollination systems may be superior in areas of low species diversity, newly colonized habitats, and places with extremely short growing seasons or other adverse climatic conditions. Abiotically pollinated plants are not constrained by the range of animal pollinators, and as a result are spectacularly successful in long-distance dispersal. Abiotic pollination also offers an escape from deleterious sexual selection and from dependency on pollinators that are climatically limited in their distribution in space or time and vulnerable to extinction. Because evolution of abiotic polination frequently leads to dicliny or dichogamy, it is largely irreversible. This evolutionary irreversibility coupled with lowered rates of extinction and speciation give wind- or water-pollinated taxa unique phylogenetic profiles. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026395519

Ovules in all genera of the family are orthotropous and single within the axil of each fertile bract. In Microstrobus and Phyllocladus ovules are erect (the micropyle directed away from the cone axis) and are not associated with an ovule-supporting structure. Pollen in these two genera must land directly on the pollination drop in the way usual for gymnosperms. In all other genera, the ovule is inverted (the micropyle is directed toward the cone axis) and supported by a specialized ovule-supporting structure. In Saxegothaea there is no pollination drop and gametes are delivered to the ovule by pollen tube growth. Pollination drops were observed in seven of the remaining genera. Increased pollination efficiency may relate to the reduction of ovule number in each cone, often to one in many genera.

Both the calculated visitation rate per head and the percentage seed set increased slightly as a function of head number. The removal of rays from all heads in the inflorescence reduced the approach rate by 51%, but had only a small negative effect on seed set (12%). Hence, ray removal probably affected male fertility (pollen donation) to a greater extent than female fertility. The decline in pollination success was similar for all inflorescence sizes, suggesting that ray and inflorescence size have independent effects on the total display, and thus represent separate targets for pollinator?mediated selection.

The pollination mechanism of the flower, Thalia geniculata, and the unusual construction of the style and staminodes is illustrated. As early as the bud stage, pollen of the single stamen is deposited onto the pollen tray at the top of the style. Special structures of the staminodes  oblique ledge (schiefe Leiste, sL), callosity (Schwiele, Schw) and hood (Kapuze, Ka)  are in the optimal position for pollination. The style functions only as a secondary pollen presenter. It is under active tension and only sensitive at a defined site. The proboscis of a visiting insect is guided into the flower by special structures: callosity, pellicle (Häutchen, H) and an appendage to the stigma (Narbenfortsatz, Nf). The insect touches the style and starts its explosive S?shaped movement via a trigger mechanism. Slow motion pictures (5000 pictures/s) show that the revolving movement occurs in 3 phases in approximately 0.03 s. During this very short time the style becomes erect, scrapes the pollen from the proboscis into its stigmatic cave and deposits its own pollen onto the proboscis in the form of a sticky paste. In Th. geniculata the 2 flowers of a partial inflorescence together form one attractive symmetrical, melittophilous blossom.

Tetraploid hybrids between 4x(2EBN) Solanum stoloniferum x 4x(4EBN) S. tuberosum Gp. Andigena as well as diploid hybrids between 2x(1EBN) S. chancayense x 2x(2EBN) S. chacoense were obtained by culturing immature hybrid embryos in nutrient medium. Identification of appropriate embryo developmental stages was critical in developing a suitable protocol for rescuing viable hybrid embryos. The use of IVP clones as the second pollinator in 4x(2EBN) x 4x(4EBN) crosses reduced premature fruit drop and helped to identify triploid hybrids. Morphological and cytological examination confirmed true hybridity for a few of the regenerated plants. Male sterility and meiotic abnormalities were characteristic of the hybrids.

The chromosome numbers of 52 species were analysed using flower buds and root tips. Previously published reports on chromosome numbers were confirmed for 21 species and new numbers reported in a further 31. Self compatibility was present in 20 species and only three species were shown to possess barriers to self pollination. Seed set occurred in two of six interspecific crosses carried out within sections. In 21 wider crosses the degree of pollen tube development was increasingly repressed with taxonomic distance. The chromosome counts also support the reclassification of the genus Verticordia into three subgenera: Chrysoma, Verticordia and Eperephes. Species within each section of a subgenus generally had the same chromosome number. Exceptions occurred in the subgenus Verticordia, sections Verticordia, Intricata and Micrantha. In species with one or two ovules, the chromosome number was also low (6, 7, 8 or 9) while species with six or more ovules had a higher chromosome number (11 or 22). There was, however, no relationship between chromosome number and chromosome size, nor between chromosome number and any observed feature which might be attributable to polyploidy or allopolyploidy. With the possible exception of V. grandis, which displayed loss of seasonality in flowering, all putative polyploids behaved developmentally as diploids and displayed a high level of male fertility. © 1991, CSIRO.

Realized gene dispersal via pollen is much greater than potential gene flow inferred from pollinator flight distances between plants but is similar to a random distribution based on all interplant distances. Extensive pollen carryover due to the unique pollination system of the plants and the behavior of their large butterfly pollinators may explain the extensive pollen movement. Matings between genetically similar plants resulted in reduced seed-set and seed viability within fruits, but genetic similarity between mating pairs was independent of the spatial distance separating them. Thus, extensive gene dispersal via pollen creates a large neighbotrhood size in milkweeds that may prevent genetic structure in small local populations, a prerequisite for optimal outcrossing distances to exist. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026274212

The experiment was performed at Bet Dagan, Israel, in 1988 under near-potential (drip-irrigated) and dryland (stored soil moisture) growing conditions. Data on phenology, biomass, harvest index, grain yield and its components were collected. Drought susceptibility index (S) was calculated for each genotype as the reduction in yield from irrigated to dryland conditions relative to the mean reduction for all genotypes. On average, cultivars produced about three- to fourfold more grain than landraces. Cultivars had the same mean growth duration and biomass but were 40 % (irrigated) to 27 % (dryland) shorter in mean plant height than landraces. This yield advantage was fully accounted for by a proportionately greater mean kernel number per panicle and harvest index, irrespective of the water regime.  Drought susceptibility index was near average for all cultivars and much more variable among landraces. Dryland yield became progressively dependent on the yield potential as the yield potential was genetically improved in the cultivars. It was concluded that, irrespective of the water regime, the large yield improvement in modern open-pollinated cultivars of sorghum, as compared with landraces, has been achieved only through greater dry matter partitioning to the panicle accompanied by a reduction in plant height.

Individual flowers are protandrous and open for 2-5 days, while a flower cluster has open flowers for 2-4 weeks. About 16000 pollen grains and four ovules are produced per flower. Self-pollination of an individual flower is unlikely because of protandry, but the sequence and synchrony of flowering, together with pollinator behaviour, favour geitonogamy. Some fruit is set when cross-pollination is restricted by bagging flowers, which indicates partial self-compatibility. Subsequently, fruit abortion is higher in the bagged treatment than in those open-pollinated; this may reflect some pre-dispersal inbreeding depression. Between 4 and 41% of open-pollinated flower buds set fruit, most of which had one or rarely two seeds. Phenologically, each reproductive stage is unimodal and the whole process from bud initiation to abscission of mature fruit is completed within a year. Initiation of floral buds, flowering, growth and abscission of fruits are almost synchronous among fecund trees at a particular latitude each year. Latitudinal differences occur consistently among populations that are separated by less than 2° of latitude; those at lower latitudes flower earlier.

The decline of the gymnosperms is considered to be due to the inefficiency of wind pollination in maintaining heterozygosity in angiosperm?enriched communities or the limited scope for speciation of wind?pollinated taxa. Contrasting hypotheses for the rise of the angiosperms focus on either environmental change or superior reproductive and vegetative innovations leading to faster growth rates. We suggest that plant?animal interactions have been overemphasized and competitive interactions largely overlooked, as determinants of the Cretaceous revolution in plant history.

The phenomenon is frequent enough that strangler fig populations will contain considerably more genetic variation than would be expected from the number of trees. How this cryptic variation affects populations depends on the flowering phenology of composite trees. If the genetically different portions of trees flower asynchronously, populations of pollinating wasps may be more resistant to low host population sizes than previously thought. If different portions flower synchronously, attempts to infer mating-system parameters from the parentage of fruit crops will be misleading. The fruiting of figs, which are considered a keystone species in tropical forests, is important for maintaining biodiversity but is also particularly susceptible to failure at small population sizes.

Most liana families are characterized by one or a few characteristic pollination strategies. Liana pollination systems are less diversified in dry forest and more diversified in the subcanopy and in pluvial forest. These features might be anticipated from liana population structure, since liana individuals are almost certainly more widely scattered than are trees, at least when genetically identical, vegetatively reproduced liana clumps are counted as single individuals. A population of widely scattered individuals would put pollination by specialized pollinators, especially trapliners, at an adaptive premium; conversely, reproductive strategies like wind (and perhaps thrip) pollination, that are efficient only in gregarious populations, would be at a selective disadvantage in lianas. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026292018

In contrast, a high pollinator visitation rate was recorded in a reference population of P. sieboldii on the flank of Mt. Yatugatake. Thus, the low rates of seed production in the nature reserve was due to a shortage of compatible pollens as a result of the limitation of pollinator availability. Stigmas of flowers in various clones occasionally were loaded with pollen grains whose sizes were not significantly different from those of anther pollens of the same flowers. However, pollen germination on stigmas was observed only in the flowers of a homo?morph clone whose flowers have pin?type stigmas and anthers with compatible thrum?type pollens at the same height. Exceptionally high fertility of the homo?morph clone would be associated with its inbreeding habit. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

Simple models of the evolution of breeding systems that represent inbreeding depression as a constant parameter do not admit the possibility of stable mixed mating systems involving both inbreeding and random mating. Contrary to this expectation, we find that coevolution between a modifier of selfing and a single overdominant locus situated anywhere in the genome can generate evolutionarily attracting mixed mating systems. Two forms of association between the modifier locus and the viability locus promote the evolution of outcrossing. The favored heterozygous genotype at the viability locus develops positive associations with modifier alleles that enhance outcrossing and with the heterozygous genotype at the modifier locus. Associations between outcrossing and high viability evolve immediately upon the introduction of a rare modifier allele, even in the absence of linkage. © 1991.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026360286

Two southern Spanish populations (El Garrobo and Grazalema) were selected to investigate flowering, dispersal and seed germination phenologies, together with morphological and functional traits of flowers, fruits and seeds. Observations on pollinator visitation, fruit set, and seedling survival were also carried out. Plants produce massive flower displays of showy, tubular flowers void of nectar that rely on insect cheating for pollination. Hand?pollinations and seed germination tests demonstrated full self?compatibility. Automatic selfing is prevented by spatial separation of stigma and anthers, and pollinators are thus necessary for reproduction. Low pollinator visitation rates are the rule, as indicated by the fact that observations spread over 2 years yielded only eight insect records. Percentage fruit set of open?pollinated flowers was found to be extremely low (0.14.9%), while hand?pollination increased fruiting levels to 3450%. Direct and indirect evidence point to consistently pollen?limited reproduction in this species. If a large number of flowers within any inflorescence are pollinated artificially, however, resource limitations operate and pods from ovaries pollinated late in the season are aborted. On average, the maximum of ovaries developing into fruit within any inflorescence is 4. It is suggested that, in this nectarless species, about 80% of total are excess flowers which contribute to increase pollinator attraction. Nerium oleander pollen is aggregated into a sticky substance, which allows the fertilization of many ovules after a single, probably rare, pollination event. Fruits are many seeded follicles (181 seeds per fruit on average), so that individual plants often liberate thousands of seeds in spite of the low percent fruit set. The hairy, water?dispersed seeds are released during the rainiest season in the year, and germination follows rapidly. All seedlings tracked died before completing 1 year of life, mostly because of desiccation during the first summer drought. Pollination by deceit in this Mediterranean species is discussed in terms of phylogenetic constraints within the mainly tropical family Apocynaceae. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

Length of the pistillate phase depends on pollinator activity, as pollination accelerates the abscission of floral parts. Unpollinated flowers remain pistillate for 3-4 days, during which time stigmatic receptivity declines gradually.

Synthetic populations were made for each variety which carried Bs at both the natural frequency as well as at the frequency of the alternative population. The populations were open pollinated, and the frequencies of the Bs were studied over three generations. The experiment was duplicated in two different environments and the variables of viability and fertility were also compared. Fertility was lower in the 2B than in the OB plants, and it was much lower again in the 4B ones. Viability was not dependent on the number of Bs. The results were similar for both environments and this finding argues against an adaptive role for B chromosomes. The frequency of Bs in the populations sown at their natural frequencies remained constant over the generations in both environments, while the Bs of both varieties tended to move towards their natural frequencies after they were experimentally changed. There was a strong tendency for the proportion of plants with Bs in the variety with a high natural frequency to increase, while the tendency for the proportion of plants with Bs in the variety with a low natural frequency to decrease was less. These results indicate just how strong are the forces which maintain Bs in populations in the face of their harmful effects upon fertility. In our opinion the genes that control B transmission rates are the main factors that determine the range of frequencies at which a natural population can carry B chromosomes, while the tendency to recover natural frequencies rapidly following a disturbance is due to frequency-dependent selection and to a maternal imprinting effect. © 1991 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",B chromosomes; Secale cereale,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966145570

Batsch) were studied from anthesis to fertilization or degeneration in pollinated and unpollinated flowers. During this time the ovule undergoes a continuous developmental process. At anthesis the megagametophyte is immature and is not fully developed until 12 days later. During the first three weeks following anthesis the ovule increases in length from 400 to 1200?Um, and the nucellus and integuments undergo various changes particularly in the distribution of starch and cutin. These appear to be connected with early embryo sac nutrition and protection. As the ovule matures, starch accumulates mainly in the embryo sac, integuments and at the nucellar tip. This starch disappears during early embryo sac elongation. Concomitant with starch depletion, the cutin that separated the integuments from the nucellus vanishes. Other cutin accumulates between cells in the nucellar tip, thus protecting and isolating the embryo sac. Most of these changes appear to be a fixed feature of ovule development since they were also observed in a few long lived ovules in unpollinated flowers. However, in unpollinated flowers development of most of the ovules is soon interrupted: callose accumulates af the chalaza, starch disappears and the ovules degenerate.

Hand pollination decreased the duration of stigmatic receptivity and pollen presentation significantly. The spatial separation of pollen presentation and receptive surfaces in a flower changed with time due to the continuing growth of the androecium and the gynoecium, and due to the temporal pattern of pollen presentation within the androecium. Hand pollination experiments indicate that seed set may be partly pollen?limited in a natural population of P. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris.

Der Pollenflug dieser Pflanzen wurde in zwei verschiedenen Höhen über.Grund (Essen, 1,8 m und 18 m) an demselben Standort durch stündliche Pollenmcssungen in den Saisons von 1988 und 1989 untersucht. Die Pollenfreisetzung von Artemisia vulgaris und des Rumex conglomeratus-Typs (R. acetosella, R. conglomeratus, R. longifolius, R. sanguineus) wird durch deutliche Tagesgänge charakterisiert, bei denen ein morgendlicher Freisetzungsgipfel typisch ist. Die zeitliche Verschiebung und die quantitativen Unterschiede des Tagesganges der Artemi-sia-Pollen bei bodenfernen und bodennahen Pollenfallcn wird durch den Tagesgang der Luftkonvektion beeinflußt, die der wichtigste Faktor für den Vertikaltransport von Pollen ist. Mit dem Sonnenaufgang beginnt ganz allmählich die Erwärmung des Bodens und es entsteht Thermik (Luftkonvektion) - erst bodennah und dann von Stunde zu Stunde in höhere Schichten hinaufreichend. Daraus folgt, daß eine bodennahe Falle früher die Artemi-sia-Pollenemission dokumentiert als eine bodenferne Falle und auch quantitativ die bodennahe Falle höhere Beifußkonzentrationen wiedergibt. Dieses gilt auch für den Rumex conglomeratus-Typ, dessen hohes Gewicht zusätzlich einen schlechten Vertikaltransport bedingt. Die Pollcncmission von Plantago lanceolata und Rumex acetosa ist durch keinen typischen Tagesgang ausgezeichnet. Beide Pollentypen können leichter in höhere Luftschichten transportiert werden, weil ihre Pollenkörner nicht in den thermisch ungünstigen Morgenstunden freigesetzt werden. Daher sind in einer bodennahen und einer bodenfernen Falle nahezu identische Pollenkonzentrationen dieser Typen feststellbar. The wind pollinated summer weeds Artemisia, Rumex and Plantago are the most important weed pollen of allcrgologic relevance. The pollen flight of these weeds at two different levels (Essen 1,8 m and 18 m above ground) was investigated by hourly pollen analysis during the seasons 1988 and 1989. The emission of Artemisia vulgaris and Rumex conglomeratus-type pollen (R. acetosella, R. conglomeratus, R. longifolius, R. sanguineus) is characterized by a distinct diurnal pattern with a prominent mid-morning peak. The phase shift and the quantitative differences for Artemisia pollen registration in a pollen trap at high level is influenced by the daily variation of air convection, which is the most important vertical transport factor for pollen. After sunrise, the ground warms up gradually and the result is the so called thermal current, at first at ground level and in time to higher layers. As a result the ground-level traps register Artemisia pollen earlier and also in greater quantities than those at roof level. This holds also true for the pollen of the Rumex conglomeratus- type. The pollen emission of Plantago lanceolata and Rumex acetosa can be observed during the whole day. Pollen of these two species can be lifted up easier to higher atmospheric levels than those of Artemisia vulgaris and R. conglomeratus-type because they show a lower gravity and do not emit pollen under unfavorable convection conditions in the morning. Thus, in the same daily variation, a high- and a low-level trap register the same amount of emitted pollen of R. acetosa and P. lanceolata. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026310149

Most response was shown by the later-flowering cultivars Shinseiki and Nijisseiki. Best results were achieved at application rates of 3% a.i. Applications of hydrogen cyanamide at 6 and 9% a.i. caused serious bud and wood damage, regardless of time of application.

In one population, lineages with disease resistance significantly decreased in frequency over a 2yr period, despite the continued presence of pathogens. Extensive self-pollination restricts the opportunity for recombination of alleles affecting separate traits, resulting in strong correlations between disease resistance and other ecologically important characters, including plant morphology, phenology, and patterns of reproductive allocation. Natural selection on these correlated characters may thus cause nonadaptive changes in disease resistance.

As the aim was to find strains with a single, varying nuclear locus for male sterility, cytoplasmic variation was avoided by starting with one open pollinated female. The progeny appeared to vary for a single locus with the homozygous recessive being male sterile. The locus was designated msl. Expected segregation ratios were disturbed by two different factors, both leading to a shortage of male steriles. An accidental drought in Petri dishes caused a relatively higher mortality of seedlings with a male sterility genotype in most cases. When this effect was avoided a systematic shortage of male steriles remained in many crosses. An experiment with varying levels of pollen competition justified the interpretation that selection at the gametophytic stage was involved. Pollen carrying the sterility allele was estimated to have a fertilization success relative to pollen with the restorer allele of 0.56. Finally the role of the msl locus in the genetics of male sterility in natural populations was assessed by crossing heterozygously and homozygously restored plants with male steriles collected from the wild. It appeared that the inheritance of male sterility is more complicated than the msl locus alone, which was expected. If the selection effects on the msl locus observed in this study occur in nature, this would have interesting consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of gynodioecy. © 1991 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Gynodioecy; Plantago coronopus; Pollen competition; Restorer gene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002358072

There was no difference between mainland and island floras in the frequency of species belonging to different dispersal types, pollination syndromes, growth forms and shrub height categories. This probably results from islands being exposed to the same disturbance (fire) regime and being accessible to similar pollination and dispersal vectors as the mainland. A fragmentation effect was also diluted by the establishment on islands of edaphic generalists from the adjacent acid sand Fynbos. Species most vulnerable to extinction on small limestone fragments were locally endemic and limestone-specialist shrubs. Our results suggest that the minimum reserve size needed to avoid species losses (including local endemics) is about 4-15 ha. This is encouraging since c. 90% of existing reserves in the transformed lowland Fynbos landscapes of the south-western Cape are larger than 15 ha. The results of empirically based studies such as this are likely to be locality-specific. Nonetheless, they do provide meaningful guidelines for reserve design and improve our understanding of fragmentation-related extinction patterns. © 1991.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026267475

Males and workers differed in flower handling only on Solidago, where males visited more flowers per stalk and fewer inflorescences per minute than workers.

Alaska no 7) were used to study the enzymes of sucrose metabolism. Acid and neutral invertase (EC 3.2.1.26). sucrose synthase (SS, EC 2.4.1.13) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS, EC 2.4.1.14) have been localized in the soluble fraction. Acid invertase activity was also present in the insoluble fraction and in pea ovary apoplast. In pea pods, sucrose breakdown was dominated by the invertase pathway. SS specific activity only increased at late stages of parthenocarpic pod development, while SPS did so in pods obtained by pollination. Changes in time course of invertase activities have been correlated with the growth rate of fruits induced to develop either by fertilization or by exogenous application of giberellic acid (GA), 2,4?dichloro?phenoxy acetic acid (2,4?D) or 6?benzylaminopurine (6?BAP). The soluble neutral activities might be associated with pod elongation, while the acid ones were rather related to assimilate import by the induced fruits. Application of gibberellic acid to non?pollinated ovaries significantly enhanced the soluble neutral invertase activity before any ovary outgrowth was detected (up to 2 h after treatment). Within the same period of time. GA?treated ovaries showed a decrease in the acid invertase activity of the soluble fraction and an increase of the acid invertase activity in the apopiast. preceding in time the increment of the acid invertase activity associated with the insoluble fraction. Our results suggest that the early GA response may be mediated through a promotion of processes of protein secretion. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

While no significant differences in yields were detectable in the Fayoum, an increase of up to 17% in seed cotton weight was estimated in the pheromone-treated fields in Dakahlia. This increase in yield was attributed to enhanced hybrid vigour as a result of introducing beehives into the pheromone-treated fields during the early stages of flowering and fruit setting. The bees, in addition to cross-pollinating the cotton flowers, produced over 10 metric tonnes of honey. These excellent results were obtained in spite of a general increase in pink boilworm infestation throughout the governorate as deduced by a comparison of green boll infestation between 1986 and 1987. The results by a comparison of green boll infestation between 1986 and 1987. The results also underlined the importance of early season pheromone treatments, since the treatments at Dakahlia went on at an earlier stage of crop development than in either Kafr El Sheikh or Fayoum. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",Cotton; Integrated control; Pheromones; Pink boilworm; Rating disruption,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026278027

Since beekeeping is a multiproduct industry, farmers can come in and exploit the income derived from both primary and secondary products. Farmers can also operate as specialised wholesalers, retailers, firms, breeders or apiculturists in beekeeping activities. Thus, it is left to the farmers to make their best choice in selecting which product to venture into. Apart from farmers, existing estate sectors can also exploit this new activity. First, it provides pollination services which has been proven to increase the production of any crop. Secondly, it maximizes the usage of labour in the long run reducing the cost per unit output. Finally, the estate sectors are more efficient and can provide a better management than individuals or smallholders.

A population with small, monomorphically colored flowers with introrse anthers had a significantly lower outcrossing rate than did a population with larger, polymorphically colored flowers with extrose anthers. In the more-outcrossing population the correlation between higher maternal plant outcrossing rate and the suite of six traits approached significance, with greater petal size, greater flower width, and reduced ability to set seeds in the absence of pollinators contributing significantly. Plants in selfing populations had a generally higher reproductive success, with a higher number of flowers per plant, a smaller proportion of unfertilized ovules, a smaller proportion of fertilized ovules aborted, a higher rate of fruit set, and overall a larger number of seeds matured than did plants from the more outcrossing populations.

Plants grown under a nutrient regime excluding boron and those receiving 0.5 mg/litre boron had fewer stolons, reproductive stolons and inflorescences than those receiving 1, 2 or 3 mg/litre. Inflorescences were also smaller and had fewer seeds per floret. A boron concentration of 1 mg/litre gave optimum reproductive growth, higher levels of boron giving no further increase. Peduncle length and nectar quantity, but not nectar quality, were also influenced by boron indicating a possible beneficial effect of this element on pollinator activity.

Sexual dimorphisms in flower production and phenology were highly significant in this understory tree. On average, individual males produced 7.4 times as many flowers as did female trees. Staminate flowers lasted only a single day, whereas pistillate flowers lasted 3-4 days, during which they showed no significant decline in their ability to produce fruit after pollination. Individual male trees opened their flower buds asynchronously during the season, maximizing the number of days they were in flower. Individual females opened their buds more synchronously, maximizing their floral display at one point in time. Females produced fruits in numbers that were somewhat less than proportional to their flower production. Fruit development was initiated from only 38.9% and 69.5% of pistillate flowers in 1987 and 1988, respectively. By the time of ripening, an average female had lost 62.3%, 24.3%, and 11.1% of its initial fruit crop in 1986, 1987, and 1988, respectively. The proportion of fruit lost in 1986 was independent of the number of fruit that initially began development. In 1988, artifically supplementing pollen to a large number of flowers failed to increase either fruit or seed production relative to control branches with unsupplemented flowers. This suggested that resource levels were likely more important than pollen availability in limiting female reproductive success. These observations on I. opaca were consistent with the expectations for a population in which male reproductive success continues to benefit from continued pollinator service and female reproductive success does not. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.",Dioecy; Flowering phenology; Holly; Pollen limitation; Sexual selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026048952

The highest number of species in bloom was detected in March, while flowering and fruiting had ceased by June. Dependence on pollination vectors (insects or wind) for reproduction was ascertained by caging plants of the studied species with either mesh or acetate exclosures and comparing fruit set with that of uncaged individuals. Caging had little or no effect on the reproduction of most species. Facultative autogamy was widespread, and cleistogamy was detected in one species (Tuberaria inconspicua). Only two taxa (Andryala arenaria and Ononis broterana) showed zero fruit set when pollination vectors were excluded. Pollen-to-ovule (P: O) ratios were usually low (the median for the whole sample was 238), which is consistent with a high occurrence of self-pollination. A positive correlation was found between the P: O ratio and the date of flowering onset, indicating that the earlier the start of the blooming season, the more likely it is that the breeding system be dominated by autogamy. The reproductive characteristics of annuals contrast with those of co-occurring woody species previously studied at the same site. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026363783

Slight freezing damage was related to good field survival and tree condition at ten years of age. A large variation in the rate of cold acclimation within geographical regions indicates that the geographical origin alone is not a reliable selection criterion in breeding for hardiness.

A rapid and economic method for testing the hybrid purity of tomato F 1 seeds, based on the expected presence of Adh?1 alleles, was developed. The method is based on the analysis of the ADH variants by ultrathin?layer isoelectric focusing, pH range 310, of crude extracts from imbibed seeds followed by enzyme activity staining. The isoelectric points (pIS) of the ADH variants were estimated to be 5.5 and 5.7 for Adh?1+ and Adh?11; respectively. Using the procedure described and a newly developed sample applicator strip, it is Possible for one person to routinely analyze 1152 seeds per day using only a single electrophoresis unit. An investigation of a large number of inbred lines, both experimental and commercial hybrids, together with open?pollinated varieties, showed the potential of the method. Among F1 hybrids, a higher frequency of the Adh?11 allele was found than among open pollinated varieties, suggesting that F1 hybrid breeding has resulted in a higher frequency of Adh?11 alleles by selection of linked genes.

The pollinia are submerged into the viscous liquid of the stigmatic cup. This liquid contains the detached stigmatic cells and mucilage. Post-pollination phenomena within this species include a more intense perianth colour and the closure of the perianth. This is followed by the swelling of the column and ovary and, after 4 days, cell division in the ovary. Following pollination the pollinia break apart as the tetrads dissociate from each other. The pollen grains progressively hydrate and germinate from the outside of a pollinium to the inside. The changes in the pollen grains associated with hydration and germination are described. The stigmatic mucilage is considered essential in the hydration and germination of the pollen. The detached cells of the stigma located near the entrance to the stylar canal are seen to lose the starch from the amyloplasts after the pollen tubes have passed.

As the aim was to find strains with a single, varying nuclear locus for male sterility, cytoplasmic variation was avoided by starting with one open pollinated female. The progeny appeared to vary for a single locus with the homozygous recessive being male sterile. The locus was designated msl. Expected segregation ratios were disturbed by two different factors, both leading to a shortage of male steriles. An accidental drought in Petri dishes caused a relatively higher mortality of seedlings with a male sterility genotype in most cases. When this effect was avoided a systematic shortage of male steriles remained in many crosses. An experiment with varying levels of pollen competition justified the interpretation that selection at the gametophytic stage was involved. Pollen carrying the sterility allele was estimated to have a fertilization success relative to pollen with the restorer allele of 0.56. Finally the role of the msl locus in the genetics of male sterility in natural populations was assessed by crossing heterozygously and homozygously restored plants with male steriles collected from the wild. It appeared that the inheritance of male sterility is more complicated than the msl locus alone, which was expected. If the selection effects on the msl locus observed in this study occur in nature, this would have interesting consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of gynodioecy. © 1991 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",Cyanogenesis; Polymorphism; Trifoliumrepens; Whiteclover,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966194122

Twenty-eight and thirty-four plants from each family were transplanted to the field in two different locations, respectively. Pollen samples were collected from each plant and stained with acetocarmine glycerol jelly. Plants with over 95% unstainable pollen were considered male sterile. The families could be put into distinct classes according to the ratio of male sterile to male fertile plants; 3 sterile: 1 fertile (23 clones), 2 sterile: 3 fertile (24 clones), 1 sterile: 5 fertile (3 clones), and 0 sterile: 1 fertile (3 clones). Four families deviated significantly from any expected ratio. The variation for male fertility among families resides in the tetraploid parent, since the male parents have the same genotype (Ms/ms) for the Ms locus. The locus of this gene is very distal to the centromere such the 2n gametic output is 1 Ms/Ms : 2 Ms/ms : 1 ms/ms. The variation in male sterility is explained by the presence or absence of a dominant allele of a restorer gene (Rt) in tetraploid Tuberosum. This locus is also very distal to the centromere. The frequency of the Rt gene was estimated to be 0.20 in Tuberosum. The finding of Rt gene explains some of the conflicting results in male fertility of haploid Tuberosum x 2x cultivated and wild species hybrids. It also provides an opportunity to partially circumvent this male sterility.

In a previous paper, it was shown that the approach of flower?naive, untrained bumblebees toward flower dummies is released by colour signals, i.e. a gradient of spectral purity. The bumblebees are directed toward that part of a flower dummy which exhibits the highest spectral purity (Lunau 1990). In the present work it is shown that the bumblebees, while still in flight, make contact with this part using their antennal tips. The antennae reaction is followed by a landing reaction which is released by olfactory and optical signals. The specific optical signals of the guide area which release the landing reaction were investigated. Since in the flower dummies which were used, the guide had the highest spectral purity, most of the antennae reactions were executed at the guide. The antennae reaction allows for a precise orientation and may involve the stimulation of a specialized area of ommatidia. Minute changes in optical guide parameters could thus be detected. The following features of stamens which most effectively released the landing reaction were: a minimum of 2 theca dummies; an oval shape of theca dummies which face each other along the longitudinal axis (both these characteristics are found in genuine stamens); 4 mm distance between theca dummies (this coincides with the distance between the antennal tips of bumblebees); two equally sized theca dummies each with an area of 7 mm2 (this size of theca dummies was preferred over larger or smaller ones; the latter parameter was not changed when the corolla size was varied). Colour parameters are not involved in releasing the landing reaction. Clearly, bumblebees possess an innate releasing mechanism (IRM) that responds to optical signals of anthers which release the landing reaction. The experimental results are in accordance with conclusions drawn from the comparative studies of Osche (1979, 1983a, 1983b) that many flower guides can be interpreted as stamen mimics. Therefore stamens as well as stamen mimics represent a highly standardized signal for the insect pollinators and they are well suited for innate orientation at flowers. 1991 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990803712

Unfortunately, most studies fail to demonstrate that both participants benefit in any significant way and therefore lack the information necessary to determine whether a given interaction is mutualistic.

To determine whether there are any genetic differences within the species that might have a bearing on this problem, accessions of P. labillardieri from seven localities in south-eastern Australia were grown in a field nursery at Bathurst for comparison of their morphological attributes. Seeds from plants grown in this nursery were collected, and a further generation of plants was grown in a glasshouse for cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies. In adult plants of this generation, there were three karyotypic groups with chromosome numbers varying from 2n = 4x = 28, in nonglaucous tussocks of the Upper Hunter Valley, to 2n = 8x = 56, in glaucous tussocks from the Central and Southern Tablelands, to 2n = 12x = 84, in a Victorian coastal tussock. Because the number of chromosomes present in some seedlings from Cooma parents varied from 35 to 49 to 56, diploid or hexaploid plants must also have been present in the Bathurst nursery and contributed to the odd-ploidy seedling chromosome numbers. Ribosomal spacer DNA fragments were investigated using the wheat probe pTa250.4 to label homologous DNA sequences in genomic DNA extracted from the leaves of individual plants of P. labillardieri. Although specific DNA fragments could not be linked to either localities or levels of ploidy, they did show evidence of cross-pollination between plants of the different accessions. These levels of cytogenetic and DNA sequence variability, and the evidence they provide of widespread outcrossing within plants of similar ploidy and of hybridisation between plants of differing ploidy, may well help to explain the success of this species as a weed and affect the control measures used to stop its spread. © 1991, CSIRO.

They are also a time of many challenges. There are questions as to whether the creative innovations we envisage will be adequate to these challenges. How, for example, do we collectively sense and grasp a fragile new gestalt that is an emerging paradigm in embryonic form? This essay is an exercise in imagining how the creative imagination might be used some time in the future, possibly 500 years hence-unfettered and unconstrained by the obvious difficulties arising from our present priorities and understanding. The focus is on the contribution of the arts to more appropriate forms of policy making and to the design of more appropriate forms of social and conceptual structure.1 1 nt]One stimulus for this exercise has been the poverty of imagination associated with fictional and dramatic scenarios of how executive councils function in the distant future-as reflected in science fiction films and books. Even when entities gather from 'the 100 galaxies', thousands of years hence, their encounter (even through 'holographic projections') still seems to be modelled on the UN Security Council or its unfortunate imitations. This organizational archetype is no challenge to our imagination, especially when other styles might be more appropriate. The degree of innovation in such policy councils since classical Greek or Roman times is laughable compared to that in any technology. High-tech, Pentagon-style 'war rooms' and corporate 'situation rooms' do not empower participants to interweave value-laden views that differ and cross-pollinate in realms beyond the quantifiable. A second stimulus was the failure of artists to nourish our imaginations with better insights into the technicalities of governing our world-and specifically the failure of the poet Robert Graves in endeavouring to describe a country ruled by poets (in Seven Days in New Crete) and of Doris Lessing in her otherwise remarkable Canopus series. It is sad to see this same archetype impoverishing the gatherings of spiritual leaders of different faiths. © 1991.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041625504

However, the term andromonoecy appears to have been misused in the pollination ecology literature. In this note, we clarify the use of the terms andromonoecy and androgyny, and suggest that they should be applied with care, only after it is clear that the flowers lack ovules or that they possess dysfunctional gynoecia. These terms should not be applied to post?fertilization events which result in ovule abortion. Further, we review the current evidence for andromonoecy or androgyny in the Proteaceae, especially the genus Banksia, and present the results of studies on two additional Banksia species, B. spinulosa and B. ericifolia.

In this paper we seek to identify potential 'bottlenecks' limiting sexual or vegetative reproduction or its predictability for these plants. To this end we consider the regulation of seed production, seed fate, vegetative propagule production, and vegetative propagule fate in turn, both in general terms and for the perennial Vallisneria americana Michx. in particular. Plant biomass appears to be an important determinant of the incidence of flowering for greenhouse-grown Vallisneria americana: 88% of 425 plants either failed to flower if below a threshold dry weight of 0.75 g, or flowered if above it. The number of flowers (in females) or inflorescences (in males), however, was only moderately well correlated with Vallisneria biomass, and the flowering 'threshold rule' weakened considerably in the field. Closer examination of the dependence of seed output on plant biomass and pollination intensity, and of the importance of seed or fruit abortion is needed for submersed species. Our ignorance of seed fate is exemplified by the paucity of quantitative studies on dispersal distances and seed deposition patterns, on seed banks, and on features of seed microenvironments pertinent to germination, although the sensitivity of seed dormancy and germination to a variety of environmental conditions has been tested in the laboratory for many species. Further, losses of seeds and seedlings as a result of unfavorable environments, sediment disturbance, flotation, pathogens, and herbivores are generally not well characterized. Overall, the principal limiting step for sexual reproduction may in some cases be lack of floral induction, and in others, ineffective pollination, but dispersal away from the local population, failure of seeds to germinate, and the challenges of seedling establishment cannot be ruled out. Plant size is well correlated with vegetative propagule production for both greenhouse and field Vallisneria populations. As with seed germination, the germination of vegetative propagules has been relatively well studied in the laboratory, but important regulators of germination and establishment in the field warrant further study. We suggest that more investigations at two interfaces of physiological ecology and demography may be particularly fruitful. Regarding propagule production, experimental focus on allocation patterns which 'translate' accumulated resources into seeds or vegetative propagules should prove rewarding. Regarding propagule fate, post-dispersal mortality of seeds and vegetative propagules may be rooted in phytiological tolerance limits, but could also be attributable to pathogen or herbivore attack. © 1991.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026274331

All F1 plants showed a half-compatible reaction whilst segregation occurred in the F2 into half- and fully-self-compatible classes. The latter plants bred true in the F3 whilst the former once again showed the same pattern of segregation. These results indicate that the control of self-compatibility is by a single gene (Sc) which is gametophytic in action. Further analysis of an intra-F2 pollination diallel and of reciprocal cross-pollinations between F2 and F1 plants reveal that this gene is additional to the SZ incompatibility system. © 1991 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.,Gametophytic; Incompatibility; Lolium perenne; Pollen; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966158041

The studies were conducted at Kabete Campus, University of Nairobi and National Horticultural Research Station, Thika, during the months April to August 1988 and October 1988 to February 1989. The mean intra specific out crossing rate estimates for A. hypochondriacus and A. cruentus were 10.4 % and 10.9 % respectively. The mean inter specific out crossing rate involving population 1024 as the dominant marker parent and 1034 as the recessive marker was 1.2 percent. The study involving population 434 as the dominant marker parent gave the mean inter specific out crossing rate as 6.5 percent. The intra specific and inter specific out crossing rate estimates showed substantial variation. Significant differences in out crossing rate estimates were noted due to locational and seasonal variations. The factors probably contributing to the variations were believed to be locational and seasonal differences in pollinator density and differences among the populations.

Viable progeny were obtained following self-pollination and allozyme analysis indicated that these progeny were the result of selfing and not agamospermy. This species is not an obligate outcrosser and does not have a classical pre-zygotic self-incompatibility system. However, outcross pollen may have an advantage over self pollen and this species may thus be preferentially outcrossing. The pollen: ovule ratios (mean 3186 ± 48.5) were consistent with this hypothesis. Allele frequencies at allozyme loci diferred little between populations, with an estimated 97% of the variation within populations. There was no correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance.

In open plantings, e.g., space?plant nurseries, selfing rates are increased by increased within plant pollination by bumblebees, the primary pollinators of C. lanceolata in temperate zones. The movement of pollinators between plants is enforced in dense plantings. We found C. lanceolata is predominantly al?logamous, but selfing rates as great as 39.0 % were observed among space?plants; thus, the progeny of an open?pollinated individual plant grown in this type of nursery is a mixed half?sib and S1 family.

Beside these S-glycoproteins, presence of heterozygote specific proteins was also pointed out, suggesting occurrence of posttranscriptional modification of these proteins.

E. cladocalyx trees ranged from self compatible to self incompatible. Reductions were seen in both the number of capsules and the numbers of seeds per capsule, from self pollination. The mechanism of self incompatibility was investigated in the pistii by following the success of cross and self pollinations with fluorescence microscopy. In E. cladocalyx and E. leptophylla no reduction in ovule penetration was seen from self pollination while in E. spathulata a significant reduction was seen in two trees but not the third, indicating that the post-zygotic mechanism of self incompatibility operates in all three species, and with mixed pre-zygotic and post-zygotic mechanisms in E. spathulata. Floral architecture differed between the three species in the structure of the inflorescence units, flower morphology, and anther, pollen and ovule numbers per flower.

Variation in resource allocation was largely determined by the seed parent. Pollen donor effects were limited to differences between self vs. non-self pollinations, suggesting that inbreeding depression following mating events between related individuals is the source of any variation among pollen donors on differential resource allocation to developing seed and fruit. Once the effect of inbreeding was removed, however, pollination date and ovule position played larger roles than pollen source. Since there was no detectable variation among male pollen donors in their ability to accrue resources from the female seed parent apart from inbreeding effects, it is concluded that the opportunity for postzygotic mate choice is limited. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026301425

I show that pyrrolizidine alkaloids in artificial nectar also inhibit at least one butterfly, Agraulis vanillae (Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae), a more general forager. Inhibition was demonstrated in two ways: quantity of nectar consumed and number of artificial flowers visited. The amount of sucrose solution consumed by individual butterflies was measured using a microcapillary tube. Number of flower visits was determined using an array of artificial orange and yellow flowers. A. vanillae drank less sucrose solution with monocrotaline, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid, than without. When monocrotaline was placed into yellow flowers, A. vanillae learned to visit predominantly orange flowers. Evolutionarily, pyrrolizidine alkaloids in nectar may represent an adaptation to exclude butterflies. Ithomiines and danaines, seeking these compounds in larval food plants, were not excluded. Alternatively, ithomiines and danaines overcame the nectar defense. In either case, the plant effectively increased floral constancy by inhibiting generalist butterflies and attracting specialists. © 1991 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",agraulis vanillae; Danainae; Heliconiinae; Ithomiinae; Lepidoptera; nectar constituents; Nymphalidae; pollination; Pyrrolizidine alkaloids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000228151

Alaska) has been investigated. Killing the ovules on day 0 (anthesis) or day 1 prevented fruit?set and resulted in ovary degeneration. When the ovules were destroyed at later stages the ovaries developed, though the rate of growth of the pod was reduced significantly. Pollination in pea occurs normally the day before anthesis, and fertilization of the egg cell 32 to 48 h later. The first divisions of the zygote and endosperm nuclei started simultaneously (ca 48 h after pollination) but the endosperm developed more rapidly than the embryo; the embryo sac cavity was lined with free endosperm nuclei at the time of beginning suspensor elongation. Extracts of endosperm and ovule coats from ovules at day 7 after anthesis showed fruit?set activity in pea, the latter material having about 3 times more activity than the former per ovule basis.

Kernels in the apical region of the ear are more severely affected than basally positioned kernels. We hypothesized that water deficit during early endosperm development might inhibit kernel growth by decreasing endosperm cell division, and that this response might be mediated by changes in endosperm abscisic acid (ABA) levels. Greenhouse-grown maize, cultivar Pioneer 3925, was subjected to water limitation from 1 to 15 days after pollination (DAP), spanning the period of endosperm cell division and induction of storage product accumulation. Water deficit decreased the number of endosperm nuclei during the treatment period; the most substantial effect was in the apical region of ears. Correspondingly, endosperm fresh weight, starch accumulation and dry mass at maturity were decreased by water limitation. Abscisic acid concentrations in endosperm were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Water deficit increased ABA concentration in apical-region endosperm by fourfold compared to controls. ABA concentrations were also increased in middle and basal regions of the ear, but to a lesser extent. Two key enzymes in the starch synthesis pathway, sucrose synthase and granule-bound ADP-glucose starch synthase, and zein, the major storage protein in maize endosperm, were studied as markers of storage product synthesis. Water deficit did not affect sucrose synthase enzyme activity or RNA transcript abundance relative to total RNA. However, ADP-glucose starch synthase activity and RNA transcript abundance decreased slightly in apical-region endosperm of water-limited plants by 15 DAP, compared with well-watered controls. In contrast to starch, there was no treatment effect on the accumulation of zein, evaluated at either the polypeptide or RNA level. We conclude that under the conditions tested, the establishment of starch and zein synthetic potential in endosperm was only slightly affected by plant water deficit during the early phase of kernel growth, and that capacity for growth and starch accumulation was affected by the extent to which cell division was inhibited. Based on correlative changes in ABA concentration and cell division we suggest that ABA may play a role in inhibiting endosperm cell division during water limitation.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000611322

Visits of small native bees significantly increased paternal success while those of honey bees Apis mellifera reduced male fitness. Only visits by large native bees had discernible effects on recipient fecundity and, overall, fecundity was not limited by visitation. Maternal plants bearing large-petalled flowers produced fewer flowers during the experiment, reducing their total seed production.

In crosses between hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; AABBDD) and Aegilops squarrosa L. (DD) or T. urartu Thum. (AA), this bottleneck may be overcome simply by pollinating a sufficient number of F1 spikes. However, hybrids between hexaploid wheat cultivars (T. aestivum) and T. monococcum L. (AA) generally are highly female?sterile, often having no pistils. One T. monococcum accession, PI 355520, when crossed with T. aestivum, produced hybrids with female fertility in the same range as that of T. aestivum/A. squarrosa or T. aestivum/T. urartu hybrids, ca. 0.5 to 1.0 backcross seed per spike. We found that female fertility was controlled by two duplicate genes in PI 355520, and that this accession can be used as a bridging parent to introgress genes from other T. monococcum accessions into hexaploid wheat. Pairing of homologous chromosomes was less frequent and weaker in such crosses than in T. aestivum/A. squarrosa crosses, but homoeologous bivalents occurred at a rate of almost 0.5 II per cell. Restitution division was detected in crosses involving all three diploid species and was confirmed cytologically in crosses with PI 355520. Chromosome numbers of BC1F1 plants ranged from 35 to 67; plants with 49 or more chromosomes occurred at frequencies of 0.09 to 0.21 among progeny of A. squarrosa and T. urartu and 0.29 in progeny of T. aestivum/T. monococcum crosses involving PI 355520. These results are consistent with those of previous studies, demonstrating the potential of direct Hexaploid/diploid crosses for rapidly introgressing useful genes into Hexaploid wheat with minimum disturbance of the background genotype.

The species exploiting F. pertusa feed on nourishing tissue that they induce within fig ovaries that are unexploited by the pollinators, rather than on developing pollinators or seeds. Thus, in this case any costs to the mutualists should be indirect and probably small. F. pertusa's torymid species can only reproduce if females have oviposited within pollinated syconia, since trees abscise nearly all unpollinated ones early in development. Torymid oviposition was delayed relative to pollination, and in the one species investigated, females discriminated among syconia and chose to oviposit in pollinated ones. Offspring depend on the pollinators' male offspring to create an escape passage out of the mature syconium, and maturation times of all wasp species within the syconium are highly synchronized. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026273537

The start of the Alnus pollen season varied between 27th January and 16th February in the Italian stations while in The Netherlands it showed an average delay of about one month. For Populus the beginning of the pollen season was delayed on an average 15 days at Dutch places compared to central Italy. In the former it varied between 14th March and 21st April while in the latter between 28th February and 24th March. Significant correlations exist between the beginning of pollination for these taxa and temperature conditions in the preceding periods. The highest correlations found were with daily mean decade temperature for three decades before the average starting dates of the pollen season.

These fitness components were measured for individual plants in several populations of Ipomopsis aggregata. Plants whose flowers had highly exserted stigmata and spent a high proportion of time in the pistillate phase received more pollen per flower. Hand-pollinations showed that female RS was strongly limited by low levels of pollen, but within natural populations female RS did not increase with mean pollen received per flower. Only number of flowers and number of seeds set per grain of pollen correlated positively with female RS. Even though hummingbirds exerted significant selection through female function, net selection was not predictable from pollination success alone. Instead, selection was modified by events during flower production, seed formation, and predispersal seed predation. Net selection on proportion pistillate was stabilizing. Selection on flowering date reversed direction over the life cycle, but net selection strongly favored early blooming. Selection on corolla length varied from year to year, which may help explain the high level of phenotypic variation. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0026269463

At this stage they were not capable of withstanding desiccation treatment. The desiccation tolerance was acquired at a stage of development which depended on the rate of water loss to which embryos were subjected. Coincident with the acquisition of tolerance to a rapid desiccation, they gained the capacity to withstand 24 h preincubation in agitated water; this acquisition could be correlated to a sharp decrease of the leaching of electrolytes, amino acids and proteins in the incubation water, suggesting that a change in membrane properties played a key role in this transition. Moreover, the acquisition of tolerance to these stresses was coincident with the increase of endogenous abscisic acid (ABA). ABA applied in vitro to young embryos induced tolerance both to desiccation and to preincubation in water: this in vitro acquisition of tolerance was again correlated with a decrease in the leakage. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

More than 1700 HS clones were screened for the occurrence and frequency of 2n eggs through 2x × 4x crosses during two pollination periods. The resulting seed/fruit provides an estimate of 2n egg frequency. About 650 HS clones produced 2n eggs; 63 had 10114 seeds/fruit; and 27 were selected for good tuber type. There was a large variation in seed set after 2x × 4x crosses, both within and between clones. Comparison of fruit and seed set between the two pollination periods using the same 595 clones indicated that environmental factor significandy affected 2n egg frequency. The mode of 2n egg formation was mainly due to omission of the second meiotic division controlled by a recessive gene (os). The gene frequency for os varied from 0.28 to 0.76 among six, 2x taxa. Both additive and dominance variance were significant for seed set after 2x × 4x crosses. Narrow sense heritability was estimated as 0.24. The average degree of dominance was equal to 1.66 which could indicate overdominance. Alternatively, this could be due to linkage disequilibrium, i.e. pseudooverdominance. However, dominance variance was greater than the additive variance indicating recurrent selection can be useful for improving the frequency of 2n egg production in the 2x population.

Seed development was complete 25-27 days after pollination, with rapid triacylglycerol deposition occurring between 9 and 24 days. PtdCho amounts increased until day 15 after pollination. Analysis of embryo lipids showed that the diacylglycerol (DAG) pool consisted of mainly long-chain molecular species, with a very small amount of mixed medium-chain/long-chain glycerols. Almost 100% of the fatty acid at position sn-2 in triacylglycerols (TAG) was decanoic acid. When equimolar mixtures of [14C]decanoic and [14C]oleic acid were fed to whole detached embryos, over half of the radioactivity in the DAG resided in [14C]oleate, whereas [14C]decanoic acid accounted for 93% of the label in the TAG. Microsomal preparations from developing embryos at the mid-stage of TAG accumulation catalysed the acylation of [14C]glycerol 3-phosphate with either decanoyl-CoA or oleoyl-CoA, resulting in the formation of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), DAG and TAG. Very little [14C]glycerol entered PtdCho. In combined incubations, with an equimolar supply of [14C]oleoyl-CoA and [14C]decanoyl-CoA in the presence of glycerol 3-phosphate, the synthesized PtdCho species consisted to 95% of didecanoic and dioleic species. The didecanoylglycerols were very selectively utilized over the dioleoylglycerols in the production of TAG. Substantial amounts of [14]oleate, but not [14C]decanoate, entered PtdCho. The microsomal preparations of developing embryos were used to assess the acyl specificities of the acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT, EC 2.3.1.15) and the acyl-CoA:sn-1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (LPAAT, EC 2.3.1.51) in Cuphea lanceolata embryos. The efficiency of acyl-CoA utilization by the GPAT was in the order decanoyl = dodecanoyl &gt; linoleoyl &gt; myristoyl = oleoyl &gt; palmitoyl. Decanoyl-CoA was the only acyl donor to be utilized to any extent by the LPAAT when sn-decanoylglycerol 3-phosphate was the acyl acceptor. sn-1-Acylglycerol 3-phosphates with acyl groups shorter than 16 carbon atoms did not serve as acyl acceptors for long-chain (? 16 carbon atoms) acyl-CoA species.

Two to three days after reaching the stage of full flower opening, this banner spot develops a pinkish blush and is deep magenta after a further 24 h. The development of this pigmentation is accelerated by exposure to ethylene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flowers with a pinkish banner spot produced the greatest amounts of ethylene and production was much lower in flowers which had either completed the colour change or in which the banner spot colour remained unchanged. Treatments such as stigma removal or pollination increased the rate of ethylene production. Dissection of the flowers showed that while the banner spot is changing colour there is no change in the rate of production of ethylene from the standard, i.e. from the banner spot or surrounding tissue. The major sites of production at this time are the keel and pistil.Isolated flowers withered within 2 d of removal from the plant and therefore did not show any change in the colour of the banner spot unless exposed to ethylene. The increase in banner spot pigment was about fourfold when isolated floweres were exposed to ethylene (0·24 ?l 1-1): however, the increase was less than twofold when isolated standards were exposed to ethylene (0·27 ?l I-1). Application of silver thiosulphate (STS) to intact isolated flowers, as a 1 h pulse prior to ethylene exposure, partially prevented the pigment accumulation, whilst a continuous supply of STS reduced the ethylene-induced colour change by approx. 50% Low concentrations of cycloheximide (CHI) (0·01 mg ml-1) reduced the accumulation of pigment in the banner spot of ethylene-treated flowers, and higher concentrations (1·0 mg ml-1) completely prevented the ethylene-induced colour change. © 1990 Annals of Botany Company.",Ethylene; Flower senescence; Lupinus albifrons; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249018248

Biosynthesis of roridins in B. coridifolia appears to be linked to pollination, and the phytotoxins then accumulate in the seed. The roles of the phytotoxins in pollination, seed maturation, and germination of the Baccharis species were investigated. The high production of roridins occurred only in seeds resulting from intraspecific pollination, and the concentration of the toxins in the seeds generally increased with seed maturity. Removal of seed coats from trichothecene-producing Brazilian Baccharis species (B. coridifolia and B. megapotamica) and non-trichothecene-producing American Baccharis species (B. halimifolia and B. glutinosa) resulted in improved seed germination of B. halimifolia and B. glutinosa but complete inhibition of seed germination of B. coridifolia and B. megapotamica. Addition of seed coat extracts of the Brazilian Baccharis species of dilute solutions (10-6?g/ml) of roridins or baccharinoids to the decoated seeds of B. coridifolia and B. megapotamica resulted in germination, while seeds of B. halimifolia and B. glutinosa were killed by the phytotoxins. Roridins interacted with gibberellic acid, a germination promoter, but not with abscisic acid, a germination inhibitor.

By optimalization and changing the culture conditions, we were able to regulate the maintenance of the earlier, more synchronous (Type II) and the later, asynchronous (Type I) in vitro embryogenesis, as well as the shift between different ontogenic stages. Within 70 days after the inoculation of immature embryos a relatively homogeneous, early-embryogenic suspension culture usable for protoplast isolation was established from the initially surface-grown cultures. Using modified solutions for protoplast isolation and culture, viable protoplasts were reproducibly obtained from which plants were regenerated via defined ontogenic steps. Despite the long in vitro history of the parental genotypes, 60-70% of the more than 500 plants derived from the HE/89 protoplasts set seeds following self or sib-pollination. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Plant regeneration; Protoplast technology; Somatic embryogenesis; Synthetic genotype,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001061228

The proportion of flat non-viable beans to fully formed, viable beans in the pods increased with an increase in dosage of gamma rays. At 60 Gy all the beans produced were flat and non-viable, beyond this dosage fruit set was zero. Pollinating the self-incompatible cacao clones with a 1 : 1 mixture of compatible mentor pollen irradiated at 60 Gy and normal self pollen produced a mixture of flat, non-viable beans and fully-formed viable beans. Similar experiments using irradiated pollen with a marker gene suggested that the fully-formed viable beans resulted from selfing. Increasing the proportion of the radiation-treated compatible pollen in the mixture increased the number of fully-formed beans. However, when compatible pollen which had been treated either at 80 Gy or with temperatures of 35° C, 40° C and 45° C for periods of five, ten and fifteen minutes in factorial combination were mixed with self pollen, no successful pollinations were achieved. Pollen viability tests indicated that, whilst pollen treated at 60 Gy were about 50% viable, those treated at either 80 Gy or with temperatures of 35-45° C were mostly not viable. This suggests that, to overcome the incompatibility in cacao, the tubes of the mentor pollen grains used should at least grow into the style. The possible causes for overcoming the self-incompatibility in cacao are discussed. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",axit spot; cacao; flat beans; gamma irradiation; mentor pollen; pollen mixture; temperature treatment; Theobroma cacao,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000319901

The exudivorous yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis) was observed to feed extensively (70% of the total feeding observation time) on the nectar of all species of Eucalyptus present at a site in southeastern Australia. Gliders harvested nectar, and presumably pollen also, whenever eucalypt flowers were available and selected trees with 2-3 times as many flowers as that on trees randomly selected along a transect. The abundance of flowering trees varied temporally and, at times when few flowering trees were present, gliders chose trees with fewer flowers than at times when flowering trees were abundant. When flowering trees were superabundant or scarce, there was no relationship between the number of flowers in a tree and the duration of visits by gliders. However, at intermediate levels of abundance, the amount of time a glider spent in a tree was related to the number of flowers in a tree. Gliders devoted 90% of the time outside their dens to foraging and the above relationship is suggested to reflect two foraging options which maximize net energy gain for different abundances of flowering trees. Although gliders spent considerable lengths of time in individual trees feeding, initial deposition of cross pollen when gliders first arrive in a tree may be substantial and thus, may provide significant amounts of outcrossing for these eucalypts. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Foraging behaviour; Marsupial; Nectar feeding; Petaurus australis; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025628846

Most of these Fusarium fungi are soil-inhabiting and may grow on dead organic material as well as on living plants. Scab in wheat is recognized by the appearance of one or more prematurely blighted spikelets after flowering. The infected spikelets develop a bleached straw color, in contrast to the normal green of healthy spikelets. Spikelet infections, which result in scab, occur via airborne conidia during the flowering or grain-filling period. Scab fusaria multiply on infected residues, including those of corn. During warm, moist weather, fungal spores are windblown and infection occurs during pollination when the fungus becomes established on the exposed anthers and then grows into the kernels, glumes, or other parts of the head. Fusarium molds produce a long list of chemically unrelated mycotoxins, including diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), T-2 toxin, HT-toxin, neosolaniol, vomitoxin (or DON), and zearalenone.

(1) Mating and competition for paternity in the sea often differs. Female gametes are often spawned freely. Passively dispersed spermatophores could in some cases provide single paternity to an entire clutch of offspring. Penises of sessile animals reach far for copulation. There are no pollinators. (2) In many clades of benthic marine animals, greater dispersal of offspring is associated with large adult size, and greater parental care of offspring and reduced planktonic larval periods are associated with small adult size. (3) Many benthic marine animals are colonies with modular construction, and these also commonly brood embryos and have short-lived larvae, in contrast to related solitary forms. (4) Unlike dispersal of terrestrial animals, larval dispersal of marine animals is often obligate with sexual reproduction and often includes a precompetent period during which larvae cannot settle at good sites. Unlike terrestrial seeds, marine larvae have no clear adaptations for dispersal, often grow during dispersal, and often leave bad sites. Feeding planktonic larvae are common among marine animals and rare among other aquatic animals, perhaps because of persistent aquatic routes between habitable sites for marine animals. Peculiarities in marine life histories may influence many aspects of evolution in the sea. Closely related sedentary marine animals can differ greatly in larval dispersal with consequences for recruitment to populations, genetic exchange between benthic populations, adaptation to local conditions, sex allocation, interaction with kin, speciation, and extinction. © 1990 by the American Society of Zoologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957217186

Pioneer 3925) subjected to post-anthesis water stress during the first 2 weeks of kernel development had lower leaf-water potentials and higher leaf-ABA concentrations than well-watered controls. There was a concomitant rise in ABA concentration in kernel tissues 3 and 7 d after pollination (DAP), after which the concentration decreased to control levels by 13 DAP. Kernel water potential, however, remained unchanged by the water stress. Radiolabelled ABA, fed to a leaf, was translocated to kernels, where free ABA as well as several ABA metabolites were the major labelled fractions. This suggested that the stress-induced kernel ABA was of maternal origin. Since ABA plays a putative role in seed maturation of several crop species, and applied ABA or water stress often hastens seed development, we expected that a water-stress-induced rise in kernel ABA concentration early in grain development may serve to prematurely induce storage-product accumulation. Zein, starch and several enzymes key to the starch synthesis pathway followed the same course of induction throughout the experiment, with no difference between treatments Hence it was concluded that although water stress increased kernel ABA independent of kernel water status, there was no apparent effect of water stress or ABA on timing of early kernel developmental processes. © 1990 Annals of Botany Company.",Abscisic acid; Endosperm development; Maize; Water stress; Zea mays L. cv.

The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate genetic variation for seed yield components and other traits among clones from three perennial ryegrass cultivars differing in seed yield and their open-pollinated progenies. Per cultivar, a random set of 50 genotypes was cloned and on each genotype seed was generated by open pollination. Clonal ramets of the parents were observed for 17 traits in 1986 at two locations. In 1987 and 1988, parents and progenies were observed as single plants in a randomized complete block design with two replications. There was little cultivar-environment interaction for most traits. The parents differed significantly for almost all traits. Half-sib (HS) families differed for only three to five traits. Broad-sense heritabilities (h2b), based on variance components of the parents, were moderate to high; earliness had the highest hb2. Narrow-sense heritabilities (h2n), based on variance components among HS-families, were low to moderate and mostly not significant; for most traits h2n estimates varied between years and cultivars. Flag leaf width and date of first anthesis showed the highest h2n. Narrow-sense heritability estimates from parent-offspring regressions (h2nPO) ranged from non-significant to high, depending on year and cultivar; they were generally higher than the corresponding h2n estimates. Generally, h2nPO was highest for earliness, flag leaf width, ear length and the number of spikelets per ear. Breeding methods that capitalize on additive genetic variance, such as mass selection, should result in improvement for these traits. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",genetic variation; Heritability; Lolium perenne; parent-offspring regression; registration characters; seed yield components; spaced plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011271194

Combined behavioral and chemical analyses were conducted under natural and controlled conditions. First the distribution of forager bees' visits on two pairs of sunflower genotypes producing a different level of hybrid seed yield was recorded under pollen-proof tunnels. Mirasol parental lines producing high seed yields were visited at random, whereas forager bees visited preferentially the female parental line of Marianne, resulting in low seed yield. Nectar samples collected on the genotypes were analyzed by gas chromatography. Fructose, glucose, and sucrose were identified. Parental lines of Mirasol showed similar sugar profiles, whereas the female line of Marianne contained higher amounts of sucrose than the male line. We assume that the bees' preferences between genotypes might rely on differences in the sugar composition of floral nectars, especially in the amount of sucrose. Aromas from headspace collection were compared between pairs and periodically during the flowering period. Of the 144 components indexed for Marianne lines and 136 components for Mirasol lines, 17 of the components for Marianne lines and 18 for Mirasol lines differed significantly according to flowering stage. Significant differences appeared in eight of the 134 components of Marianne lines and in 20 of the 250 components for Mirasol lines. Such differences, even restricted to a few components, might account for honeybees' discrimination between genotypes or flowering stage. Experiments then were conducted in a flight room using an artificial flower device. A total volatile extract was used as a conditioning scent previous to the test where the total extract was successively compared to several of its subfractions. Fractions significantly less visited than the total extract were discarded, whereas fractions confused with the total extract were kept. From step to step, a restricted fraction of 28 polar components, among which 15 were identified, was shown to be as active as the initial conditioning extract. These data emphasized honeybees' abilities to generalize from simplified to more complex chemical information. Finally, this work considers the possible use of such plant chemicals, from nectars or aromas, either as targets for genetic modification of crop plants or as direct attractants when sprayed on the crop, for the improvement of entomophilous cross pollination. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Apidae; Apis mellifera; aroma; conditioning; foraging behavior; Helianthus annuus; honeybee; Hymenoptera; nectar; olfactory discrimination; plant chemicals; pollination; Sunflower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001035220

This study was donducted in order to identify genotypes with small blossom-end scar and to estimate the genetic variation and the heritability of the trait. The blossom-end scar size (BSS) of 27 genotypes, 18 open pollinated varieties and breeding lines and 9 F1's, grown in 3 fields representing spring, summer, and winter production, was recorded. The genotypes' BSS was distributed in a continuous bi-modal fashion. A few genotypes exhibited consistently small BSS, and line N-643 the smallest one. The genetic variance component for BSS was 3, 2.1, and 2.5 in fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The other major source of variation was fruits within plants. Single plant heritability estimates were 0.71 and 0.72 in fields 1 and 2. Single plot heritability estimates were 0.92, 0.75, and 0.81, in fields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Joint analysis of all the fields revealed relatively small, though significant genotype by environment interaction. It was concluded that it should be possible to select for genotypes with small blossom-end scar. Such genotypes are likely to have small BSS in a wide range of environments. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",blossom-end scar; catfacing; genetic variation; heritability; Lycopersicon esculentum; tomato fruit,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249964210

Acmena is well or under-represented, and while Eucalyptus is well-represented by its pollen in sclerophyll forests, where it is the dominant tree, it is over-represented in rainforest stands, suggesting it has effective dispersal and deposition.

Some trends in pollen characters are closely correlated with trends towards specialisation in macromorphological characters. The structure of the colpate/colporate aperture and its associated aperture membrane/operculum is described in the tribe Amorpheae. Here the genera Apoplanesia, Eysenhardtia and most species of Errazurizia have small tricolporate pollen with a granular colpus membrane and complete tectum. The pollen of Amorpha, Parryella and one species of Errazurizia have tricolporate pollen with an operculum and reticulate tectum. Dalea, Marina and Psorothamnus have larger tricolpate, operculate, reticulate pollen. Some species of the genus Mucuna have pollen with a columellate interstitium while others have a granular interstitium. These types correspond in general with the proposed macromorphologically based division of the genus. Supratectal verrucate ornamentation occurs in some neotropical species of Mucuna.

Sparse psammophilous vegetation is found within the hyperarid zone. It primarily produces pollen of Cyperus conglomeratus and Calligonum. Within the arid zone pollen of Chenopodiaceae, Plantago and insect-pollinated herbaceous vegetation dominates. Artemisia pollen becomes important within semi-arid climates. Both Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae are characteristic of highly continental climates with cold winters and dry summers. Because Artemisia pollen increases and Chenopodiaceae decreases with decreasing aridity the ratio of their pollen (C/A) is used as a moisture indicator. This ratio should be applied within narrow geographical limits and within non-forested areas. Grasses (Poaceae) are not well-adapted to climates with summer drought and their pollen percentages are low in most of the region. They are somewhat higher where favorable edaphic conditions occur or where summers are less arid. A low C/A during the pleniglacial suggests moist conditions with a rainfall regime similar to today. Increases in Chenopodiaceae pollen at the expense of Artemisia indicate intense aridity during late glacial times. An early Holocene phase of summer rainfall is evident in the region-wide replacement of Chenopodiaceae/Artemisia vegetation by grasses and in the spread of deciduous trees in less arid sites. © 1990.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025585854

This may be one reason why ant pollination is rare. It is predicted that pollination by ants is possible only in the presence of certain ant and/or plant traits. Two traits are investigated; first, absence of the metapleural glands, and second, the presence of stigmatic secretions that insulate pollen from the ant integument. The pollinator of the orchid Leporella fimbriata is the ant Myrmecia urens. Only one caste is involved, the winged males, and they differ significantly from the queen and worker castes in that they do not possess metapleural glands. This paper reports experiments which test for differential effects on pollen between the males and other castes and evaluates the importance of stigmatic secretions. The results show that the absence of metapleural glands makes no difference as all three castes have strong disruptive effect on pollen artificially applied to the integument. However, during pollination the orchid secures the pollen mass to the ant surface by stigmatic secretions and normal pollen function, fruit production and seed set occur. It appears that both ant and plant traits are pre-adaptive having evolved for functions other than ant pollination. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Ant; Antibiotic; Metapleural gland; Pollen; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025595299

Once during fruit and seed growth, the subtending leaf was exposed to 14CO2, and translocation of labelled photoassimilate was recorded by macro- and microautoradiography. Phloem transport into the raphe occurred in both fruits with fertilized and fruits with non-fertilized ovules. Since empty ovules showed some sink strength, it is assumed that growth of vegetative seed-tissue signalizes the retardation of completion of the abscission process.

The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in carbon and nitrogen accumulation and partitioning under drought stress among maize hybrids that differ in yield potential and/or physiological metabolism during reproductive development. The hybrids B73 × LH38, FS854, B73×Mol7 and US13 were subjected to drought stress from the 7th leaf stage until pollination was completed, at which time the soil of the stressed plots was replenished with water. For d. wt and chemical constituent determinations, plants of each hybrid were harvested from the irrigated and drought stressed plots at silking, mid-grain fill, and physiological maturity. Averaged over hybrids, vegetative biomass at silking was reduced 25% as a result of the drought stress treatment, with B73 × LH38 and FS854 accumulating more total biomass during the later portion of grain fill than the other two hybrids under both soil moisture treatments. At silking, the total non-structural carbohydrate content of the hybrids' vegetative tissue was not changed as a result of drought stress, whereas their reduced nitrogen (N) contents were decreased by an average of 33%. B73 × LH38 and FS854 had greater grain carbohydrate and reduced N contents under irrigation and smaller decreases in those variables as a result of soil moisture deficit than did the other two hybrids. These results indicate that the greater drought tolerance of B73 × LH38 and FS854 to stress imposed during vegetative and early reproductive development resulted from their more active N uptake and assimilation and sugar production during the later portion of grain fill and from their more efficient partitioning of assimilate to the developing kernels. © 1990 Annals of Botany Company.",Carbohydrates; Drought stress; Hybrids; Maize; Nitrogen; Partitioning; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249017917

The net efflux of CO2 from female cones, vegetative and male cone-bearing buds decreased exponentially with increasing quantum flux density. A simple model was derived relating temperature and quantum flux density to the net CO2 efflux from female cones. This model was used to estimate the net respiratory losses from female cones from a few weeks after pollination until the cones senesced with the light regime normally experienced at Edinburgh (56° N). It was estimated that during that period the net respiration rate of female cones was 25% less than their dark respiration rate. This model was also used to estimate the net respiratory losses from an estimated crop of female cones in two forest stands and the simulation model MAESTRO was used to estimate the CO2 assimilated by the needles on the trees over the same days.

Although each stem produces an average of 26 capitate inflorescences only 12% of those inflorescences will open each day to disperse and receive polyads. Each inflorescence may live up to 48 hours but anthers abscise by late afternoon on the first day and the filaments change color and lose their scent.

They are nectarless. Bombyliid flies and male bees are infrequent floral foragers so the major pollinators include female bees representing five families;Anthophoridae, Apidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae. All foraging insects ignore second day inflorescences although stigmas are still receptive. Although 97% of all bees collected on S. nuttallii carry Schrankia polyads in their scopae or corbiculae 59% also carry the pollen/pollinaria of one or more coblooming angiosperms. At least 98% of all bees carrying mixed pollen loads incorporate the pollen/pollinaria of one or more nectariferous taxa (e.g. Asclepias spp., Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Delphinium spec., etc.). Species of halictid bees are more likely to carry pure loads of S. nuttallii polyads (70%) than bees of the four remaining families. Due to the nectarless florets and high degree of polylectic foraging bee-pollination in S. nuttallii converges more closely with the pollination systems of some Australian Acacia spp. than with most other xeric/tropical genera of mimosoids studied in the western hemisphere. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; anthecology; Bee-pollination; Halictidae; Mimosaceae; Schrankia nuttallii,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2642641292

When related to taxa with known breeding systems, it is found that low SPGs and high P:O ratios characterize xenogamous plants, high SPGs and low P:Os characterize autogamous plants. There is a significant negative correlation between P:O ratio and SPG in the whole family as well as in certain genera. Both measures can serve as reliable indicators of the breeding systems in taxa of the Polemoniaceae and can be measured in dried or living specimens. Accordingly, most polemons feature ""mixed"" breeding system, i.e. facultative xenogamy or facultative autogamy. Xenogamy is common among the tropical genera and in the Leptodactylon, Phlox and Polemonium. Autogamy is more frequent in the tribe Gilieae (particularly in Gilia) than in the other tribes. Annual taxa tend to be autogamous, showing on the average higher SPG and lower P:O ratio. The lepidopteran-pollinated group of species have a higher mean P:O ratio and lower mean SPG thus indicating that such plants are associated with crosspollination more than the others. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; breeding systems; ovule ratio; Polemoniaceae; Pollen; stigmatic pollen germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001104267

There was a near-1:1 relationship between the frequencies of pollination of stigmas and the fertilization of at least one ovule within the pistil. Pollination was the major barrier to fertilization of the pistil, and ovules, since no mechanism was evident in the style to prevent pistil fertilization. The frequency with which single ovules were fertilized in pollinated pistils fell as their distance from the stigma increased, and averaged 83.5% overall. The frequency of pollination was most influenced by the level of autofertility possessed by the genotype, and the activity of pollinators. Provision of honey bees to plants in caged plots showed that high levels of pollination could be achieved under open-pollinated conditions, but this was also influenced by autofertility. Increasing plant population in the field had only a small effect on pollination, but extending photoperiod caused the levels and timing of self-pollination in three genotypes to vary. Large differences were found among genotypes in their early stigma receptivity, that is, the frequency of stigmas found to be pollinated at the erect standard stage, prior to the flower opening and being visited by bees.

The different types did not correlate with sectional classification, genome groups or ploidy level, but did correlate with life form. All the perennial species studied had very small stigmas, which were guarded by a ring of hairs and were difficult to pollinate effectively. Most of the annuals, including the cultivated peanut (A. hypogaea), had larger stigmas, which were not surrounded by hairs and which were easily pollinated. One annual species, A. spinaclava, had a stigma intermediate in many of its characteristics between the other two types. Proteins, including esterase and acid phosphatase, were present in all stigmas before the flowers opened. Bud pollination produced apparently normal pollen tube growth in pistils of the wild annual A. spegazzinii and may overcome certain interspecific incompatibilities. Various methods of pollinating stigmas of the perennial species were tried, but even the most successful produced pollen tubes in less than half of the flowers pollinated.

(black locust) and 34 open-pollinated families of Gleditsia triacanthos L. (honey locust) from natural stands. An algorithm employing population estimates of fixation indices, pollen allele frequencies, and selfing rates was used to calculate the mean expected number of alleles in common across loci under assumptions of either full-sib (i.e., a single pollen parent) or half-sib (i.e., random mating) relationships. For each open-pollinated family, the average coefficient of relationship among progeny was calculated by linear interpolation from the observed number of alleles in common. For most families of both species, coefficients were significantly higher than 0.25 (half-sib relation), but were significantly lower than 0.50 (full-sib relation). These results suggest that the assumption of a half-sib relationship among progeny of open-pollinated families is violated for these tree species. More critical to the estimation of heritabilities and the prediction of genetic gains was the observation that estimates of the coefficient of relationship varied widely among open-pollinated families (for R. pseudoacacia r0=0.20-0.43, mean=0.34; for G. triacanthos r0=0.29-0.55, mean=0.36). © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Allozymes; Coefficient of relationship; Gleditsia triacanthos; Heritability estimates; Robinia pseudoacacia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002230845

Gene expression during pollen function, i.e., germination and tube growth, was determined by means of a new approach based on the in vivo comparative analysis of pollinated and non-pollinated silks. In the early autotrophic stage of germinating pollen ADH-1, CAT-1, and GOT-1 were expressed, whereas during further tube elongation only GOT-1 was detected. Pollination did not give rise to pollen-style hybrid enzymatic molecules nor to the induction of new enzymes on either partner. Silks, even when non-pollinated, showed the expression of additional alcohol dehydrogenase and catalase enzymatic activities, specifically ADH-2 and CAT-3. These data support the view that expression of the catalase system in the male gametophyte is stage specific, and suggest that the style may provide support to the elongating pollen tube at the functional as well as at the nutritional level. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Gene expression; Isozymes; Pollen development; Pollen-style interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1242301333

As assayed by allozymic variation at 20 loci and five monogenic morphological loci, the extent of their genetic variation, although relatively low, is sufficient to provide clues as to their hybridity, phylogeny, and possible affiliations with cultivated tomatoes. According to interviews with agronomists, growers, and aboriginals, this entity is seldom cultivated and is not considered indigenous. The level of genetic variation is higher in the central San Martín-Ayacucho region and decreases northward and southward. Tarapoto (Bajo Mayo, Departamento San Martín) is a district of high variability for fruit shape, size, and color, although within the range of allozyme variability for the central region. Allele substitution for a few genes could account for this variation, which grades continuously to the small fruits of var. cerasiforme. Introgression between the latter and introduced cultivars could account for this complex. Rather high levels of cross-pollination estimated for the Bajo Mayo (and other parts of the central area) are compatible with this hypothesis. The presence of several variant alleles in the central region and throughout the coastal populations of var. cerasiforme and of L. pimpinellifolium suggests an affiliation between them, the latter presumably ancestral. According to the total evidence, the eastern Andes seems to be a secondary center of variability, probably not the primary site of domestication of the cultivated tomato. © 1990 The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, NY 10458.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0010553284

Exclosure studies showed that protected yews produced significantly more male and female strobili than unprotected yews, but only after several years of protection. Seed production did not respond as readily to protection from deer perhaps because of reduced pollination levels in browsed yew populations. Previously unbrowsed yews were clipped at different levels of removal of available browse (control (no removal), 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% removal) to simulate deer browsing. Reduction in male strobilus production was linearly related to clipping intensity in three years of observation. Female strobilus production was significantly reduced only at the 100% level of removal. Intermediate levels of clipping may have even stimulated production of female strobili. Analysis of covariance, with previous year's branch production as the covariate, showed no significant effect of clipping on male strobilus production except in the 100% removal group. Female strobilus production showed no such covariance with branch production. Effects of clipping on seed production could not be reliably assessed in 1984 and 1985 due to low seed production. Seed production in 1986 was significantly reduced only in the 100% removal group.

The effects of delivering substances both locally to the grain wall, tube or tip by a microcapillary and directly into the pollen grain by microinjection, and single grain pollination were investigated. Germination was induced by adding small amounts of water locally to the grains with either a microcapillary or with a waterdelivering emulsion without any other ingredients in the medium. The grains were overlayered by mineral or silicone oil so that tube growth proceeded without the grains bursting. There was no apparent penetration of high-molecular-weight substances (FITC-dextran, ethidium bromide labelled DNA) into the living grain either before or after pollination. Neither could the penetration of these substances be detected in both dry, viable and hydrated grains, tubes and tube tips, with or without treatment with Triton X-100 and dimethyl sulfoxide. By microinjection, however, the delivery of high-molecular-weight substances into grains was possible. Such injected grains successfully pollinated stigmas of cultured ear segments. Pollination with pore-injected grains was most efficient (mean 26%). No difference in fertilization rates between mass pollination (mean 41%) and single grain pollination (mean 39%) could be found.

Of the 18 species of insect foragers bees (Apis florea, Trigona, Amegilla, Ceratina, Xylocopa latipes, Xylocopa pubescens) and wasps (Delta sp., Rhynchium) promote both geitonogamy and xenogamy. The bees collected pollen as well as nectar. The wasps while foraging for nectar their dorsal side touches the anthers and causes nototribic pollination. The butterflies visit the flowers for nectar only, but the contact between proboscis and the essential organs is unlikely. © 1990 Indian Academy of Sciences.",Alangium lamarkii; geitonogamy; nectar; nototriby; Pollination; xenogamy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4344624189

Red Wattlebirds (Anthochaera carunculata, 110 g), achieved higher intake rates than New Holland Honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, 20 g), and both achieved higher rates than Eastern Spinebills (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris, 10 g). These results reflect differences in bill and tongue dimensions as well as in body mass. Sugar intake rates for all three species increased with volume (5-50 ?l) at any given concentration (10-60% mass/mass sucrose). For a given volume, sugar intake rates peaked at intermediate concentrations: 40-50% for the two larger species, and 30-40% for the smallest species. Published studies for other nectarivores foraging at unlimited volume feeders also show optimal nectar concentrations of 30-50%. However, biophysical theory predicts optima at 20-26% for small volumes, and plants presumed to be adapted for bird-pollination often have dilute nectar (20-30%). To explore this discrepancy further, we presented New Holland Honeyeaters with a range of sucrose concentrations (10-50%) using two presentation schemes. In the first we varied concentration but kept volume constant, thus varying gross sugar reward available in each concentration. This gave maximum sugar intake rates at 50%. In the second we varied both volume and concentration so that gross sugar rewards were equal for all solutions, decoupling high concentrations and large sugar rewards. This gave optima at 20%. We argue that variation among plants in nature more closely resembles the latter, ""equal sugar presentation"" scheme, and therefore, that dilute nectars may indeed represent adaptations for bird pollination. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Bird-pollination; Floral adaptation; Nectarivore; Optimal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025684098

In this paper, a post-zygotic mechanism (seed abortion) under polygenic control is proposed as the basis for fertility differences in this species. A pollen chase experiment indicated that self-pollen tubes fertilize ovules, but are also 'outcompeted' by foreign male gametes in pollen mixtures. Matings among cultivars derived from a pedigree showed a linear decrease in seed number per fruit, and increase in seed abortion, with increasing relatedness among parents. Selfed (S1) progeny from self-fertile parents were largely self-sterile. At zygotic levels of inbreeding of F&gt;0.3 there was little or no fertility, suggesting that an inbreeding threshold regulates reproductive success in V. corymbosum matings. Individuals below the threshold are facultative selfers, while those above it are obligate outcrossers. Inbreeding also caused a decrease in pollen viability, and reduced female fertility more rapidly than male fertility. These phenomena are discussed in terms of two models of genetic load: (1) mutational load - homozygosity for recessive embryolethal or sub-lethal mutations and (2) segregational load - loss of allelic interactions essential for embryonic vigor. Self-infertility in highbush blueberries is placed in the context of 'late-acting' self-incompatibility versus 'early-acting' inbreeding depression in angiosperms. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Genetic load; Mating systems; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000097146

Seed-set should decrease with increased distance from the pollen source in outcrossing plants. This prediction was tested using females of the clonal, gynodioecious herb Glechoma hederacea in three natural populations. In controlled pollinations, both hermaphrodites and females had similar high percentages of fruit-set and seed-set. In a natural population where a female clone was isolated from the nearest hermaphroditic clone by c. 100 m, fruit-set was low (1%). In another population where hemaphroditic clones were rare and female clones had a patchy distribution, fruit-and seed-set in females were pollen-limited and decreased with increased distance from the nearest pollen source. The estimated mean pollen dispersal distance was 5.9 m when calculated on fruit-set and 5.3 m when calculated on seed-set. The most frequent pollinators were bumblebees. The mean and median distances moved by pollinators between ramets were 0.13 m and 0.05 m. In a third population where female clones were isolated from the nearest hermaphrodites by more than 200 m, fruit-set was 0%. After introduction of 16 hermaphroditic ramets in the center of the female clone, fruit-set varied between 0% and 100% in individual female ramets. Fruit-set decreased with increased distance from the pollen source.

Pollen germination begins 3 minutes after compatible pollinations. The earliest pollen tubes reach the ovary 17 minutes later. Many of the later germinating pollen tubes are arrested and burst at the stigma papillae. In the transmitting tissue inhibitional effects due to negative interactions between pollen tubes are frequently observed. Complete self-incompatibility results in total inhibition of germination. In case of pseudo-self-compatibility, some pollen germinate but germination and stigma penetration are delayed and often result in pollen bursting. There is no self-incompatibility reaction in the transmitting tract but if the pollen tubes reaching this tissue are relatively numerous, negative interactions between them occur as after compatible pollinations. An hypothesis is presented which attributes the negative interactions between pollen tubes to the diffusion of a substance from the growing pollen tubes.

In non-irradiated flowers, apoplastic peroxidase activity, which is present in non-pollinated pistils, is increased by self-pollination, whereas cross-pollination causes its disappearance from the central portion of the transmitting tissue. Apoplastic peroxidases localized in the central portion of the transmitting tissue are supposed to play a role in the predisposition of the pistil to reject incompatible pollen tubes and in the rejection mechanism itself. Pistil irradiation with u.v., which induces pseudo-self-compatibility, modified the aforementioned apoplastic peroxidase distribution. Shortly after u.v. irradiation of non-pollinated styles, apoplastic peroxidase activity was absent from the central portion of the transmitting tissue; some hours later peroxidase activity was restored, and 40 h after treatment, the 'normal' peroxidase distribution was observed. Our data suggest an u.v.-induced temporary removal of the 'predisposition' for incompatible pollen tube rejection. Moreover, soon after irradiation, the usually observed peroxidase production due to self-pollination was inhibited. Pseudo-self-compatibility, observed when self-pollination was carried out immediately after u.v. irradiation, was due to incompatible pollen tube elongation in a transmitting tissue devoid of apoplastic peroxidases and hindered in the rejection mechanism. However, pseudo-self-compatible pollen tube growth was not accompanied by the dramatic changes in transmitting tissue ultrastructure observed after compatible cross-pollination.

Special attention has been paid to the genetic variation within half-sib families, which is expected to be large as compared to the genetic variation between families. Based on observations of individual plants within plots, the environmental component of the variation is expected to be large and nonestimatable. The results of an experiment in meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) are presented. In this experiment, randomly selected individual plants within HS families were cloned and laid out in randomized blocks. For the characters observed (earliness and raw matter yield) no significant variance component for dominance was found. The highly significant additive component estimated for earliness, as well as for yield, after each of three cuts and in total were about three times as large within as between families, as expected from the theoretical considerations. The estimated response to selection was much higher for a combination of between- and within-family selection as compared to free clone or family mean selection alone. It is suggested that a program for progeny testing and selection in a base population of perennial forage grasses should start with an experiment in which a large number of randomly selected parental clones and a fixed number of clones from each of the half-sib families derived from the mother genotypes are grown simultaneously. The selected clones within superior families could later on be further cloned, placed in a polycross field, and the new HS-families could be sown in ordinary field trials at various locations for further selection. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Bootstrapping; Genetic correlation; Genetic variation; Open-pollination; Polycross,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000185432

Hybrids are not available because of the instability of male sterility. Synthetic varieties can and should be bred. Thus, we studied the reproductive behavior of this partially allogamous, insect-pollinated crop. Autofertility (AF) and the rate of cross-fertilization (C) were measured in 36 inbred lines and 28 crosses in F1, F2, and F3 generations for 3 years at Hohenheim, Stuttgart, FRG. Heterozygosity strongly increased AF and decreased C. AF was negatively correlated with C. AF varied from 1% to 98%, and C varied from 7% to 82%. Heritability for both characters was high. For an optimum exploitation of heterosis, breeders should utilize lines with high C as variety components. It is often labor-intensive to multiply such lines, due to low AF. Hence, breeders tend to use autofertile lines with rather limited C. We showed that even in this case about 50% of the total heterosis, which equals a yield increase of at least 25% over the inbred line level, is realized. An increase in yield stability due to heterogeneity will occur simultaneously. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Autofertility; Cross-fertilization; Outcrossing; Synthetic variety; Vicia faba L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345616765

Noaman & Taylor (1988b) showed the combination of protein content in the head, peduncle, and flag leaf of winter wheat at heading provided a good estimate for grain protein. The objectives of this research were to apply these results in indirect selection scheme for grain protein improvement and to study the heritability of protein content in these plant parts. Two random winter wheat populations from four parents in double crosses were used in this study. Sixty randon F2-derived F5 and F6 lines were grown in randomized complete block design with 3 replicates in two years. Significant differences for grain yield, grain protein, and vegetative protein content were detected among F5 and F6 lines in both populations. Genotypic and phenotypic correlations between grain protein and vegetative protein were significant and in agreement. Estimates of narrow sense heritability of protein content using variance components method ranged from 0.46 to 0.94 for leaf 2 and head in population 1, and from 0.63 to 0.89 for peduncle and head in population 2. Correlation coefficients (r) between predicted and observed grain protein ranged from 0.50 to 0.88 and from 0.37 to 0.84 in populations 1 and 2, respectively. The highest r was obtained from the combination of head, peduncle, and flag leaf protein at heading. Correlation between protein in plant parts and grain yield was small and not significant. The high heritability of vegetative protein at heading allows the identification of genotypes before pollination which are likely to produce high grain protein. Indirect selection for head, peduncle, and flag leaf protein should result in increased grain protein without yield reduction noted in other breeding schemes. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",genotype x environment interaction; grain protein content; grain yield; heritability; indirect selection; protein inheritance; Triticum aestivum; variance components; wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000214673

Since the base population of rapid-cycling B. campestris is self-incompatible, inbreeding was achieved by a combination of bud-pollination and the application of pollen to the cut surfaces of decapitated stigmas. Three inbred generations were raised, and in each generation plants were selected for high or low potential for anther embryogenesis. The proportion of viable pollen present in anthers, as indicated by a fluorochromatic reaction and a germination test, was also determined at each stage. Lines of rapid-cycling B. campestris with clearly defined high or low potential for anther embryogenesis were isolated in these experiments. Within each line, however, continuous variation was always observed. Pollen viability and anther efficiency were not correlated. Although inbreeding depression caused a significant decrease in pollen viability over the three generations, there were no obvious deleterious effects on anther efficiency. In general, over the three generations of inbreeding, no segregation in plant morphological characters was observed, although many developmental abnormalities were seen in the 3rd inbred generation and there was a marked reduction in the number of seeds set. No association between plant vigour and high or low anther efficiency was noted. All plants regenerated from anther embryoids of rapid cycling B. campestris were haploid. By treating anther-derived embryoids, axillary buds and whole plants with colchicine, dihaploid plants were produced, but these failed to set seed after self-pollination. The diploid nature of the plants was confirmed, however, when they produced normal seeds after cross-pollination with plants of the base population. © 1990 Annals of Botany Company.",Anther culture; Brassica campestris; Inbreeding; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249019011

Clearcut sizes range from 16 ha down to 0.4-ha patches. Seed trees or shelterwoods are sometimes used to provide additional seed and site protection. Uneven-aged systems are not recommended, with the exception of group selection for yellow birch. Coppice systems do not provide full stocking except in short-rotation biomass culture, but coppice provides acceptable supplemental regeneration. Natural regeneration by seeding prevails because it is economical and highly reliable where the water balance is favorable. Yellow birch sometimes regenerates in advance, but otherwise the canopy, understory, and seedbed must be manipulated to meet germination and seedling-establishment requirements. Suitable seedbeds are prepared by burning, by mechanical site-preparation equipment, and sometimes by the logging process itself. Draining often is all that is necessary to regenerate peatlands. Seedlings should be protected from grazing or browsing. Relatively few stands are regenerated artificially. Direct seeding (either broadcast- or spot-sowing) is usually reliable. Planting is more common and gives the opportunity to introduce exotic or genetically improved stock. In species trials, silver birch has consistently grown faster - and yellow birch slower - than eeitherhairy birch or paper birch. Phenotypically selected natural stands and controlled pollination produce progeny that grow in volume from 30 to 80% faster than average. Thorough site preparation, fertilization, mulching, weed control, and protection from animals benefit seedling growth. Both bare-root and container-grown stock are planted successfully. Birch is highly regarded for afforesting mine spoils, drained or worked-out peatlands, abandoned and abused agricultural lands, heaths, previously flooded lands, and areas with high air pollution. Fertilizers are often applied to improve site quality. Birch nurse crops benefit conifers by protecting them from frost, insects, and pathogens; by improving the soil through nutrient cycling; and by increasing stand wind-firmness on shallow soils. The optimum proportion of birch in mixed stands is 17-25%. Overly dense birch should be controlled with chemicals, by hand, or with machinery to allow optimum conifer development. © 1990.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025232090

Among the surviving plants, after self-thinning, variability in above-ground biomass and gender was higher in the high nutrient treatment. Among individuals there was a significant positive correlation between maleness and both height and biomass. Fecundity was also positively correlated with both measures of size. Based on the pattern of distribution of male and female flowers within the plant, it appears that the increase in maleness in larger plants is due to increased branching and axis elongation. These results demonstrate that competitive interactions, which lead to increased variability in biomass and fecundity, can also generate variability in gender within populations. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Ambrosia; Competition; Gender; Size hierarchy; Wind-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025680634

These fatty acids are solely commercially available from palm kernel and coconut oils; thus, there is considerable interest in Cuphea as an alternative source of these fatty acids. Cuphea is a genus of undomesticated species characterized by seed dormancy and seed shedding. Our goal is to eliminate these domestication barriers in a few species with agronomic potential. Our objective was to survey existing Cuphea laminuligera and C. lanceolata germplasm for genetic variation for seed dormancy (germination percentage after a certain seed storage period). Recurrent half-sib family selection was practiced in various open-pollinated and synthetic populations. Half-sib family seed were evaluated for germination percentages at 26° C after various seed storage periods. There was significant genetic variation among families in every population. Additive genetic variance, half-sib family-mean heritability, and expected selection response magnitudes depended on the length of the seed storage period within a given population. Estimates of these parameters were significantly greater for longer seed storage periods within a population. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.00 to 0.79. Expected half-sib family selection responses ranged from 0.0 to 23.9%. Our study demonstrated there is substantial genetic variation for seed dormancy in C. laminuligera and C. lanceolata. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",crop domestication; Cuphea laminuligera; Cuphea lanceolata; heritability; seed dormancy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343501371

Progenies from plants with a susceptible reaction type in the field (scores 8 and 9) all showed homogeneous levels of susceptibility similar to that of the control cultivars Mundo Novo and Catuaí of Coffea arabica. Variation for incomplete resistance was mainly expressed by low or heterogeneous reaction types and also by longer latency periods. Incomplete resistance to race II of some Icatu and Catimor plants, which is overcome by Is. 2, appeared to depend on a partially dominant gene. The expression of this gene may vary also according to the genetic background and some residual resistance to Is. 2 was observed. A few derivatives of Híbrido de Timor were more resistant to Is. 2 than to race II, suggesting the presence of a resistant factor to Is. 2 in this germplasm. Segregation in progenies from other plants with incomplete resistance to race II suggested presence of one or a few genes only, which in homozygous condition or in combination seem to confer near-complete or complete resistance. The results suggest that selection for incomplete resistance, expressed by intermediate reaction types, in Icatu and derivatives of Híbrido de Timor may not provide durable resistance to coffee rust. On the other hand, due to apparent additive gene action, phenotypic selection of plants with a highly resistant reaction type could facilitate the accumulation of several resistance alleles in one genotype, which could provide an efficient barrier against new race formation of the pathogen. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",breeding strategies; Coffea arabica; coffee; coffee leaf rust; durable resistance; Hemileia vastatrix; interspecific hybrids; reaction type; residual resistance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-30344438135

The procedure has been tested in autumn-sown onions (in the UK) using a wide cross between the openpollinated Japanese cultivar, Senshyu, and a partially inbred line derived from the European cultivar, Rawska. The early generations used for prediction included the first self-pollinated generation of the two parental populations and the F3 generation produced from the hybrid population. The predictions were tested by reference to the field performance of a random array of inbred lines, which were produced by single-seed descent (SSD) and had been selfed for three generations.

Although Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera forage for nectar, bees (Andrenidae,Anthophoridae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae) probably make the only effective pollen transfers between the two morphs. Both male and female bees may transport pollen of both morphs and short-tongued bees (e.g., Augochlorella spp., Dialictus spp.) may be more common but as effective as pollinators as long-tongued bees (e.g., Calliopsis andreniformis and Hoplitis spp.).

The genus Nomia contains polylectic, pollen gathering species that store pollen in both the crop and scopa on the hind legs. The absence of a reward for the bees indicates the orchid is relying on deception to attract visitors. The relationship of deception to mimicry is discussed. Once on the flower, tactile, visual and possibly olfactory stimuli direct bees to the false anther formed by the voluminous column wings, where morphological adaptations of the flower ensure that the pollinarium is deposited on the gaster of the bee to effect pollination. - The lack of seed set observed on the Victorian coast appears to be due to the absence of pollinators from the heath and grassland communities in which the orchid grows.

In order to determine whether amino acids are important in attracting butterflies and bees, we tested the preference of cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) by allowing them to feed from artificial flowers containing sugar-only or sugar-amino acid mimics of Lantana camara nectar. Honey bees and female cabbage white butterflies consumed more sugar-amino acid nectar than sugar-only nectar. In addition, female cabbage white butterflies visited artificial flowers containing sugar-amino acid nectars more frequently than flowers containing sugar-only nectars; honey bees spent more time consuming the sugar-amino acid nectar.

This family contains approximately six to eight family members and is expressed at high levels only in pollen. The predicted protein sequence from a near full-length cDNA clone shows that the protein products of these genes are at least 38,000 daltons. We identified the protein encoded by one of the cDNAs in this family by using antibodies to ?-galactosidase/pollen cDNA fusion proteins, Immunoblot analysis using these antibodies identifies a family of proteins of approximately 40 kilodaltons that is present in mature pollen, indicating that these mRNAs are not stored solely for translation after pollen germination. These proteins accumulate late in pollen development and are not detectable in other parts of the plant. Although not present in unpollinated or self-pollinated styles, the 40-kilodalton to 45-kilodalton antigens are detectable in extracts from cross-pollinated styles, suggesting that the proteins are present in pollen tubes growing through the style during pollination. The proteins are also present in pollen tubes growing in vitro. Both nucleotide and amino acid sequences are similar to the published sequences for cDNAs encoding the enzyme polygalacturonase, which suggests that the P2 gene family may function in depolymerizing pectin during pollen development, germination, and tube growth. Cross-hybridizing RNAs and immunoreactive proteins were detected in pollen from a wide variety of plant species, which indicates that the P2 family of polygalacturonase-like genes are conserved and may be expressed in the pollen from many angiosperms.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025389089

The increase of the amino acid concentration in the medium is different in all four species and seems to be determined by a variety of factors including permeability of the pollen grain wall and presence or absence of pores. The results suggest a passive diffusion process of the free pollen amino acids into the medium rather than an active release. Implications from the experiments for Battus philenor and for other nectar feeding pollinators are discussed. A possible complementary effect of free pollen and nectar amino acids is proposed for plant species in which pollen is likely to be knocked into nectar by their flower visitors. A possible evolutionary pathway from nectar feeding butterflies such as Battus philenor to the complex derived pollen feeding habit in the Heliconius butterflies is proposed. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Aesculus californica; Amsinckia lunaris; Angiosperms; Battus philenor; Brodiaea pulchella; butterflies; butterfly-feeding; Carduus pycnocephalus; diffusion; Heliconius; nectar; Pollen amino acids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001085505

Box 17, 6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","In Cymbidium flowers, emasculation by removal of the pollinia and the anther cap leads within 24 hours to red coloration of the labellum (lip). Lip coloration, being the first sign of senescence in these flowers, has been ascribed to the action of ethylene in the lip. When a small incision in the base of the lip is made prior to emasculation, or when the lip is excised and placed in water within 10 to 15 hours after emasculation, coloration is considerably delayed. This indicates that a coloration-associated factor is moving in or out of the lip. Measurements of ethylene production of excised flower parts, isolated at different times after emasculation, showed an increase only in the central column; the other flower parts, including the lip, did not show a measurable change. In contrast, in situ measurements of the ethylene production of the central column and the remaining portion of the flower revealed a simultaneous increase in all the flower parts following emasculation. Similarly, application of radiolabeled 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to the top of the central column in situ leads to the production of radiolabeled ethylene by all the flower parts. In addition, the ethylene production of isolated lips, measured immediately after excision, was initially high but ceased within 10 to 15 minutes. Treatment of the central column in situ with ethylene or ethephon did not stimulate ACC production but did stimulate lip coloration and this was accompanied by an increased internal ethylene concentration in the lip. The data indicate that endogenously produced as well as applied ACC is rapidly translocated from the site of production or application to all the other flower parts where it is immediately converted into ethylene. By excision of a flower organ, the influx ol ACC is prevented, causing a rapid decrease in ethylene production. In addition, it was found that ethylene may also be translocated in physiologically significant amounts within the flower. The roles of ACC and ethylene as mobile senescence or wilting factors in emasculation- and pollination-induced senescence is discussed.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000004694

Forty-three fertile tetraploid somatic hybrid plants, each deriving from separate calli, were recovered from both fusion procedures. Electrofusion appeared more efficient than chemical fusion for the production of somatic hybrids. These plants appeared morphologically similar, whatever the fusion procedure and tomato genotype. They had intermediate leaf, inflorescence, and flower morphology. After self-pollination, the hybrids set fruit of intermediate size and color. The hybrid nature of these plants was confirmed by isoelectric focusing of the Rubisco small subunits used as nuclear markers. L. esculentum and L. peruvianum were distinguished by means of two chloroplast markers: CF1-ATPase ? subunit as analyzed by isoelectro-focusing and ct DNA restriction patterns. All hybrids displayed both ct markers of only one parent with no biased transmission. Mitochondrial (mt) DNAs were prepared from flower buds by using miniaturized CsCl gradients. Preliminary analysis indicated that mt genomes from the hybrids all differed from those of both parents. mt DNA Sall restriction enzyme analysis revealed that all but two hybrids contained one novel fragment of 13.5 kb. Gene mapping experiments showed that the mt apocytochrome b and ATPase subunit 9 homologies in the somatic hybrid mt DNA resembled L. esculentum and L. peruvianum, respectively; the mt nad5 probe distinguished at least four distinct patterns in the hybrids. These results indicated that mt DNA rearrangements involving intergenomic recombinations occurred through protoplast fusion.

The cleistogamous flower shows a loss of protandry and the stigma is receptive only after reflexing and closing of its lobes. In contrast, the chasmogamous stigma is receptive when reflexed and closes when pollen has been deposited on the lobes. Pollen tube penetration of the dry stigma papillae and entry into the style is similar in the two morphs. The chasmogamous style is solid and the cleistogamous style partly hollow. The matrix of secretion produced by the transmitting tract cells is mainly carbohydrate with a trace of lipids. It is fibrillar in nature and appears to be partly comprised of wall material from the transmitting tract cells. In the chasmogamous pollen, the generative cell enters the tube before division, which occurs between 30 and 60 min after pollination. This division correlates with an increased growth rate for the pollen tube. In the cleistogamous pollen, contact with the stigma triggers generative cell division inside the hydrated pollen grain before germination. The two resulting sperm cells exit the grain 15-30 min after pollination when the pollen tube is in the stigma lobes. The cleistogamous pollen tube shows only one phase of growth which occurs at a rate similar to that of the slow, first phase of the chasmogamous pollen. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Cleistogamy; Collomia grandiflora; Generative cell division; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002558562

Thirty covariances were calculated for each of ten non-epistatic and ten epistatic genetic models with varying probabilities of recombination between two coupling or repulsion loci. Each set of covariances was tested for linkage by comparing covariances calculated for the model with those expected for an additive-dominance model with no linkage. Results showed that the test for linkage is quite insensitive to the effects of linkage due to the disproportionate influence of inbreeding. Repulsion linkages should be easier to detect than coupling linkages for all models. Epistasis was found to mimic or counteract the effects of linkage.

The mature megagametophyte contains two synergids, an egg cell, a central cell with two unfused polar nuclei and three antipodals. Pollen tube passage between cells in the styloid, on the placenta and through the micropyle does not induce degeneration of surrounding cells. Pollen tube entry into the megagametophyte occurs through the degenerated synergid immediately adjacent to the filiform apparatus. The tube grows the length of the filiform apparatus 20-30 ?m into the synergid, and then discharges its contents-two sperm cells, the vegetative nucleus, and pollen tube cytoplasm. Sperm cells appear progressively hypertrophied during their passage in the pollen tube. In the degenerate synergid, the sperm nucleus is located at one end of the cell and the remaining cytoplasm is diffuse, containing a large vacuole. Following transmission of sperm nuclei into the egg and central cell, one male nucleus fuses with the egg and the other fuses with the micropylar polar nucleus. Enucleate cytoplasmic bodies of apparent sperm origin were observed within the degenerated synergid. The gametic fusion mechanism in this plant appears to involve: (1) eccentric positioning of the nucleus within the sperm cell, (2) separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear portions of the sperm cell, and (3) fusion of the nuclear portion with the egg cell. This represents a previously undescribed mechanism by which male cytoplasmic organelles are eliminated from sperm cells prior to fusion. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.",Cytoplasmic inheritance; Female germ unit; Fertilization; Gametic fusion mechanisms; Male gamete; Populus; Synergid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000782437

Regenerated plants contained pea plastocyanin located within the chloroplast thylakoid membrane system. Analysis of seedlings from a self-pollinated transgenic plant containing a single copy of the pea plastocyanin gene indicated that seedlings homozygous for the pea gene contained almost twice as much pea plastocyanin as seedlings hemizygous for the pea gene. Homozygous seedlings contained approximately equal amounts of pea and tobacco plastocyanins. The amount of tobacco plastocyanin in leaves of transgenic plants was unaffected by the expression of the pea plastocyanin gene. The mRNA from the pea gene in tobacco was indistinguishable by northern blotting and S1 nuclease protection from the mRNA found in pea. In both pea and transgenic tobacco, expression of the pea plastocyanin gene was induced by light in leaves but was suppressed in roots.

Therefore the aim was to produce it from newly developed inbred lines obtained by reshuffling the genes in the hybrid, accompanied by selection. Thus in open pollinating generations derived from this hybrid, i.e. in C0, C1, C2, C3 and C4, honeycomb selection for grain yield improvement was applied. Selfing of one ear and open pollination of another ear of selected prolific C4 plants yielded 20 pairs of S1/half sib progenies. Plants grown from remnant S1 seed corresponding to superior progeny pairs were selfed. In each S2-line a single plant was selected and selfed. The S3-lines were evaluated for yield. Two S3-lines, i.e. 6D and 2B, attracted attention because they yielded two and a half times as much as the best commercial inbred line B73. The S1-and S2-lines were tested for combining ability with the related inbred lines NE2 and F68 by means of honeycomb design experiments and for combining ability with unrelated, freely available inbred lines by means of randomized complete block designs. Two S2-lines, i.e. 5C and 6E, were selected for their good combining ability. The six single cross hybrids produced by crossing the four S3-lines 6D, 2B, 5C, and 6E were compared with the original hybrid F68*NE2 in a honeycomb design at two sites. The grain yields of the single cross hybrids 6D*6E and 5C*6E were similar to that of F68*NE2. However, these two reconstructed hybrids can be produced in a cheaper way because the new maternal inbred lines yield as good as B73 (line 5C) or much better (line 6D). © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",honeycomb selection; inbred line development; maize breeding; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0342366753

Pollen-tube growth rates were generally greater for species with longer pistils and larger pollen. Increasing temperature increased the rate of pollen-tube growth. There was no detectable effect of pollen tube density on tube growth rate in the style. After interspecific pollinations tube growth rates in foreign styles could be faster or slower than in self styles. A semisterile individual with two viable pollen grains per tetrad and a plant grafted as scion to a longer-styled stock both showed more rapid pollen-tube growth than expected on the basis of pistil size.

Subtle differences in the inflorescences have been detected, for example, there are more flowers per inflorescence on male plants than on female plants and petal expansion from the day of opening to the next day is greater in females than in males; in addition, pollen from female plants appears somewhat collapsed and does not germinate. Pollinators (Apis mellifera, other bees (Apidae), Eristalis tenax and other Syrphidae: Diptera) visit the blossoms mostly in the morning to collect pollen (there is no nectar) and in choice experiments do not discriminate between male flowers and female flowers on landing, but do spend significantly more time on the former. They do discriminate between freshly opened flowers and day?old flowers, and show marked preference for bouquets of five flowers vs. single flowers. The female plants, with smaller inflorescences and lesser interest to pollen foraging insects, seem to encourage them to forage at more flowers than do their male counterparts.

This monoecious plant was found to be self- and cross-pollinated. The pollen grains are somewhat sticky as they are released from the anther thecae, and are initially dispersed in a non-random manner in many small threads or 'clouds'. The adhesive in transient and within minutes the individual grains are set free and sink. The primary effect is for the pollen to be dispersed in small clouds or threads of grains instead of as one large cloud of grains randomly spaced apart. This type of dispersal may increase the frequency of collision with the stigma. By experiment it was found that the presence of stigmas stimulated pollen germination; this can lead to the presence of some precociously germinated pollen grains in the water surrounding flowers; these thread-like grains are rare in natural conditions and are not considered to be important in pollination. Emasculated isolated plants failed to set seed, indicating agamospermy to be unlikely. Although underwater pollination has been previously considered to be highly inefficient the fruit-set efficiency varied from 55.6 to 91%, which must be considered high.

Both pollen and nectar are produced only during the male phase of the protandrous disk florets, but pollen is produced bimodally whereas sugar accumulation is constant. Acceptance of heads by native bees was positively correlated with the number of male-phase florets per head, although the number of approaches was not. Native bees responded to increases in nectar amounts, as determined by experiments using bagged heads in which nectar accumulated, by increasing time per head and time spent foraging per floret. Comparisons across an array of visitors showed that large bees were more effective pollinators than small bees, but within the large bee category, there were no differences between specialists and generalists or between males and females. Within the Asteraceae, rewards can influence pollinator behavior directly, whereas in many other advanced groups of angiosperms with floral morphologies that restrict pollinator movement, the number of ways that rewards can directly affect pollinator behavior may be limited. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025624089

Lavender open flowers and produce nectar uninterruptedly over daytime; both flower production and nectar secretion rates are highest early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Pollen availability in the flower population reaches a maximum in late afternoon, while nectar and sugar availability peak around the middle of the day. There was considerable variation both among major groups (Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera), and among species within groups, in the timing of foraging at flowers. As a consequence of this, and of interspecific differences in pollen transfer effectiveness and average flight distance between consecutively visited flowers, the daytime period is not homogeneous with regard to the potential pollinating effectiveness of the pollinators active at a given time. There is not, however, a good correlation between the daily cycles of floral resource production and availability, on one hand, and of components of pollinating effectivness, on the other. Both the plant's and the pollinators' daily cycles probably largely represent independent responses to diel rhythmicity of the physical environment. Matches and mismatches found here between daily patterns of floral resources and aspects of pollinating effectiveness are epiphenomena lacking particular adaptive significance to the plant. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025594484

Mean initial fruit set was 5.0 per panicle, representing a percentage fruit set of 15.5%.

Diversity of insect flower visitors, attracted by nectar rewards, was great, but only a few species were common. Three species of potentially efficient pollinators were tested for their pollinator efficiency which was found to be high for honey bees, Apis mellifera, and a native fly, Ligyra sp. Only 25% of flowers were pollinated in 1987, but this increased to 98% owing to a corresponding increase in the natural populations of insect visitors. Wind and night flying insects played no role in pollination. Although 98% of flowers were pollinated, initial fruit set averaged only 15.5%.

Flowers of Acacia nigrescens Oliver are an important food resource to giraffe in the late dry season.

Factors such as inflorescence structure and colour, pollen morphology and thorn structure suggest that one group of African Acacias could be pollinated by ungulates.

Three parameters were investigated: cost of reproduction c, was the probability that high-fecundity individuals regress one size class; population pollination level, p, was the probability that reproductive individuals have a high-fecundity year; fecundity difference, d, was the relative difference in fecundity between low- and high-fecundity individuals. The main results of simulations were that 1) for any combination of c and d, there is a particular value of p that maximizes fitness, and this value can be very low or very high; 2) keeping the other parameters constant, higher c's reduce fitness and higher d's increase fitness; 3) the magnitude of the effects of c and d on fitness depends only on p and is lowest when p is lowest and highest when p is highest; and 4) increases in c and d move the optimal pollination level to the left and right, respectively.

Poit. is representative of an explosive pollination mechanism. The carinal structure formed by the middle lobe of corolla lower lip conceals the stamens and stigma and does not open following the natural anthesis. Upon anthesis, the carinal lobe is under tension which is later released by wind or bees. The violent explosion of the carinal lobe caused by wind results in self?pollination; by bees, it results in self? and cross?pollination. Foraging activity of some bees which collect pollen from the anthers and stigma on H. suaveolens may reduce the success of pollination. The mating system involves both autogamy and allogamy. Both require explosion of carinal lobe for pollination. The flexibility of the mating system is considered a safeguard ensuring its ruderal nature for weediness. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

Weather- related effects on pollinator activity operate indirectly through floral reward (the secretion rate and sugar concentration of nectar, and die release, texture, and perhaps digestibility of pollen) or direcdy through the hygrothermal balance of the insect or bird, to an extent that depends on the shape of the flower and the degree of endothermy of the pollinator.

Damage to young fruits by genetic defects, by insects, or by climatic factors is probably an important factor that increases the optimal number of female flowers and decreases the fruits-to-flowers ratio. This includes parental selection for seed or fruit equality. Short-term increases in either pollination probability or resource levels do not increase fruit production by plants that had reached an evolutionary equilibrium under constant conditions. Random variation in pollination level, young-fruit survival, or resource level can cause a significant increase in the number of female flowers and a decrease in the fruits-to-flowers ratio, especially when the cost of flowers or young fruits is low relative to that of mature fruits. The evolutionarily stable sex ratio in most plants selects for a high number of functionally male flowers. The cost of adding female reproductive organs to male flowers to produce bisexual flowers is considerably less than the cost of producing female flowers. This lower cost may provide the selective advantage that explains the prevalence of plants with bisexual flowers. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025204980

Thynnine wasps are exploited in this manner by more orchid species than any other insects. Experiments were conducted on the mating behaviour of male Zaspilothynnus trilobatus during encounters with the female and the orchid Drakaea glyptodon. The flightless female called for mates by releasing a sex pheromone. Winged males responded rapidly to calling females, locating and carrying away 61% of them within the first minute. All females were taken within 5 min. Similarly. males quickly located experimentally presented flowers with a peak rate of visits occurring within the first minute. Pollination requires the wasps to grasp the flowers but not copulate or ejaculate. While 93% of the wasps landed on flowers, <21% attempted to grasp the female decoy, 6% of males attempted copulation with the flower and ejaculation was never observed. Some flowers were preferentially attractive. Males immediately leave the area after visiting a flower and do not visit nearby flowers within a refractory period. Males moved up to 132 m (mean of 32 m) in their search for females.

The economic value of such insects to pollination, seed set, and fruit formation greatly outweighs that suggested by more conventional indices, such as the value of honey and wax produced by honeybees. Although the European honeybee has been widely regarded as the single most important pollinating species, the increasing spread of trachael and Varroa mites and Africanized bees threatens the distribution and magnitude of traditional honeybeekeeping enterprises in North America. A number of other bee and insect pollinators, such as orchard bees, bumblebees, and squash bees, which are not affected by either the mites or the Africanized bees, are considered as likely candidates for management and use in commercial agriculture. An additional role can be played by native or wild pollinators, provided that attention is given to curtailing of population losses caused by both inadvertent insecticide poisoning and habitat destruction. To ensure a reliable source of pollinators, both managed and native, a more comprehensive strategy for management of crop pollination is needed. Elements of this strategy include an increased understanding of the biology and ecology of pollinating insects, as well as providing appropriate nesting habitat, and ensuring the availability of alternative sources of forage to sustain populations when the target crops are not in bloom.

We consider it evident that specific pollinators have a strong selective effect on Ophrys flowers. By comparing the characters of the Ophrys flowers and of their pollinators, we try to bring an indirect proof of this hypothesis1.

The honey bee was introduced for honey production, but it provides adequate pollination for most of the introduced flowering crops that require insect pollination for fruit and seed production. The shortage of indigenous pollinators led to the importation of long-tongued bumble bees for pollination of red clover. This was the first introduction anywhere of bees especially for pollination. Following this success, 2 species of bees were introduced to pollinate lucerne. The importation of further specialist pollinators for selected crops could improve yields and quality. Criteria for selection of additional pollinators are suggested, which include minimizing disturbances to the existing flora and fauna, and the safeguarding of current crop yields. Had these criteria been in force last century, honey bees may have been excluded, but bumble bees probably would have been introduced. As an example of a candidate specialist pollinator, Osmia cornifrons is suggested for fruit flowers. This bee species appears to comply with all criteria.

However, in N. capitata a few abortive pollen tubes (±5%) were found in the styles of two long-styled morphs that had been selfed and in one short-styled flower pollinated with pollen from a long-styled plant. Four out of five distylous species have pollen size but not exine dimorphism. The flowers of Nivenia species are unscented, tubular, and nectariferous, encouraging a trapline pollination syndrome. The major pollinators appear to be large-bodied, long-tongued bees of the family Anthophoridae or long-tongued fries of the family Nemastrinidae; the latter evidently are the exclusive pollinators of N. binata and N. stenosiphon. Both insects insert their tongues down the long floral tubes and collect nectar while hovering. The exserted anthers of flowers of the monomorphic Nivenia species and the short-styled flowers deposit pollen on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the insects thorax and abdomen. Pollen deposition from anthers of the long-styled flowers appears to be confined to the insects head. Differential deposition of pollen from the two floral morphs thus facilitates intermorph pollinations. Analysis of nectar sugars indicates high sucrose:hexose ratios and relatively high sugar concentrations, consistent with insect pollination. The combination of self-compatibility, adaptive floral morphology, and ratio of floral morphs within populations does not suggest that Nivenia is a model of either conventional 0Primula-type) distyly or andromonoecy. We suggest that the genus is derived from self-incompatible ancestors, perhaps now extinct, but the self-incompatibility response has declined, while dimorphic flowers are retained in five of the nine extant species. We presume that self-compatibility and the loss of distyly reflect a trend in the adaptive radiation of the genus towards harsher, xeric environments and a sublithophytic habitat. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001893744

Garcinia hombroniana is a facultative agamosperm which is pollinated by Trigona bees. Nectar is restricted to the large discoid stigma (or pistillode in male flowers), which also captures and hydrates pollen. The wet stigma and binucleate pollen suggest that Garcinia arose from hermaphrodite plants with a gametophytic self?incompatibility system. On stigmas, nectar is secreted early on three or four successive days. On male pistillodes, nectar is secreted when anthers dehisce, on the second morning after anthesis. Pollen is most viable when freshly collected, but some viability remains four days after collection. Pollen germinates within 24 h of hydration. Similar results to pollinations are obtained by germinating pollen in 1 % sucrose. Garcinia hombroniana flowers principally from January to June.

In the present study, this point was experimentally approached by encasing female catkins of Salix repens L. and S. caprea L. in net covers, thus rendering them unapproachable to the habitual insect visitors without hampering the access of airborne pollen. Afterwards, their seed set was compared with that of uncaged control catkins. Seed set attributable to wind pollination in S. repens amounted to 70% in one location and to 20% in another location, while that in S. caprea it came to 50%. An investigation into the pollen aggregation tendency proved that the pollen stickiness of S. repens is slightly lower than that of S. caprea. Taking into account the combined evidence, S. repens appears to be somewhat better adapted to wind pollination than S. caprea, while the contrary applies to insect pollination. Since both air currents and insect visitors substantially contribute to pollen transfer, the pollination system of both Salix species should be designated as ambophilous. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954868985

G.) and slash pine pollen in controlled pollinations. The studies have provided guidelines for pollen application in the monoclonal orchards, established in Queensland to produce seed of the hybrid between slash and Caribbean pines. These new orchards contain a single clone of slash pine and the pollen of Caribbean pine is applied artificially during the flowering period. Variation occurred between slash pine clones in seed potential and in the number of pollen grains usually present inside the pollen chambers. Both features may affect a clone's capacity to produce hybrid seed. The stage of cone development determined the entry of the pollen of both species. Caribbean pine pollen had no difficulty entering the pollen chambers in competition with slash pollen provided it was applied when the cones were receptive. Application of pollen prior to cone receptivity provided no advantage and late arriving pollen could still enter the chambers provided the cones were receptive. Pollen generally entered the chambers in approximately the same proportion as they were present in the pollen cloud. The results indicate artificial application of pollen could be scheduled for every two or three days in the monoclonal orchards. With misting applications Caribbean pine pollen should constitute at least 50% of the pollen cloud to ensure adequate numbers of pollen grains of this species in the pollen chambers. The counts of pollen grains inside the pollen chambers were compared with reported counts for other species of Pinus. There were important differences. Consequently there could be inter-specific differences in the degree of competition between pollen grains. Our studies suggest there could be similar differences between clones. There may be other important inter-clonal and inter-specific differences in the pollination process within the genus Pinus. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17444385828

Similarly, the genus Puya (Bro- meliaceae) contains species with abundant sucrose in the nectar (hummingbird-pollinated species) and species with abundant hexose belonging to the massive monocarpic subgenus Puya.

Pollinators comprise mainly bumble?bee queens (Bombus spp.) that transport 90% of the pollinaria. The remaining pollinators are cuckoo bumble?bee females (Psithyrus spp.).

Moreover, experiments indicate that O. spitzelii is an obligate outcrosser and lacks an effective isolating mechanism against the abundant and concurrently blooming Orchis mascula.

Successive cytokinesis in microspore mother cell results in isobilateral and decussate microspore tetrads. The mature pollen grains are single, spheroidal, disulculate, echinate and 2-celled. In the mature anthers, fibrous thickenings develop not only in the endothecium but also in two or three middle cell layers and the connective tissue before latrorse dehiscence. A lobed tissue in each of the three locules of the ovary serves ovular and placental functions. Each extension of the 5-7 paired lobes represents an ategmic ovule. The development of the female gametophyte conforms to the Polygonum type. Usually only one gametophyte is present in each lobe but occasionally several may occur. Bulb growth is monopodial with normally three umbels produced per plant, each carrying an average of 10 flowers, only two or three of which are open at any one time. Nectar sugar concentration was measured at 14.2% (w/w), of which 44.8% of solids was sucrose and 3.9% either glucose or fructose. The protandrous flowers are phalenophilous, pollinated by sphingid moths. The endosperm formation is of the nuclear type. In the absence of seed coats and the nucellus at maturity, the outer layers of the endosperm become corky following the activity of a phellogen. Embryogeny appears to be of the Asterad type. The mature embryo is straight and chlorophyllous. The large (5.3 g) seeds are 89% water and show no dormancy, germinating without an external supply of water, sometimes while still on the parent plant. © 1990, CSIRO.

While few differences were observed in the SDS-PAGE patterns, we have characterized a set of developmentally regulated silk proteins after IEF and total protein staining, two of them likely corresponding to glycoproteins. Some of these tissue specific and stage specific proteins have been correlated with the receptivity state and may be used as markers. Whereas the esterase activity detection remains very similar throughout spikelet development, the level of general activity of peroxidase isozymes is very high in the silks and increases during the development.

Types of specialisation are summarised according to the response of the organisms. Some adaptations may be seen to the humid conditions by certain aquatic insects. Co-evolution between plants and animals is seen in pollination or cross fertilisation, seed dispersal and ""arms races' between plants and animals in parasitism and herbivory. Specialisation in resource utilisation can occur either by the species surviving as a narrow specialist or the development of special foraging methods. The rain forests of N Queensland have a characteristic physiognomy of tall forests with a closed but generally irregular canopy made up of many different species. The internal structure is not stable over a long period.

Selection for these mimetic phenomena is very different in each case and it is important to distinguish among categories of trophic, interspecific mimicry and sexually selected, nontrophic, intraspecific mimicry. Once categories are distinguished, the diversity of selection should clarify misunderstood concepts, such as the 'Batesian-Mallerian mimicry spectrum'.

This plant is characterized by broad intraspecific variation in size and proportions of floral parts. Floral morphology does not influence significantly the probability of fruit set. Among flowers setting fruit, spur length and size of petals have no significant effect on seed production, but capsules from long? and short?peduncted flowers contain significantly more seeds than capsules from flowers with intermediate peduncles. Individual plants differ significantly in average floral characteristics. Plants with comparatively long and short peduncles tend to produce more seeds than those with intermediate ones, even after accounting statistically for individual differences in flower production. These findings are interpreted as evidence of disruptive selection on peduncle length during the study season.

At all sites, the species is almost exclusively pollinated by a single species of day?flying hawkmoth. Differences between populations were significant for all traits examined, and population means exhibit a broad range of variation. When all characters are considered together, each population displays a unique combination of characters. Despite interpopulation differences in character means, local populations retain most of the variability of the entire species. Floral traits do not vary in unison among flowers, and at least four different subsets of independently varying traits are identifiable. Floral similarity between populations of V. cazorlensis was largely unrelated to geographic proximity, as revealed by analyses at both large and small geographic scales. The geographic pattern of floral variation among populations represents a random patchwork, with unique combinations of character means occurring randomly across the study region. Marked population differences in quantitative floral traits in spite of spatial constancy in the identity of pollinators, a disintegrated floral phenotype, and prevailingly random geographic variation among populations, suggest low adaptedness of the floral phenotype of V. cazorlensis to its current hawkmoth pollinators.

In Sardinia, at least, it is annual and dependent on sexual reproduction. Seeds remain in the fruit and germinate underwater. Some seeds germinate while still on the mother plant, others after a period of desiccation; low temperatures or periods in darkness induce germination of dormant seeds. Althenia is not able to utilize HCO3 - and is dependent on CO2 as a carbon source. The leaves reach the water surface where they not only get CO2, but are exposed to considerable wave action. They thus have relatively large marginal bundles of fibres. Althenia is monoecious, but some male and female flowers develop close together and form a bisexual floral unit. Pollination takes place either on the upper surface of the water (epihydrophily) or inside gas bubbles underwater (bubble autogamy) - which accounted for about half the seed set in cultivated populations. The pollen does not form stable rafts or ""search vehicles"", but spreads as individual grains over the water surface. Pollination at the water surface probably leads to a high degree of outbreeding. © 1990.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025638161

The flower is large, protogynous and nectarless. Its petals close after the female stage and again after the male stage. The mean duration of flowering of an individual flower is 34 days, while the flowering period of an individual tree lasts up to 40 days. The main pollinators of the flowers were beetles. Success of pollination is assumed to be affected by weather conditions at anthesis. Average fruit sets (ratios of fruits to flowers) were 1325%. Hand?pollination of 44 flowers produced a significantly higher fruit set (28 fruits) than control flowers (33/133). These results suggest that the fruit set is limited by pollination. The frequency of infertile ovules was higher in controls than in hand?pollinated fruits, indicating that the seed set was also limited by pollination. We propose a mimicry hypothesis in which the non?rewarding female?stage flower mimics the rewarding male?stage flower to explain the short life?span of an individual flower, the long flowering period of an individual tree, and the coexistence of flowers of various stages on a single tree.

In the SE USA, it occurs in the Appalachian Mountains and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces, but rarely in the intervening Piedmont. P. ciliaris is self-compatible but not autogamous. Nectar volume increased over the 6-7 day life span of a flower, reaching a maximum of 4 ?l and 1.0 mg of sugar (Mountains) or 6 ?l and 1.2 mg of sugar (Coastal Plain). Nectar concentrations were relatively constant in flowers of all ages and averaged 23% in the Mountains and 19% in the Coastal Plain. Most nectar appeared to be produced overnight. In the Mountains Papilio troilus (spicebush swallowtail) was the most frequent and effective pollinator. In the Coastal Plain P. palamedes (palamedes swallowtail) was predominant. These large butterflies were most active in the late morning and early afternoon. Levels of pollinator service were higher in the Mountains (0.81, 0.86) than in the Coastal Plain (0.63, 0.67). These values were reflected in higher levels of fruit-set in Mountain (83.9% in 1983, 86.5% in 1984) than in Coastal Plain (63.8, 65.5%) populations. Combining these observations with the fact that hand pollination increased fruit-set of Coastal Plain flowers 6.5-13.5% above open-pollinated controls, it appears that fruit-set is pollen- limited. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025590598

A synthetic population known as «Arizona Arid Environment Maize» was used as a source of heat-stress tolerance, and two Corn Belt-adapted, heat-stress sensitive inbreds, B73 and LH74, were chosen for improvement. An in vitro pollination-fertilization procedure was utilized to generate a series of selected and non-selected progenies by exposing the gametes to elevated (38 °C) and normal (28 °C) temperatures, respectively. Two single crosses (B73 x AZIOO and LH74 x AZIOO) and two back-crosses [B73 x (B73 x AZIOO) and LH74 x (LH74 x AZIOO)] were made. Out of the of 9,914 ovaries pollinated in this study, 1,250 kernels were formed from which 689 plants were obtained. A total of 112 progenies (14 per cross x temperature treatment) were generated by self-pollinating the resulting in vitro-derived plants and evaluated for pollen germination at 38°C and agronomic performance under heat-stress conditions. In all four crosses, pollen from the selected progenies was less sensitive to heat-stress-induced reductions in germination than was pollen from nonselected progenies. Similarly, the agronomic performance of the selected progenies was superior as evidenced by higher grain yields, greater seedling vigor, and reduced stalk and root lodging. The results from this study demonstrate that exposure to elevated temperature during gamete function can influence the heat-stress tolerance of pollen in the following generation. They also support the contention that gamete selection can enrich the frequencies of genes associated with useful agronomic traits, such as heat-stress tolerance. © 1990, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

Self?and interspecific incompatibility is expressed by flower abscission and not by inhibition of pollen germination or pollen tube growth. The incompatibility system is gametophytic and complementary, and it is likely that the auxin content in the pollinia triggers the incompatibility reaction.

Mean number of taxa per site per year was 6.8 for ants and 3.6 for pollinators. The ant assemblage varied more than the pollinator assemblage, particularly spatially. The ant assemblage varied more through space than through time (means of the proportional similarities for pairwise comparisons of assemblages were 0.37 and 0.51, respectively), while the pollinator assemblage varied equally through space and time (means of the proportional similarities were 0.53 and 0.50, respectively). For individual taxa of both assemblages, the coefficient of variation in relative abundance was large (>75%) for most spatial and temporal comparisons. In each assemblage there was a single taxon that was the least variable, in both time and space, in its relative abundance. Results, coupled with previous findings of significant variation among mutualist taxa in the magnitude of their beneficial effects, indicate that plants may be subject to highly variable selection by their mutualist assemblages. The most beneficial antguard was consistently rare; the most beneficial pollinator was abundant in one site-year but rare or absent in most site-years. The taxon that was consistently abundant was not an efficient pollinator.

In tests of this ""pollen donation hypothesis,' male reproductive success has usually been measured indirectly by flower production, pollinator visitation, or pollen removal. The pollen donation hypothesis was tested directly by quantifying the number of seeds sired by individual genotypes in a natural population of poke milkweed in SW Virginia. Multiple paternity was low within fruits, a fact which allowed the authors to use genotypes of progeny arrays to identify a unique pollen parent for 85% of the fruits produced in the population. Seeds sired (male success) and seeds produced (female success) were significantly correlated with flower number per plant. While the number of pollinaria removed, the usual estimator of male success in milkweeds, was highly correlated with numbers of seeds sired, it was even more highly correlated with numbers of seeds produced. Plants with many flowers did not behave primarily as males; individuals with the highest total reproductive success contributed equally as males and females. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025675205

Eleven families were represented from the 1502 spider individuals captured, the majority of which (> 85%) belonged to the families Theridüdae, Linyphiidae, Araneidae, Tetragnathidae, Lycosidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae. Of the adults collected (39 species, N = 203) 38% were orb?weavers, 33% were irregular or sheet?web weavers, and 29% were cursorial hunters. The crab spiders (Thomisidae), Xysticus cristatus (Clerck) and X. kochi Thorell, were the species most frequently collected. A low feeding frequency was observed in the field for the Xysticus spp. (<10% with prey, N = 395), and a wide variety of arthropod taxa was consumed by the crab spiders including eight orders of insects, other spider species and a representative from a family of earthworms. Although crab spiders have been noted as voracious predators of large social bees, this category made up only 3% (by number) of the prey. Previous reports found in the literature suggest that crab spiders that hunt on the flower inflorescence feed almost exclusively within a narrow range of pollinating insects, however, no supporting evidence for this contention was found, instead Xysticus spp. in European hay meadows are exceedingly polyphagous. The impact of mowing on meadow spider populations was evaluated using three methods, all yielding evidence that mowing had a negative effect on spider densities. Depending on the circumstances, the impact of mowing on spider densities in a diverse variety of meadows may range from mild to massive, however, emigration by spiders after their habitat has been disturbed, may serve as a beneficial arthropod generator, providing for the colonization of surrounding field crops.

This pattern has been observed for large bees foraging on flowering trees of Aesculus hippocastanum, A. octandra (Hippocastanaceae), Robinia pseudoacacia and Cladrastis lutea (Leguminosae) from temperate North America and Tilia sp. (Tiliaceae) in Scandinavia and, in the tropics, one Peltophorum pterocarpum (Leguminosae) in Malaysia, Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) in the Maldive Islands, and on Sarcotheca celebica (Oxalidaceae) in Indonesia. Upward foraging on inflorescences, whether upright or pendant, is consistent with well-known behaviour for bees on inflorescences of herbaceous plants. The downward movements between separated inflorescences may represent an exaggeration of the usual pattern exhibited by bees when they depart from high on one inflorescence and start low on the next one they visit. The observed patterns of bees foraging on trees for intra- and inter-inflorescence movements is energetically efficient. The former is likely because of the proximity of flowers within inflorescences and the greater ease and accuracy for bees making very short upward movements by flight or walking. The latter may be because the bee, starting high on a tree, gains mass as it accumulates its pay-load and downward flights are less energy-consuming than are upward or horizontal flights. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bombus; Flowering trees; Inflorescences; Optimal foraging; Pollination; Temperate; Tropics; Xylocopa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007280612

In Piptanthus nectar there were no traceable amino acids. Neither an evolutionary significance of amino acid contents in floral nectar nor their close correlation with bees, the main pollinators of both genera, could be confirmed from our studies. Rhododendron nectar showed antibiotic activity due to the presence of acetylandromedol. The biological significance of acetylandromedol, the main toxic principle from Rhododendron nectar, seems to be its antibiotic activity, which could possibly compensate for lower sugar contents in preventing bacterial growth. 1990 Deutsche Botanische Gesellschaft/German Botanical Society",acetylandromedol; amino acids; antibiotics; Floral nectar; Piptanthus; Rhododendron; sugars,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995025920

In vitro culture of immature embryos isolated at different times after anthesis showed that the youngest embryos are able to germinate, but within the third week after pollination, dormancy progressively affected most of the embryos. A radioimmunoassay showed that the endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) level, which increased sharply in the first half of the development period, fell at precisely the moment when embryo dormancy became established. An application of fluridone, before the increase of ABA level, prevented both ABA synthesis and development of embryo dormancy. Applied later, after the rise of the ABA level, fluridone could not prevent embryo dormancy development. Dormancy thus appears to be dependent on ABA synthesis but not concomitant with its accumulation; it must therefore be induced by ABA during maturation. Furthermore, a preincubation in water allowed dormant embryos to germinate. This acquisition of germinability could not be directly related to a leaching of free ABA.

Native bees also favoured species with high relative cover values and foraged on 70% of the 51 plant species visited by honey bees in the same period. Although only 30% of the regional flora are post-fire seed regenerators, these species were preferentially used by both the honey bee and native bee foragers. Fire, especially close-interval recurrent fire, can have a deleterious effect on the major melliferous species. Perennial reseeding species had a higher projective foliage cover than perennial sprouting species, but had lower cover at sites with shorter intervals between fires. A short interval between fires which decreases the local abundance of reseeding species may reduce the ability of a population to attract pollinators and, combined with the effect of a short interval between fires, may lead to the decline and eventual extinction of the population. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025243138

We have tested the fertilization abilities of the stressed spikelets and pollen using in vitro pollination-fertilization to determine their respective tolerance to stress. The synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was also analyzed in male and female tissues using electrophoresis of 35S-labeled proteins and fluorography, to establish a relationship between the physiological and molecular responses. Pollen, spikelets, and pollinated spikelets were exposed to selected temperatures (4, 28, 32, 36, or 40°C) and tested using an in vitro fertilization system. The fertilization rate is highly reduced when pollinated spikelets are exposed to temperatures over 36°C. When pollen and spikelets are exposed separately to temperature stress, the female tissues appear resistant to 4 hours of cold stress (4°C) or heat stress (40°C). Under heat shock conditions, the synthesis of a typical set of HSPs is induced in the female tissues. In contrast, the mature pollen is sensitive to heat stress and is responsible for the failure of fertilization at high temperatures. At the molecular level, no heat shock response is detected in the mature pollen.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000153413

Therefore, breeding improved cultivar is more complex than in several of the other crop species (2). Alfalfa grows naturally under more diverse conditions than most perennial species. There are ecotypes that are adapted to cold, hot, and dry climates and grow on soils that vary from heavy clay to sand. Alfalfa has survived temperatures as low as 64°C, and as high as 49° C, and may be found growing in areas with an annual precipitation of 25 cm3 or less (5). There are two main problems creating difficulties for breeders: i) Great labour costs, time and room for cutting production. ii) Pollen control in hybrid production. Results show that cloning of alfalfa by cuttings tends to create chromosomal instability, aneuploids and mixoploids (6).

Progeny of these bees have now largely colonized the American tropics. Their imminent arrival in the United States poses a serious threat to the beekeeping industry and to agriculture dependent on honeybee pollination. African and European bees are morphologically very similar. DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms are proving successful in distinguishing between the two. Several DNA markers specific to European honeybees have been described previously. Reported here are three cloned honeybee DNA probes that reveal polymorphisms that appear to be either African or European specific. Of fourteen alleles or haplotypes identified, five were present only in African and neotropical (Venezuelan and Mexican) African bees but absent in European?derived bees, two were present only in European?derived bees but absent in samples from South Africa. Another allele showed apparent frequency differences among populations. Such markers are useful in studying the genetics of neotropical African bee populations. Venezuelan and Mexican honeybee colonies show a preponderance of the African alleles with low levels of the European alleles. These observations of nuclear DNA, revealing limited paternal European introgression, together with previous mitochondrial DNA findings showing negligible European maternal gene flow into feral African populations, indicate that neotropical African bees are primarily African.

The abundance of inflorescences was greater in the mid than in the early and late periods of the flowering season. In the mid period, many plants were blooming and each plant had many flowering inflorescences. Inflorescences received most visits by honeyeaters in the early flowering period; the visitation rate declining as flowering progressed. Eastern spinebills were the most common floral visitors at all times during the season. The number of foraging probes made at inflorescences by eastern spinebills did not differ throughout the season. Foraging movements between inflorescences on the same plant were more frequent in the mid period than in the early and late periods. Long distance movements between plants (more than 10 m apart) were promoted by aggressive interactions between honeyeaters. Inflorescences flowering in the late period were less likely to develop follicles because there were fewer visits by birds and/or because resources had been allocated to inflorescences pollinated earlier in the season. The number of follicles produced per infructescence did not differ between flowering periods. Overall, the number of inflorescences produced per plant, the number of visits received per inflorescence and the proportion of inflorescences that developed follicles were greater in 1987 than in 1988.

Males patrol patches of Petunia flowers in search for females. They also wait for females in or on the flowers and perch for mates in the vicinity of blossoms. Copulation is always initiated on Petunia flowers. Flying in copulation posture, the couple visits Rrther flowers where the female continues to collect pollen. The mates land outside the Petunia patch to copulate for up to 20 min. and then take ofr separately. We interprete the flights in copula posture as male strateies to prevent the female from returning to the area of high competitor abundance for further pollen collecting after copulation. Thereby males may increase their chances to be the last male to mate before the eggs are fertilized. Femals and males of C. petuniae are the most frequent pollinators of purple flowered Petunia species and indiscriminately transfer pollen between them. Cytogenetic analyses of chromosome numbers and meiotic phases in individuals of two sympatric Petunia species and in presumable hybrids showed, however, that the species maintain their integrity. Spontaneous color choices in multicolored patches of dummy flowers revealed that C. petuniae bees have a high preference for Petunia?purple color tones, as seen by the human eye. We discuss the significance of color selectivity by C. petuniae bees and of the visual signals exhibited by purple flowered Petunia species to keep the coevolved reproductive strategies stable.

R. bulbosus. and R. polyanthemos. Parental plants were preferably taken from remote provenances, an F1 plant was selected to be crossed with pollen from the maternal parent, and the backcross offspring, altogether about 2300 plants in five backcross families, were tested individually with their pollen onto this parent. Backcross plants failing with their pollen on their backcrossed parent were selected and tested to one another in a diallel scheme of cross pollinations. The analyses based on these selected backcross plants showed 4 S?loci to be at work in all three species; in no case was it necessary to presume more than four. There were no indications that the higher levels of heterozygosity were favoured in any way. The main influence on the frequencies with which the different S?genotypes appeared among the selected backcross plants was seen to be associated with individual S?genes and not with specific S?gene constellations. The data are interpreted to testify to the ancient state of the complex S?gene system, to indicate that the 4 loci form the genuine number, at least for these three species, and to favour the view that they cooperate through a complex recognition molecule, at least a heterotetramer, where each of the four S?loci contribute by its specific polypeptide. The presumption of a restrictive supply of alleles in the team is supported by four of the five F1 plants showing S?gene identities between the crossed parental plants.

Selfing gave a greatly reduced seed set in all three species, indicating self?incompatibility. In the hybrids, morphology, alkaloid pattern, and meiotic pairing were studied. On the basis of the results, alternative models of genome evolution were considered. The genomic structures we consider most likely are P. bracteaturn AA. P. orientale AABIBI and P. pseudo?orientale AABlBIB2B2. The chromosomes of the B1 and B2 genomes are able to pair with each other but show preferential pairing with the chromosomes of their own kind. This explains the pairing behaviour in the hybrids, including occasional multivalents. Autosyndetic pairing in P. orientale, along with the multivalent formations in the triploid and tetraploid hybrids, show that occasional pairing may also take place between the chromosomes of the A and B genomes. This model agrees with the morphological intermediacy of P. pseudo?orientale and with the finding that the hybrid P. orientale x P. pseudo?orientale is morphologically very close to the former species. The alkaloid composition of the species suggests that thebaine and alpinigenine are produced by the A genome, isothe?baine, oripavine. mecambridine, and orientalidine by the BI (possibly also B2) genome.

A peculiar mode of growth of male specimens of E. aphylla is mentioned and its biological significance is briefly discussed. Among the visitors, representatives of certain groups of flies appear to be the most important pollinators, Hymenoptera taking a second place. The pollen rain of E. aphylla is already low at a distance of 15 m from the pollen source; the bulk of the pollen produced, if not removed by insects, is shed in aggregates of 2 to 600 grains and mostly falls down almost vertically in the dense thickets. In combination with the intermingled growth of male and female plants, this leads to gravitational pollination. The stickiness of the pollen is discussed in connection with the low rate of its dispersion by air currents, and a more direct method of assessment is suggested. The overall conclusion is that entomophily in some and conceivably in all Ephedra species is an established fact, also because of certain adaptations such as the stickiness of the (coherent) pollen grains; however, E. aphylla and possibly some or all of the other Ephedra species exhibit ambophily as well. By encasing female branchlets in gauze (so as to prevent insect visits), the relative importance of biotic vs. abiotic pollination was assessed by recording the rate of seed set. Our results suggest at least a partial dependence on entomophily for a maximum seed set. A certain dependence on biotic pollination in association with certain adaptive features (viz., either an incipient monocliny of the male strobili, or nectarial secretion in strictly diclinous forms) may be taken as a possible intermediate phase in the evolution from anemophily to entomophily and as a yardstick for the advent of biotic pollination among the earliest zoophilous angiosperms. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025660829

The modem average increase in U.S. corn yield is two bushels per acre, or about $330 million, annually with virtually no additional Input. This return is fueled by research investments In corn breeding that must be recovered. Seed companies meet the farmer's demand for more profitable hybrids (higher yield, lower harvest moisture, and easier harvest). Tens of thousands of hybrids are tested at hundreds of locations annually to identify widely adapted hybrids. Corn genetic resources include wild relatives, races, open pollinated varieties, genetic and cytogenetic markers, synthetics, and elite inbreds. Popular modem hybrids contain one or more elite inbreds. Successful corn breeders use the best genetic resources available; elite inbreds are now the best genetic resource. The U.S. patent system requires public access in return for a grant of exclusivity; this ensures continued breeding gain from elite inbreds, reducing feed and food costs for the public good. I suggest that we broaden the U.S. corn germ plasm base by sending elite inbreds to foreign climates, crossing them with superior local races and varieties, backcrossing to the elite inbreds, and selecting for better-adapted progeny before returning them for use in the United States. © 1990 The American Genetic Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025331853

Intraspecific patterns of nectar production indicate that source-sink dynamics and variation in plant size and/or vigour primarily affect nectar secretion rates within species. Interspecific patterns (production per flower declines patterns (production per flower declines with increasing inflorescence size) are also most consistent with a physiological explanation, namely the packaging of a limited allocation of photosynthate.

This hypothesis has frequently been used to describe the evolution of large floral displays in milkweeds (Asclepias). Most tests of the pollen donation hypothesis, however, have used indirect measures, such as flower production or pollen removal, to estimate male reproductive success. To test the pollen donation hypothesis directly, we performed a paternity analysis and determined the number of seeds sired by individual genotypes in a natural population of poke milkweed, A. exaltata, in southwestern Virginia. Seeds sired (male success) and seeds produced (female success) were significantly correlated with flower number per plant (for male success: r= 0.32, P < 0.05; for female success: r= 0.66, P < 0.0001). Functional gender of plants that reproduced both as males and females (N = 17) was not correlated with flower number per plant (r= 0.35, P>0.05), indicating that plants with large floral displays did not reproduce primarily as males. Percent fruit?set and seed number per fruit were higher in 1986, when levels of pollinarium removal also were higher. Furthermore, several umbels that experienced high pollinator activity selectively matured fruits that contained many seeds. We argue that the evolution of large floral displays in milkweeds is the result of selection to increase overall reproductive success rather than male reproductive success alone.

The pedicellate? and sessile?flowered species with different floral morphologies and ecological distributions exhibited distinct modes of reproductive systems in relation to their habitat conditions. The pedicellate?flowered species occurring in stable mesic temperate deciduous forests reproduce exclusively by seeds, while sessile?flowered species growing in the alluvial flood plain habitats depend to a large extent on vegetative reproduction to compensate for the insufficient sexual reproduction under ecologically unstable conditions, e.g., frequent disturbance due to flooding. These sessile?flowered species are characterized by low ovule numbers, subsequent low seed outputs and low fecundity levels. In contrast to the sessile?flowered species, the pedicellate?erect?flowered species showed very high seed setting rates of over 50%. Breeding experiments for four Japanese species suggest that, although they substantially possess the capability of both inbreeding and outbreeding, the high fecundity levels are maintained by predominant inbreeding system. Furthermore, resource levels in the stock organs of these species obviously determine fecundity levels. As a consequence the amount of reserved food in the rhizomes transferred to the next season is determined, which gurantees a continuous reproductive activity of a given individual plant.

Different environments in floodplain forests are associated with Laportea's allocation to male (fast drainage) vs. female (favorable growing conditions late in the season: heavy soil, high light and low density). In upland forests, both male and female allocations increase with productive conditions (high light and intermediate soil texture). Vegetative allocation decreases with stem density in upland forests. All types of reproduction are size-dependent, but male reproduction requires larger minimum sizes than female reproduction, probably reflecting selection for longer distance wind-pollination. Clonal growth allows persistence in dark upland areas with high amounts of litter, where seedling establishment is difficult. Upland plants also devote relatively little biomass to sexual reproduction and achene production. Reproductive specialization between male and female function within floodplains, and between fruit production and clonal spread within floodplains and between habitats, contributes to the competitive success of this species. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025640268

Control plants shed most of their flowers; pods that did set originated primarily from flowers at proximal positions on the raceme. Most pods set on the lower Part of the reproductive portion of the control plants. Chloroindole and GA3 application before tripping had no significant effect on pod-set pattern. However, GA3 applied after tripping significantly enhanced pod set at proximal flowers by 21 % but inter-raceme pod set was not significantly altered. Chloroindole applied after tripping significantly increased pod set, particularly at proximal flower positions on the raceme; this treatment increased inter-raceme pod set but the increase was significant only for the basal four racemes and racemes 11, 12 and 13. Application of BAP before or after tripping resulted in almost complete pod set on all racemes; but greater flower drop was observed on the uppermost five racemes of plants treated after tripping than on corresponding racemes of plants treated before tripping. The effects of BAP, chloroindole or GA3 treatment were not due to changes in the synchrony of flower opening. An adequate supply of a cytokinin appeared to be necessary at or before pollination to initiate changes in reproductive organs to prepare them to become net attractors of assimilates from other plant parts. Auxin and gibberellin were only effective in promoting fruit set 24 h after tripping. An adequate supply of auxin, and perhaps of gibberellin, in balance with cytokinin appears to be required after pollination to maintain the flow of adequate assimilates to enable further pod development and for maturation to proceed. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

In one of the seasons, the nutrient distribution in tissues from basal, median and distal segments of the fruit was examined. The concentration of all nutrients in fruit (skin, flesh and seeds inclusive) declined during growth. Concentrations of Ca, Cu and Fe in skin were consistently greater, and those of P and S consistently smaller than corresponding concentrations in flesh throughout the season. Concentrations of B, K, N, Mg, Mn and Zn in flesh only exceeded those in skin during early fruit development. In tissues of mature fruit, the highest concentrations were found in seeds for all nutrients except Ca, which was more concentrated in skin. Significant differences between concentrations in the basal and distal ends of fruit were found for Ca, K and N. These differences were present as early as 9 weeks after fruitset, and in the case of K, were time dependent. The quantity of all nutrients accumulated by fruit tended to increase steadily throughout fruit development, the pattern of accumulation for N, Cu and Fe showing a seasonal dependence. For most elements, nutrient accumulation was strongly associated with increase in dry matter. For Ca, there was significant accumulation during early growth, so that by 12 weeks after pollination, approximately 88% of the final content had been acquired, as opposed to only 35% of the ultimate fruit dry mass.

The objective of this study was to examine how various metabolic factors in developing maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm influence starch deposition. Kernels were grown in vitro on medium with: (a) zero N (-N), (b) optimum N (+N), or (c) -N from 3 to 20 days after pollination followed by +N until maturity (±N) to produce different degrees of endosperm growth and to promote an enhancement of starch synthesis midway through development. At intervals, kernels were harvested and levels of enzyme activities and carbohydrate and N constituents examined. Endosperm starch and protein accumulation were decreased in -N compared to +N kernels, but relief of N starvation increased both constituents. With greater movement of N into ±N kernels, endosperm sugar concentrations declined suggesting an inverse relationship between C and N transport. Unusually high concentrations of sugar in N stressed kernels did not appear to limit or enhance starch production. Rather, increased accumulation of starch in ±N endosperm was correlated with significant increases in the enzymatic activities of sucrose synthase and PPi-linked phosphofructokinase, and to a lessor extent hexokinase. In addition, the occurrence of specific proteins of the albumin/globulin fraction either increased, decreased, or remained unchanged in relation to starch synthesis.

Plants and birds were locally interdependent: mistletoes supplied a continuous resource of fruits or nectar that sustained permanent populations of pollinators (honeyeaters) and dispersers (honeyeaters and mistletoebirds). The reproductive phenology of Amyema quandang was central to the interactions. Amyema quandang flowered in winter and annual fruit crops overlapped so that ripe fruit was continuously available. Spiny?cheeked honeyeaters obtained most of their energy requirements from mistletoe nectar in winter and mistletoe fruit in summer. Higher honeyeater densities were sustained by flowering in winter. Mistletoebirds were present in low density throughout the year and subsisted on a diet of mistletoe fruit and a few insects. The reproductive strategy of A. quandang probably evolved in response to the pollination and dispersal service provided by honeyeaters in inland Australia. Neither spiny?cheeked honeyeaters nor mistletoebirds have adaptations resulting from evolutionary interactions with A. quandang. The high specificity of their mutualism is a result of: (i) the abundance of A. quandang in relation to other nectar and fruit producing plants in the community: (ii) the year?round production by A. quandang of the primary source of fruit or nectar for honeyeaters and mistletoebirds: (iii) the facultative specialization of both birds on A. quandang; and (iv) the reluctance or inability of other frugivorous birds in the community to consume A. quandang fruit.

As a consequence, the pollen grains do not germinate directly on the ovule but on the outer surface of the carpel (on the stigma) and the pollen tubes reach the ovules only inside the ovary. The carpel not only provides protection to the ovulesa trait that is also present in various gymnosperms by other meansbut it also opens new possibilities for fine-tuned interactions between the male and the female gametophytes. Intraspecific incompatibility systems that function in the stigma and the pathway to the ovules are important new acquisitions of the angiosperms. They prevent fertilization of egg cells by sperm cells with too similar genotypes. At the same time, the intervention of the style enhances pollen tube selection among the entire pollen portion that has been transferred to the stigma in the process of pollination, and therefore, fertilization by the most vigorous male gametophytes. Comparative studies of living plants indicate that members of the Magnoliidae retain the largest number of primitive floral characters among extant angiosperms. This has subsequently been reinforced by the fossil record of angiosperms.

In one treatment, all flowers were pollinated, allowing total seed production to be measured. In the second, all flowers were removed, preventing any post-anthesis investment (Post-AI). In the third, the daily pattern of investment in capsules was measured by reaping capsules a random number of days after fertilization. This showed that post-AI was complete within fourteen days of fertilization, and competed directly with investment in pollen and attractive structures. The investment in primary female structures exceeds investment in anthers, and the mass of seeds is greater still. Significant between population variation in post-AI is found, with the population variation in post-AI is found, with the population with an annual life history and small flowers having the greatest values. The mass of the corolla is a good predictor of ovary and capsule mass, and it is argued that the cumulative corolla mass can thus be used as an indirect measure of parental investment.

The amino acid concentration of the nectar increased drastically after pollen addition both in Hibiscus and in the two other species investigated. The main amino acid responsible for this increase was proline. After puncturing or otherwise injuring a flower, the amino acid composition of the nectar is altered. In this case, the increase is due mainly to asparagine. Although contamination of nectar by pollen may be a common and natural event in many flowers, especially in those pollinated by butterflies, such an alteration in nectar constituents should be carefully discussed when considering amino acid concentration or composition in relation to pollinator-plant Devolutionary lines. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001289124

Ethylene-induced coloration of isolated lips was inhibited by treatment with 2,5 norbornadiene, cycloheximide and actinomycin-D. The latter, however, was less effective. The results therefore indicate that emasculation and ethylene-induced anthocyanin synthesis is regulated both at the translational and transcriptional levels. The red color of the lip was composed of at least six anthocyanins that were based on three different aglucones, i.e. cyanidin, peonidin and malvidin.

Fruit growth is enhanced beyond the parthenocarpic level by pollination. Sectorially different fruit growth, as observed in pollinated cucumber, can be ascribed to the inability of pollen tubes to reach the ovules at the pedicel end of the elongated ovary.

Variation in flower size was caused by variation within genets and, more drastically, by temperature fluctuations. The hawk moth Enyo lugubris visited flowers from time of anthesis until sunrise, when bumble bees Bombus pennsylvanicus arrived. Flower morphology affected pollen deposition during single hawk moth visits, single bumble bee visits, or unlimited hawk moth and bumble bee visits. The morphological variables with strongest effects differed in each case, and could be related to the foraging technique of each pollinator. Floral morphology affected pollen removal from flowers more than it influenced pollen receipt. Hawk moths could potentially fully pollinate I. trichocarpa before pollen from later rising bumble bees could send tubes to ovules, but tube growth rate increased with rising morning temperatures. Thus, ovules could potentially have been fertilized by a mixture of pollen deposited by hawk moths and by bumble bees. Low morning temperatures excluded hawk moths entirely from I. trichocarpa pollination, by delaying anthesis.

Firstly, self-pollination and autogamy treatments failed to produce any fruit in B. spinulosa and produced very few fruit in B. paludosa. This suggests that cross pollen is required to produce the level of fruit set observed in the field. Secondly, when plants were given abundant cross pollen, fruit set was not altered in B. spinulosa but was in B. paludosa. Although the number of follicles per inflorescence was was not different for open-pollinated (control) and manipulated B. paludosa inflorescences, the latter produced twice the proportion of inflorescences with follicles produced by control plants and twice the total number of follicles per plant. Thirdly, larger floral display in open-pollinated B. spinulosa plants was associated with a greater production of fruit. However, larger floral display was not associated with a greater reproductive output in B. paludosa, and we suggest that recurrent pollen-limitation in this species may be responsible for this result. © 1990, CSIRO.

An average of 63 seed-bearing inflorescences were produced per plant.

In figs, flowering is synchronous within a tree and the specialist pollinators/seed predators can only survive briefly away from trees. Consequently, population-level flowering asynchrony must extend year-round for pollinators to persist locally. In repeated stochastic simulations using phenological traits of Ficus natalensis, a median of 95 trees was required to produce an asynchronous sequence that could maintain local pollinator populations for 4 yr. However, many trees in those simulated populations were either male-sterile (10%) or both male- and female-sterile (35%), because their sexual phases were not well timed with the opposite phases of other trees. Sterility within a population approached zero at 2-3 times the critical population size. Both the predicted critical population size and frequency of success of the trees within it depended strongly on the duration of reproductive episodes and the intervals between episodes. Doubling the length of time over which individuals could donate pollen resulted in a 39% decrease in critical population size and a 27% increased likelihood that individuals would achieve at least some reproductive success. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025626993

The evolution of the selfing rate is controlled mainly by (1) the benefit of enhanced genetic relatedness to seeds and (2) the cost of lowered fitness of selfed offspring (inbreeding depression), being modified by (3) fertility assurance under pollen limitation, (4) reduced performance as pollen donor, (5) reduced expenditure to male function, and (6) lowered genetic recombination. Models of the joint evolution of selfing and inbreeding depression predict either strong outcrossing or predominant selfing. Although wind?pollinated plants fit the prediction, some animal?pollinated species have intermediate selfing rates, refuting the theory. Second, three resource allocation models are analyzed, in which an individual plant optimally allocates limited resources to outcrossed seeds, selfed seeds, and to energy reserves for the next year. The first model explains how the number of outcrossed and selfed offspring change with plant size when they differ in dispersal distance. The second model predicts that, in a disturbed habitat, the plant is likely to be annual and to produce both selfed and outcrossed seeds; in contrast, in a stable habitat, the plant tends to be perennial and to abort selfed seeds selectively. Hand pollination may increase seed production for perennials but not for annuals. The third model explains the observed difference between animal and wind pollinated plants in the out?crossing rate pattern by the difference in the way pollen acquisition increases with investment.

Self-pollination of an M3 mutant produced M4 progeny segregating high catalase phenotypes (average 40% greater than wild type) at a frequency of about 60%. The high catalase phenotype cosegregated precisely with O2-resistant photosynthesis. About 25% of the F1 progeny of reciprocal crosses between the same M3 mutant and wild type had high catalase activity, whether the mutant was used as the maternal or paternal parent, indicating nuclear inheritance. In high-catalase mutants the activity of NADH-hydroxypyruvate reductase, another peroxisomal enzyme, was the same as wild type. The mutants released 15% less photorespiratory CO2as a percent of net photosynthesis in CO2-free 21% O2 and 36% less in CO2-free 42% O2 compared with wild type. The mutant leaf tissue also released less 14CO2 per [1-14C]glycolate metabolized than wild type in normal air, consistent with less photorespiration in the mutant. The O2-resistant photosynthesis appears to be caused by a decrease in photorespiration especially under conditions of high O2 where the stoichiometry of CO2 release per glycolate metabolized is expected to be enhanced. The higher catalase activity in the mutant may decrease the nonenzymatic peroxidation of keto-acids such as hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate by photorespiratory H2O2.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001414371

Genetic factors were incorporated as (1) improved loblolly seedlings from a commercial clonal seed orchard and (2) slash seedlings from four fast-growing, open-pollinated seed-orchard clones. Three replications of a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experiment were established on a Typic Haplaquod soil in northern Florida using four cultural treatments: no treatment (F0H0); weed control (F0H1); fertilizer (F1F0); and combination of weed control and fertilizer (F1H1) for each species. During the first year there were large, sustained responses to all cultural practices. Loblolly and slash pine showed similar growth responses and had a lengthened growing season (60-100 days). Slash pine growth was superior to that of loblolly. Growth responses observed during the first year continued. After 4 years, irrigation had no measurable effect on tree growth. Both pine species responded equally to F1H0 and F0H1, but slash retained a slight edge. Extra nutrients]available via fertilizer, reduced competition, or additional rooting space, increased slash-pine volume index from an average of 2.0 m3 ha-1 (F0H0) to 11.90 and 13.59 m3 ha-1 (F0H1 and F1H0, respectively). The F1H1 treatment produced the largest slash-pine response, diameter at breast height (Dbh) averaged 9.84 cm, height reached 5.02 m, and volume index rose to about 22.94 m3 ha-1. With teh F1H1 treatment, average loblolly-pine height and volume exceeded that of the average slash pine. At age 4, the growth response due to increased nutrient supply was 13-29 times that of the best genetic response within F0H0 trees of the four slash-pine progenies.

A decreased number of cells per endosperm was observed at 10 DAP (and later sampling times) in kernels cultured in medium containing ABA from 5 DAP, and in kernels transferred at 8 DAP to medium containing ABA, but not in kernels transferred at 11 DAP to medium containing ABA. The number of starch granules per endosperm was decreased in some treatments, but the reduction, when apparent, was comparable to the decreased number of endosperm cells. The effect on endosperm fresh weight was slight, transient, and appeared to be secondary to the effect on cell number. Mature endosperm dry weight was reduced when kernels were cultured continuously in medium containing ABA. Endosperm (+)-ABA content of kernels cultured in 0, 3, 10, 30, 100, or 300 micromolar (±)-ABA was measured at 10 DAP by indirect ELISA using a monoclonal antibody. Content of (+)-ABA in endosperms correlated negatively (R = -0.92) with endosperm cell number.

Bumble bees Bombus spp. removed a median of 50-80% of the available pollen during 1st visits to species with exposed anthers. Only 19% was removed during initial manipulation of lupine flowers, which present pollen indirectly. Within species, removal increased with visit duration; it did not additionally depend on the number of visits involved. Removal typically changed in direct proportion to differences in pollen availability. Pollen size also affected removal, but it is unclear that this effect is direct. In most cases, removal was unaffected by species or caste of bee involved. Succeeding visits to a flower removed either a fixed or, more commonly, a declining proportion of the pollen remaining in a flower. A model of pollen dispersal indicates that a constant removal proportion would maximize dispersal when the number of visits a flower receives varies little. Diminishing proportional removal would allow plants to maintain pollen dispersal when the frequency of pollinator visits is uncertain. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025205948

There are three kinds of adaptation for entomophily: (1) adaptations to substrates of animal origin, (2) morphological adaptations and (3) chemical adaptations. Species of Sptachnum and the entomophilous species of Tayloria are restricted to the dung of herbivorous mammals. Species of Tetraplodon grow on skeletal remains, on antlers, on stomach pellets of predatory birds, or on dung, which contains both bone and hair. The entomophilous species Aplodon wormskioldii grows on corpses, on caribou (reindeer) dung, bones and antlers, on owl pellets, or on enriched gravel. Cultivation experiments indicate that protonema and shoots of Splachnum sphaericum have a greater tolerance for concentrated dung liquid than the control species Physcomitrium pyrij'orme, Funaria hygrometrica and Pohlia nutans. Tetraplodon mnioides, A. wormskioldii and Splachnum vasculosum have higher nitrogen contents in their tissues than do other arctic bryophytcs and the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium in the plant tissues of T. mnioides and A. wormskioldii reflect those of their substrata. The adaptation to grow on osmotically concentrated substrates confers a selective advantage upon these species. Morphological adaptations of the sporophyte are the enlarged, coloured neck (hypophysis), the coloured upper region of the seta, and the hygroscopic movements of the urn wall and peristome which help the spores to leave the urn. The small, thin?walled spores are dispersed in clumps on the hairs of visiting flies. Chemical adaptations are the odours produced and released by the sporophyles. Several volatile compounds have been found in the urn and hypophysis of entomophilous species, volatile octane derivatives and organic acids such as acetic, propionic and butyric acids particularly in the hypophysis. Volatile compounds may be released through the many stomata of the hypophysis. The seta, the gametophyte and the substratum do not contain these compounds. Flies which are attracted to and visit species of Splachnum in Europe and North America include Scatophaga furcala, (Scatophagidae), Pyrellia cyanicolor, Myospila metida (Muscidae) and Delia platura (Anthomyidae). The most common visitors to Tetraplodon mnioides are Delia platura and species of the Muscidae. Scatophagids have been found to benefit from a possible increase in copulatory success after visiting these plants. Entomophilly in the Splachnaceae can be regarded as chemical mimicry. Other organisms that mimic faecal/carrion odours to attract flies to disperse the spores include the macrofungus Phallus impudkus. Some species in the angiospcrm families Ramcsiaccae and Araceae, which arc pollinated by flies, produce odours resembling those found in the Splachnaceae. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

Results of general survey in Asian populations and of a detailed population study carried out in Thailand are presented. Estimated outcrossing rates of Asian wild rices ranged from 5 to 60%, though cultivated rices are predominantly selfing. Interpopulational comparison showed mating system is associated with life?history traits, resulting in the differentiation into two ecotypes; predominantly selfing annuals having high reproductive effort and mixed?mating perennials having low reproductive effort. Resource allocation to pollen production vs. seed production (pollination effort) proved to be correlated with outcrossing rate. Isozyme study showed that both mating system and reproductive system jointly influence genetic structure of populations such as the level of intrapopulational variability and the extent of interpopulational differentiation. Evolution of selfing in this plant group might have been promoted by selection for seed propagation which was brought by environmental change and/or habitat disturbance.

When soil phosphorus availability was low, phosphorus uptake was increased by elevated CO2. This may have been related to changes in mycorrhizal competition. When the phosphorus concentration in the youngest fully expanded needles was above 600 milligrams per kilogram the shoot weight of all pine families was greater at high CO2 due to increases in rates of photosynthesis. More dry weight was partitioned to the stems of P. radiata family 20010 and P. caribaea. At foliar phosphorus concentrations above 1000 milligrams per kilogram (P. radiata) and 700 milligrams per kilogram (P. caribaea), growth did not increase at 340 microliters of CO2 per liter. Soluble sugar levels in the same needles mirrored the growth response, but the starch concentration declined with increasing phosphorus.

Cotton reproduces by autogamy and allogamy at frequencies determined by relative abundance of pollen and pollination vectors. Hand-pollinations of treated glandless cotton (Acala 8160) were made using pollen from a glanded variety (Murietta 4), to determine whether OMT and SD 227559 had selective male-sterilizing activity or were merely phytotoxic. Hybrid seed were distinguished from selfs by observations for the dominant glanded trait. Three rates of each chemical were sequentially applied twice at a three-week interval during square formation and first bloom. Pollinations were made twice weekly for 7 weeks during flowering. The occurrence of out-crossing in untreated plants was about 1%. Hybrid seeds per boll from hand-pollinated, untreated plants averaged 51%, indicating foreign pollen successfully competed with self pollen.

Studies of the receptive surfaces of stigmas from representatives of all genera of the family have shown that a range of types exists from papillate to non?papillate, and from wet, bearing a free?running secretion, to dry, lacking such a secretion, most genera falling in the former category. Self?incompatibility is wholly restricted to wet?stigma species, and direct and circumstantial evidence indicates that it is always likely to be of the gametophytic type, as in certain Oenothera species that have been the subjects of detailed genetical and physiological research. Whilst Oenothera and most other self?incompatible species in the family appear to reject incompatible pollen mainly in the stigma surface layers, the precise site is subject to both genetical and environmentally?determined variation. Intraspecific polymorphy in sex function is known in the genus Fuchsia, most species of which have wet stigmas. Female sterility in the functionally male flowers of certain species of this genus appears simply to be due to a failure to produce adequate stigma secretion. All species of the dry?stigma genera in the family are self?compatible, but not all are inbreeding because of the existence of other mechanisms enforcing outcrossing. The stigmas of some possess certain unique features, apparently related to water conservation. Possible evolutionary trends in the family and in the breeding and pollination systems are briefly discussed in the light of what is now known of pollen?stigma relationships.

A cDNA clone of maize (Zea mays L.) oleosin KD 18 was obtained by screening a cDNA library of maturing maize embryos with cDNA probes obtained by reverse transcription of size-fractionated poly(A)+RNA, and identifying the KD 18 clones using hybrid-select translation followed by immunorecognition of the translation products. Northern hybridization analyses using KD 18 cDNA as a probe were employed to study the levels of KD 18 mRNA. Two species of KD 18 mRNA were found; the major one had 1.1 kb and the minor one contained 1.0 kb. The presence of KD 18 mRNA was tissue specific and was found only in the maturing embryo. The level of KD 18 mRNA in the embryo increased during seed maturation and reached a peak 40 days after pollination. It declined rapidly as the kernel matured and was not detectable 2 days after seed imbibition. Abscisic acid applied to imbibing mature kernels inhibited germination and, at the same time, enhanced the level of KD 18 mRNA and prolonged its presence. An examination of the published genomic sequence of the KD 18 gene revealed putative ABA-responsive sequences in the 5? upstream region of the coding sequence. Southern hybridization of restriction enzyme digests of genomic DNA showed two possible KD 18 genes. No specific amplification of the KD 18 gene was apparent in the maturing embryo. The pattern of gene expression is similar, although not identical, to that of oleosin KD 16 gene in the same maize embryo. The coordinate expression of the two maize oleosin genes emphasizes the close similarity among oleosin isoforms. © 1990.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0011393241

Data at all the main steps of the H. bulbosum technique were recorded and statistically analyzed. Significant differences between barley genotypes were demonstrated for all characters. It was confirmed that Apex has poor crossability with H. bulbosum. Out of the three F1 hybrids having Apex as one parent, two exhibited low crossability similarly to Apex but one showed significantly higher seed setting than Apex.

The ability of the hummingbird to efficiently process and excrete such large volumes of water must surely entail structural or functional specializations of the kidney and GI tract. The rate of water flux and nutrient extraction efficiency are also influenced, however, by the animal's feeding behavior. Because meal size affects the passage rate of food through the digestive tract (and, therefore, assimilation efficiency), feeding frequency and the amount of nectar consumed per feeding bout will affect the efficiency of nutrient absorption. Ultimately, the water and nutrient content of the nectar produced by the plants should reflect the ability of the hummingbird pollinator to balance its required intake of energy and electrolytes with its ability to excrete the accompanying water load. The simultaneous regulation of water and energy balance in hummingbirds consequently involves the complex integration of renal and intestinal functions and of these physiological processes with behavior and ecology. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025523694

Two thirds of the plants in this population are O6 interchange heterozygotes and may be considered as N.S complex heterozygotes. The N complexes are two interchanges removed from the standard axillaris chromosome end sequence characteristic of Isotoma structural homozygotes and they carry the PGM 3 allele. Most of the N complexes are non-transmissible through the pollen and where not so, carry a recessive lethal factor. The associated S complexes in the O6 interchange heterozygotes carry the standard chromosome end sequence and either PGM 1 or PGM 2. It is suggested that in highly inbreeding species with terminally localized chiasmata the occurrence of balanced deleterious recessives within supergenes results in permanent hybridity and that the yield of fully heterozygous offspring must be very low, following selling, or very occasional, following rare cross pollination events. Deterministic models incorporating the above observations and deductions indicate that O6 hybrids should occur at a frequency of approximately 66 per cent under a regime involving approximately 98 per cent recurrent selling irrespective of whether the N complex is transmissible or not transmissible in the pollen. These values are comparable to those actually found in the Pigeon Rock population. It is concluded that complex hybridity in I. petraea had its origin in the Pigeon Rock population, and arose within highly inbreeding lineages in which mutations contributing to an increasingly efficient transmission of permanently heterozygous parental genotypes were selected. © 1990 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966173635

For flowers receiving a single honey bee visit, corolla size was positively correlated with pollen removal, but not with pollen deposition on stigmas or seed production. Flowers receiving an average of 3.7 honey bee visits (in 1987) also showed a correlation between corolla size and pollen removal. When flowers were visited an average c5.7 times by honey bees (1988) there was no significant relationship between corolla size and either pollen removal or estimates of female reproductive success (pollen deposition on stigmas and seed production). Honey bees demonstrated a preference for large flowers, either by significantly overvisiting large flowers or by visiting the large flowers before visiting smaller flowers. Most radish flowers receive numerous visits, but even with frequent visitation, at least 20% of the pollen a flower produced was not removed. Flowers with greater pollen production had a larger proportion of pollen removed. Pollen removal was a positive decelerating function of honey bee visitation frequency. Number of pollen grains removed per visit declined with increasing honey bee visits. The male fitness function (pollen removal plotted against pollen production) was positive and decelerating in 2 experiments; positive and linear in one study. Large flowers may have greater male success than small flowers by virtue of their greater pollen production, their greater pollinator visitation frequency, and their earlier pollinator visitation. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025206093

Leaf number of reproductive individuals as well as of nonreproductive ones, taken as an indication of size class, varies clinally from N to S, with reproductive individuals in S populations having mean leaf numbers c12 times greater than those at the N end of the range. Female cone size and mature ovule weight also vary along this gradient. Using leaf number as a predictor of sexual maturity, 37-100% of the individuals present in a population were mature. The percent of mature individuals participating in the 1987 coning episode ranged from none in 3 southern populations to 68% elsewhere. In 9 of 10 samples, more males than females participated in the 1987 coning episode, with a collective sex ratio slightly male biased for all populations sampled. Successive cone production by both sexes is apparently separated by an interval of several years. The periodicity with which fire is used as a fire suppression method may affect the frequency of cone production in some populations, perhaps preventing it entirely. The apparent absence of recruitment in some populations may result from long-term seed collection by humans for horticultural purposes as well as very poor seed dispersal. The weevil Tranes internatus was observed occupying the internal tissues of female cones; this insect may be involved in pollination. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025665951

In theory these characteristics should give homostyles in advantage over heterostyles and homostyly should spread. In fact primrose populations with significant numbers of homostyles are rare in Britain and the frequency of homostyles in them has not noticeably increased during 40 years of observation. In search of an ecological explanation for the homostyle handicap, growth, survival and reproduction of heterostyle (pin and thrum) and homostyle primroses were compared. A significant negative relationship between seed number capsule-1 and mean seed weight occurred in all three morphs. This could mean that in years of poor pollination when heterostyle seed set is low, heterostyle seeds will be significantly larger than homostyle seeds. If seed size is more important than seed number in determining the fitness of primrose morphs, the trade-off between seed size and seed number could handicap homostyles on the common occasions when heterostyle seed set is pollinator-limited. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025603939

The catkins are effective absorbers of solar radiation and temperatures within the catkins of each sex differ. Generally, those of the female plants are warmer than those of male plants and there may be freer flow of warm air in staminate catkins. These differences can be explained, in part, by the greater size and bulk of the pistillate catkins, and the greater density of pubescence. Catkins of both sexes obtain additional heat units of up to c50%, the pistillate catkins c20% more than the staminate ones, early in the sunny part of the summer when pollination takes place, and the pistillate catkins obtain an additional 25% as they mature for the rest of the short and cloudier arctic summer. The direct importance of this for pollination is not evidenced through nectar characteristics (concentration of sugars), but is important for the catkin's maturation to sexual activity (pollen shedding, stigma receptivity and insect pollination) as one of the earliest blossoms of the summer. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0025598523

Dedeckera, an outcrossing (protandrous) evolutionary relict from the Mojave desert of California has a seed set of only 2.5% and no means of vegetative reproduction. We show here that the most probable explanation for this exceptional result is that there are genetically mediated embryonic abnormalities. The percentage of fully viable seeds is further reduced by low viability, germinability, and post-germination developmental failure. Genetic studies involving extinction have emphasized inbreeding depression and homozygosity4-8, but Dedeckera is highly heterozygous (27%). Outcrossing does not significantly increase seed set over selfing, suggesting that a high segregational genetic load is primarily responsible for the low seed set in Dedeckera.

Flower morphology of C. japonica changed greatly for about 12 hours after flower-opening and the maximum duration of nectar secretion was 2 days. The nectar volume peaked at 11:00 and 15:00, and declined at night and at 13:00 regardless of time elapsed after flower-opening. The nectar volume at the two peaks was, on average, 0.25 ?l on bagged inflorescences and 0.1?l on unbagged inflorescences (both, sugar concentration=60%). The flower secreted nectar compensatory when the nectar was removed. This means that insects consume more nectar than the difference of nectar volume between bagged and unbagged flowers. Apis cerana is a primary visitor of this flower, and was the only species for which we confirmed pollen on the body, among many species of flower visiting insects to this flower. Apis cerana visited intensively at the two peaks of nectar secretion. Visits of the other insects were rather constant or intensive only when there was no nectar secretion. Thus flowers of C. japonica with morphologically unprotected nectaries may increase likelihood that their nectar is used by certain pollinators, by controlling the nectar secretion time in day.

The production of hybrids offers the potential advantages of minimizing inbreeding depression, maximizing genetic heterozygosity, and providing a uniform, consistent phenotype, which potentially will lead to improvements in yield, persistence, disease tolerance, and quality. The use of artificial seed technology in alfalfa will allow the mass propagation of parental, self-sterile lines for the commercial production of hybrids. The ability to dry somatic embryos as artificial seeds provides the added advantages of long term germplasm storage, and international transport of pathogen free clones. The cell culture system described maximizes the production of synchronized somatic embryos, and minimizes somaclonal variation. These somatic embryos can be induced to acquire desiccation tolerance by treatment with ABA or any one of several environmental stresses, including water and nutrient stresses, if applied to the embryos at the cotyledonary stage of development. The embryos have been subsequently air dried slowly (over 7 days) or rapidly (over 1 day) to moisture contents less than 15% water and remain fully viable. Dry somatic embryos have been stored with no loss of viability for 8 months at room temperature and humidity. Dry somatic embryos are germinated on moist germination paper and follow a similar developmental pattern to seedlings from true seed, but are less vigorous.

Metaphase nuclei from two-celled embryos had 5 to 10 maize chromosomes, most of which were lost during the second cell division. About half the metaphase nuclei from four-celled embryos had no maize chromosomes, and the remainder had one to five. Anaphase or telophase nuclei from four-celled embryos showed no maize chromosomes in about half the cells and one or more pairs of lagging maize daughter chromosomes in the remainder. No maize chromosomes were seen in metaphase preparations from embryos with eight or more cells. These data strongly suggest that all maize chromosomes were lost during the first three cell-division cycles in most embryos.

In vitro fertilization was traced using silk excision and autoradiography with 32P-radiolabelled pollen and occurred between 4 and 7 h after the pollination of 4.5-cm-long silks. This study supports the validity of the in vitro pollination method for studying fertilization and emphasizes the importance of using a developmentally sensitive index (silk length) for establishing female developmental stage. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Female receptivity; In vitro pollination; Silk length; Timing of fertilization; Zea mays L,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343983815

Discrimination was equally evident in experiments that were the in vitro equivalents of reciprocal pollinations. In a TAPS-buffered medium, self eluates depressed pollen germination in a dose-dependent manner. TAPS medium allowed a bioassay of the effects of SLSG in eluates because it optimized germination in a way that eliminated the complicating features of the stimulatory substances in the eluates. Stigma eluates affected percentage pollen germination and optimum calcium concentrations in vitro whether or not SLSG were present in the eluates, but differently in different media, and depending on whether the eluates were cross or self with respect to the pollen tested.

Several recent reports conclude that bees fail to assess pollen harvest rates when foraging for nectar and pollen. A native nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium Cavanilles) that is visited exclusively for pollen by both solitary and social bees (eg. Ptiloglossa and Bombus) was studied in SE Arizona and SW New Mexico. The flowers have no nectaries. Two experiments were deployed that eliminated ""pollen feedback"" to the bees by experimentally manipulating flowers prior to bee visits. The two methods were 1) plugging poricidal anthers with glue and 2) emptying anthers of pollen by vibration prior to bee visitation. Both experiments demonstrated that bees directly assess pollen harvest on a flower-by-flower basis, and significantly tailor their handling times, number of vibratile buzzes per flower and grooming bouts according to the ongoing harvest on a given flower. In comparison to experimental flowers, floral handling times were extended for both Bombus and Ptiloglossa on virgin flowers. Greater numbers of intrafloral buzzes and numbers of times bees groomed pollen and packed it into their scopae while still on the flower were also more frequent at virgin versus experimental flowers. Flowers with glued andreocia received uniformly brief visits from Bombus and Ptiloglossa with fewer sonications and virtually no bouts of grooming. Curtailed handling with few buzzes and grooms also characterized visits to our manually harvested flowers wherein pollen was artificially depleted. Sonicating bees respond positively to pollen-feedback while harvesting from individual flowers, and therefore we expect them to adjust their harvesting tempo according to the currency of available pollen (standing crop) within Solanum floral patches. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus; Buzz pollination; Nightshade; Ptiloglossa; Vibratile,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024939219

To study the effect of genotype and temperature on pollen performance, we conducted greenhouse experiments at controlled temperatures. Individual florets of four genotypes that are known to differ in seed production were hand pollinated at four temperatures (14°, 18°, 22°, 26° C) both in vivo and via a semiin-vitro method involving excised florets on agar. Pollen germination and tube growth were determined with UV-fluorescence microscopy and scored in six classes at 2 h after pollination in vitro and after 0.5, 2 and 5 h in vivo. In vitro, both genotype and temperature had a significant effect on the performance of self-pollen. Pollen tube growth increased with temperature. In cross-pollinations, the pistil parent had a significant effect on pollen tube growth, and there was also a significant pistil-by-temperature interaction. In vivo, genotype and temperature significantly affected pollen performance. The genotype-by-temperature interaction was only significant 5 h after pollination. One genotype with low seed yield was pseudoself-compatible and was a relatively poor mother after cross-pollination. The effects of genotype and temperature on the growth of self-pollen might be exploited in a breeding programme. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Genotype; Lolium perenne; Pollen tube; Seed production; Self-incompatibility; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001265108

Here, we report on experimental pollinations using foreign pollen from two co-flowering species that share pollinators with P. viscosum. Experiments were designed to ascertain whether improper pollen transfer causes reduced seed set under controlled conditions and, if so, to determine the stage at which interference occurs. In flowers pre-treated by pollination with either Mertensia or Castilleja pollen, adherence of subsequently deposited conspecific pollen grains was unaffected. However, conspecific grains had significantly lower germination and ovule fertilization success in flowers receiving foreign pollen than in controls. These results suggest that pollinator infidelity in high alpine plant communities can reduce female reproductive success of P. viscosum by inhibiting the performance of conspecific pollen grains. Negative effects of Mertensia and Castilleja pollen were comparable despite large interspecific differences in pollen grain morphology. Accordingly, susceptibility to foreign pollen interference appears to be an intrinsic property of P. viscosum that is not dependent on the unique structural properties of pollen produced by competitive species. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Castilleja; Competition; Mertensia; Polemonium; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024911937

Protein bodies increase in size with distance from the aleurone layer of the developing endosperm; this reflects a process of cell maturation. The protein bodies within the subaleurone cell layer are the smallest and contain little or no alpha-zein; beta-zein and gamma-zein are distributed throughout these small protein bodies. The protein bodies in cells farther away from the aleurone layer are progressively larger, and immunostaining for alpha-zein occurs over locules in the central region of these protein bodies.

Plant costs alone was estimated to be $2315 with additional replanting costs of $93 for 'Tifblue' and much higher for 'Woodard'. Sidedressing 5-10-10 fertilizer eight weeks after planting would have prevented plant mortality. Placement of various fertilizers under 'Woodard' or 'Tifblue' plants resulted in a significant increase in plant mortality as compared to side placement of fertilizers. Yield loss due to plant mortality increased linearly with the N level of the fertilizers (ranging from 0 to 2) for both cultivars. 'Woodard' fruit size was not affected by fertilizer placement but placing fertilizers under 'Tifblue' plants produced smaller yields with larger fruit than sidedressed plants. Blueberry plants in a virgin acidic soil may experience no reduction in yield if fertilization is completely eliminated. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",fertilizer placement; NPK fertilizer formulations; plant mortality; replanting costs and gains; Vaccinium ashei,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249966186

The numbers of terrestrial species now known are algae (3), fungi (2), lichens (17), liverworts (37), mosses (21), lycopods (3), ferns (17), and flowering plants (52). Three of the latterare adventive (Poa annua, Stellaria media, Sonchus asper). The 20 species of indigenous monocotyledons comprise 7 sedges, 2rushes,4 terrestrial orchids, and7 grasses; and the 29 species of indigenous dicotyledons comprise 25 herbs, 2 semi-woody species (Acaena minor, Coprosmaperpusilla) and 2 shrubs Coprosma rugosa (erect), and C. ciliata (decumbent). The only terrestrial taxa endemic to the island are Gentiana antipoda, Senecio radiolatus subsp. antipodus, and Stellaria decipiens var. angustata. Ten species of flowering plants (including Coprosma cuneata), a fern, and 2 liverworts, have been erroneously listed from the island. Flowering times are given and pollination is discussed. The trans-oceanic colonisation of this relatively young Pleistocene volcanic island is considered in terms of wind, birds and people, and the term palynochory is proposed for dispersal by dust-diaspores. The principal sources have been the New Zealand mainland to the west, the Auckland and Campbell Islands to the south-west, and the Chatham Islands to the north.

They appear to be pollinated largely by bees in the family Halictidae (Lasioglossum spp., Nomia spp., Zonalictus) and to a lesser extent by bees in the family Anthophoridae (Amegilla). The mechanism of bee-pollination in M. inclinata is the ""Iris type""; i.e., each flower consists of three pollination units (an outer tepal, a partly exserted anther, and the opposed style branch which terminates in a pair of petal-like crests). Bees rarely visit more than one pollination unit per flower. Transferral of pollen to the bee is passive and nototribic although all bees collected on the flowers were female and 55% of the bees carried pollen loads with 2-5 pollen taxa in their scopae. Moraea brevistyla flowers are nectariferous but lack scent and last two days. They are visited infrequently by bees and only one female Lasioglossum spec. carried the pollen of M. brevistyla. Unlike flowers of M. inclinata those of M. brevistyla deposit pollen only on the head and thorax. Bee-mediated autogamy in both species is avoided due to the erratic foraging patterns of the bees and the flexibility of each stigma lobe as the bee backs out of the flower. Approximately 2-4 flowers in the inflorescences of both species (6-8 flowers/infloresence) develop into capsules. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Anthophoridae; Bees; flower morphology; Halictidae; Iridaceae; M. brevistyla; Moraea inclinata; Pollination mechanism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001142409

Pollination of the primitive species of Annona by Dynastinae would imply that the genus had not evolved before the Tertiary. The fossil record is in congruence with this hypothesis. Once again it is stressed that the cantharophilous syndrome, as it is found in the Annonaceae, Magnoliaceae, Eupomatiaceae and Calycanthaceae, with beetles being exclusive pollinators, is a secondary and derived condition and obviously different from the expected basic entomophily of the original angiosperms. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Annona; Annonaceae; Beetle pollination; flower evolution; Magnoliidae; Rollinia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000004459

The Annona spp. investigated showed different floral rhythms varying from one to three days. The elaborate and wellcoordinated flowering processes, along with floral heating and olfactorial attraction of the night-active Cyclocephala spp., result in a very precise and effective pollination. The floral chamber provides alimentation for the beetles in the form of nutritious food-tissues and pollen and offers a mating place and a well developed shelter against predation and environmental changes. A staggered flowering period and an alternative attraction of different beetle species seems to be more a device for diminishing competition between the cooccurring Annona spp. than a hybridization barrier. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms Magnoliidae; Annona; Annonaceae; Dynastid scarab beetle pollination; Flora of Brazil; flowering rhythm; thermogenic respiration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249973550

It is dependant across its range on unique pollination by sexually attracted male winged ants Myrmecia urens, which pseudocopulate with the flower. Typical pollination sequences began with an initial circling then zig-zag flight to the flower. Vectors usually alighted on the inflorescence stem and quickly crawled to the flower where they adopted a copulatory position sideways along the wide labellum, pseudocopulatory probing immediately followed. In this position pollen carried on the thorax was deposited on the stigma. Departure from the labellum usually resulted in pollinium removal. Pollinator movements were restricted and the distribution leptokurtic with a mean of 3.141 ± 4.59 m. Pollination was widespread but variable from site to site and season to season with a maximum of 70% of all flowers being pollinated. Pollinator limitation is indicated. Traits essential for this pollination interaction include the coincidence of orchid and ant geographic distributions and the coincidence of flowering with the flight period of the ant. The production of pheromonelike substances and the distinctive floral morphology are also essential for attraction and manipulation of male ants. The ant mating system which the orchid can exploit is also important. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Angiosperms; Ant pollination pseudocopulation; floral morphology; Formicidae; Leporella; Myrmecia; Orchidaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000604636

We presented equations for the expected value of the additive genetic variance within populations derived by SSD (E(VA)SSD) and PBD (E(VA)PBD) in terms of the initial population size (N0), the number of seed harvested per pod (M), the probability of survival of an individual (?), and the generation at which the population is evaluated (St). Differences between (E(VA)SSD) and (E(VA)PBD) are due to differences in the expected amount of random drift which occurs with the two methods after the S0 generation. With both methods, random drift occurs when progeny are sampled from heterozygous parents. An additional component of random drift occurs when sampled progeny fail to survive during SSD, or when sampling occurs amoung families during PBD. For values of N0, M, ?, and St that are typical of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) breeding programs, (E(VA)SSD) will be greater than (E(VA)PBD). The ratio of (E(VA)SSD) to (E(VA)PBD) will: (1) increase as M and ? increase; (2) approach a value of 1.00 as N0 increases; and (3) be a curvilinear function of St. Plant breeders should compare SSD and PBD based upon values of (E(VA)SSD) and (E(VA)PBD) and the expected cost of carrying out the two methods. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding methods; Bulk populations; Quantitative genetics; Random drift; Soybeans,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249973003

Allele frequencies were used to estimate the apportionment of gene diversity within and between populations and to construct a dendrogram based on a similarity matrix containing Nei genetic distances. - The gene diversity estimates suggest that the structure of Capsicum populations in Mexico consists of predominantly homozygous genotypes presumably due to a self-pollinated breeding system and population bottlenecks. Significant genetic differentiation was found mainly between populations of differing geographical regions.-Based on the results of this study, three species of domesticated Capsicum can be identified in Mexico, C. annuum var. annuum, C. chinense, and C. pubescens.

A sharp geographical division results between the latter species;C. frutescens was collected exclusively in the southeastern states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Tabasco; whereas wild and semidomesticated forms from the rest of the country are C. annuum. Based upon the similarity of enzyme genotypes of semidomesticated and wild forms, the primary center of domestication of cultivated C. annuum was estimated to be the region comprising the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, and Hidalgo in eastern Mexico.

The determinants, their location in the cell, and the mechanism of their expression are unknown. The defect is the result of a cross in which mixing of two different cytoplasms occurs, without the usual predominantly maternal inheritance. F1 progeny of reciprocal crosses show a quantitative difference in the frequency and degree of expression of the fal character. When the F1 progeny are backcrossed to the parents, the percentage of fal is high in crosses to O. suaveolens and low in those to O. lamarckiana. This manner of transmission is observed regardless of whether the hybrid is used as seed or pollen parent or shows a normal or fal phenotype. F2 generations from F1 plants having either a normal or a fal phenotype always include a certain percentage of fal plants, although the latter generally produce a higher percentage of fal progeny. If a second backcross is carried out, plants that produce normal progeny on self-pollination behave differently from those that produce some fal off-spring when selfed. The latter are similar to the F1 with regard to the transmission of the fal trait. Plants of the F1B1 yielding normal progeny upon selfing produce normal progeny in the F1B2 if the parent to which they are backcrossed is the same as in the first backcross; if the parents of the first and second backcross differ, a high percentage of fal offspring is obtained. Again, whether the hybrid is used as seed or pollen parent is not relevant. Exceptions to this behaviour have been observed only rarely in that the character of the penultimate cross is retained. There is some evidence of somatic segregation of the fal determinants, since sister plants may react differently; this suggestion is supported by comparing the progenies of different branches of a self-pollinated fal plant of the F1 generation. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Non-Mendelian inheritance; Oenothera,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345691144

In the ovule of Vardekloeftia the nucellus is surrounded by two distinct layers (integument and cupule). Comparisons indicate that this kind of ovule structure also occurs in other Bennettitales and may be general within the group. The probable leaves of the Vardekloeftia plant are Pterophyllum kochii Harris. The pollen organs are unknown, but Bennettistemon amblum Harris and Bennettistemon ovatum Harris are associated with Vardekloeftia and clumps of pollen very similar to that of these species occur in the micropyles of Vardekloeftia seeds.

The objective was to elucidate interspecific patterns in the ""quantity"" component of the plant-pollinator interaction. A total of 54 insect taxa are considered in the analyses, including hynenopterans, dipterans and lepidopterans. Most pollinators were comparatively scarce, with a few taxa acounting collectively for the majority of individuals. Pollinators differed broadly in flower visitation rate (0.2-30 flowers/min). Most of this variation was explained by differences in flower handling time (HT). Regardless of proboscis length, hymenopterans had intrinsically shorter handling times than lepidopterans. Within each group, HT decreased exponentially with increasing proboscis length. Abundance and visitation rate were uncorrelated across pollinator taxa. The total number of visits that each pollinator contributed to the plant (NFV) was estimated as the product of abundance x visitation rate. NFV values spanned four orders of magnirade. A small, taxonomically diverse group of species (1 moth, 1 butterfly, 4 bees) accounted for most visits and thus could effectively exert some selection on floral features. Nevertheless, the morphological diversity represented in this group of dominant pollinators probably constrains plant specialization, as they will most likely select for different floral features or in opposing directions on the same traits. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Foraging behavior; Lavandula latifolia; Mutualism; Pollinator abundance; Specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024919693

Data on the following characters were recorded on these plants and on two male fertile plants: chromosome number, presence of pollen at tripping, percentage of irregularly shaped anthers, percentage of anthers with acetocarmine stainable pollen inside, maximum range of percentage of pollen fertility among anthers within a flower presenting pollen, and percentage of pod setting with selfing. All male steriles showed a somatic chromosome number typical of the species. All were indehiscent and complete control of pollination occurred in all but one. They differed in percentage of irregular anthers, percentage of anthers with stainable pollen inside, and range of percentage of pollen fertility among anthers within a flower. Indehiscence in flowers having some pollen inside the anthers was probably due to lack of internal pressure.

The correlation between the mean number of pollinator visits per flower and size was positive but not significant.

The chemical, azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (A3C), was applied at three treatment levels of 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 kg/ha for the mature pollen investigations. It was found that the major effect of A3C on mature pollen is an alteration of the wall precursor vesicles (wp-vesicles), which form a high proportion of the contents of the mature grass pollen grain. The degree of deformation of the wp-vesicles is dose dependent. There is some evidence that increased aggregations of ribosomes are formed in treated pollen cytoplasm. Pollination studies (all at a treatment level of 1.0 kg/ha) show that, in most cases, the treated pollen does not germinate, and a high percentage of the pollen grains burst (60% burst grains in treated material compared to 28% in controls). In about 20% of the cases from treated plants, a short pollen tube forms, but no tubes were seen to grow far enough to enter the stigma hairs of the pistil. Thus, A3C does not act by preventing pollen formation, but by the prevention of normal pollen tube growth. There appears to be a specific targeting of the wp-vesicles such that, even in cases where the ultra-structure of the vesicles is not altered, the normal course of events leading to the incorporation of their contents into the extending tube wall is arrested. Further studies must be undertaken to determine the significance of the effect of CHATM Chemical Hybridizing Agent on wp-vesicle composition. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Azetidine-3-carboxylic acid; Male sterility; Plant breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2142682522

An open-pollinated variety, Armel's Reid Yellow Dent, was divided into subpopulations of 6,10 and 50 plants. Selection proportions of 17% and 5% were imposed upon each subpopulation. Selection was based on the percentage of oil in individual kernels as determined by wide-line nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As expected, total response to selection increased with larger population sizes and selection intensities. The concave shape of the response curves suggested that an appreciable part of the genetic variance can be attributed to additive genes at high initial frequencies, dominance genes at low initial frequencies, or to the generation of negative linkage disequilibrium due to selection. The consistently greater loss of vigor experienced by the more intensely selected populations reflects the enhancement of inbreeding due to artificial selection, an effect that increases with the intensity of selection. The results indicate that combined selection, based on kernels and using within- and amongfamily information, will be more efficient than other conventional selection procedures, including the normal combined scheme where selection is based on plants. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Inbreeding; Intensity of selection; Linkage disequilibrium; Population size; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038176127

Bees land, move about the inflorescences in search of nectar, and come to a last-faced position from which takeoff occurs. Last-faced directions are generated by a forward-moving tendency while probing artificial inflorescences or real florets. This tendency is modulated by restricted bee locomotion, caused by the size and shape of the visited inflorescence and the spatial distribution of florets within such inflorescences. The result is that bees tend to circle inflorescences. The process is terminated with an undefined stopping rule, whereupon bees usually depart in the direction they last face. The last-faced direction is a by-product of intrafloral search and becomes less associated with arrival directions as intrafloral search continues. Pollinator flight directionality is usually represented as a frequency distribution of angular changes in direction which typically has a mean near 0° and a variance that increases with increases in energy gain. We show that these characteristics are artifacts of pooling mirror-image movement data sets;a mean of 0° is the result of canceling the means of the left- and right-hand turns. The putative increased variance associated with energy gain is the result of adding the variances associated with left- and right-handed turns. These computational artifacts may be avoided by changing the sign of the left-handed turns prior to pooling with the right-handed turns (or vice versa). Pooling bee visits based only on the number of florets probed can destroy information relevant to studies examining behavioral mechanisms of flight directionality. Analytical problems encountered when turns exceed 360° are also addressed. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Apis Mellifera; artificial flower; Bombus Pennsylvanicus; directionality; flight; foraging; pollination; red clover; search,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0006442650

There was no change in style length with time after anthesis, but both stigma secretion and ability to support pollen germination and tube growth increased to reach a peak at 7 d. Pollen germinated on the stigma surface and in the stylar canal, but most tube growth occurred intercellularly in the transmitting tissue surrounding the canal. At the base of the style the pollen tubes split into five groups following the transmitting tissue strands to the ovary. Each group grew through a septum dividing two locules and entered the placenta. The tubes then emerged from the placenta to penetrate the ovules at between 10 and 20 d after pollination.

Fresh achenes also germinated more slowly and had a lower maximum level of germination. Achenes that were buried in the soil showed a decrease in viability over time. At depths of 2 cm achenes either germinated or were destroyed. At greater depths the achenes showed an exponential decay rate in viability with time.

Attempts to overcome interspecific incompatibility are analysed by pollen germination and pollen tube behaviour in situ, both for compatible and incompatible crosses. We have demonstrated that following the mixed pollination, the two pollen sets interact at different levels of the progamic phase. A hypothetical model is proposed which describes mentor effect as the result of interactions of antagonist and cynergic forces applying on compatible pollen and tubes.

The first series, called the foreign selection series, consisted of four trials comprising open-pollinated families from single clones from a Florida seed orchard and from selected trees in Queensland, Australia. Two trials were established in the eastern Transvaal, at Tweefontein and Frankfort State Forests (SF), and two in Zululand, at Dukuduku and KwaMbonambi SF. The second series, called the Zululand selection series, consisted of open-pollinated families from single trees selected in Zululand that were compared in three trials: in the eastern Transvaal at Wilgeboom SF, in Zululand at Dukuduku SF and in the southern Cape at Lottering SF. The third series, called the South African selection series, consisted of open-pollinated families from single trees selected in the different forest areas of South Africa and compared in four trials: two trials in the eastern Transvaal at Tweefontein and Mariti SF and two in the Natal province at Dukuduku and Weza SF. Some positive and linear relationships between absolute sizes of the variance component for family and trial average for all traits studied, except stem form, were discernible for the foreign selections and for the Zululand selections. The South African selections presented a more erratic pattern of variation. However, when the origin of the genetic material was disregarded, the positive trends were undeniable. Curvilinear relationships between relative values and site averages were discernible, when the origin of the genetic material was disregarded.

The honeybee's response to volatiles from leaves and inflorescences of two M. syriaca chemotypes, which differ in the thymol carvacrol ratio of their volatiles, was tested using a bioessay method based on associative conditioning and recruitement techniques. Behavioural data show that a honeybee identifies and reacts selectively to olfactory signals from leaves and from inflorescences of the two chemotypes. Such data suggest that the volatiles from all parts of the aromatic plant M. syriaca may have a role in attracting pollinators. The vegetative parts produce a volatile emission which attracts the pollinators from a distance towards the whole plant. At close range these are directed by the flower signal which is amplified by the volatiles of bracts and leaves in the inflorescence. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Honey bee; Majorana syriaca; Olfactory associative conditioning; Pollination; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024919692

The addition of 60 ?M dicamba (3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid) to the kernel culture medium resulted in an induction frequency of 27-38% compared to 0% for controls on standard kernel culture medium. Embryos excised from dicamba-treated kernels also showed in-ovule callus-like tissue proliferation. The increased induction frequency and the callus-like tissue proliferation could also be produced by injecting the ears of field grown FR27rhm plants, 3-d post pollination, with 1.08 ?moles of dicamba.

We performed hand pollinations using pollen from near neighbors and from plants separated by 5, 15, and 60 meters. Pollination by near neighbors reduced fruit set and the numbers of seeds per fruit in comparison to other treatments in two of the three populations; variation in pollination distance beyond near-neighbor pollination produced no effect. In the third population, in which nearneighbor pollination did not affect seed production, nearneighbor pollination reduced seed weight by 11%, compared to other pollination distances. Seed weights from the 5-, 15-, and 60-m pollination treatments did not differ, and pollination distance did not affect seed weight in the other two populations. The effects of pollination-distance treatments explained a very small proportion of the variance in seed production and seed weight. Heterogeneity among individual plants, despite full hand pollination of every plant, accounted for much more variance (by one to two orders of magnitude) than variation in pollination distance. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding system; Fecundity; Outcrossing distance; Pollination ecology; Population structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024895124

The pollinia are patially separated from the viscidium by a stipe so that pollinia can be labelled with coloured histochemical stains without interfering with pollinarium removal. Pollen flow was monitored by following the movement of the coloured pollen in several populations of P. fimbria in Western Australia. Statistical analysis confirmed that pollen labelling did not interfere with pollinarium removal or subsequent pollination of the labelled flower. Fifty eight labelled pollinaria were removed by vectors from 16 test spikes, with a total of 125 flowers on 47 spikes receiving labelled pollen. An average of 2 flowers received pollen for every pollinium removed but up to 6 flowers received pollen from a single collinium. No significant differences between mean vector flights and pollen flow distances were detected. On average, geitonogamous transfers only accounted for 22% of all pollinations.

Individual plants showing contrasting zymogram patterns were simultaneously selfed and cross-combined. Crossing was unsuccessful in producing progeny, and only selfed progenies were suitable for genetical analysis of isozyme variability. Three zones of GOT activity were made visible. The isozyme of GOT-2 and GOT-3 zones were dimeric and under the control of three alleles at the Got-2 locus and two alleles at the Got-3 locus, respectively. The isozymes of the GOT-1 zone did not show any variability. Three zones of SOD isozyme activity were made visible. The isozymes occurring in the SOD-1 (chloroplastic isozyme form) and SOD-2 (cytosol isozyme form) zones were dimeric and under the control of two alleles at the Sod-1 and Sod-2 loci. The isozyme visualized in the SOD-3 zone (mitochondrial isozyme form) were tetrameric and under the control of two alleles at the Sod-3 locus. Apparently the isozymes made visible in the most anodal esterase zones EST-1, EST-2, and EST-3 were monomeric, and the occurrence of two alleles at each of two different loci explained the variability observed in the EST-2 and EST-3 zones. For MDH, only two five-banded zymogram pattern types were found, and every selfed progeny showed only one of the two zymogram type, indicating that each individual possessed fixed alleles at the loci controlling MDH isozyme.

Many of the mutant plants produced in culture were unusually pale with abnormal leaves, rosettes, and patterns of reproductive development. Other plants were phenotypically normal except for the presence of siliques containing 100% aborted seeds following self-pollination.

Most of the 15 genes examined in this study were essential for embryogenesis but were required again for subsequent stages of development. Only EMB24 appeared to be limited in function to embryo development.

The interrelationships between the timing and number of flowers produced, sex expression, seed set, and seed parasitism were studied for their direct and indirect effects on the numbers and masses of viable seeds produced by individual plants. In a sample population of 369 plants that produced 161 386 flowers, 76% of the plants produced some hermaphroditic flowers. The percentage of hermaphroditic flowers increased significantly with the total number of flowers produced by a plant. Seed set was 65-90% in plants producing >600 flowers, but was highly variable in plants producing fewer flowers. Hand-pollinated plants showed the same pattern of seed set, suggesting that variable seed set in small plants may result from insufficient resources for seed development. The majority of schizocarps was produced by only 12% of the plants. Parasites killed 24.5% of the seeds prior to dispersal. Another 14.5% of the seeds lacked endosperm. Hence, the initial 161 386 flowers, which included 25874 hermaphroditic flowers each capable of producing two seeds, produced 42 468 seeds of which an estimated 25906 entered the seed bank as undamaged seeds with fully developed endosperm. Path analysis indicated that the number of hermaphroditic flowers on a plant and the percentage of seeds attacked by seed parasites had the greatest direct effects on the number of viable seeds entering the seed bank. The date at which a plant began flowering and the percentage of flowers setting seed had smaller or only indirect effects on viable seed production. Mean seed mass for plants was not significantly related to any of the factors that affected seed number, but little of the variance in seed mass occurred among plants. Masses of intact seeds in the population ranged 9-fold in both 1987 and 1988. Thirty-five percent of the variance was among seeds within umbels, 46% was among umbels within plants, and only 19% was among plants. The large variation among umbels within plants resulted from a seasonal pattern in which seeds from umbels produced late in the spring had lower mean seed masses than seeds from umbels produced early in the spring. Overall, the results indicate that both direct and indirect interactions between number of flowers, the date of initiation of flowering, seed set, and seed parasitism affect the number of viable seeds entering the seed bank. These interactions strongly bias viable seed output to a small minority of plants that produce many seeds with a wide range of masses over the growing season. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Andromonoecy; Lomatium salmoniflorum; Seed parasitism; Smicronyx; Umbelliferae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024897702

A remarkable increase in the width of the pollen tube was induced by treating the stigmatic papillae with high CO2 concentrations. The width of the pollen tube appeared to be greatest with CO2 concentrations ranging from 3% to 5%; these concentrations were also optimal for tube penetration. Callose accumulation was extensively induced in the stigmatic papilla with 10%-20% of CO2, although a typical callosic reaction remained through the ranges appropriate for blocking self-incompatibility. Observations using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) after pollination revealed that compatible pollen tubes in cross-pollinations fused completely to the papular surface during tube penetration, while in self-pollination, pollen tubes remained on the papilla with some additional diffusate. In the case of CO2 treatment for self-pollination, some pollen tubes behaved very similarly to the incompatible or compatible ones already described, while others were different from both of them: they showed a complete fusion, similar to compatible ones, with additional diffusate, similar to incompatible ones. These responses of the pollen and stigma to high CO2 concentrations are discussed with respect to their effect upon the expression of self-incompatibility. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Brassica; CO2 treatment; Diplotaxis; Pollen tube growth; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249976563

Our objective was to demonstrate a method of separating reproductive barriers and other factors affecting SI expression. The analysis consists of four parts: (1) calculating male (MCC) and female (FCC) coefficients of crossability using seed set from a diallel crossing design; (2) determining significant male and female differences using a 1:1 paired Chi-square test; (3) constructing scatter diagrams of FCC versus MCC; (4) performing linear regression analysis between FCC and MCC. Diallel data from eight genera with various reproductive barriers were used to illustrate and validate the usefulness of this method. SI can be distinguished from other reproductive barriers (incongruity, inbreeding depression, post-fertilization phenomena) using 1:1 Chisquare and regression analysis. In addition, the incorporation of ovule counts is crucial for demarcating the SI phenomenon in species where ovule numbers vary between self- and outcross pollinations. Male and female steriles can be identified with the MCC/FCC equations and subsequently removed from further analysis. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Inbreeding depression; Incongruity; Post-fertilization phenomena; Self compatibility; Self incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0004189868

D.A. Webb) is self-incompatible (SI) and requires honey-bees to effect the transfer of pollen among cultivars that flower simultaneously. Four year old trees from the F2 generation of several peach x almond hybrids were studied to determine whether self-compatibility (SC) and the potentiality for natural, i.e., abiotic, self pollination (NSP) are genetically related or are inherited independently. Both SC and the high potentiality for NSP are characteristic of peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) but not almond. Forty percent of SC genotypes exhibited adequate NSP (SC, +NSP) for good fertility i.e., without insect-mediated pollination. The remaining 60% of SC genotypes (SC,-NSP) exhibited an average 61% reduction in fruit set on limbs bagged to exclude honeybees during anthesis relative to fruit set on open pollinated limbs. Our data are consistent with the concept that fertility is dependent upon the load of compatible pollen deposited on the stigma. Fruit set reduction on bagged limbs, compared with bagged and self-pollinated limbs, was presumably due to a) lack of/insufficient pollination for fertilization and/or b) post-zygotic abortion of genetically inferior recombinants. Selection following manual self-pollination may result in SC genotypes with or without the capacity for NSP. In contrast, significant fruit set on limbs enclosed during pistil receptivity necessitates that the genotype selected express both SC and the potentiality for NSP. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",almond; fruit set; peach; pollination; Prunus dulcis; Prunus persica; self-fertility; self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942713881

A large range of insects and birds visited feijoa flowers to collect pollen or feed on the sugary petals. Estimation of pollen deposited on stigmas showed that only large birds deposited sufficient compatible pollen to initiate fruit development. An exclusion experiment confirmed this. Observations of the behaviour and size of the floral visitors explained why insects and smaller birds are ineffective pollen vectors. In orchards with high densities of large birds, flowers were visited at earlier stages but, even at lower densities, visits were sufficient to ensure pollination. In orchards that lacked birds, fruit set was minimal. Bird visitation was greater at the edges of blocks and, in large blocks, fruit set was significantly lower in the centre of the block. Studies of animal movements indicated that large birds such as blackbirds (Turdus merula) and mynas (Acridotheres tristis) were the most efficient cross pollinators. Specific recommendations to growers are that large birds should be encouraged, honey bees should not be put in feijoa blocks, varieties should be interplanted within the row and blocks should be small (<0.5ha). © 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Birds; Blackbirds; Feijoa sellowiana; Honeybees; Insects; Mynas; Pollen vectors; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024898782

The domestication and commercialization of this diploid (2n = 30), protogynous, cross-pollinated, annual, aquatic cereal present an opportunity to examine crop evolution and domestication theory. Traits associated with the domesticated cereal grains are shattering resistance, tiller synchrony, and increased seed size. This syndrome of traits may result from automatic selection, the selective force applied by repeated cycles of planting of harvested seed. Positive responses from deliberate selection for these traits in wildrice populations indicate that a domestication ideotype is attainable through plant breeding and that founder effect in this diploid species may be negligible.

The target tissue for the transformation is the cut end of cotyledonary petioles. These tissues, when cultured with their lamina intact, show a regeneration frequency of more than 80%. The cells of this cut surface, which undergo organogenesis, are very susceptible to topical infection by Agrobacterium. The cocultivation method used does not require feeder layers or use of exogenously applied promoters of virulence. After 72h of infection with Agrobacterium the explants were transferred to selective regeneration medium. Using kanamycin (15?g cm-3) for selection, transgenic plantlets emerged within 3 weeks. These plantlets which appeared on over half the explants were excised and rooted for a further 7-10 days. When the plants were large enough, leaves were taken for assay of NPT II activity using dot blots. Most of the plants surviving the selection showed substantial NPT II activity. The frequency of transformation and yield of transgenic plants was higher than in previously reported methods with this species. Southern blotting revealed that integration of the T-DNA frequently occurred in multiple copies and at multiple loci in the genome. The transgenic B. napus plants all grew normally and developed fertile flowers. The transgenic plants were self-pollinated and their progeny studied by two methods. The first was a single-embryo NPT II assay performed on developing seeds of these selfed-plants. The second was a leaf bleaching assay performed by selection of germinating seedlings of the selfed progeny. Both assays yielded segregation ratios consistent with the number of integration events indicated by Southern blots. The method should have broad application in studies of gene expression in the Brassicaceae and will be a cost-effective alternative to those seeking to improve Brassica crops by introduction of foreign genes. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0003050586

Thus, hybrids could still be the more profitable type of variety provided seed rates are low and yield levels high.

Short-tongued species were most dominant in large patches, while small patches were frequented by middle- and long-tongued bumblebees. This phenomenon was extremely obvious in Symphytum officinale and Aconitum napellus, where short-tongued species had bitten a hole in nearly every flower of large patches. Long-tongued species were forced to small patches, where nectarrobbing occurred only exceptionally. In small patches visitationrate (Number of visits per flower per hour) was not lower but either equal or even higher then in large patches. Nectar measurements in Echium vulgare showed, that not only the mean quantity of nectar but also the variance was lower in small patches. As a result, the possible gain can be predicted much more precisely in a small patch than in a large one, and bumblebees have less difficulties in making the right foraging decisions. According to this, foraging strategies depend on patch size. This was confirmed by a computer simulation. The conclusion can be drawn, that many bumblebee species are able to share the same resource by using different patch sizes. Since large flower patches occur mainly in man-made habitats, the dominance of short-tongued species in many bumblebee communities studied by other authors may be unnatural. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Bumblebees; Community structure; Foraging strategies; Patch size; Resource partitioning,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024907686

Following pollination, these acids are synthesized in the stylar tissue via the acetate pathway within the first 12 hours. The fatty acids are transported rapidly to the corolla where they induce an increase in ethylene sensitivity. In unpollinated flowers, these acids are produced in the corolla during the early stages of senescence. Although the levels of these fatty acids decrease rapidly during the final stages of senescence, a significant increase in ethylene sensitivity could be detected prior to the decrease.

Two symmetrical synergids occupy the micropylar portion and show evidence of a high degree of differentiation: large numbers of dictyosomes and remarkably, high level of RER, which appears swollen and fragmented, characterize the cytoplasm of the synergids and distinguish them from the egg and the central cell. All other cytoplasmic organelles are embedded in these assemblies of ER and dictyosomes. After pollination, one of the two synergids degenerates before the arrival of the pollen tube at the embryo sac. The first sign of the degeneration is the darkening and loss of definition of the membrane systems of one of the synergids. Staining by the silver methenamine reaction reveals many electron-translucent, poorly defined structures. The membranous aspects of these structures can subsequently be visualized by UA-Pb staining. The denaturation progresses and the pollen tube always enters the degenerating rather than the intact synergid. These data imply that the preliminary denaturation of one synergid is required before the arrival of the pollen tube and that highly differentiated ultrastructure, with abundant RER and dictyosomes, is somehow related to the synthesis or the secretion of some protein or other product(s) that subsequently prompts the entrance and discharge of the pollen tube. © 1988 The Botanical Society of Japan.",Crepis capillaris; Embryogenesis; Pollination; Silver-methenamine reaction; Synergid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249173816

Flowers aligned parallel to the sun's rays reach mean internal temperatures several degrees Celsius above ambient air temperature. As a flower's angle of deviation from the sun increases beyond 45 degrees, internal flower temperature is significantly reduced. Fly pollinators are seen disproportionately often on flowers aligned with the sun; this is due, in part, to their greater residence time on tracking flowers. Fly visitation is important to fecundity. When flies were excluded from flowers, some selfed seeds were matured, but total seed production was much less than in either handoutcrossed or open-pollinated flowers. Flowers that were tethered at random angles to prevent solar tracking set fewer, smaller seeds than unmanipulated control flowers. Reductions in seed weight were statistically consistent at different times in the season, but tethering influenced seed number per flower most strongly in the early season. Effects of tethering on maternal reproduction could be due to either pollinator diserimination, post-pollination developmental processes, or both. In a second series of experiments using fluorescent dye particles as pollen analogs, tethered donor flowers dispersed dye to as many recipients as paired control flowers, suggesting that solar tracking fidelity may have little effect upon this component of male reproduction. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Alpine ecology; Heliotropism; Plant reproductive biology; Pollination; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024902863

The present study examines the extent to which a small group of six species are selective in their diets and investigates the role of flower colour as a means by which such selectivity may occur. Flower feeding preferences were determined by pollen analyses of gut contents and an extensive flower sampling programme was under-taken to provide information on the relative abundances of the food resources available to the insects. Flower colours were defined by their reflectance spectra, and the inherent colour preferences of the flies were determined by field experiments in which natural flowers were simulated using painted plastic discs. The results reveal that some hoverfly species are highly selective in their pollen diets, while others have a more generalist approach to their foraging. The division of flower resources by the more selective species is shown to be dependent, at least partially, on the colours of the flowers. The findings are discussed in relation to the theories of Competition and Optimal Foraging and the 'mechanistic approach' to ecology. The use of learning models is suggested as an alternative means of investigating patterns of resource use in future research. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Flower colour; Mechanistic approach; Pollen; Resource partitioning; Syrphidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024873148

Three measures of seed formation were used: (1) achene number; (2) proportion of filled achenes (fruits) that distinguishes between achenes with seeds and empty achenes; (3) proportion of aborted seeds that distinguishes between viable and aborted seeds. Self-pollinations resulted in empty achenes. Achene number did not vary between the different pollen donors. A bimodal pattern of filled achenes was found in two populations in two consecutive years. On the other hand, a unimodal pattern was found in crosses between more distant donors (> 30m). These patterns seems to be the results of a sporophytic incompatibility system.

For such taxa this implies that selection for aspects of floral display (inflorescence size, pollination type) may also be expressed at the level of leaf size and vice versa.

The Chloranthaceae had probably differentiated into insect-pollinated (Chloranthus and Sarcandra) and wind-pollinated (Ascarina and Hedyosmum) forms by the end of the Albian, and leaves referable to the Trochodendrales are known from the Albian and Cenomanian. In the latest Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, extinct representatives of the Trochodendrales included Nordenskioldia and the Joffrea-Nyssidium complex. The Platanaceae also differentiated before the end of the Albian and initially had insect-pollinated, unisexual flowers with five carpels or stamens. Some of these features persisted in the platanoid lineage until the Early Tertiary, and during the Paleocene and Eocene the Platanaceae included forms with elliptical, palmate and pinnate foliage. The history of the Platanaceae suggests that several features of the reproductive morphology of extant taxa may have arisen in association with a trend toward wind pollination. In the Mid Cretaceous, platanoid foliage partially intergrades with pinnate Sapindopsis and pedate Debeya-Dewalquea leaves suggesting a close relationship between Platanaceae and Rosidae and Fagaceae respectively.

Once in contact with the stigma a bond is formed between the pollen grain and stigma surface coatings. At the site of pollen tube emergence, the pollen grain wall is eroded and the tube wall initiated. The pollen tube penetrates the stigma surface between the receptive cells and a collar of stigma wall material surrounds the tube at this point. Deposition of callose is induced in the stigma cells and stylar transmitting tissue cells adjacent to the pollen tube. A callose plug blocks the tube where it enters the stigma.

Premature desiccation of the seed at 35 DAP also leads to a major decline in ABA within the embryo and endosperm. Partial water loss from the seed at 35 DAP which, like natural and premature desiccation, leads to subsequent germination upon return of the seed to full hydration, causes a much smaller decline in ABA levels. In contrast, ABA declines substantially in the non-dried (hydrated) control at 35 DAP, but the seeds do not germinate. Hence, a clear negative correlation between ABA content and germinability is not observed. Both drying, whether natural or imposed prematurely, and partial drying decrease the sensitivity of the isolated embryo to exogenous ABA by about 10-fold.The protein synthetic response of the castor bean embryo exposed to 0.1 mol m-3 ABA following premature desiccation exhibits some similarity to the response of the non-dried developing embryo-in both cases the synthesis of some developmental proteins is enhanced by ABA, and germination is suppressed. Germination of mature seeds is also suppressed by 0.1 mol m-3 ABA, but the same developmental proteins are not synthesized. In the cotyledons of prematurely-desiccated seed, some proteins are hydrolysed upon imbibition in 0.1 mol m-3 ABA, a phenomenon that occurs also in the cotyledons of similarly treated mature embryos, but not in developing non-dried embryos. Hence the embryo exhibits an 'intermediate' response upon rehydration in 0.1 mol m-3 ABA following premature desiccation; viz. some of the responses are developmental and some germinative. Following natural or imposed drying, the isolated embryo becomes relatively insensitive to 0.01 mol m-3 ABA: Germination is elicited and post-germinative reserve breakdown occurs in the radicle and cotyledons. The reduced sensitivity of the embryo to ABA as a consequence of desiccation may be an important factor in eliciting the switch to germination and growth within the whole seed. © 1989 Oxford University Press.",Abscisic acid; Astor bean endosperm; Desiccation; Germination; Hormone sensitivity; Isolated embryos; Protein synthesis; Seed development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002640766

At anthesis, this spot is yellow; 14 days later it changes to purple. After the change, purple flowers remain on plants an additional 5-7 days before corolla abscission; purple flowers were avoided by pollinators, presumably because they contained less pollen (rewards) than yellow ones. Pollinators preferentially approached and foraged on plants with greater numbers of flowers per inflorescence; they did not discriminate between yellow (rewarding) and purple (nonrewarding) flowers at interplant distances >0.4 m but would preferentially forage on plants with more total flowers, even if these individuals contained fewer rewarding flowers. Thus, spent flowers increased the overall attractiveness of plants to pollinators. By directing pollinators to rewarding flowers, the change may increase pollinator foraging efficiency; pollinators visit more flowers before leaving plants (pollinator-tenure mechanism). By directing pollinators to receptive flowers, the color change may prevent incoming pollen from being wasted on unreceptive stigmas and may prevent collection of inviable pollen (pollination-efficiency mechanism). The pollinator-tenure mechanism was tested by removing pollen from yellow flowers, thereby reducing the reliability of the color-reward signal.

Trollius europaeus (Ranunculaceae), however, is pollinated by four Chiastocheta species (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) that mate in the flowers, eat pollen and nectar, and complete larval development in the seeds. Strict resource partitioning is present between the fly species, in that different parts of the infructescence are used by larvae of each species, and fly species oviposit at different times in the life of a flower. The flies were shown to be the exclusive pollinators. Because the numbers of ovules fertilized per visit was a fixed proportion of remaining non-fertilized ovules, fly species differed in mean pollinator efficacy, with the last species contributing the fewest pollinations. Therefore, with larval consumption of seeds being fixed and seed initiation decreasing per visit, larvae from later ovipositions consumed more seeds than their mothers pollinated. The point at which costs and benefits were equal was found to be around 4-5 eggs; observed population means of eggs per flower varied between 2.3-7.25 during three years of study. The system is rather insensitive to variation in pollinator density, remaining mutualistic over a wide range.

Strain crossing (uncontrolled hybridization between two or more self?fertile populations with seed of the populations combined to product a strain cross population) represents a potentially valuable alternative procedure for exploiting heterosis in this species. Strain crosses in lucerne are typically produced using insect pollination in the field. Using hand pollination under glasshouse houses could increase the number of strain crosses available for tests of combining ability. The objective of this study was to determine whether forage yield of strain crosses produced using hand pollination were sufficiently similar to that of insect?produced populations to allow the use of the former in lucerne breeding. Forage yields of eight pairs of hand? and insect?produced strain crosses did not differ significantly in 15 of 16 pairwise comparisons and were positively correlated (rs= 0.90) for 20 harvests at two locations. Yield amp of band produced strain crosses could be used, with reasonable accuracy to accuracy the eventual performance of strain crosses produced between the same populations using insect pollination.

Pollen production is positively related to corolla and style length, whereas pollen removal per visit by bumble bee pollinators is a positive function of corolla flare. Larger-flowered plants receive more bumble bee visits than small-flowered ones. Individual queen bumble bees of the principal pollinator species, Bombus kirbyellus, were similar in male, female, and absolute measures of pollination effectiveness. An estimated 2.9% of the pollen that bumble bees removed from flowers during a foraging bout was, on average, deposited on stigmas of compatible recipients.

Sporophylls of male cones are rich in starch; those of female cones are poor in starch, and weevils feed upon male cones and are visitors to but not feeders upon or within female cones.

The total number of honeyeaters was significantly correlated to the number of inflorescences ofB. menziesii. New Holland Honeyeaters. Brown Honeyeaters and Western Spinebills were present throughout the year, whereas the larger honeyeaters (Red and Little Wattlebirds) were observed when B. menziesii was flowering. The foraging behaviours of the Little Wattlebirds, New Holland Honeyeaters, Brown Honeyeaters and Western Spinebills were similar and all were likely to effect pollination of B. menziesii florets. Differences in their foraging position at an inflorescence, number and direction of foraging probes, and the time spent at an inflorescence were minimal. Western Spinebills used inflorescences lower in the tree crown than the other species. Movements to inflorescences on different plants were inversely related to honeyeater size. Smaller honeyeaters were frequently chased from inflorescences by the larger species, increasing the proportion of distant foraging movements made by the smaller species. Also these interrupted visits were of shorter duration than uninterrupted visits. Visitation by smaller species, especially the Brown Honeyeater, may result in more cross pollinations although the effect on the reproductive success of B, menziesii is unknown.

Factors determining which sex offers more reward include the limitations on reproductive success, risks of flower damage, and phylogenetic and structural constraints. Male and female flowers of some species resemble each other in ways that suggest mimicry. Female flowers appear to mimic male flowers more often than vice versa. True intersexual floral mimicry can lead to different ecological/evolutionary consequences than deceit-pollination without specific resemblance: In mimicry systems, sexual dimorphism and intrasexual floral polymorphism are less likely and the dependence on naive pollinators is less strong. Proposed mimicry systems should be analyzed both to ascertain the response of the pollinators to the convergent traits and to determine the effects of the convergence on reproductive success. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024943912

Because the proportion deposited declined as the amount removed increased, an individual plant would maximise its total pollen dispersal by relying on many pollen-removing visits while limiting the pollen removed by each pollinator. This restriction of pollen removal could be achieved by a plant presenting only a small portion of its pollen at one time (packaging) and/or by limiting the amount of presented pollen that a pollinator removes during a single visit (dispensing). The restriction of pollen removal required to maximize the expected total deposition on stigmas depends on the number of pollinator visits a plant receives, variation in the frequency of visits, and the pattern of pollen removal during a series of visits. Many aspects of floral biology contribute to a plant's ability to restrict pollen removal, including inflorescence size, flower morphology, anthesis patterns, nectar production, and dichogamy. Selection increasing paternal fitness of animal-pollinated plants could therefore elicit one of a variety of evolutionary responses; the specific response will depend on characteristics of both the plant and the pollinator. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024897921

Since immature stigmas lack sufficient exudate for pollen germination, the sandwiching of a thin layer of pollen germination medium between the stigma and a mineral oil layer containing pollen allows precocious pollen germination and some compatible pollen tube growth through the style. This procedure is rapid, inexpensive, applicable in the field, and makes efficient use of pollen. Consistent though low seed yields have been obtained. A high proportion of aborted seed, seedling lethals, and aberrant seedling phenotypes in selfed progeny indicate the presence of strong post-zygotic barriers to such selfing.

There was no consistent trend of a maternal shift in the M2 generation that may render the technique of irradiated pollination useful by preferentially producing pure breeding maternal materials having a few specific paternal characteristics. Overall, pollination with irradiated pollen in rice produced mainly normal hybrid progeny with very little heritable variations. These lack of responses in rice may be explained by the fact that rice pollen is relatively insensitive to irradiation on the one hand, and that the pollen genome is less able to accommodate mutational damage on the other hand. Thus, the rice plant is considered less amenable to the application of irradiated pollination as a practical breeding technique. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966185870

No peroxidase activity is present in the apoplastic space of non-pollinated and cross-pollinated young styles. Self-pollination causes the appearance of peroxidase activity in the apoplastic space of the transmitting tissue region where the pollen tubes elongated, indicating that bud pistils are able to recognize «incompatible» pollen tubes and to react to their growth. A similar interaction between pollen tubes and transmitting tissue cells was observed in cross- and self-pollinated pistils regarding the utilization of cellular reserves.

Comparisons of the genetic diversity within and between the pollen pools and maternal parents of two arbitrary subpopulations indicated the presence of spatial genetic heterogeneity which was not broken down by pollen flow. It was suggested that this is the result of a high level if inbreeding and limited pollen dispersal by birds. Estimates of outcrossing rate ranged between t =0-59 and t =0-67 and were at the low end of the range reported for other eucalypts. It was concluded that E. rhodantha has a mixed mating system with a significant proportion of selfpollination. Biparental inbreeding within small neighbourhoods probably also contributed to the high level of inbreeding. The low level of outcrossing observed in E. rhodantha was not consistent with the hypothesis that bird pollination leads to high levels of outcrossing in the Australian flora. However, the level of outcrossing achieved through bird pollination together with high levels of gene flow between populations contribute to the maintenance of the relatively high levels of diversity which characterise the dissected populations of this species. © 1989, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966152604

A systematic study of the initial hybridization and subsequent backcrosses has identified multiple barriers to introgression. These barriers are expressed as pollen tube inhibition in the upper style and lower pistil, and failures in syngamy, zygote development, and sporogenesis. Upper style cross-incompatibility barriers were successfully avoided by bud pollinations using a stigma complementation procedure to allow pollen germination on otherwise unreceptive stigmas. The inhibition of pollen tube growth was observed in the lower pistil. A combination of environmental, plant, and genetic manipulations facilitated consistent pollen tube growth to the ovule micropyles in all crosses attempted. Failures at syngamy and early zygote formation proved to be the most difficult barriers to overcome  these were particularly severe in crosses to F1 hybrid plants. Progeny were obtained in all crossing combinations attempted except in the initial hybridization with S. lycopersicoides as the pistillate parent. Although the strong pre-zygotic barriers were overcome in this cross, further progress was restricted by post-zygotic failures. The capability to overcome pre-zygotic barriers and to excise and culture very young embryos has allowed plantlet recovery from male sterile F1 plants. Partially pollen-fertile F1 plants were recovered when relatively large F1 populations were generated from different S. lycopersicoides accessions. In general, barriers to introgression diminished with increased backcrossing, though exceptions were noted. Progeny from the second backcross to L. esculentum possessed adequate fertility to set self-seed under field conditions. Although all backcross progeny were developed from only a few F1 individuals, considerable genetic variability was recovered for fruit and vegetative characteristics. Potentially useful levels of disease resistance, particularly to Botrytis cinerea, were also recovered. © 1989, Springer-Verlag.

These features may promote legitimate pollination. Analysis of a natural population showed substantial pollen inviability, a preponderance of illegitimate pollen on stigmas and a possible asymmetry of pollen flow. Mean pollen travel was estimated as 2.6 m by counting legitimate grains on stigmas whose distance from the nearest source of legitimate pollen was known. Direct field and laboratory measurement indicated mean seed travel of &lt;0.2m. The density of flowering spikes varied greatly within the studied colony of Menyanthes, with a mean of 0.93 m?2. Using suitable corrections the genetically effective density was estimated as between 0.04 and 4.4 m?2. Crossing experiments indicated that Menyanthes is fully outcrossed (r=1). The neighbourhood area was estimated as 1015 m2 while neighbourhood size ranged from less than one to sixty?five. Some published neighbourhood estimates are revised with the results for Menyanthes being at the lower end of the range. If the genetically effective density were estimated more accurately, neighbourhood estimates would likely be lower still.

In this paper, we consider the suite of characters that define the seed habit, and discuss the probable selective pressures that produced each character. Our major conclusion is that most characters are a direct consequence of the origin of heterospory and of natural selection for propagules with larger food reserves. Seeds are traditionally defined by the possession of integuments. However, some heterosporous pteridophytes possess integument?like structures. Therefore, integuments cannot explain the evolutionary success of seed plants. Rather, we believe that the decisive character in this success is related to pollination. Seed plants differ from other heterosporous lineages in the capture of microspores before dispersal of the 'megaspore'. Modern gymnosperms all possess mechanisms whereby the maternal sporophyte withholds resources from potential propagules that have not been pollinated and/or fertilized. This represents an increase in efficiency over Pteridophytic reproduction. Wind?pollination means the propagule is vulnerable to pathogens that mimic pollen, and pathogen pressures may have contributed to some seed characters. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

Abundance of both hawkmoths and hawkmoth flowers peaked in the first half of the wet season (May-July). Numbers of hawkmoths decreased through the dry season (December-April) with lowest numbers during April. Species of hawkmoth flowers also decreased through the dry season, but several species began flowering before onset of the wet season and before the sudden increase in hawkmoth numbers that followed shortly after the first rains. Tube lengths of hawkmoth flowers ranged from 0-19 cm (mean 5.1 cm), matched by the range in length of hawkmoth tongues (1-20 cm, mean 4.9 cm). Hawkmoth tongue lengths were correlated with body size (wing length). Long flower tubes restricted access to nectar to long-tongued moths, but hawkmoths visited many species of flowers adapted for other pollinator types (hummingbirds, bees, and bats) along with hawkmoth flowers whose tubes were much shorter than their tongue lengths. Some flowers were always heavily visited, other species were virtually ignored. In less attractive flowers, nectar accumulated during the night and attracted a variety of diurnal visitors the following morning. Hawkmoth flowers that opened before dark attracted diurnal and crepuscular visitors (bees, wasps, hummingbirds, butterflies) that robbed nectar and pollen, possibly decreasing flower attractiveness to hawkmoths. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024934124

The bees landed on eglandular flowers apparently by mistake, as suggested by their making one to a few scraping movements on landing, and behaving in the same way as they scrape oil glands on glandular flowers. After perceiving their mistake the bees either left the flower, making one to a few additional visits to other eglandular flowers before leaving the plant, or switched to pollen collecting. Large and medium?sized species of Centris, and some Epicharis, left the flowers after mistake visits, thus wasting time and energy, whereas small Centris and larger Epicharis switched to pollen harvesting, thus turning a mistake into a rewarding visit. Eglandular flowers of both Banisteriopsis muricata and Heteropterys aceroides attracted oil?gathering bees by deceit and probably acted as mimics of glandular flowers of their own species (automimicry). The pollination of eglandular morphs of these two Malpighiaceae species seems dependent mainly on the opportunistic, mixed oil?pollen gathering behaviour of deceived bees such as Epicharis schrottkyi.

It is concluded that for mature vines, the optimum crop load is about 70 fruit m-2 (1650 fruit per vine). However, economic success may depend just as much on improvements in bud break, pollination and water management. In particular, developments in artificial methods of pollination and the use of the growth regulator, hydrogen cyanamide, are projected to potentially improve yields and profits significantly. Replacing natural by artificial shelter is also likely to be cost effective, but whether investing in irrigation is profitable depends on local circumstances.

Average leaf numbers of known males and females were not significantly different. Average leaf numbers of plants showing no evidence of coning were lower than for coning individuals, suggesting that both populations contain substantial numbers of immature plants. About half the plants in both populations were putatively mature, but only 12% of such individuals in the Dorrigo population bore current season's cones compared with 51% in the Lookout population; 28% of the Dorrigo plants and 5% of the Lookout plants showed evidence of prior coning. Thus, in each population, not all mature plants produce cones during a given reproductive episode. The proportion that does so appears to vary from year to year. Cone production by individuals of each sex appears to be separated by several?year intervals. The few plants with current season's cones in the Dorrigo population prevented determining a phenotypic sex ratio there, but for the Lookout population it was not statistically different from 1:1 male:female. The weevil Tranes lyterioides was abundant on two male cones that were entering the pollination phase in the Lookout population, suggesting that it may be involved in the pollination of this cycad.

The position of a flower within the inflorescence strongly influences its onset of anthesis, which in turn is closely correlated with these reproductive parameters. Ovule number decreases with time, although in some species it increases again at the end of the flowering season. Number of seeds decreases more or less linearly with time, although there is an unexpectedly high number of the earliest berries of the triploid species, which is probably the result of interspecific pollination.

The observed response was studied using four methods of selection based on single and multitrait criteria in three types of families, namely S1, half?sib (HS) and full?sib (FS) families. One hundred SI, HS and FS families each were developed in PSB 7 and PSB 3. Plants within a population were pollinated with bulk pollen of other population to develop HS families. Crosses were made between a pair of plants using one plant from each of the two populations to develop PS families. Data were recorded on days to flower, plant height, tiller number, spike length, spike girth, seed yield per plant and spike weight. Additive genetic variance estimates were significant for all traits. The estimates of dominance and additive × location and dominance × location interaction components were not significant, except additive × location component in PSB 7 for seed yield and spike weight. The genotypic component of variance among S1 families and S1 × location interactions were significant except S1 × location interactions in PSB 7 for days to flower, spike length and spike girth. Twenty?four strains were developed by intermating superior families identified on the basis of four selection methods in each of the six types of families. The selection methods were high seed yield (YS) per se; index selection (IS) for high tiller number and long and thick spike; truncation selection (TS) for high yield among the families having days to flower and plant height lower than the population mean: and visual selection (VS) after completion of flowering for good vigour, uniformity in plant height and good inflorescence attributes. YS and IS were found to be superior to TS and VS with respect to observed genetic gains for seed yield. That advance was higher in selection among SI families as compared with FS and HS families. In general, a good agreement was noted between observed and expected responses. Expected genetic gain from FS reciprocal (R) recurrent selection was higher than the average gain from HS?R selection.

Compared to the main body of the nucellus the columnar cells in the micropylar part appear more meristematic and display a number of structural characteristics indicative of high metabolic activity, e.g. abundant mitochondria, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, numerous dictyosomes and coated vesicles often fusing with irregular and strongly PAS+ cell walls. This tissue undergoes a gradual degeneration after having reached the mature stage and this degeneration seems to be independent of both pollination and fertilization. The cuticle structure of the apical cells in the micropylar nucellus is very similar to cuticles of stigmatic papillae in other plants, which may be related to this tissue being predetermined to be recognized and penetrated by pollen tubes. The ultrastructural features of the micropylar nucellus cells are well in accordance with a secretory activity related to penetration and guidance of pollen tubes. It is discussed whether mitochondrial conversion of ACC to ethylene in these cells might be involved in pre? and postfertilization processes. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

Current explanations for angiosperm success emphasize the advantages of insect pollination and seed dispersal by animals for the colonization of isolated habitats. Differences between gymnosperm and angiosperm reproductive and vegetative growth rates have been largely ignored. Gymnosperms are all woody, perennial and usually have long reproductive cycles. Their leaves are not as fully vascularized as those of angiosperms and are more stereotyped in shape and size. Gymnosperm tracheids are generally more resistant to solute flow than angiosperm vessels. A consequence of the less efficient transport system is that maximum growth rates of gymnosperms are lower than maximum growth rates of angiosperms in well lit, well watered habitats. Gymnosperm seedlings may be particularly uncompetitive since their growth depends on a single cohort of relatively inefficient leaves. Later, some gymnosperms attain a higher productivity than co?occurring angiosperm trees by accumulating several cohorts of leaves with a higher total leaf area. These functional constraints on gymnosperm growth rates suggest that gymnosperms will be restricted to areas where growth of angiosperm competitors is reduced, for example, by cold or nutrient shortages. Biogeographic evidence supports this prediction since conifers are largely confined to high latitudes and elevations or nutrient?poor soils. Experimental studies show that competition in the regeneration niche (between conifer seedlings and angiosperm herbs and shrubs) is common and significantly affects conifer growth and survival, Fast?growing angiosperms, especially herbs and shrubs, may also change the frequency of disturbance regimes thereby excluding slower?growing gymnosperms. Shade?tolerant and early successional conifers share similar characteristics of slow initial growth and low plasticity to a change in resources. Shade?tolerant gymnosperms would be expected to occur only where forest openings are small or otherwise unsuitable for rapid filling by fast?growing angiosperm trees, lianas or shrubs. The limited evidence available suggests that shade?tolerant conifers are confined to forests with small gap sizes where large disturbances are very rare. The regeneration hypothesis for gymnosperm exclusion by angiosperms is consistent with several aspects of the fossil record such as the early disappearance of gymnosperms from early successional environments where competition with angiosperms would have been most severe. However there are unresolved difficulties in interpreting process from paleoecological pattern which prevent the testing of alternative hypotheses. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

Analysis of 5-6 natural populations indicated that mean and mean squared distances of pollen dispersal, measured over the reproductive lifespan of individual plants, varied >3-fold among populations and years. Dispersal distances also shifted over the season within a given population. Unlike the variation among populations, these seasonal changes were associated in part with changes in flower density. The mean distance of pollen dispersal from an individual plant was unrelated to date of 1st flowering, but did reflect 2 floral characters. Plants with higher variance in stamen length across flowers delivered pollen farther on average, as predicted by computer simulations of pollen carryover. Plants with lower mean stamen lengths also delivered pollen farther. Such effects of plant characters of pollen dispersal are a critical prerequisite for dispersal to evolve in response to its effects on fitness. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024944392

Grain number per main culm ear under these standard conditions was compared with the response obtained when sets of plants were transferred to high temperature (24/19°C, or 30/25°C) over the period from flag leaf ligule to ear emergence (booting), or from ear emergence to the end of anthesis (pollination and fertilization). Some Australian lines such as Isis and Hybrid Titan were tolerant of high temperature at booting, while others such as Pinnacle and Olympic showed a marked sensitivity to high temperature at this stage. Cultivars from the Middle East and tropical areas were generally more tolerant of high temperature at booting than cultivars from regions such as North America and Europe, while the Australian lines were intermediate in their response. With the cultivar Pinnacle, it was shown that at least part of the low fertility associated with high temperature at booting was related to poor pollen development. Commencing the high temperature treatment earlier in the development of the ear and continuing this until ear emergence resulted in adaptation in the cultivar H757 from Afghanistan, which showed an increase in grain set above that of the short high temperature booting treatment. However, this contrasted with the response of the cultivar Banks when the extended high temperature treatment resulted in a further reduction, not an increase in grain set. It was shown that the presence of the rye translocation for rust resistance (1B/1R) in near isogenic lines of Condor resulted in reduced sensitivity to high temperature. This would suggest that species such as rye should be examined more closely for their sensitivity to environmental stress. Exposure to high temperature only during anthesis generally had a small effect oil grain set. Some cultivars showed an increase in grain set, whereas others showed a decrease. Part of this variation may be related to the finding that under high temperature conditions, high humidity (v.p.d. 6.7 mb) could reduce grain set. However, given the normal relation between temperature and humidity in Australia, this effect is likely to be limited to glasshouse conditions. © 1989 CSIRO.

Unless the arrival rate of any forager at a patch is independent of previous arrivals at that patch, encountered crop does not equal standing crop. Pollination ecologists should be wary of using standing crop to measure encountered crop. When resources in a patch renew at a constant rate, systematic foraging (reducing the standard deviation but not the mean of the inter-arrival time) does not increase the mean resource abundance encountered by a forager. However, systematic foraging may increase the fitness of a territorial forager because it reduces mean standing crop and therefore intruder pressure, and systematic foraging may increase the fitness of a risk-averse forager because it reduces the standard deviation of encountered crop. When the rate of resource renewal in a patch depends on the amount of resource in that patch, systematic foraging alters the mean resource abundance encountered by a forager. In particular, when resources increase in a patch at a decreasing rate, systematic foraging increases mean encountered crop. -Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024525251

During and following germination of the mature seed the RNA content of the endosperm increases up to 72 h after imbibition (HAI). A similar decline in RNA in the endosperm occurs when the seed is prematurely dried at 35 DAP and there is an increase again upon subsequent rehydration, although not to the level achieved in the endosperm of germinated mature seed.Quantitative and qualitative changes in the mRNA complement of the endosperm occur during development. In particular, messages coding for high mol. wt. proteins (putative storage protein precursors) decline substantially during maturation drying (50-60 DAP). A similar decline occurs as a consequence of premature desiccation at 35 DAP. Following rehydration of these dried seeds the pattern of proteins synthesized in vitro by the mRNAs extracted from the endosperm is very similar to that catalysed by messages from the mature seed endosperm during germination and growth. Some mRNAs associated with development, which persist in the endosperm following natural and imposed desiccation, decline during early imbibition. During germination and growth of mature and prematurely dried seeds a similar complement of mRNAs arise in the endosperm, in an identical temporal sequence. The mRNA for ricin D, a protein synthesized predominantly during development at 30-40 DAP, declines to a low level in the mature dry endosperm (60 DAP) and in that of the prematurely dried seed and does not increase substantially during germination or growth. Thus the changes in protein synthesis effected by drying in the endosperm of castor bean are mediated primarily through changes in their mRNAs, as a result of transcriptional control. Drying, whether occurring naturally or imposed prematurely, results in the permanent suppression of transcription of most developmentally-related messages and, upon subsequent rehydration, the induction of those associated with germination and growth. Some residual mRNAs for developmental proteins which are present in the dry seed are selectively degraded during germination. Thus there are some posttranscriptional changes to the mRNA population following drying, in addition to the transcriptional modifications. © 1989 Oxford University Press.",Castor bean endosperm; Desiccation; Gene expression; Messenger RNA; Metabolism; Protein synthesis; Seed development and germination; Transcriptional control,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0002640765

Catalase activity profiles and zymogram analysis were used to examine the spatial and temporal expression of the three genes during kernel maturation. Three developmental stages of catalase expression were observed in the growing kernel. During stage 1 (6?12 days after pollination), both Catl and Cat3 were expressed; during stage 2 (15?18 days after pollination) only Cat1 expression was observed; and during stage 3 (21?30 days after pollination), Cat1 and Cat2 were expressed. The major constituent tissues of the kernel were examined to determine their contribution to total kernel catalase expression. Each of the tissues was found to have a unique pattern of catalase gene expression. RNA blot analysis, using catalase gene?specific nucleic acid probes, suggests that the differential expression of the three catalase genes observed in the kernel is regulated by controlling the distribution of steady?state mRNA species for the three genes.

Aberrant endosperm nuclei were first observed alter the 8th division and their number increased after the 10th division. Endosperm nuclei continued to divide until the 12th day after pollination.

This starchy pollen, when fed to newly emerged adult honeybees, was nearly totally rejected when they were provided, simultaneously, with a standard mixture of bee-collected pollen from 15 other plant species. Ethyl acetate extracts from 1 g of Typha pollen were added to 20 g of an artificial diet and fed in choice tests to newly emerged worker bees. The bees preferred by over 2·5 to 1 the extract-flavoured diet over either unflavoured diet or Typha pollen, itself. In longevity tests, bees fed Typha pollen died, on average, in about 21 days compared with 25 days for sucrose-water controls, and 57 days for bees fed the standard pollen mixture. A small colony fed only Typha pollen consumed pollen rapidly at first but then consumption decreased and in 5 weeks the population declined from 5686 to 2525 adults, with only 377 new adult bees being reared. A similar colony fed a pollen mixture increased from 4024 to 4617 adults in 4 weeks and reared 2269 adults. Despite the poor colony performance on Typha pollen, the bees apparently digested the pollen as shown by an average approximate digestibility (AD) of 90·0% and average coefficient of approximate digestibility of nitrogen (CADN) of 83·6%. The amount of uric acid in faeces from Typha-fed bees was 13·1% of the total faecal nitrogen. These results suggest that Typha pollen may be toxic to bees and is avoided by them, although it is digestible. The nature of the presumed toxic activity of Typha pollen is not known but may be related to its high starch content. Overall, Typha pollen is detrimental for honeybees and would not be a good supplemental pollen for feeding to bees. However, it does contain lipid-soluble phagostimulants that can be separated from the otherwise unattractive pollen. © 1989 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0001594603

The same thornless clone had the greatest production of 39 t/ha after three seasons at the wetter site, while the thorny hybrid clone B9V18 had only 16.6 t/ha at the end of three seasons' growth. Two principal reasons seem responsible for the differences in productivity. Clone B9V18, being thorny and multi-stemmed, was undamaged from deer browse and deer scrapes at the drier site, while the thornless erect clone was heavily browsed at the drier site, but not at the wetter site. Clone B9V18 experienced considerable damage from blister beetles (Epicauta nigritarsus) at the wetter site, while clone B2V50 was undamaged.

The 6-fold difference in the productivity of clone B2V50 between sites may be caused by fertility deficiencies.

The overall response to temperature, based on 28 cultivars from Afghanistan, Australia, Europe, India, Mexico, the Middle East and north Africa, demonstrated the sensitivity ofgrain number to high temperature during booting and the sensitivity of weight per grain to high temperature after anthesis. The data indicate a general reduction in yield per ear of 3-4% for each 1±C rise in temperature above a mean of 15°C. The response to temperature varied with the stage of development, and some cultivars sensitive to high temperature at booting were amongst the least sensitive during grain development. Also, the temperature response was found to be dependent on light, with an enhanced sensitivity to high temperature at low irradiance (&lt;10 MJ m-2 day-1). The data did not reveal any clear relationship between the response to temperature, and weight per grain, the number of grains in a head or grains per spikelet of control (18/13°C) plants. © 1989 CSIRO.

The plants adapted to the dry Yucatan coast have structural characteristics to cope with low moisture, the same structures serve also as herbivore deterrents. Thus, during the dry season, some of the most attractive rood sources are the rich tissues of the reproductive structures. The nectar produced by those structures may play an important role, not only in insect nutrition, but in their water balance as well. It is proposed that owing 10 rood shortage during the dry season in coastal Yucatan, ants will rely on the nectar produced on the flowers and other reproductive structures as their main liquid energy source. Twenty?three plant specks arc reported as being visited by ants in coastal Yucatan. Two of these species were studied in more detail: Avicennia germinans, where ants take floral nectar and pollination is not effected, so nectar thievery is taking place; Schomburgkia tibicinis, where ants take circum?floral nectar, and this activity benefits the plant (fewer damaged infloreseences and more matured fruits).

The secretory cells are densely packed and have few vascular connections. The five anther connectives each terminate in a gland, which at anthesis contains large, thin-walled cells. The gland contains a hydrophobic material which stains positively for lipids and probably contains phenolics.

In terms of body size, the endemic species is the most sexually dimorphic species of hummingbird known; it also displays an extraordinary degree of sexual dichromatism. Both sexes hold feeding territories, within which courtship probably occurs. It is suggested that sexual selection, and selection for gender recognition and the absence of indigenous predators may explain the evolution of sexual dimorphism and dichromatism in the Juan Fernández Firecrown. In spite of a more than twofold difference in body size, the bill lengths of both sexes in both species are nearly identical and closely match the flower tube length of the several species of endemic plants they pollinate. The endemic Juan Fernández Firecrown has become extinct on one of the two main islands (Isla Alejandro Selkirk) and its population on the other main island (Isla Róbinson Crusoe) has greatly declined in recent decades. In contrast, the population of the Green?backed Firecrown has probably increased on Róbinson Crusoe and the species has recently become established on Alejandro Selkirk. Because historical records show that Green?backed Firecrown survived centuries of potential competition from Juan Fernández Firecrown, massive habitat destruction, plagues of rats, feral cats and dogs and the effects of feral livestock before beginning its recent decline, it is suggested that the introduction earlier in this century of the bramble Rubus ulmifalius, the coati Nasua nasua and possibly the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus may have differentially favoured the Green?backed Firecrown at the expense of the Juan Fernández Firecrown.

Natural pollination limited seed set in one year but not another at the study site near Montreal, Quebec; year-to-year variation in pollinator availability probably is the norm. Removal of leaf or floral bract tissues did not affect mean seed set, but leaf removal did reduce allocation of biomass and nonstructural carbohydrates to rhizomes. As the level of defoliation increased, the correlation between reproduction and storage within plants became increasingly negative. Although the mean seasonal leaf conductance of partially defoliated plants was greater than that of intact plants, any conductance of partially defoliated plants was greater than that of intact plants, any compensatory increases in photosynthesis that may have occurred were apparently insufficient to prevent the reduced allocation to belowground storage. Allocation of resources to current reproduction at the expense of survival and future reproduction possible reflects selective effects of unpredictable availability of pollinators for this woodland spring ephemeral. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024927216

We present in this article the results of an 8-year pollen count in the atmosphere of Naples, Italy. The pollen content was examined with a volumetric spore trap (Lanzoni VPPS-2000) like that of Hirst. The results of the pollen counts were subsequently compared with results of skin tests of patients born and still living in and around Naples to determine the pollinosis of that area. We found that the most important allergenic pollen in the Naples area is Parietaria, with very long-lasting periods of pollination. The first period, more important, occurring from March to July, and the second period of much lower intensity, occurring from the end of August to the end of October. Pollen allergy to Parietaria was found to be present in 82.02% of pollen-allergic patients. It was followed by Gramineae (38.12%), Olea (23.11%), and Artemisia vulgaris (17.08%). These data are quite different from data of the pollinosis in northern Italy and in the northern Mediterranean area, as well as the southern coast of France, where allergic sensitization to Poaceae is the most important. © 1989.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024586458

This study involved controlled pollinations and serial sectioning of material embedded in glycol methacrylate. In Hordeum vulgare cv. Bomi the pollen tube reaches the nucellus in the course of 40 minutes after pollination (m.a.P). In the next minutes the tube advances between the nucellar cells, through the filiform apparatus of the degenerating synergid and releases its contents, which is characterized by rod?shaped starch grains. One of the sperm nuclei is fused with the egg nucleus 45 m.a.P., the second is in contact with the two polar nuclei 5060 m.a.P., but the real connection between one of the polar nuclei and the sperm nucleus does not occur before 10 hours after pollination (h.a.P.). Triple fusion between all three nuclei takes place about 13 h.a.P. The first division in the zygote takes place 2224 h.a.P. The embryo has got 3 cells at 34 h.a.P., 4 cells at 38 h. and 52 h.a.P. the embryo is composed of 7 cells. Protoderm formation takes place from a 14?celled embryo stage at 7280 h.a.P The primary endosperm nucleus divides 14 h.a.P. The next division takes place soon after the first; therefore the endosperm is 4?nucleated already 18. h.a.P. Further divisions are synchronized, and 3038 h.a.P. there will be more than 32 nuclei. The synchronous divisions continue, and the cellularisation begins at about 70 h.a.P.

There were trends in flower longevity associated with various ecological factors hypothesized to be important: bee-pollinated species had lower MFL than hummingbird and moth-pollinated species; MFL was negatively correlated with plant size (trees<shrubs<herbs); large flowers persisted longer than small flowers; MFL was higher in species with ?50 ovules per flower than in species with few ovules. However, when correlations due to taxonomic relatedness were eliminated, none of the ecological factors had a significant effect on flower longevity.

During 1987, experiments were conducted to determine: 1) If volatile plant?derived Diabrotica spp. attractants could be encapsulated in a starch borate matrix (SBM), and 2) If various SBM?semiochemical formulations would attract Diabrotica species over time in field corn. Chemical analyses of fresh SBM formulations indicated that indole, estragole, veratrole, phenylacetaldehyde, and trans?anethole were not retained during formulation but trans?cinnamaldehyde, Beta?ionone, 1,2,4,?trimethoxybenzene, eugenol and isugenol were successfully encapsulated. Encapsulated semiochemical formulations were made into 20 mesh granules, placed in Pherocon ® 1C traps that were tied to corn plants, and sampled for CRW adults every 4 days from 11 July to 8 September. Field data indicated that encapsulated semiochemicals were retained in the SBM for varying lengths of time and were released at rates attractive to CRW adults. A two?component mixture of trans?cinnamaldehyde and 1,2,4?trimethoxybenzene was the most effective formulation tested; however, no formulation was effective during corn silking and pollination. Although seasonal variation in CRW response could limit the usefulness of some plant?derived semiochemicals, the starch matrix concept may be useful as a delivery system for semiochemicals and may have potential as a tool that could be used in the development of new more biorational CRW management programs.

The primary pollinators, bumble bees Bombus spp can discover individual plants with elevated levels of either nectar or pollen, and return to them more often than to less rewarding plants. Both pollen and nectar are presented gradually over time in such a way as to favor traplining behavior by the bees, with many, frequent visits. In controlled environments, lifetime sugar production per flower varies among plants, among umbel orders within plants, and between male and female phases of bloom within umbel orders; there are further interactions among these sources of variation, which complicate any consideration of differential male-phase vs. female-phase nectar production. After draining, floral nectar is rapidly replenished, rendering umbels attractive to bees again within 15 min. Pollen production per flower and pollen grain size vary among umbel orders, increasing toward the end of bloom; grain size (but not production) varies among plants.

Recent theoretical work suggests that patterns of investment in reproduction should also change with the mating system. In a glasshouse study, we investigated the extent to which mating system differences among populations of Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae) were correlated with changes in allocation to male and female function, floral display, and the regulation of investment in reproduction through fruit and ovule abortion. Significant differences in the amount of biomass allocated to reproductive structures were evident among six populations of E. paniculata. As predicted by sex allocation theory, the proportion of dry weight allocated to male function decreased with the outcrossing rate of populations. Six of the eight attributes used to characterize floral display also differed significantly among populations. However, with the exception of two attributes describing the number of flowers produced by inflorescences, these were not correlated with outcrossing rate. Levels of fruit and ovule abortion were determined in two populations with contrasting mating systems under different nutrient and pollination treatments. Virtually all fruits initiated by plants from a self?fertilizing population were matured, while the amount of fruit abortion in an outcrossing population increased with flower production. Ovule abortion was low in both populations. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of self?fertilization in E. paniculata is associated with changes in investment to reproduction that normally distinguish selfing and outcrossing species.

Experiments were designed to determine whether simulated acid rain treatments just before or after pollination could adversely influence reproductive processes and seed set in corn (Zea mays L.). Container-grown corn with sexually mature tassels and ears were exposed once to simulated rain at four pH levels for 1 h, beginning 1 h after artificial pollination or ending 10 min before artificial pollination. The single, artificial pollination deposited an average of 85 pollen grains per silk. Simulated rain treatment at pH 4.5, 3.5, or 2.5 after pollination reduced the percentage seed set of treated ears 7, 29, and 34%, respectively, as compared with pH 5.5. Simulated rain at pH 5.5 after pollination reduced seed set 24% as compared with no-rain controls. The pH of simulated rain applied before pollination did not affect seed set, and pH 5.5 rain applied before pollination had no effects on seed set compared to no-rain controls. Microscopic observations indicated that pollen germination and pollen tube penetration of the silk were completed by the time the rain treatments began 1 h after pollination.

Inbreeding depression was manifested as late abortion of some selfed seeds. Geitonogamous selfing is largely prevented by temporal separation of male and female functions within plants.

The day following a defoliation of c. 80% of leaf area, there was a 42% reduction in the mean time spent per flower by bees, relative to undamaged controls. No further reductions were evident, 2, 3 or 5 days postdefolialion; defoliated shoots maintained a nectar secretion rale of c. 58% that of controls. Although under normal circumstances most photosynthate for nectar secretion is provided by adjacent leaves, these results suggest that the sink effect of open flowers is sufficient to mobilize the translocation of photosynthate from distant plant parts. Defoliated plants did not significantly reduce the numbers of flowers open until day 3 postdefoliation, and even then, there were no differences in the numbers of flowers visited by bees. Parallel fluctuations in flower quality appeared in both control and defoliated inflorescences across the experimental timeframe and presumably reflect variation in environmental factors that influenced the rate of nectar production and/or secretion. © 1989 International Bee Research Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051733713

For B, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, S and Zn, concentrations declined sharply within the first 8 weeks of growth, then more gradually in the subsequent 12 weeks until harvest. The concentrations of Ca, N and P, on the other hand, tended to decline regularly throughout the growth period. Small differences were noted between concentrations when fruit at equivalent stages of development were compared over both seasons. However the trends in the concentration changes were similar, the only exception being K, where in one season they fluctuated in an irregular manner, whereas in the other there was a regular decline. The quantities of all nutrients in fruit increased throughout the season, the magnitude of the increase diminishing with time. The greatest rate of accumulation of each element occurred during the first 8 weeks of growth. There was no apparent difference in the pattern of B, Mg, K, S or Zn accumulation in either season. For Cu, Fe, Mn, N, P and especially Ca, the patterns were influenced to some extent by season.

In the lowland population the male-bias could be attributed to males (trees producing staminate flowers) starting to flower at a smaller average size than females (trees producing pistillate flowers). Males trees flowered earlier, flowered longer, and produced over twice as many flowers as females. Although onset of flowering was variable, 18-22 d following heavy rains, most trees had a synchronous period of maximum flowering. Pollination manipulations determined that there was no fruit development without pollination, and that increasing pollen loads resulted in increased fruit set with diminishing effect. Taking into account the sex-ratios and intersexual differences in flower production, the pollen-ovule ratio was calculated to be 16 000-19 000. Male trees expended more energy on flowering. Open-pollination resulted in 1.0% of female flowers setting fruit. The much greater cost of fruit production resulted in females expending 421% more energy on reproduction than males.

In both groups, species with greater pollen dispersal abilities appear to maintain high levels of gene flow. A detailed analysis of population structure in relation to gene flow was carried out on a gymnosperm species (Pinus rigida) and two angiosperm subspecies (Eucalyptus caesia ssp. caesia and ssp. magna). The results suggested that populations of many species may be concatenated systems bound by gene flow, and the overall levels of gene flow may be influenced by either single or clusters of populations. Different levels of gene flow was found between two closely related species of E. caesia growing under similar ecological conditions, suggesting a plausible link between pollinator behaviour and pollen flow. 1989 The Linnean Society",angiosperms and conifers; Population differentiation; qualitative and quantatitive methods rare alleles; rate of immigration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024882898

After washing the pollen for 5 or 10 min before mixing it with the DNA, a fraction of the nucleases appeared to be removed. This was demonstrated by incubation of DNA in the washing medium, after which the sample was analyzed by electrophoresis. However, considerable nuclease activity remained associated with the pollen and completely degraded the DNA. Pretreatment of the pollen with Denhardt's solution, which might coat the pollen and therefore decrease the release of nucleases, had no influence on degradation of the DNA.

The reduction appeared related to a derease in pollen germination and tube elongation associated with acidic conditions and limited quantities of pollen available for pollination. Germination and tube elongation of pollen were inhibited when grown on an agar medium acidified to pH 4.6 with simulated rain. Germination of pollen grains was reduced as much as 75% on silks previously exposed to a simulated rain of pH 3.6 as compared with germination on silks exposed to simulated rain of pH 5.6.

The various ways of propagation and survival, both generative and vegetative, are described. Attention is also given to the germination ecology of achenes and tubers. Flowering and achene production have been observed in most populations studied and the process of fructification is described in detail. Inflorescences of P. pectinatus are surface pollinated and the pollen is hydrophobous. The formation of seed banks by populations appears to be largely dependent on the degree of shelter in the habitats, the number of achenes produced seems to be less important. The results of the germination experiments with achenes support the field observations, indicating that achenes are relatively unimportant in the shory-term survival of populations. The main function of these generative propagules is most likely the dispersal of the species and the long-term survival. Potamogeton pectinatus shows several types of vegetative propagation. Subterranean tubers are the most common and most important propagules. Temperature and stratification appear to be major factors regulating the germination of tubers. The reproduction of P. pectinatus is discussed in relation to the life cycle and survival strategy of the populations. © 1989.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024910852

The seeds obtained were germinated and one cotyledon per seedling was removed and put stalk upwards on nutrient agar. In 80% of the cotyledons a callus developed from the cut surface of the stalks which was screened for tumor transformation on hormone?free medium. In repeated subculturing some calli maintained growth on hormone?free medium. Two of these calli were habituated. One callus, the best growing one, showed on Southern blot analysis a distinct hybridization signal at 3.2 kb when probed with Hind III fragment 22 DNA, covering two genes responsible for hormone free growth. This is the exact size that could be expected when plant material has been transformed with T?DNA. Another callus gave a hybridization signal at 2 kb which could only be explained with chromosomal rearrangement. In these two calli there was no co?transformation of the nos?gene: nopaline synthase activity could be detected from none of the calli, and none of the calli DNAs hybridized when probed with the nos?gene.

Buds swelled as early as June in some lines while others showed no sign of swelling until September. In those lines with early swelling or flower opening a high proportion of the buds were frost damaged, whereas late flowering lines had a high rate of survival. Terminal flower buds formed just prior to winter dormancy survived and flowered in the next spring, even in otherwise early flowering lines. Earlier work has shown that jojoba flower buds remain dormant until a chilling requirement has been met.

Population flowering synchrony, effective pollinator populations and pollen loads transferred between staminate and pistillate trees were compared among three insect?pollinated tree species. All three were visited by a wide range of insects, 75% of which (mostly 36 mm long) carried conspecific pollen. Fewer than 8% of individual insects were found to be carrying single?species pollen exclusively and none could be described as specialist pollen foragers. The introduced honeybee carried greater quantities of pollen than any native species but was not necessarily a reliable pollinator. The brief flowering periods in Neolitsea dealbata (34 weeks) and Litsea leefeana (45 weeks) populations were synchronized among individuals. Flowering in the Diospyros pentamera population extended over 15 weeks and most individuals were in flower for most of this period. Staminate trees began flowering earlier, produced more flowers and attracted relatively more insects than did pistillate trees, suggesting a density?dependent response of pollinators to flowering performance. Pollen was trapped in greater quantities on insects at staminate trees than at pistillate trees. Insect numbers increased at peak flowering periods and Diptera were the most abundant flower visitors. Anthophilous Coleoptera were more numerous at staminate than at pistillate trees in all three tree species populations. Larger quantities of pollen were mobilized during peak flowering times although the greatest quantities were transferred to pistillate canopies towards the end of the population flowering periods. Diptera carried pollen more often to pistillate N. dealbata and L. leefeana trees than did other groups whereas Coleoptera carried pollen more often to pistillate D. pentamera trees. The two contrasting flowering performances in the three tree species are discussed with reference to mechanisms that facilitate pollen transfer between staminate and pistillate trees.

Chev.) C.F. Laing et A.R. Ferguson) orchards in the Western Cape. All pollinated flowers set fruit and this represented a potential doubling of production. There appeared to be some interaction between concentration and application time. Concentration had a much greater influence than application time. Three and 4% hydrogen cyanamide gave the highest flowering intensities. Application 5, 4 or 3 weeks before natural bud break gave equally good results, however, the vines showed increasing sensitivity to hydrogen cyanamide with decreasing time to bud break. The increased flowering intensity was brought about mainly by a more compact bud break period, which increased the proportion of flower-bearing (reproductive) shoots, as well as by an increase in the number of flowers on individual shoots. Overall bud break percentages were increased as well, but this had a smaller influence than the altered flower development pattern. The low chilling cultivar 'Abbott' was more sensitive to the chemical than cultivar 'Hayward' and showed phytotoxicity at the higher concentration (4%). The mature vines were naturally more productive, but showed a lower response to hydrogen cyanamide than the young vines. Mature vines generally had higher average flower numbers per reproductive shoot. The response to hydrogen cyanamide appeared to be greater in the orchards that received higher winter chilling accumulation. © 1989.",Actinidia deliciosa; delayed foliation; dormancy; flowering; hydrogen cyanamide,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249026192

A genetical analysis of maternal progenies obtained from in situ open-pollinated plants (G1, generation) allows us to define two types of parents: segregating plants (females, intermediate-females and some hermaphrodites) which yield different types of progenies, and non-segregating plants, hermaphrodites which yield only hermaphrodites. Molecular analysis (Saumitou-Laprade, 1989) confirms the results of a preliminary study (Boutin et al., 1987), in which it is shown that cytoplasmic type is related to segregation in the maternal progeny. A differentiation in space has been pointed out by the comparison between the sex phenotype frequencies in the two populations. This differentiation is not due to a variation of cytoplasmic frequencies but to a variation in the nuclear genetic components of these populations: the level of restoration is higher in population A than in population B. A comparison of the G0 and G1, generations did not allow to predict any detectable temporal change in population A, whereas the frequency of females in population B has been predicted to decrease quickly, probably due to a rapid invasion of restorer genes. We suggest that pollen flow is an important factor which determines the rate of the dynamics of male sterility during the life-span of a population. © 1989, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966169320

Plants that expressed RNA sequences complementary to the CP coding region and the 3' untranslated region, including the tRNA-like sequences, were protected from infection by TMV at low levels of inoculum. However, plants that expressed RNA complementary to the CP coding sequence alone were not protected from infection. These results indicate that sequences complementary to the terminal 117 nucleotides of TMV, which include a putative replicase binding site, are responsible for the protection.

The analytical model illustrated that as carryover rate drops, fewer donors can be sampled by any pollen recipient, and that this reduction in diversity is highly non-linear. Simulations of variable pollen carryover were carried out for two kinds of plant pollinator systems: (a) those in which little pollen on average is removed from a vector during a flower visit, and (b) those in which a large fraction of the available pollen is removed. In both cases, realized carryover is reduced as variance in carryover of pollen from one flower to the next increases. However, the reduction is disproportionately large in case (b). Introducing simulation results in the analytical projection of donor diversity suggests that in the extreme, variance in carryover can reduce the diversity of pollen ""seen"" by a flower by up to 70%.

In seed-propagated species, the low transmission of the extra chromosome has prevented such plants from becoming agriculturally useful cultivars. In line B220, the transfer of the extra chromosome in 2n×2n+1 crosses was very low (13.5%), although n and n + 1 pollen grains were produced in equal quantities, as was confirmed by anther culture. This was due to the delayed development of n + 1 pollen grains, which are not at full maturity at the time of an thesis. The transfer of the extra chromosome in 2n×2n+1 crosses was increased by a 1 day delay in pollination and also by pollination of small pollen grains selected through nylon meshes. The delayed pollination increased the frequency of trisomics by 9%, whereas pollen selected by using 30 and 25 ?n nylon meshes induced an extremely high transfer of the extra chromosome, namely 51.9% and 70.4%, respectively. The observed frequencies of trisomics and tetrasomics in artificial selfing of 2n+1 plants with selected small pollen grains were lower than those expected from the data of reciprocal crosses between 2n and 2n+1 plants. This discrepancy seems to indicate a disadvantage of the n+1 pollen in fertilization due to the longer style of the trisomics relative to that of the diploids. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Delayed pollination; Extra chromosome; Nicotiana sylvestris; Pollen sizing; Primary trisomics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2642648607

Temporal patterns of leaf production vary considerably between tropical forest species, but few species produce leaves continuously throughout the year2. Even in aseasonal tropical forests, most species show synchronous peaks in leaf production2. Results from this one-year study suggest that herbivores may influence leaf phenology of shade-tolerant understory plants in a Panamanian lowland moist forest.

Extinctions will continue untill species number equilibrates at a level appropriate for the size and isolation of the island remnants. We tested whether insularisation leads to species loss by comparing plant species numbers on islands of fynbos shrublands surrounded by Afrotemperate evergreen forest with extensive ""mainland"" tracts of fynbos. Species area curves for islands and subsamples of mainland had significantly different slopes (zisland=0.43, zmainland=0.16). Small islands had the fewest species (less than one fifth) relative to mainland samples of similar size. The species area curves intersect at 590 ha so that reserve sizes of this order of magnitude are needed to avoid species losses relative to extensive areas of fynbos. We compared traits of species on islands and mainlands to determine processes most affected by insularisation. Island floras did not differ from the mainland in the mix of dispersal types, pollinator syndromes or proportion of dioecious species. Islands did have significantly fewer species of low stature and significantly more species that survive fire only as seed and not by resprouting. We infer that the main cause of species loss is change in disturbance frequency. Islands have fewer fires and lose species dependent on frequent fires. We predict that island effects could be reduced by judicious fire management of small reserves. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Disturbance; Island biogeography; Nature reserves; Species diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024185684

In the Oleaceae family, the most allergenic pollen is produced by Olea europaea, the olive tree, which in the Mediterranean area has a pollination period lasting from May to the end of June and sometimes causes severe symptoms of pollinosis. In Northern and Central Europe, where there are no olive trees, there are two other commonly occurring genera of the Oleaceae family, namely Fraxinus and Ligustrum, but these have a low frequency of allergic sensitization.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024208237

Darwin suggested that the evolution of deep flowers could be a response to a kind of 'race' with pollinating insects: the length of the tongues of pollinating insects could increase as a result of a general size increase, or because it increased their nectar foraging efficiency. As this occurred, plants with relatively shallow flowers could be disadvantaged since pollen transfer, which is effected by physical contact between the pollinator and the anthers or stigma of the plant, could be reduced when the insect tongue is long relative to flower depth. This could lead to the evolution of increasing flower depth which in turn could drive the evolution of a further increase in insect tongue length. Various predictions of Darwin's proposal were tested here for orchid species with deep flowers that are pollinated by moths. It was found that insects do indeed insert their probosces no further than necessary to obtain nectar; that an experimental reduction in flower depth reduces both the male and female components of fitness; and that in natural populations there is a correlation between flower depth and female fitness measured by fruit set. These results all support Darwin's hypothesis to explain the evolution of flower depth. © 1988 Nature Publishing Group.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023808390

The thesis is put forward that amphicarpic annuals, which exhibit both self-pollination and extreme seed polymorphism, are best adapted to life in hazardous habitats. The hypothetical course of the evolution of amphicarpy is demonstrated on the grounds of the comparison of contemporary annual species producing chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers on a single individual. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Amphicarpy; Life history; Seed polymorphism; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024189294

Most experiments that investigated a likely role of wind alter wind flows and are confounded by the presence of honey bees. Similarly, evidence taken as support for the role of honey bees is confounded by the action of wind.

Excised embryos are capable of precocious germination as early as 8 d after pollination (DAP). At this age, however, they are not capable of resisting a desiccation treatment which induces a loss of 96-98% of their initial water content. At 16 DAP the embryos germinate despite the drastic drying treatment. The pattern of in-vivo and in-vitro proteins synthesized by the developing embryos from 12 DAP (desiccation-intolerant) and 16 DAP (desiccation-tolerant) were compared. A set of 25-30 proteins was identified which is denovo synthesized or enhanced during the developmental period leading to desiccation tolerance. Abscisic acid (ABA; 100 ?M) applied in vitro for 5 d to 12-DAP embryos induces desiccation tolerance and represses a subset of polypeptides preferentially associated with 16-DAP embryos.

Over 36% of the pistils had the potential to set fruit. Pollinations conducted in the afternoon at the normal time of anthesis, had double the fruit set potential of morning pollinations as measured by penetration of ovules by pollen tubes. Pollinator efficiency also varied, with excessive damage to stigmas resulting in reduced pollen germination and tube growth. There were differences between clones in both female and male fertility, in the proportion of pistils with more than three carpels and in the production of small abnormal stigmas. There was no difference in pollen tube growth following self- or cross-pollination, indicating that the self-sterility mechanism of rubber operates in the ovary.

These final size differences were eliminated when all flowers were pollinated simultaneously. At anthesis proximal ovaries have higher cell numbers than distal ovaries but the cell division activity and cell enlargement in both positions was similar in the first 10 days of fruit growth. Simultaneous pollination resulted in lower cell numbers in proximal but higher cell numbers in distal fruits compared to control fruits.

The frequency of gynogenetic plants when ""Stock 6"" was used as pollinator varied according to the female parent genotype. No simple relation was observed between genotypic aptitudes for gynogenetic and androgenetic development, which occured after pollination of ""W23"" plant carrying the ""indeterminate gametophyte"" gene. Furthermore, the population NS, a favorably responsive genotype to anther culture, does not exhibit exceptional ability for in vivo gynogenesis. The effect of inbreeding and the influence of maternal haploid origin suggest that specific genes control maternal haploid initiation and development. However, gynogenetic development is not limited to a particular genotype. The frequency of maternal haploids may be increased by using specific pollen parents. Attempts were made to select for a high haploidyinducing trait and the present study reports the successful development of lines that can be utilized as pollen parents to induce haploids for experimental purposes and breeding programmes. When an inbred line ""WS14"", derived from the cross W23 x Stock 6, was used as pollen parent, 2%-5% maternal haploids were obtained according to the female parent genotype. A high haploidy-inducing potential is a heritable trait and may be controlled by a limited number of genes.

Both species are distylous and self-incompatible. In laboratory experiments, we examined possible effects of indiscriminate foraging by hummingbirds among flowers of both species, as observed in the field, on pollination of Palicourea. In each of 35 trials, captive L. calolaema probed 2 flowers from pin plants of Palicourea followed by 20 thrum flowers of the same species, with either 0, 2, or 10 Cephaelis flowers intervening. We assessed pollen transfer by staining and counting pin pollen tubes growing in thrum styles; counts of 0, 1, or ?2 pollen tubes relate directly to seed output (0, 1, or 2 seeds per fruit, respectively). Intervening Cephaelis flowers sharply reduced pollen receipt by thrum flowers of Palicourea and reduced some aspects of pollen dispersal from pins as well, thereby curtailing maternal and paternal reproductive potential of Palicourea. Such effects of interspecific pollen loss on reproductive output may lead to strong competition among some, though not all, combinations of plant species pollinated by L. calolaema or of other plant combinations that share animal pollinators. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Cloud forest; Competition; Costa Rica; Hummingbird; Pollen tubes; Pollination; Tropics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024182684

This plant genus is coevolved with carpenter bees, and aspects of the insect-flower interaction in Israel suggest that the smaller bee, X. sulcatipes, is the natural co-adapted pollinator, a view borne out by the geographical distributions of the species concerned. There are significant mismatches between the plant and the larger X. pubescens, involving physical fit and behaviour. These mismatches are particularly evident when the physiologies of the bees and the plant are considered. The different sizes and colours of the two bees lead to different daily activity patterns, only X. sulcatipes being thermally suited to, and thus abundant at, times of maximum nectar production by Calotropis. Similarly the water requirements of X. sulcatipes are finely balanced with the water production in the floral nectar; this bee gains just enough water when foraging to restore its blood concentration and production in the floral nectar; for deposition in the nest. X. pubescens does not incur net water loss in flight and gains too much water from Calotropis flowers, necessitating copious urination and 'tonguelashing'. Hence physiological information can be of use in deciphering insect-plant coevolutionary patterns, and the water component of nectar is confirmed as a potentially major determinant of foraging activities. The circumstances where this will be particularly true, and cases where it may not apply, are discussed. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Coevolution; Nectar; Pollination; Water balance; Xylocopa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024187145

These techniques combine gamma-ray irradiation to pollen or to egg cells (in ovules) with in vitro culture of fertilized ovules. When in vitro culture of fertilized ovules from in situ hybridization of N. repanda x N. tabacum was combined without gamma-ray irradiation to pollen or to egg cells (in ovules), all of the resulting seedlings developed chlorosis and died. Furthermore, in the case of in situ hybridization of N. repanda x N. tabacum with gamma-ray irradiated N. tabacum pollen, no viable seeds were obtained. By using both techniques, combining gamma-ray irradiation to N. tabacum pollen or to egg cells in (N. repanda ovules) with in vitro culture of fertilized ovules, we were successful in obtaining flowering hybrid plants. Thus, it appears that it may be possible to overcome hybrid inviability to a certain extent using both the pollen irradiation technique and the egg cell irradiation technique, i.e., gamma-ray irradiation to pollen or to egg cells (in ovules) before pollination and in vitro culture of fertilized ovules. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Hybrid inviability; Irradiation; Ovule culture; Tobacco; Wide hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038128099

Box 43098 Mangere, Auckland, New Zealand","The reproductive biology and pollination of Phormium tenax was studied on Tiritiri Matangi Island and in Auckland, in the northern part of New Zealand. P. tenax reproduces asexually by offsets and sexually by large inflorescences. Offsets are monocarpic and inflorescences are terminal. Adjacent inflorescences often originate from the same genetic clone and each inflorescence usually carries many open flowers at the same time. Flower crops varied substantially from year to year. Flowers are protandrous hermaphrodites that exhibit partial dichogamy and herkogamy. The pollen or the stigma are presented sequentially for initial contact with floral visitors. Nectar rewards are greatest during the male phase of flowering. Results of controlled pollinations show that the plant preferentially outcrosses. Seeds are either large or small with the former predominating from outcrossed and natural pollinations. The capsules formed from self pollinations were rarely retained unless overall levels of pollination were reduced greatly. Where a plant was allowed to pollinate itself, a single capsule with large seeds was formed but these seeds had little endosperm. The shape and configuration of flowers ensures that large birds are the most likely pollinators. Two honeyeaters (Family Meliphagidae), the tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) and the bellbird (Anthornis melanura) were the most frequent visitors and pollinators although some introduced bird species also commonly visited, especially in Auckland City. Rather than a strict self incompatibility system, ovules respond preferentially to outcrossed pollen and nutrient resources are preferentially allocated to outcrossed zygotes. Many flowers appear to function solely as pollen donors. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bird pollinated; Dichogamy; Flowering; Herkogamy; Honeyeater; Inflorescence; Nectar; Outcrossing; Phormiaceae; Phormium tenax; Pollination; Reproductive biology; Seed size; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024254784

The number of ramets with flower buds, the proportion of flower buds that opened, and fruit set varied markedly between years. In the frost-prone populations, the occurrence or absence of detrimental frosts during the development of flowers and fruit could explain much of the variation, both in the proportion of flower buds that developed into flowers, and in fruit set. In the frost-sheltered populations, most female flowers that did not develop into fruit aborted without any signs of physical damage and before any ovules had begun to enlarge. Flower mortality caused by herbivores feeding on reproductive parts was commonly low, but reached values higher than 10% in one of the shaded populations. Hand-pollination increased the proportion of ovules producing seeds in the mature fruits by about 20%, and in one year also increased fruit set significantly in one population. Fruit-producing female ramets had a higher mortality and a lower probability of flowering in the subsequent year than male ramets and non-fruiting female ramets. In R. chamaemorus, the conditions for fruit maturation are highly unpredictable at the time of flower initiation. It is suggested that the apparent ""over-initiation"" of flower buds is advantageous, as it allows the plant to attain a high reproductive success in years favourable for flowering and fruit development. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Flowering pattern; Fruit set; Rubus chamaemorus; Sexual dimorphism; Weather effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024184345

(2n=6x=54) to induced tetraploid (2n=4x=28) cultivated pearl millet, Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke resulted in four offtype plants, two with 27 chromosomes and two with 28 chromosomes. These plants were found among 217 spaced plants established from open-pollinated seed of an apomictic 21-chromosome polyhaploid (2n=21) plant derived from an apomictic interspecific hybrid (2n=41) between tetraploid pearl millet and Pennisetum squamulatum. It appeared that a 21- (or 20-) chromosome unreduced egg from the apomictic polyhaploid united with a 7-chromosome pearl millet (2n=2x=14) gamete to produce a 28- (or 27-) chromosome offspring. Meiotic chromosome behavior was irregular averaging from 3.60 to 4.05 bivalents per microsporocyte in the 27- and 28-chromosome hybrids. The 27- or 28-chromosome hybrids, like the 21-chromosome female parent, shed no pollen, but set from 1.8 to 28 seed per panicle when allowed to outcross with pearl millet. Progeny of the 28-chromosome hybrids were uniform and identical to their respective female parents, indicating that apomixis had been effectively transferred through the egg. In addition, a 56-chromosome plant resulting from chromosome doubling of a 28-chromosome hybrid was identified. Pollen was 68 per cent stainable and the plant averaged 2.3 selfed seeds per panicle. Chromosomes of the 56-chromosome plant paired as bivalents (x=10.67) or associated in multivalents. Three to nine chromosomes remained unpaired at metaphase I. Multiple four-nucleate embryo sacs indicated the 56-chromosome hybrid was an obligate apomict. The production of 27-, 28-, and 56-chromosome hybrid derivatives were the results of interspecific hybridization, haploidization, fertilization of unreduced apomictic eggs, and spontaneous chromosome doubling.

The 15 ""red-line"" species are mostly well marked, whereas ""blue-line"" species-numbering roughly 50 if some newer treatments be accepted-are mostly hard to tell apart. Red-line ovules are tenuinucellate, blue-line ovules crassinucellate. Dividing the red line separates cornelian cherries from the showy-bracted species; dividing the latter separates dwarf cornels from big-bracted dogwoods. Adding in the blue line there are thus four subgroups, which differ with regard to inflorescences- and with regard to iridoid glucosides, among other things. I downplay further subdivision (into opposite- and alternateleaved blue-line groups, for instance) and focus on few traits because I aim to trace the subgroups backward in the fossil record, to decide the direction of evolutionary changes, and to infer the causes for divergence. Unlike pollen, leaves, and wood, fossil dogwood fruits can often be assigned to one of the four subgroups and sometimes to a species group within a subgroup. Dunstania (based on fruits from England's early Tertiary and here transferred to Cornus's cornelian cherry subgroup) or something close to the dunstanias gave rise to modern C. volkensii of Africa and four related species found today in California and Eurasia. Fossil fruit-stones of the blue line, like their modern counterparts, can be subglobose, compressed and asymmetric, fluted, or topped by a deep depression. Such a deep depression serves to link a fossil to the extant species C. alternifolia and C. controversa, but other features of the blue-line fruitstones, overlapping and less constant, cannot be used to prove a fossil's tie to groups within the blue line. Evidence of several kinds makes the blue-line dogwoods oldest and connects Cornus to the nyssoids:Nyssa, Camptotheca, and Davidia. Commonly called Nyssaceae after 1910, when Wangerin got their traits wrong, the nyssoids are surer relatives of Cornus than any of Wangerin's (""Das Pflanzenreich"") cornaceous genera. Mastixia, however, may be the actual sister group because it shares with Cornus 1-celled 2-armed hairs that nyssoids lack. Cornus, nyssoids, and mastixioids (modern Mastixia and its closest fossil allies) are here regarded as the true Cornaceae. Other genera once thought to be cornaceous are doubtfully to not at all related. As is now widely known, discordant features make Corokia and Kaliphora (for example) out of place in the Cornaceae, but Aucuba and Garrya (for example) are neither easily excluded by a listing of their traits nor easily included by construction of branched diagrams. The novelty that brought about the radiation of true cornads was, I think, epigyny, followed fairly quickly by the hard endocarp and singleseeded locules. Mastixioid fruits of the late Cretaceous were dry or leathery and smaller than their successors. This suggests that early members of the family spread abiotically or by means of animals that ate whole plants. Bigger, fleshier fruits came later through interaction with evolving frugivores. The cause of early radiation within Cornus probably was interaction with insect predators and pollinators. One species of the blue line escaped competition for spring pollinators by switching to fall flowering and thereby kept some traits that other dogwoods lost. Though birds are now the main dispersers of the dogwoods, rodents likely play a minor role, and monkeys likely played a major role when compound fruits evolved. Though gynoecial reduction was the rule in dogwoods, C. (Dunstania) multilocularis's multiple seed chambers reflect an evolutionary increase. I postulate that modern Cornus's 4-merous flower with 2-merous ovary has a strong developmental tie to pairing of the leaves and branches. © 1988 The New York Botanical Garden.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51849181764

Staphylinids removed substantial amounts of pollen but did not deposit any onto stigmata. Abundance of beetles on inflorescences was related to the mean number of florets opening per day. Honey bees collecting pollen were more likely to effect pollination than those collecting nectar which only contacted stigmata when arriving or leaving an inflorescence. Nectar-foraging birds probed between florets 10.2±0.8 (±SE) times, contacting 8-16 stigmata during each probe. Bees visited inflorescences ten times more frequently than birds although they deposited only 25% of the pollen that birds did on stigmata. Fruit set was ten times greater on inflorescences visited by birds than on inflorescences visited by bees. Bees were capable of removing as much pollen as birds but, because of direct pollen transfer to birds when florets opened during foraging, actual removal was probably much less.

The endosperms were of two kinds: homo-constitutions in which three chromosomes in each of the ten sets of homologues were of the same patterns of H-segments and hetero-constitutions in which one chromosome in a set of three homologous chromosomes was different from the other two. Out of 30 endosperms, 27 (90%) were of homo-constitutions and only three (10%) were of hetero-constitutions. Since the population consisted of various homokaryotypes in which each of the ten pairs of homologous chromosomes was homozygous for the patterns of H-segments, the endosperms of homo-constitutions were the result of self-pollination, and those of hetero-constitutions were from cross-pollination. Due to pollination tests conducted in two natural populations, many good seeds were found in the fruits from both open-pollinated flowers and those covered with cotton-bags. In striking contrast, no good seeds were found in the fruits from flowers castrated and pollinated in the open-air. An additional evidence of predominant self-pollination and occasional cross-pollination was given by analyzing spatial distribution of plants of various karyotypes in a population. © 1988 The Botanical Society of Japan.",Chromosome polymorphism; Endosperm nuclei; Natural population; Pollination; Trillium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51249173376

Although many-flowered plants attracted most bumblebees these plants received fewer visits on a per flower basis than smaller plants, and each bumblebee visited a smaller proportion of the flowers. The calculated effective visitation rate per flower was highest on plants of an intermediate size. If pollen-carryover was assumed to be limited the most efficient plant was predicted to be smaller since the proportion of fertilized flowers per bumblebee visit is expected to decrease further on the largest plants in relation to the total flower number. These predictions were tested by measuring fruit-set in the field. The percentage fruit-set decreased with plant size at all sizes that were investigated. That the most efficient plant was small indicates that pollen-carryover was indeed limited. However, the low percentage fruit-set associated with large size did not present a serious problem since the total estimated seed production per plant still increased with size.

In maize (Zea mays L.), chromosome aberrations and qualitative genetic variants have been induced during in vitro culture. The proportion of regenerated plants carrying such variants has been shown to increase with culture age. The objective of this research was to evaluate the relationship between culture age and somaclonal variation for several agronomic traits. Six sib-pollinated ears of S0 (F2) plants in four OH43 ms/A188 populations each provided control seed and embryos for culture initiation. S2 lines derived from control seed and from plants regenerated 4 and 8 months after culture initiation were grouped according to their source ear and grown in 6 separate trials. A total of 305 tissue culture-derived and 48 control lines were evaluated as lines per se and in a testcross at each of three locations. Tissue culturederived lines and their testcrosses generally had lower grain yield and moisture. Since grain yield and moisture were not positively correlated in any trial, the highest yielding lines could be selected without increasing grain moisture. Grain yield and plant height tended to decrease with culture age. Although tissue culture-derived lines were, on average, inferior, the highest yielding line per se in three of six trials and the top-ranked line in five of six trials for yield and moisture were derived from tissue culture. The results indicate that tissue culture may generate variation for agronomic traits. Some of the variation, particularly the trend towards earlier maturity, could be useful. However, this method may require screening large populations because of the tendency to generate a large proportion of inferior lines. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Agronomic traits; Earliness; Somaclonal variation; Tissue culture age; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000601642

Desiree (2n=4x=48). Nine dihaploid derivatives (2n=2x=24) of cv. Desiree were isolated by gynogenesis through prickle pollination with S. phureja Juz et Buk. Patatin DNA sequences in Desiree and in the dihaploids were examined by probing Southern blots of restriction endonucleases Hin-dIII and XbaI digested DNA with patatin cDNA region-specific gene probes and by more detailed examination (restriction endonuclease mapping and partial DNA sequencing) of 10 patatin genomic clones in bacteriophage ? replacement vector EMBL4. This provided positive identification for most individual patatin gene family members and some estimate of their organisation and diversity. Most of the 64-72 patatin DNA copies showed little allelic variation based on HindIII and XbaI restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping and did not appear to be very tightly clustered. Four of the 6-8 class I patatin genes (without a characteristic 22 bp insert in their untranslated leader DNA), showed apparent allelic homogeneity, whilst the remaining class I genes comigrated with a single class II patatin gene RFLP subclass. Of the isolated clones, 4 contained apparent pseudogenes lacking 5? control sequences and exon-1 DNA while another clone contained a patatin gene truncated at the 5? region due to the cloning event. The remaining 5 all contained class II genes (with the 22 bp insert) and these showed varying degrees of sequence homology for 400 bp of conserved 5? coding and non-coding DNA (from 77%-95%). In one case the extent of homology differed, with complete sequence divergence upstream of position-80 from the start of transcription.

It is assumed that the wild population predominates over the cultivated one, and that wild and cultivated plants differ only by one locus with two alleles (the wild allele being dominant). The parameters introduced in the model are the selfing rate, ?, of the cultivated species, the strength of selection, v, against hybrids prior to flowering and the migration rate of wild pollen, m. We first study a deterministic modelization, then we investigate the importance of the approximations carried out in this modelization. This leads to the study of two Markov chains: a Fisher-Wright model and a Markov chain associated with the random fluctuations of the wild pollination rate. We found that the domestication process could be initiated quickly, was easier with self-pollinating plants, and that parameter v had no qualitative effects on the domestication. The wild pollination rate is the major factor in this process, and the effects of its random fluctuations are important. © 1988 Academic Press Limited.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0007273377

Responses of the immature castor bean embryo to isolation from the whole seed; a comparison with premature desiccation.-J. exp. Bot. 39: 487-497.Desiccation is an absolute requirement for germination and post-germinative growth of whole seeds of the castor bean, whether desiccation is imposed prematurely during development, at 35 d after pollination (DAP) or occurs naturally during late maturation (50-60 DAP). Desiccation also plays a direct role in the induction of post-germinative enzyme synthesis in the cotyledons of embryos in the intact seed; this event is not simply due to the presence of a growing axis. Isolation of embryos from the developing castor bean seed at 35 DAP results in both germination and growth, despite the absence of a desiccation event. We have compared the metabolic consequences of premature drying of whole seeds (35 DAP) and isolation of the developing 35 DAP embryos. In both cases, hydrolytic events involved in the mobilization of stored protein reserves proceed in a similar manner and mirror those events occurring within germinated mature seeds. There are differences, however, for post-germinative enzyme (LeuNAase and isocitrate lyase) production occurs to a lesser extent in non-dried isolated embryos than in those from prematurely dried (35 DAP) whole seeds, or from mature dry (whole) seeds. Desiccation of the 35 DAP whole seed does not alter the subsequent response of the embryo upon isolation. Thus, while drying does not affect the metabolism of isolated embryos, it has a profound effect on that of embryos within the intact seed. Tissues surrounding the embryo in the developing intact seed (viz. the endosperm) maintain its metabolism in a developmental mode and inhibit germination. This effect of the surrounding tissues can only be overcome by drying or by their removal. © 1988 Oxford University Press.",Castor bean; Desiccation; Development; Embryo; Endosperm; Germination; Isolation; Metabolism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344967997

""Nectarial"" is the general term pertaining to nectaries. The very explicit ""nectar-secreting"" should be used instead of ""nectariferous"" to stress clearly the secretory function of cells (not all nectarial cells are nectar-secreting). ""Nectary"" is defined anatomically as a more or less localized, often multicellular glandular structure (some nectaries are unicellular hairs) that occurs on vegetative or reproductive organs and that regularly secretes nectar, a sweet solution containing mainly sugars and generally serving as a reward for pollinators or for protectors (e.g., ants) against herbivores, or, in carnivorous plants, as a lure for animal prey. It seems preferable for general use to adopt Caspary's (1848) ""floral/ extrafloral"" terminology of nectaries based on structure rather than Delpino's (1873) ""nuptial/extranuptial"" terminology based on function, unless there is clear evidence for the latter. All nectaries in the flower should be regarded as ""floral,"" a designation counter to the ""extrafloral"" one commonly used for many nectaries abaxially located on sepals and petals. Furthermore, from a topographical viewpoint, the term ""reproductive nectaries"" is proposed for those nectaries present on any type of reproductive structure, whether inflorescence part, peduncle/pedicel, bract/ bracteole, fruit, ovule (in gymnosperms), and, of course, any floral part.

Eupomatia laurina and E. benettii differ in DNA and constitutive heterochromatin (hc) quantity; their evolution from high to low DNA content probably corresponds to general progressions in Magnoliidae. Austrobaileya has nuclei of the presumably primitive ""Tetrameranthus type"" which is closely related to that of Galbulimima and several other primitive taxa in Magnoliidae. Karyomorphology and other characters support the maintainance of two main branches within the Magnoliidae, Laurales and Magnoliales, with Austrobaileya probably intermediate; the Winteraceae appear more remote.-In Annonaceae the reestablishment of Ancana is underlined by its chromosome number (2n = 18) the unexpected and specialized disulcate pollen, and various morphological characters which point to a close alliance with the Australian endemic genera Fitzalania and Haplostichanthus (also disulcate) and the American genus pair Sapranthus/Desmopsis; they are united in the provisional Sapranthus tribe, with a more distant position to Fissistigma s. str.

To achieve this breeding goal, it is essential that the program use a stability technique that will identify high-yielding, stable genotypes accurately in international trials conducted under different environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to compare a spatial method with a modified conventional regression analysis method to determine the yield stability of 27 CIMMYT maize varieties evaluated at 37 locations. The methods also were compared on the basis of their consistency in assessing the stability of varieties when certain locations were omitted, and when subsets of varieties were analyzed. The varieties found to be stable by the spatial method with all sites included in the analysis were also stable (1) when the lowest and highest yielding sites were excluded from the analyses, and (2) when the varieties were considered, along with others, as a subset of the original group of materials. Stability parameters determined by regression analysis, however, varied for some varieties when (1) extreme sites were excluded, and (2) a subset of entries was considered in isolation. Because the spatial method was more consistent in identifying high-yielding stable varieties, it was considered the more useful of the two methods. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Principal coordinates analysis; Regression analysis; Selection; Zea mays L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000084944

Genomic clones encoding the ?? and ? subunit genes were ligated together in intermediate plasmids, either in direct orientation (? ?) or in divergent orientation (? ?). In the latter instance the transcriptional promoters of the two genes were approximately 2.0 kb apart. The DNAs were introduced into leaf disks of Petunia hybrida on a disarmed Ti plasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and transgenic plants were regenerated. Expression of the introduced genes, limited to specific stages in developing seeds, was analyzed by quantitating the accumulated mRNA and protein, and compared with expression in transgenic plants that contained either gene alone. Development time course studies showed that the ?? subunit mRNA and protein were first detected at 10 days after pollination while accumulation of the ? subunit protein ensued at day 14 regardless of the orientation of the two genes. The temporally regulated expression of these two genes in transgenic plants mimics their temporal regulation during soybean embryo development. In transgenic plants that contain the ?? and ? genes in divergent orientation, expression of the ? gene was enhanced several-fold, while the expression of the ?? gene was slightly decreased. These results suggest that (i) sequences of the ?? gene enhance the level of expression of a nearby storage protein gene and that (ii) the signal(s) operating in the temporal regulation of seed storage protein genes is (are) common to soybean and petunia, and are different from those that govern the final amounts of mRNA and protein. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",embryo specific genes; enhanced expression; seed storage protein; soybean; temporal regulation; transgenic petunia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000578844

The latter demonstrated a shift to xenogamy and outbreeding in larger plants. Light intensity indirectly influenced reproductive modes through its infuence on plant size.

In the parental asynaptic plants, the majority of pollen grains revealed a very low fertility which varied slightly among clonal plants and years, the average value being 5.50%. The seed setting rate was vely low, the average value being 1,8% in 1969, and 1.2% in 1970. Some of the seeds germinated in the following spring. Thus, asynaptic plants were capable of sexually producing a few progenies. They have also produced on the average 16.7 bulblets during ten years. As for the progeny plants with various chromosome numbers, the pollen fertility was greatly variable among plants, from 10.3 to 96.0%. The seed setting rate and germination rate were considerably variable among progeny plants, and were, as a whole, lower than those of the normal amphidiploid plants, similar to the case of pollen fertility. All progeny plants reproduced also vegetatively during 16 or 17 years. © 1988, The Genetics Society of Japan. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995999273

Ant species included Atta texana which cultures fungi by means of various types of secretions. The frequency of grains showing membrane dysfunction, and therefore reduced viability, was quantified by means of a fluorochromatic test. Comparisons of treated and control samples showed that in 46 out of 50 bioassays there was a reduction in pollen viability following exposure to ants, 38 being statistically significant. Variation in the outcome of bioassays showed differential potency among ant species and differential vulnerability among pollen types. Ant pollination may be uncommon because surface secretions, often from the metapleural glands, cause membrane dysfunction in pollen. Ant species without metapleural glands may be pollinators, but ant pollinated plants may have pollen resistant to the secretion. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Ant; Antibiotic; Atta; Membrane; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024187144

Tubes grown in distilled water (pH 6) showed the highest fluorescence in a subapical region that tapered basally into a fluorescent strand centrally located in the tube and extending back towards the pollen grain. The apical cap had low fluorescence as did the cytoplasm surrounding the fluorescent strand, the tube base and the pollen grain. Tubes grown in different pond waters (pH 8) revealed no intracellular CTC fluorescence. Instead there was an external fluorescence forming a distinct layer around the whole tube, frequently enhanced in a subapical region to form an external collar. Modification of the patterns of fluorescence could be induced by manipulation pH of the growth media and content of specific ions. For example tubes grown in distilled water with 10-3 M Mg2+ salts showed a similar CTC fluorescence as those grown in pond water. In contrast, Ca2+ enrichment had no visible influence on the patterns of fluorescence. The pattern of fluorescence displayed by tubes grown in distilled water, could be reproduced in pond water if the pH was artificially reduced to pH 6. Ultrastructurally, there was no detectable difference in the markedly polar distribution of organelles between pollen tubes grown in the various growth media. The secretory vesicles found in the pollen grain prior to germination become distributed throughout the pollen tube but are least concentrated in regions that show highest internal CTC fluorescence. These regions appear to have large amounts of endoplasmic reticulum and include mitochondria. These results are discussed in relation to the significance of calcium gradients for tip growth and limitations in the use of CTC. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Calcium distribution; CTC fluorescence; Najas pollen; Tip growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0005109336

The generative cell, bounded by its own plasma membrane and the inner plasma membrane of the vegetative cell, possesses the cytoplasmic extension which lies within the embayments of a vegetative nucleus. The generative cell contains the normal complement of organelles and, especially, microtubules which cluster into several groups adjacent to the plasma membrane, oriented along the longitudinal axis of the cell. In the pollen tube reaching the lower end of the style after semivivo pollination, both of the sperm cells are elongated and polyribosomes and microtubules are the outstanding feature in the cytoplasm. The two sperm cells are connected by a common transverse cell wall, while cytoplasmic channels exist in both the periplasm of the two sperm cells and the transverse wall. The leading sperm cell (Svn) is closely associated with the vegetative nucleus. Thus the present study demonstrates the existence of the male germ unit in the pollen tube of C. betacea.

Floral color, floral form, total dissolved solids in floral nectar, and polinator behavior on flowers of Japanese species are similar to those of North American species. Blooming phenology of Japanese species also corresponds to the North American sequence of long?tongued, nectar?foraging queen bumblebees (Bombus Latr.) pollinating nectariferous, earlier?blooming species nototribically and short?tongued, pollen?foraging workers pollinating nectarless, rostrate flowers of later?blooming ones sternotribically. Electrofocus analysis of peroxidase systems in two Japanese species indicated considerable intrapopulational heterozygosity. Nectar component analysis of two transboreal species indicated intraspecific differences in kinds of sugars between widely disjunct Japanese and North American populations. A tentative conclusion is that the Japanese and North American Pedicularis floras have evolved in a parallel manner from Himalayan migrants, while their transboreal elements are in process of vicariant diversification.

Pollination is achieved by bumblebees, with varying tongue lengths, collecting pollen and/or nectar. Long- and medium-tongued workers pollinate the flower nototribically (head-thorax pollination) and pollen-collecting short-tongued bumblebees sternotribically (venter pollination). Short-tongued bumblebees collect neactar by robbing the flowers, sometimes also destroying the pistil. Nectar was present in a volume of 0.26 ?l, with a sugar concentration of 30% and a ratio of fructose:glucose:sucrose = 1:0.67:0.73. M. arvense is self-fertile. Increasing pollination intensity increased fruiting, although after 3 pollinations fruiting did not increase and number of seeds per fruit did. During a low visitation intensity, flowers were visited at least 6.7 times during the flower's life span (7 days), and at a high visitation intensity 39.3 times. The additional effect on the seed set of one-hand pollination during the flower's lifetime was low. Plants in low-density plots are highly branched in contrast to plants in high density. Branching of plants, resulting in more flowers per plant, and the fact that flowers on branches produce more seeds per flower, influence total seed production per plant. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024234058

Size-dependent fitness achieved per open flower was estimated from pollinator visitation rates, amount of pollen exported and pollen deposited. On average, rate of bee arrival on LARGE (88±7.9 SE arrivals/hr) was 1.5 times that of SMALL (59±5.5), and bees visited 1.3 times as many flowers before they left (LARGE: 4.3±0.2; SMALL: 3.2±0.1).

Both pollen export and pollen deposition were similar for the 2 size groups. For single flowers male function (pollen donation) and female function (pollen receipt) are thus both independent of inflorescence size, but flowers on LARGE inflorescences are visited by a larger number of individually different bees than flowers on SMALL, suggesting a higher diversity of mates for the flower of LARGE. On LARGE inflorescences bees were also less likely to move directly from male to female flowers. With pollen carryover, however, this latter advantage may be counterbalanced by the generally longer visitation sequences on LARGE (4.3±0.2 flowers/inflorescence/bee; SMALL: 3.2±0.1), leading to a similar proportion of female flowers (incorrectly) visited after a visit to a male (LARGE: 67.6%; SMALL: 61.6%). -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024219853

Plants in natural populations flower synchronously, producing a massive display. Osmophores scattered over the perianth produce a strong, sweet scent in sunny weather. Nectar-seeking insects are guided to the central, reproductive area of the flower by the colour gradation of the perianth, including an area of high U.V. reflection near the centre, and a bright yellow ridge along the labellum. A tube formed by the labellum and column directs the potential pollinators. The flower, however, produces no nectar. Flowers vary in size within the six recognised varieties of D. speciosum and are pollinated when visited by bees of appropriate size. Post-pollination closure of flowers prevents further access by potential pollinators. The dendrobium beetle and larvae feed on the plant and inflorescences and play no part in pollination. The low fruit set, characteristic of this species, is considered to be a combined result of self-infertility and the absence of rewards offered by the flower. The specific climatic conditions during which pollinators visit the flowers are also important. The attraction and pollination mechanisms are similar among all observed varieties of D. speciosum as well as some closely related species, possibly explaining the high occurrence of hybrids within this group. It is concluded that D. speciosum provides a visual and olfactory display through the production of a large number of hermaphrodite non-rewarding flowers on each inflorescence, and relies on infrequent outcrosses for successful pollination. © 1988, CSIRO.

The density of flowers over the season can be described as curvilinear. The mean number of flowers per raceme decreased significantly over the season. The rate of foraging by pollinator species from flower to flower varied and is described by multiple regression models. Julian date, hour of day, and flower density are the independent variables.

The bees foraged on sainfoin for about 12 h per day and average bee density increased significantly with the corresponding flower density. A theoretical approach used to predict the bee populations required to pollinate varying flower densities shows that the required population of bumble bees is about two-thirds that of honey bees or alfalfa leafcutter bees.

In terms of relative species richness, hymenopterans are generally the dominant pollinators in lowland communities, but yield dominance at higher elevations to lepidopterans or, more often, to dipterans, which usually dominate the pollinator fauna at the highest elevations. Coleopterans are seldom of major significance as pollinators and generally decline in relative species richness as elevation increases. The observed trends for hymenopterans, dipterans and coleopterans have analogous counterparts among foliage insects, suggesting that the distributional patterns are a consequence of life history and thermoregulatory factors rather than selective pressures exerted by changes in flower structure along an elevational gradient. A lack of a generalized distribution pattern among lepidopteran pollinators may indicate that the thermoregulatory factors are less important in determining the elevational distribution of that taxon. -Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024248895

An average of 5.3 species flowered in each of 13, 2 m×2 m montane plots and 5.6 species in the 13 alpine plots. The maximum number in flower simultaneously averaged 4.1 species in the montane and 3.3 in the alpine plots; flowering peaked in mid?January, Corolla tube lengths of the flora averaged 1.73 mm. The most common floral colour was white or predominantly white (40 species), followed by yellow (14 species). Only six of the 38 species (16%) examined had some type of reflectance pattern; the remaining species all absobed ultraviolet. Flies appeared to be the major pollinators. The insects collected in the study area comprised 60 species of Diptera, 33 species of Hymenoptera, and several species each of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera. On average, 14.4% of flowers watched during 379 observation periods (10 min each) were visited. On average, each plant species was visited by 6.4 species of flies, 2.4 species of bees, wasps or sawflies, one species of butterfly or moth and 0.3 species of beetles. Visitation rates increased over the growing season, and were significantly affected by ambient temperature (positively), light levels (positively) and wind speed (negatively). The maximum proboscis length for the 25 most common species of bees was 2.76 mm, but 18 of 51 species of flies had proboscis lengths longer than this. The mean proboscis length for all 25 species of bees was 1.68 mm, and for 51 species of flies was 2.31 mm. Proboscis lengths for flies were positively correlated with the average corolla length for the plant species they visited. For bees, however, the range in proboscis lengths was relatively small and did not show this pattern. There appear to be significant differences between the plant?pollinator community of alpine Australia and other alpine areas where bumblebees are common pollinators. These differences include shorter proboscis and corolla tube lengths, and perhaps an increased diversity and significance of flies as pollinators. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

Visitation rates by bumble bees, the principal pollinators, were then observed. In the reward-variation experiments, bees appeared to learn the positions of nectar-rich shoots, and visited them significantly more often than nectar-poor shoots. They did not respond to similar variation in pollen production. The nectar preferences developed slowly after the treatments were imposed, and bees continued to favor sites that had been occupied by nectar-rich shoots even after the treatments were discontinued. Visitation rate was approximately proportional to flower number, making it unlikely that increases in inflorescence size produced a disproportionate gain in male reproductive success (a necessary condition in certain models for the evolution of dioecy). For a fixed number of flowers per inflorescence, bees preferred inflorescences with more umbels. In pairwise choice tests of male-phase and female-phase umbels of various sizes, bees preferred male-phase umbels and larger umbels; the preference for male-phase umbels is stronger in bees that had previously fed on male-phase umbels. © 1988 Chapman and Hall Ltd.",Aralia hispida; Bombus; choice experiments; dioecy; inflorescence size; nectar; pollen; pollination; pollinator visitation rate; selective foraging; trapline,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024233636

Lavandula latifolia is pollinated there by nearly 85 species of comparatively long?tongued Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. The diversity, composition and abundance of pollinators varied markedly between years. Lepidopteran taxa prevailed numerically in one year, hymenopterans in four years, and both groups had similar abundance in the remaining year. The vast majority of pollinators exhibited significant annual differences in average abundance. Only 35.7% of taxa were recorded in all of the six study years. The pollinator assemblage had marked seasonal dynamics. Important changes in species richness, abundance and composition took place over the flowering season of L. latifolia (nearly 3 months). Only 21.7% of insect taxa occurred throughout the flowering season. Lavandula latifolia populations at different distances from water courses differed broadly in the abundance and composition of pollinators. Hymenopterans dominated numerically at the water?distant sites, whereas lepidopterans prevailed in populations growing in the vicinity of streams. Only 40.7% of taxa were recorded at all of the four study populations. Within the same plant population, horizontal distances of the order of 25 m resulted in significant changes in pollinator composition. Variations at the four scales considered combine to produce, from the viewpoint of L. latifolia, a spatio?temporal mosaic of pollinators. As these differ broadly in frequency of pollen transfer, size of pollen loads deposited, and between?flower flight distance patterns, spatio?temporal variation will predictably result in inconsistent or contradictory selective pressures on the plant, thus hindering specialization in relation to particular pollinators.

Bird visits to yellow or red heads are essentially determined by the availability of nectar in each rather than differences in their visibility. Fruit set is negligible in the absence of pollinators but still < 1% in their presence. Banksia ilicifolia has the smallest heads and is the most localized of five co?occurring and partly co?flowering Banksia species.

The receptive stigma emerges from the perianth before the opening of the perianth, and anther dehiscence is late about two days for perianth opening. The flower therefore is protogynous even though no insects visit the unopen flowers. Receptivity of the stigma is maintained for about 8 days, and even the 10 day?old flower can produce seeds. Self?pollination may be rather common in H. orientalis, which is self?compatible, in particular in the flowers which open on days unfavorable for insect activity. Many species of Diptera and Hymenoptera forage on the flowers, and almost any insect can be their pollinator.

In particular, the rate of saturation should be determined largely by the height of a plant because, other factors being equal, pollen-flight distances (and thus access to mates) are dependent on the height of the pollen-emitting source. A diminutive plant with a restricted pollen shadow might be able to fertilize most or all of the few available ovules even at low levels of pollen production. Allocation to additional polliniferous flowers would not alter the dispersal range or ovule pool and so would merely increase the local mating competition (LMC) among sib pollen. In contrast, a taller individual should experience reduced LMC and have a less saturating male-fitness curve, due to wider dispsersal of its pollen. Thus, contrary to the traditional expectation of greater female effort in larger plants, larger wind-pollinated plants should have relatively greater male investment. Data on the tropical monoecious grass, teosinte (Zea spp.) support this hypothesis. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024257376

The relative attractive (competitive) abilities were predicted by an index based on average daily sucrose production per flower × local floral density as: Ilex opaca ? Kalmia latifolia ? Gaylussacia frondosa ? K. angustifolia. Bumble bees rarely visited the less attractive species during flowering overlap in 3 of 4yr. Competitive avoidance was achieved by having traits that confer tolerance of rare pollinator visits (eg long-lived flowers or self-pollination) or by having diverse pollination assemblages (small bees and bumble bees). K. latifolia was the only shrub specialized for pollination (by bumble bees); this specialization increased the risk of pollination limitation because K. latifolia was a poorer competitor for bumble bees than Ilex. Pollination limitation was prevented or reduced by the extented longevity of unpollinated flowers. Flowers could remain viable ?2 wk until Ilex ceased flowering and bumble bees switched to K. latifolia. K. angustifolia, the poorest competitor, was visited by many species of small bees and could also self-pollinate. Gaylussacia lacked these traits, and was pollination limited: flowers are short-lived and cannot self-pollinate. For this species small bees were important in maintaining fruit set when bumble bees switched to more attractive species. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024229473

Temporal pollination limitation was indicated. Late seed set per flower was not increased by adding nutrients. Late-produced seeds germinated less well than early ones, with a success similar to self-fertilized seeds, suggesting a higher proportion of self-pollination among late-produced seeds. Pollen deposition on receptive stigmas was highest during the 1st half of the flowering season, with the pollen to ovule ratio highest after c1 wk of flowering. Stigmas of bagged flowers commonly bore some self-pollen grains despite protandry. Both standing crop per flower and sugar content of nectar changed over the course of the season. A few long-tongued bumblebee queens made most visits to V. vulgaris. Bumblebees deposited up to 500 conspecific pollen grains on a stigma during single visits, but they abandoned V. vulgaris prior to its flowering peak because more rewarding species began to flower.

The flower with subtending scales is the only part of the plant external to the host and is produced solitary on roots (rarely stems) of the genus Tetrastigma (Vitaceae). Studies were made of the pollination process in R. pricei, endemic to the Crocker Range in the Malaysian state of Sabah (N Borneo). Pollination is mediated by carrion (bluebottle) flies of the genera Lucilia and Chrysomya. Both visual and olfactory cues are important in attracting flies to flowers. Flies (mostly female L. papuensis) obtain loads of the viscous liquid pollen matrix by visiting male flowers and entering anther grooves on the central column of the flower, precisely guided by ridges armed with hairs that force the fly into a position in which the pollen is positioned on the dorsal part of the thorax. Pollen-loaded flies visiting female flowers may enter the infradiscoidal sulcus and become wedged in so tightly that pollen is rubbed off the thorax onto the stigma. Only large flies could be effective in picking up pollen from male flowers and transferring it to female flowers. The pollination syndrome is sapromyophily, in which the flower closely parallels trap flowers of several other plant families, although it is not a trap. The flower deceives pollinators by an apparent offering of food and possibly brood place. Rafflesia is extremely rare, perhaps in part because of infrequency of pollination, which requires neighboring male and female flowers simultaneously in bloom. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024189127

Flowering encompassed the whole year, as did insect visits to flowers. Distinct seasonal changes, however, in both number and identity of insect taxa, and in number of plant species in bloom were apparent: maximum plant and insect richness occurred in spring. Insect visitors mainly included small beetles, honeybees, small halictid bees, syrphids and bombylids. The overall species richness of the pollinator array was very high (187 taxa). Plant species with specialized pollination mechanisms were relatively infrequent. Most plants had non-restrictive or small flowers, or both. Species relying on pollen to attract pollinators outweighed those relying on nectar as the main reward. Species flowering at about the same time of year tend to have their flowers visited by the same insects, irrespective of floral features. Fruit set is probably more resource- than pollen-limited. To achieve maximum fruit set most plants have unspecialized pollination relationships. The generalized nature of pollination systems may have been a major factor contributing to the survival and weedy behaviour of many Mediterranean scrub species. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024194328

Phyllodes with axillary racemes or phyllodes towards the tips of branches were more likely to have nectar secretions than phyllodes without axillary racemes or away from the tips of branches. Although most phyllodes were damaged by herbivores to some extent, this damage had occurred prior to the secretion of extrafloral nectar in winter. Further damage to phyllodes was negligible during winter. A variety of birds, including silvereyes and several species of honeyeaters and thornbills, consumed extrafloral nectar and in the process brushed against inflorescences. The activity of these birds in Acacia pycnantha, relative to their use of other plants, increased during the period of nectar secretion. When birds were excluded from flowering branches by mesh, pod production was significantly reduced. Natural rates of pod production were low and variable.

We conclude that the presence of an adequate population of honeybees increases the proportion of well shaped (marketable) berries. © 1988 CSIRO.

Growth cessation occurred earlier and bud break later in the material from the high night temperature regime. There was no effect of population in the thermo? or photoperiodic experiments. This might be attributed to the southern origin of the two populations. The effect of family variation within populations was always larger than the population effect, but only significant for two growth rhythm characters and for plant height in the photoperiodic experiment.

Day visitors were two hummingbird species which do not pollinate the flowers. Most Brazilian Helicteres species have red flowers with a long androgynophore.

The behaviour of nectar?collecting Bombus hypocrita sapporensis Cockerell queens was observed on a population of a spring ephemeral plant Corydalis ambigua Cham, et Schlecht. Daily patterns of activity and behaviour changed with the progress of flowering. Activity peaked shortly before sunset early in the flowering season but approximately at noon towards the end of flowering. In the peak flowering period the queens tended to visit nearby plants and to change direction often, whereas early or late in the flowering period they flew further between visits and were less likely to change direction. Each plant was visited 0 to 24 times (mean 9.4 ±SD 5.2) by the queens during the whole flowering season. The queens collected nectar, rarely through the front of the flowers but mostly through the spurs perforated by themselves or predecessors. At the beginning of the flowering season the illegitimate foragers often visited the front of the flowers before moving to the spurs; later, most queens quickly learned to land directly on the spurs. Even the 59.7% of plants that were visited only by illegitimate foragers set seeds. Close observation confirmed that the illegitimate foragers opened the inner petals enclosing anthers and stigma frequently when visiting the front of the flowers before robbing, or occasionally when walking about on the flowers or collecting nectar through the perforated spurs.

Measurement of the thickness of the major components of this wall has demonstrated a significant difference in cuticle thickness between the two S (incompatibility) genotypes under study. It is suggested that cuticle thickness is responsible for differences observed in the rates of pollen hydration on the stigma surface. The relevance of tins finding to the genetical control of pseudocompatibility is discussed. Unusually, the pectocellulosic component of the papillar cell wall is composed of three layers. On pollination, the outer layer detaches to permit the elongating pollen tube to pass down the papilla within the wall itself. At the base of the papilla, the tube becomes truly extracellular, growing down in the intercellular spaces between stylar parenchyma cells. Following a bud pollination, the pollen tube may even penetrate the complete cell wall and grow down the length of the cell, invested on one side by the plasma membrane and on the other by the inner face of the pectocellulosic wall. These tubes experience some difficulty in traversing the cell wall at the base of the papillar prior to entering the intercellular spaces of the style. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

Flowering and fruit set were affected not only by the environmental conditions during flowering, but also by vegetative flushing of the tree. Flowering was closely associated with vegetative flushing. The level of natural fruit set under controlled-environment conditions, irrespective of temperature or humidity, was low (<3.1%) compared to field or container-grown trees flowering under ambient conditions (11 and 28%, respectively). The increased set under ambient conditions appears to be due to the presence of insect pollinators, in particular Nitidulid beetles which were observed in the flowers. High VPD (1.2 kPa) severely reduced both flowering and fruit set. Soil moisture stress (mid-day leaf water potential -2.0 MPa) also reduced flowering and fruit set, particularly at high temperature (28°C). Hand-pollination of flowers, even under high VPD conditions, resulted in a significantly higher set (>20%). Productivity of custard apple in the field may be improved by cultural techniques such as overhead misting, windbreaks and efficient irrigation scheduling. © 1988.",custard apple; hand pollination; moisture stress; vapour pressure deficit,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249030776

Fruit drop accentuated by shading treatment indicates that reduced incident solar radiation by overcast weather in the post-bloom period could be a major hindrance to the set. High leaves-to-panicle ratio was found to be needed for a normal set. Shading reduced photosynthesis but also enhanced the abscisic acid levels in the fruits. The abscisic acid levels were positively correlated with abscission, regardless of whether it was caused by non-pollination or by shading.

Seeds within one pod differ in size, the heaviest seeds contained the largest number of cells. It depended on the initial size and number of cells, how long cotyledons could be grown in vitro on a medium without growth hormones. Cotyledons did not grow for longer than 21 days at 16°C. During that period, starch and protein were synthesized. Whole seeds in vitro showed only limited increase in mass of fresh and dry matter. Removal of the seed-coat facilitated seed growth. The initial growth rate of cotyledons was higher than on intact plants but declined after 4 days in culture. Increase in temperature caused an increase in rate of accumulation of dry matter. The optimum temperature was about 28°C. Higher temperature shortened the duration of growth and had no effect on number of cells, nor on starch and protein contents. With the medium used (without growth regulators), cotyledons could be grown in vitro for only a limited period of time.

The following trends, with successional age, were recorded: leaf life expectancy increased, the amount of biomass allocated to reproduction fell, as did the ratio of flowering to reproductive structures in the herb layer, average germinule size increased and seedling survival fell. The flowering structures of dicotyledons were predominantly hermaphrodite in the field seral stages, but monoecious in the woodland trees; dioecious plants were relatively rare. The early successional plants were often self-pollinated, a mechanism characteristic of few of the plant species found in the other seral stages. Insect pollination was the most frequent mechanism in the forbs of the old field and wind for the woodland trees. The seed bank closely predicted the composition of the early successional flora. The pattern of succession in these sites would seem to conform most closely to the initial floristic composition model of Egler (1954) with a tolerant stage followed by an inhibitory stage, the latter in the old field. Here the conditions provided by the thick grass vegetation maintain large populations of small mammals and molluscs that increase the mortality of seedlings, including tree seedlings, and so retard the rate of succession.

(2) Although there was not a pronounced seasonal pattern of leafing activity, more species produced new leaves in the dry season. Species that flush large quantities of new leaves do so more commonly in the drier months. Leaf loss was gradual and unobtrusive in species observed. (3) Flowering activity was greatest in the late dry season and early wet season. Most species exhibited extended flowering; only 15% of the species were massively flowering. Massive flowerers showed less seasonality than extended flowerers. (4) Of the species studied, the majority had relatively unspecialized flowers which were visited by a variety of insects; small bee-pollination was the next most common, followed by hummingbird, beetle, settling moth, sphingid, butterfly, large bee and fly pollination (the pollination system of 18 species was unknown). Hummingbird pollinated species showed little seasonality of flowering when compared with species exhibiting small moth, and beetle pollination syndromes, as well as those with unspecialized flowers. (5) The vast majority of species studied have fleshy fruits (sarcochores). Fruiting activity was less markedly seasonal than flowering. Species with fruit are more numerous in the second half of the year (the wet season and early dry season). The second year of the study saw substantially fewer species in fruit than the first year; this is attributed to the greater than usual rainfall and inclement weather during the peak flowering season. (6) Cloud forest shrub and treelet phenology is compared with patterns of other forests that have been studied. In general, the greater the rainfall, the less seasonality of flowering and fruiting is seen. Although Monteverde is very wet, rainfall is intermediate between that of lowland dry and lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. Seasonality of flowering and fruiting at Monteverde is more pronounced than at La Selva (wet) and less obvious than in Guanacaste (dry). © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

In vitro pollination-fertilization procedures were used to expose various components of the reproductive process to elevated temperature. Fertilization percentage, as estimated by ovary swelling, and the percentage of kernel formation was measured. Heat stress during the stages of pollen shed, silk receptivity, pollen-stigma interaction, and/or early kernel formation adversely affected reproductive development. Fertilization per se appeared to be less sensitive to thermal stress than was kernel formation. The most sensitive stages appeared to be during pollen-stigma interaction and early kernel development. Differences between the two genotypes used in this study were expressed at the pollen and silk level. Exposure of LH74 tassels and/or silks to heat stress resulted in a significant reduction in kernel formation when compared to the nonstressed controls. Kernel formation frequency was not significantly reduced when Mo17 tassels or silks were exposed to heat stress prior to pollination. However, both genotypes were sensitive to elevated temperature during the pollen-stigma interaction and early kernel formation stages. The results from this study suggest that the development of heat stress tolerant germplasm would require reduced sensitivity not only during pollen shed and silk receptivity stages but also during pollen function and early kernel formation. © 1988, Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart.

Flowering phenologies were significantly aggregated and average overlap per species was >1.0. Ten species flowered during June and early July; only 1 species flowered in late July-August. When this last species was excluded and a shorter flowering season was used in the analyses, flowering was significantly aggregated in 3 of the 5 yr and significantly less than random in 2 yr. Observed overlaps were always much greater than those calculated from an even dispersion of flowering times. Flowering sequences of species were highly correlated among years so consistent interactions were possible. The lack of July flowering is perplexing, especially as this could decrease flowering overlap. The shrubs seemed likely to compete for pollination because most species overlapped in flowering, depended upon insect pollinators for seed set and shared bumblebees or small, solitary bees. If the species were divided into these 2 major pollination guilds, flowering remained either aggregated or random in different years and average overlap per species was high (0.5-0.9). Of the 6 congeneric species pairs, only 2 pairs had little overlap (<0.1), 3 had high overlap (0.5-0.9), and 1 was intermediate (0.1-0.2). Competition for pollination seemed likely and pollination limitation of fruit set was detected in 4 of the species; however, pollination limitation could be attributed to interspecific competition in only one species. The high overlap in flowering and pollinator use can be maintained because current competition for pollination is rare or mild. Although competition is generally assumed to select for divergence and specialization in resource use, avoidance of competition by these shrubs was achieved by 3 major characteristics: self-pollination, long-lived flowers and diverse pollinator assemblages. Divergence in time and specialization for pollinators increased, rather than decreased, the risk of pollination limitation. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024179569

Kernels from XL-12 were examined 3, 12 and 15 days after pollination. The general trend in the hormone profiles of XL-12 corn kernels was one of rapid accumulation of growth promoting hormones, auxins and cytokinins, and a decline of growth inhibiting hormones, abscisic acid (ABA) and ABA-ester(s). For all three varieties, the auxin accumulation (free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and esterified IAA) was by far the most pronounced change among the hormone groups observed. A188 corn kernels containing 1-mm embryos (12 days after pollination) had 20-fold less auxin than Missouri-17 kernels containing 0.8-mm embryos (15 days after pollination) and 16-fold less auxin than XL-12 kernels containing 0.5-mm embryos (15 days after pollination). Since literature reports have correlated corn embryo size with the ability of embryo derived callus to regenerate in culture, it is hypothesized that endogenous kernel auxin levels may be a major regulatory hormone component of corn embryo callus regeneration.

The concentration of copper, iron, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur and zinc in the flesh (seeds inclusive) declined sharply during the first 8 weeks of growth, reaching values which remained relatively constant, or declined only gradually, until harvest. For boron, calcium, magnesium and manganese flesh concentrations declined steadily throughout the season. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the flesh were generally higher, and those of calcium manganese and zinc consistently lower, than corresponding concentrations in skin over the entire maturation period (23 weeks). Flesh concentrations of copper, iron, magnesium and sulphur exceeded those in the skin but only during the early stages of fruit development (up to 11 weeks after pollination). Boron concentrations in flesh and skin were similar during the season. The quantity of all nutrients increased throughout the season to be at a maximum by harvest The rate of accumulation of each element was greatest during the first 8 weeks of growth corresponding to the cell division phase of fruit development. There was 6175% of the total calcium, manganese and zinc content taken up during this time, compared with 3754% of the content of other nutrients.

During 1981 and 1982, flowering in P. arieianum was a mixture of 1) highly synchronized peaks in which most plants flowered and most of their inflorescences flowered; and 2) more extended flowering during which few plants flowered and few of their inflorescences flowered. Probability of fruit set was greater for large plants and for plants that flowered in synchrony with other plants than for small plants and plants that did not flower in synchrony with the rest of the population. The species is mostly self-incompatible, a possible explanation for the decrease in fruit set when fewer plants were flowering, but synchronization per se did not necessarily lead to high fruit set, suggesting that certain times of the year are better for flowering than others. In general, flowering was more prevalent in February and from September-October, when rainfall is predictably the lowest and pollinator services are more reliable. The primary flowering peak (February) accounted for 64% of total inflorescence and 62% of total infructescence production in 1981, and 50% of total inflorescence and 76% of total infructescence production in 1982. Fruits of individual plants from a single flowering period were dispersed over 2-4 mo. Time from flowering to final infructescence maturation was 5-9 mo. Large fruit crops and fruit set more than once per year resulted in a longer time period over which infructescences were presented to dispersers than did small fruit crops and fruit set only once per year. Predispersal seed predators were abundant following the major flowering peaks but not the minor flowering peaks, suggesting that off-peak fruit production can lead to escape from seed predators. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024260566

Induction is caused by a drop of c2°C or more in minimum nighttime temperature for ?3 nights. This extraordinary trigger is probably the most reliable signal associated with an invasion of the aseasonal tropics by a dry air mass. Such a trigger does not appear to be directly adaptive in the aseasonal tropics, but in the seasonal tropics it would result in flowering at the onset of dry season and ripening fruits at the beginning of rainy season. This suggests that the Dipterocarpaceae may be have arisen initially in the seasonal tropics, even though their center of species diversity is now in the aseasonal tropics. Invasion of the aseasonal tropics by having such a floral trigger, adapted to the seasonal tropics, could help explain the origin of a phenological core of species flowering and fruiting more or less synchronously at intervals of several years. The droughts causing these mass flowerings may, in some cases, be driven by the climatic effects of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the W Pacific, as evidenced by the temporal association of El Nino years with drought and mast fruiting on windward slopes of tropical Malesia. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024228949

Other pigmentation (anthocyanin) patterns also vary within and between these subspecies. We carried out a genetic analysis of differences in floral patterns and petal size. A novel basal petal spot appeared in the F2. The analysis indicated that the novel petal spot was specified by an allele in subsp. gracilis at a locus governing spot position. This allele is not normally expressed in subsp. gracilis because of the action of a modifier gene at a second locus. The study also indicated single factor inheritance for presence versus absence of pigmentation on the hypanthium, stamens, and the lower portion of the petals. Multifactorial inheritance was observed for differences in petal length and width. Most of the possible recombinant floral patterns were recovered in the F2 and F3. This system can be used to study developmental regulation of floral traits as well as ecological relationships between floral pattern and pollination system. The recovery of a normally unexpressed allele for basal petal spot points to the difficulty of extrapolating from phenotypic analysis to an understanding of morphological evolution. © The Genetical Society of Great Britain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966181978

This selection occurs by position-dependent seed abortion and position-dependent resource allocation within fruits, coupled with position-dependent fertilization of ovules by pollen donors. Stressed plants thereby select for pollen donors that sire seeds in the basal and middle, rather than the stylar, thirds of fruits. Position of seeds fathered by pollen donors may thus act as a selective arena. Because of this position-dependent abortion, successful fathers sire the seeds most likely to mature and to be larger than average, but siring these high-quality seeds may reduce the quantity of seeds sired by a donor after mixed pollination because pollen tubes must grown past fertilizable stylar ovules to reach middle and basal ovules, allowing pollen tubes from other donors to sire many seeds in the less favoured positions. Since multiple paternity is common in wild radish fruits, selective seed abortion probably occurs as well. -from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024198207

Pegs are commonly produced in interspecific crosses, but either they fail to reach the soil because growth is arrested, or pods are produced but embryo development is never re-initiated. Peg tips, with the ovule and embryo, of A. hypogaea L. cv. 'NC 6', were used to determine whether peg tips can be used as nurse tissue for in vitro culture of embryos. Tissues were collected 1, 2, 3 and 4 d after self-pollination, after which peg meristems were removed from half the pegs, and cultured on five media combinations. Continued reproductive development was observed for embryos cultured at all four collection days; however, the highest frequency of growth was observed in 1-d-old tissues. Evidence is presented that meristematic activity may restrict embryo growth in the 2- to 4-d-old embryos and, once the sequence of events is initiated to slow embryo growth, it is not easily reversed in vitro.

The source of the colored motes was traced directly to the formation of the ovule fibers and indirectly to ineffective pollination of the cotton plants. Unpollinated ovules produce very fine, long, mature ovule fibers bound to the ovule coat, which is easily crushed, thus yielding the seeds for the formation of motes and probably neps as well. The formation of the green motes is only one example of ovule motes, and the color of some fibers could be traced to a specific variant of a hybrid. The green ovule motes constitute thus only a particular case of general ovule mote formation. Differentiating between the usual motes and the ovule motes is possible on the basis of the appearance and dimensions of the fibers constituting the motes. Better pollination, as suggested, should thus improve the quality of cotton lint. © 1988, SAGE Publications. All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024016087

The specificity of the reaction was checked by using several controls. No final specific reaction product was detected in unpollinated P. deltoides stigmas or in the P. deltoides or P. alba pollen grains used for compatible and incompatible pollinations. In the compatible cross between P. deltoides × P. deltoides, fine dense precipitates were observed in the dictyosomes and the plasma membrane and exterior to the exine of hydrated pollen grains adhering to the stigma surface. Labeling of the stigmatic pellicle was also observed after pollen adhesion and hydration. This was accompanied by a strong reactivity of the cell wall and plasmalemma of the stigma papillae at the sites of pollen tube germination on the stigma surface and at the sites of penetration of pollen tubes between adjacent papillae. In the incompatible cross between P. deltoides x P. alba, adenylate cyclase activity was still present but reduced at the stigma surface following adhesion, hydration, and germination of P. alba pollen. This activity was completely abolished after the penetration of pollen tubes between stigma papillae. These findings suggest that in Populus, adenylate cyclase activity is correlated to pollen adhesion, hydration, and germination at the stigma surface, and that the abolition of this enzyme activity could be one of the cellular events governing the gametophytic phenotype of incompatibility in the cross between P. deltoides and P. alba. © 1988, Springer-Verlag.

This abscission period usually preceded the brief but variably timed period of pollinator arrivals; in most cases every pollinated, undamaged inflorescence set fruit. Fruit abortion would not be expected in plants that evolved under conditions of pollen limitation; although pollinators have been thought to be overabunadnt in highly coevolved pollination mutualisms, figs' unique flowering phenology may in fact make pollen limitation common.

Cultured petioles were collected and fixed daily from one to 25 days after plating. Two regions in the vascular bundle sheath of cultured petioles gave rise to callus. The first region was adjacent to the phloem fibers and produced friable callus. The second region gave rise to compact callus that was connected to the fascicular cambium. Somatic embryos originated from single cells in the cortex directly without intervening callus formation and from single cells in the friable callus. In addition, embryos arose from meristematic regions in compact callus. Many early stages of embryogenesis (one, two and four-celled stages) were observed in the cortex and friable callus. Zygotic embryogenesis in Trifolium differs from other legumes in that the suspensor is short and has a broad attachment. This arrangement was observed in zygotic embryos of T. rubens and in many somatic embryos.

The methods used with inflorescences of a wind?pollinated tree, Populus tremuloides Michx., are reported here. The responses of components of the reproductive system to rain simulants indicated significant (P &lt; 005) overall response of in vivo pollen germination to pH. The combined data demonstrated a significant (P &lt; 005) negative correlation between germination and pH. However, the response in the absence of copper showed no linear correlation because of a recovery at the lowest pH used (26). The effect of simulated rain at the time of pollination was shown to increase fruit abortion significantly. In addition, an overall significant negative correlation was found between fruit abortion and pH, but again in the absence of copper, fruit abortion recovered at the lowest pH (26). Seeds per fruit and percentage of placenta with full seeds were significantly reduced at pH 26 in the presence of 005 mg 1?1 Cu compared with the control. These two seed set parameters were also significantly intercorrelated (P &lt; 0.01) with fruit abortion suggesting that lack of seed set may be the cause of the abortion. The significant correlation of both in vivo pollen germination and fruit abortion with pH, especially in the presence of copper, supports the view that inhibition of the pollen on the stigma by the simulated rain is responsible for the lack of seed set above the required threshold that prevents fruit abortion.

It seems that meiotic irregularities, i.e. lack of bivalent formation, result in the formation of a high percentage of non?viable pollen grains and pollen grains of unequal chromosome number. As demonstrated by the existence of individuals showing seed set, these meiotic irregularities do not lead to total sterility. In a given population, the self?incompatibility of the species and the clonal nature of the population due to its vegetative propagation seem to be a further cause for the sterility observed. The frequency of fertile individuals is comparatively high mainly in Southeast Europe. Probably this area served as a refugium in glacial times. It seems possible that the spread of L. nummularia into northern latitudes resulted in the degeneration of the sexual system. This might have been caused either by the participation of only one or few genotypes spreading mainly vegetatively ? in this situation the frequency of seed set would have decreased due to the self?incompatibility of the species ? or from the absence of a pollinator, also leading to decreased seed set.

Based on the sequences of visits to distylous bluets morphs (pins and thrums), and the time spent by a fly at either morph, Bombylius foraged randomly between morphs. This behaviour was probably a result of both morphs being equally abundant and evenly distributed, and an inability of the flies to distinguish between morphs.

Despite spatial separation, variations in population size (though not density) and reproductive output, no statistically significant difference was detected in outcrossing rates between the populations. Similarly, only slight differences in outcrossing rates were detected within populations when estimates were based on seed collected from flowers open at different times in the flowering season. The earliest flowers tended to have a lower estimated rate of outcrossing. In all cases, multilocus outcrossing rates were high, ranging from 0.81 to 1.05. In all three populations flower production extended over a period of more than 2 months but the majority of seed was produced by flowers that opened during the first third of the (lowering season. This was largely caused by a high rate of flower production during the early part of the season and not changes in the number of seeds set per flower. The average number of seeds produced per flower varied both between individuals within populations, and between the different populations, but neither of these differences were significant. Controlled pollination of flowers with self or outcross pollen, applied either singly or together, failed to detect any differences in the likelihood that either type of pollen would give rise to fertile seeds.

These volatile constituents include hydrocarbons, esters, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and compounds of miscellaneous structure (Schreier 1979). Their determination has been based invariably on juice expressed by maceration of the fruit or its parts and usually by chromatographic analysis of headspace or solvent extracts. Many of these constituents are common to most cultivars, and many are probably the products of hydrolytic andlor oxidative reactions resulting from the disruption of the internal compartmentation of the plant cells. For example, six carbon aldehydes form readily from unsaturated fatty acids under such conditions (Schreier 1979). While some of the volatile constituents of grape juice can therefore be considered products of cellular disorganisation, others are clearly products under genetic control, particularly those compounds associated with specific cultivars. In other biotic systems compounds of this latter group are now known to have important functions not associated directly with primary metabolism and have thus become known as secondary metabolites. Their adaptive value seems to rest with a role in ecological interactions with other plants, animals andlor the physical environment. © 1988, CSIRO.

Characterization of over 1400 nodule isolates on the basis of phage sensitivity revealed totals of 37, 75 and 87 distinct phage types of indigenous K. meliloti from the three soils, respectively. The distributions of phage types differed markedly between soils and on one soil an individual type dominated the nodule population accounting for over 60% of the isolates. The incidence and variety of phage types differed significantly between legume species grown on two of three soils indicating species variation in nodulation preferences for indigenous R. meliloti. Individual plants within each legume species were heterogeneous with respect to preferences for phage types although, overall, the extent of this variation differed between species and appeared related to pollination characteristics. The data indicate that the homologous legume species for a particular soil, irrespective of its pollination characteristics, consistently tended towards greater inter-plant homogeneity of nodulation preferences for indigenous R. meliloti than heterologous species grown on the same soil. On the basis of the evidence presented it is suggested that the legume host is an important factor determining the composition of its associated Rhizobium population.

Once begun to shed pollen, an inflorescence of any of the grasses studied, continued to do so until it ceased to flower, but in Apluda mutica, a high rate of anthesis on one day was followed by a feeble rate the next day. Each of the species a characteristic temporal patterns of pollen release, and no hour of the day was quiescent. Imperata cylindrica and Pennisetum americanum shed pollen without gap through the 24-hr period and all through the inflorescenc life, even if it was rainy. Cynodon dactylon and Perotis sp. flowered twice during a circadian cycle, while the other grasses only once, the majority releasing pollen over a period of 2-7 hr. Duration and intensity of pollen released were inverseley related.Pollen release times of any species were repeatable on fine weather days, and based on the maximal release period ten patterns were recognised. Weather affected the normal pattern, and each species responded differently to variations in weather factors suggesting that anther dehiscence in them might have adapted through a genetic make-up to certain evaporating power of the air. Rain exceptionally promoted anthesis in Sehima nevosum. Nocturnal pollen release seemed peculiar in anemophiles, and its adaptive value is discussed. Staggered flowering during one day and in some species short anthesis of 2-3 hr might function as a reproductive isolating mechanism, and/or as a device to avoid waster of pollen and stigma through unwanted nonsense pollination. © 1988.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023699830

Maekawa was investigated in native populations. The flowers were protogynous, and the stigmas and anthers were distant from one another. These floral characters are significant for cross?pollination, but breeding experiments showed that the flowers are fairly self?compatible and their pollination is obligately dependent upon animal pollen vectors. The most efficient pollinator for H. tamaensis is a fungus gnat, a member of Mycetophylidae. The fungus gnat visited the flowers relatively frequently and often carried many pollen grains on their hairy bodies. Furthermore, their eggs were frequently found within flowers collected from native habitats. The fungus gnats actively moved about within the flowers and often touched the stigmas and anthers with their bodies. Therefore, H. tamaensis seems to be predominantly self?pollinated, though cross?pollination may occur rarely. The presence of fungus gnat eggs in many flowers strengthened Vogel's hypothesis that the flowers of Heterotropa species mimic the basidiomycetes, in which fungus gnats usually oviposit.

It is more common in the primitive subclasses. It is probably more common than heterostyly. Temporal dioecism is strongly associated with monoecism, self-compatibility, many simultaneously receptive stigmas, and less efficient pollen vectors, eg wind, beetles, and flies. In such species, temporal dioecism should increase pollinator efficiency, minimize geitonogamy, and faciltate xenogamy. Because it occurs primarily in self-compatible species and minimizes self-fertilization, it may be an evolutionary alternative to self-incompatibility. There are numerous temporal phenotypes that include many of the possible combinations of protogyny and/or protandry, sequential and/or synchronized flowering, and single or multiple alternations of sexual phases. The simplest phenotype, which results from the sequential opening of the flowers within an inflorescence in monoecious species, is uncommon. The relative lengths of the pistillate and staminate phases result in sex-phase ratios at the population level. Four general associations involving sex-phase ratios, lengths of the 2 phases, and pollen vectors are evident: 1) wind pollination and relatively long sexual phases with slightly pistillate- or staminate-biased sex-phase ratios; 2) nonspecialized insect vectors and strongly staminate-biased ratios; 3) specialized vectors (beetles, moths, and wasps), short phases, and unbiased ratios; and 4) generalist insect vectors, short and repeated sexual phases, and unbiased ratios. -from Author",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024228762

Diploid Chrysanthemum was chosen for this study because accurate counts of the potential number of ovules could be made. Individuals in populations of C. carinatum, C. coronarium, C. c. subsp. spatiosum, and C. segetum were crossed in complete diallels. All species exhibited similar results. Therefore, only the diallel data from C. coronarium subsp. spatiosum were presented. The seed set data with and without ovule counts were processed by SIGMAS, a computer program designed to analyze SI data. Incorporation of the actual number of ovules into seed set diallels provided the most realistic representation of values for self-incompatibility studies. Data derived from equations excluding ovule counts might lead to inaccurate genetic interpretations. Ovule counts were significant between and within genotypes for self (disc and ray florets), but not cross (ray florets only) pollinations. The disc florets in self-pollinations were found to be responsible for increasing the variability in ovule number. The statistics indicate that the disc and ray florets composed two distinct populations. At the diploid level with a single daisy flower type, the disc floret numbers were variable, whereas ray florets were relatively static. This was not the case with polyploid chrysanthemums, where both ovule populations were dynamic and interactive. The conservative nature of percent pseudo-self-compatibility (%PSC) deems it necessary to obtain an accurate measure of female fertility. Values for this could be obtained using a bulk pollination or a tester with unmatched S alleles. © 1988, Springer-Verlag.

Year-round protection is critical to the survival and proper development of trees and vines. Tall windbreaks may cause the microclimate within the orchard to become isolated from the atmosphere above the orchard. This decoupling enhances the orchard microclimate, thus improving conditions for pollination and fruit set which in turn result in greater yields. Reductions in windspeed within the orchard reduce the amount of mechanical damage caused by the whipping of leaves, branches, buds, flowers and fruits. This improves fruit quality and results in substantial economic gain. In addition, windbreaks reduce tree deformation and root breakage in young fruit trees. Proper windbreak design and careful selection of windbreak species will increase flexibility in orchard and vineyard management. Reduced windspeed allows for timely application and efficient use of pesticide. Water management is enhanced owing to more efficient water distribution and reduced evaporation.

Significant family variation was found for diameter at breast height, total tree height, spirality, basic density, percentage fibre tissue, percentage ray tissue, percentage vessel tissue, vessel frequency and fibre length. The respective estimates for broad-sense heritabilities were 0, 30; 0, 45; 0, 61; 0, 45 (0, 54); 0, 30; 0, 25; 0, 14; 0, 31 and 0, 54.

Genetic correlations among traits indicated substantial negative values for diameter at breast height and tree height with basic density and fibre length. Strong positive genetic correlations were also found for diameter at breast height with vessel volume and vessel frequency, and between tree height and fibre volume. Both diameter at breast height and tree height showed a strong negative genetic correlation with ray volume. Apart from significant negative correlations between diameter at breast height and fibre length, and between tree height and ray volume, none of the phenotypic correlations for diameter at breast height and tree height with wood properties which showed some genetic variation, were significant.

Low seed production and cool temperature 2 yr previously and warm temperatures in the summer of seedfall are necessary for occurrence of a mast year. The interaction of seedfall in one year with that 2 yr previously is linked to the long productive development period in rimu and provides an example of competition between overlapping cohorts of reproductive structures in the same plant. Male and female reproductive effort is probably synchronized in rimu, which is dioecious.

Low temperatures during flowering, which can adversely affect pollination, seed development and hence yield, may limit the use of early pruning and cyanamide application, particularly under cooler subtropical conditions. Depending on market prices, any loss of yield associated with early pruning and cyanamide applications will need to be compensated for by higher prices received for earlier maturing fruit. Cyanamide may have greater commercial potential for use on young, vigorous vines growing under warm subtropical conditions.

The present investigation was, therefore, directed to the formation of new cross combinations between radish and rape in order to eliminate the above mentioned problems by additional transfer of corresponding radish genes into the rape recipient. After the initial intergeneric crosses, male sterile hybrids were received by in?vitro embryo culture and colchicine treatment. These hybrids were not backcrossed to rape as usual, but to one of the monogenomic ancestral species of rape, in order to increase the probability of allosyndesis between radish and rape chromosomes. After subsequent back?crossing with rape, the desired male sterile plants with 38 chromosomes were recorded, forming normal green leaves even at low temperatures. In a parallel backcross programme, restorer genes from male fertile radish were also transferred into rape by the same backcrossing procedure.

Its development takes into account data obtained from studies of apomictic?like processes in sexual organisms and in non?apomictic parthenogens, as well as data obtained from studies of generative apomicts. This approach provides insights into the evolution and control of generative apomixis that cannot be obtained from studies of generative apomicts alone. It is argued that the control of the avoidance of meiotic reduction during egg production in generative apomicts resides at a single locus, the identity of which can vary between lineages. This variation accounts for the observed variation between taxa in the pattern of avoidance of meiotic reduction. The affected locus contains a wild?type allele that codes for meiotic reduction and excess copies of a mutant allele that codes for its avoidance. The dominance relationship between these is determined by their ratio and by the environment. Environmental differences between female generative cells and somatic cells are such that the phenotypic expression of the mutant allele is favoured in the former, while that of the wild?type allele is favoured in the latter. This is important, for the locus is also involved in the control of mitosis which would be disrupted by the expression of the mutant allele in somatic cells. The requirement to maintain a viable pattern of growth and development explains why the wild?type allele is retained by generative apomicts, and this in turn explains why the ability to produce meiotically reduced eggs is retained by facultative forms and why it appears to be suppressed in, rather than absent from, obligate forms. The requirement for excess copies of the mutant allele in generative cells explains why generative apomicts are typically polyploid, as this condition provides a simple and effective means of generating the correct balance of mutant and wild?type alleles. Environmental effects can also lead to the dominance relationship between wild?type and mutant alleles varying between generative cells. In plants, this can lead to the apomixis gene being expressed, and thus to meiotic reduction being avoided, in only some ovules. Meiotically reduced, as well as meiotically unreduced, eggs are produced when this occurs. If compatible and viable pollen is available the meiotically reduced eggs may be fertilized, resulting in these organisms reproducing as facultative apomicts. It is argued that the control and evolution of parthenogenesis in generative apomicts varies between taxa. In some, the parthenogenetic initiation of embryos may result from the acquisition of a parthenogenesis gene or genes; but there is no reason to believe that this is either a general or a common requirement. Indeed, in some it may be an ancestral trait, these apomicts differing from their sexual ancestors in the ability to mature, rather than in the ability to initiate, embryos from unfertilized eggs; or it may result from physiological or developmental changes induced, for example, by polyploidization, hybridization, or the avoidance of meiotic reduction. In some plants it may be induced by pollination (without fertilization) or by the activity of a developing endosperm. Although it is argued that most generatively apomictic lineages may have acquired this form of reproduction relatively easily, by the acquisition of a mutation at a single locus, it is argued that newly initiated lineages may often be reproductively inefficient. These will begin to accumulate mutations that improve the efficiency of apomictic reproduction. Thus several loci may be involved in the control of generative apomixis in established lineages, even though only a single locus was involved in its initiation in these lineages. Care must be taken to distinguish between these initiator and modifier genes when considering the evolution of generative apomixis. Finally, it is argued that although generatively apomictic lineages have easily acquired this form of reproduction, its evolution in some taxa may be so difficult, requiring the acquisition of mutations simultaneously at two or more loci, that these may never acquire it. Thus, evidence obtained from taxa that have successfully made the transition from sexual reproduction to generative apomixis that its evolution was straightforward should not be used as evidence that its evolution will always be relatively easily achieved. Its uneven taxonomic distribution indicates that it is much more easily evolved by some taxonomic groups than by others. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

In this article, we describe palynomorph assemblages from 20 outcrop samples taken from 9 localities along the lower Colville River and nearby areas. The latest Cretaceous palynomorph assemblages that are from marine rocks contain late Campanian or Maastrichtian dinoflagellate cysts. Our latest Cretaceous and early Tertiary samples contain abundant spores and pollen grains and can be readily dated by reference to well-known pollen assemblages from the N Great Plains and NW Canada. By dating each sampled outcrop, we can approximate the position of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in the study area. On the N Slope, as in regions to the E and S, the Maastrichtian pollen assemblages represent a different kind of flora and vegetation than the Paleocene assemblages. The Maastrichtian assemblages have moderately high diversities of angiosperm pollen taxa, most of which were probably insect pollinated. In contrast, the Paleocene assemblages have low diversities of angiosperm taxa, and many of these taxa were probably wind pollinated. Differences between the mid-Maastrichtian and Paleocene assemblages may have been caused at least in part by climatic changes but may also have been caused by the effects of a hypothesized bolide impact at the end of the Maastrichtian for which there is increasing evidence.-from Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023723815

The sensitivity of pollen to pH in vitro was related to the species' position in canopy and was different for conifers and broad?leaved trees. Most pollen assayed revealed significant inhibition of germination and germ tube growth in response to pHs currently observed in rain samples in eastern Canada. Acer saccharum Marsh and Betula alleghaniensis Britt. pollen in vitro showed a high sensitivity to pH in combination with copper. The pollen of Populus tremuloides L, was shown to be highly sensitive to pH, and a synergism between pH and copper on pollen function in this species was also demonstrated. This was in contrast to the general antagonistic interaction of pH and copper noted in the other species tested in which copper by it self either did not affect pollen function or was stimulatory. Zinc has little or no effect, whereas lead at the concentrations used significantly inhibited both germination of Pinus strobus L. pollen at pH 5.63.6 and tube growth of both P. strobus and Pinus resinosa Ait. The increase in pollen mortality in response to air pollution at the time of pollination raises certain implications for reproduction and breeding. These implications are also discussed in the light of the significant genetic overlap between pollen and sporophytes of higher plants. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

After surpassing the period of embryo cell division and histodifferentiation (1214d after pollination = dap), the seed enters into a maturation period. The time courses of various physiological, biochemical, and structural changes of embryo and testa during seed maturation were analyzed in detail (dry and fresh mass changes, osmotic and water potential changes, respiration, DNA amplification by endomitosis, total ribosome and polysome formation, storage protein synthesis and accumulation, storage lipid accumulation). In addition to the final storage products protein and lipid, embryo and testa accumulate transiently large amounts of starch within the chloroplasts during early maturation. Concomitantly with the subsequent total breakdown of the starch, the plastids lose most of their internal structure and chlorophyll and shrink into proplastids, typical for the mature seed. At about 30 dap the seeds shift from a desiccation?sensitive to a desiccation?tolerant state and are able then to germinate rapidly upon drying and reimbibition. If isolated from the immature fruit and sown directly on water, the seeds demonstrate precocious germination from about 13 dap onwards. Young seeds (isolated ? 38 dap) germinate only after surpassing a lag?phase of several days (after?ripening) during which the embryo continues to accumulate storage protein and lipid at the expense of the surrounding seed tissues. We conclude from these results that the maturing seed represents a rather closed developmental system which is able to continue its development up to successful germination without any specific regulatory influence from the mother plant. Immature seeds are able to germinate without a preceding dehydration treatment, which means that partial or full desiccation does not serve as an environmental signal for reprogramming seed development from maturation to germination. Instead, it is argued that the water relations of the seed are a critical element in the control of maturation and germination: during maturation on the mother plant the embryo is subject to a considerable turgor pressure (of the order of 12 bar) accompanied by a low water potential (of the order of ?12 bar). This turgor permits maturation growth but is subcritical for germination growth. However, upon imbibition in water, the low water potential provides a driving force for a burst of water uptake overcoming the critical turgor threshold and thereby inducing germination. 1988 Deutsche Botanische Gesellschaft/German Botanical Society",Chloroplast regression (seed maturation); desiccation tolerance (seed maturation); germination (immature seeds); maturation (Sinapis seeds); mustard (seed development); precocious germination (Sinapis); proplastid formation (seed development); seed development (Sinapis); Sinapis alba (seed development); starch synthesis (seed maturation); water potential (seed maturation),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0000996398

In this paper, computer simulation has been developed to determine the effects of the polymorphism level on Fis estimates in finite samples. It is shown that finite samples present mostly negative Fis estimates when allelic polymorphism is low. In these conditions, the high frequency of these apparent heterozygote excesses is not a consequence of frequency dependent selection acting on rare heterozygotes but only a statistical effect caused by the low probability of encountering rare homozygotes in the samples. The genetic structure of 250 European beech stands was studied using three electrophoretically detectable protein loci. F-statistics were estimated using the Weir and Cockerham method. The beech shows the highest interpopulation genetic differentiation estimates among the anemophilous pollinated forest trees. At the population level, an heterozygote deficit can be observed.

The same average copy number of Mu elements is transmitted through the male and female, but there is wide variation in the absolute copy number among the progeny. In inactive Mutator plants -defined both by the loss of somatic instability at a reporter gene (bronze2-mu1) and by modification of the HinfI sites in the terminal inverted repeat sequences of Mu elements -the absolute copy number of Mu elements is fixed in the parent. Thus, in outcrosses Mu element number is halved, and on self-pollination Mu copy number is constant. Reactivation of somatic mutability at cryptic bz2-mu1 alleles in inactive individuals by crossing to an active line seems not to involve an increase in Mu element copy number transmitted by the inactive individual. These and other results suggest that increases in Mu copy number occur late in plant development or in the gametophyte rather than after fertilization. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",bronze2; Maize; Mutator; Somatic instability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0023739575

Plants growing in the field produced fewer large flowers per unit of stem, and stem biomass was negatively related to corolla size for plants grown under controlled greenhouse conditions.

Except for one site adjacent to E. regnans, no introgression to E. macrorhyncha is found, suggesting that hybridization is a rare event. The presence of hybrids is likely to be a result of a third order reaction requiring heavy synchronous flowering, attraction of suitable pollinators and the occurrence of bushfires within the retention time of capsules in the canopies. Intermediate trees exhibit water relation characteristics and essential oil contents similar to those of E. macrorhyncha but morphological features closer to those of E. regnans. Progeny of intermediates display wide variability, both morphologically and physiologically, between the putative parent species.

We investigated these factors by restricting pollination, and thus seed-set, to defined regions and differently-sized areas of the capitulum of a cytoplasmic-male-sterile genotype. We also investigated the effects of defoliation on seed set. Seed characters, and contents of carbohydrates, N, P, K, Mg and Ca in capitulum parts were measured at physiological maturity. Single-seed weight was largest when pollination was allowed on only 33% of the capitulum diameter in any position on the capitulum. Seed oil concentration was highest when pollination was restricted to the outer whorls of florets and when seed numbers were greatest. Concentrations of kernel N, Mg and P, and seed-hull Mg and P were highest when pollination was restricted to inner whorls of florets. There were no significant effects on Ca. Capitulum dry matter and nutrient contents were only lowered when pollination was completely prevented. Concentrations of N, P and Mg in the receptacle were highest when pollination was completely prevented; these nutrients also accumulated in hulls of normal seeds and in the hull structures developed from unfertilized florets. Concentrations of K, Ca and fructose were highest when seeds were present. Thus, the nutritional demand of developing seeds does not appear to control the movement of N, P and Mg to the capitulum, but it may do so for K, Ca and fructose. Complete defoliation and, to a lesser extent, partial defoliation at anthesis decreased seed number, total seed weight and oil yield per plant. Only complete defoliation decreased single-seed weight and oil concentration below control values. The fructose content of receptacles at maturity was proportional to the leaf weight remaining, but the glucose content was not affected by any defoliation treatment. Seed N was decreased by defoliation but stem N was not. In the absence of leaf N, stem N does not seem to be redistributed as a compensatory N supply to developing seeds. We conclude that the vasculature to the centre of capitulum can adequately supply nutrients to central seeds, and that the outer seeds control the growth of inner seeds, probably by competition for spa???on the receptacle and by preferential sequestration of nutrients. © 1988.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45549110530

During the phase of germination the moisture supply was changed, so that after an initial soaking the kernels were desiccated. Finally the inbibition/dehydration treatments were followed by soaking the kernels to allow seedling growth. This experimental design mirrors natural conditions (in subtropical/tropical climates) which are characterized by short rain and drought periods during the sowing of maize. The maize cultivars were chosen from German and Thai hybrids and open pollinated varieties. In the treatments, the initial imbibitions were 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours; the dehydration periods were 24 and 48 hours. Percentage of regermination, radicle length, number of mesocotyl roots, root and shoot dry weights, were measured as indicative features for evaluation of the resistance against changing moisture content of the kernels during the germination phase. The results show, that a duration of 36 hours of imbibition describes in general the dehydration?insensitive phase. Dehydration after imbibition periods of 24 (or 48) hours very often lead to a growth acceleration in the following germination after the kernels are imbibed again. If the germination proceeds for a longer period, as tested for 48 or 60 hours, all maize cultivars will show detrimental effects of dehydration on germination and seedling growth. However, there are distinct differences within the material tested, the Thai cultivars being more resistant than German hybrids. The reactions may be explained by differences in the rate of development during the first phase of germination. Slowly germinating genotypes probably pass later the border line from the insensitive to the sensitive phase against dehydration after an initial imbibition of the kernels.

Based on analyses of survivorship it was concluded that the populations are at least stable (even short-lived Oenothera cohorts survive long enough to reproduce) or growing (the number of established Swallenia and Astragalus plants doubled during the study). The high mortality and short life span of Oenothera and Astragalus populations were offset by copious seed production, long-lived seeds, low to moderate seed predation, and frequent establishment. The low and variable seed production, high seed predation, and infrequent establishment of Swallenia populations were counterbalanced by a low mortality of recruits and established plants, a long reproductive life, and long-lived seeds. It is concluded that the factors endangering these endemic populations are mostly extrinsic to the plant population (e.g. human disturbance, pollinator availability, climatic fluctuation) and that no additional manipulations of the populations are necessary. © 1988.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0024266890

It was the intention of the present study to test existing hypotheses on the inheritance of the bisaboloids using the genetic analysis of segregating progenies from controlled, self and cross pollinations within and between different chemotypes. Such types were analysed by means of TAS?TLC. Results from 40 interconnected progenies confirmed the biosynthetic pathway from bisabolol via bisabololoxid A to bisabolonoxid. It could further he shown that three loci act in this pathway; the genotype oo., (bisabolol) is epistatic to P/p, a gene controlling synthesis from bisabolol?5,6?epoxid (OO) of either bisabololoxid A(O.P.) or B (O.pp). The dominance of P appears to be incomplete. The genotype pp is epistatic to the locus N/n which governs the step from bisabololoxid A  (O.P.nn) to bisabolonoxid (O.P.N). The most desirable genotype, which contains both bisabolol and matricine, is double recessive. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

Some explants generated several shoots, and roots were formed in some cases only. Embryonic axis and cotyledon explants at the stages later than torpedo-shaped embryo formed more shoots than those of intact embryos. Shoot formation was promoted when the concentration of the minerals and organic components of MS medium, except for sucrose and plant growth regulators, was diluted to 3 4, sucrose at 30 g l-1 was added and a 10-h photoperiod was supplied.

The difference in oil quality (i.e., geraniol, geranyl acetate, and total alcohols) in the phenotypic patterns was not pronounced. The results indicated that a judicious selection for phenotypic parameters such as leaf: stem ratio around 0.40, herbage yield above 300 g, and harvest index above 0.80 on per plant basis might be rewarding for genetic improvement of palmarosa.
