The question remains, however, whether urban species constitute a unique community, and thus add value to landscape biodiversity, or whether they are just a mixture of species from surrounding ecosystems. In this study, the occurrence and abundance of arthropods were analysed according to trophic guilds (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae as xylophagous species, Apiformes as pollinators, Neuroptera as flying predators, Araneae and Carabidae as surface-dwelling predators) in urban, agricultural and forest ecosystems in Switzerland. To assess the likely origin of arthropod fauna in Swiss cities, we identified character species (regular and constant occurrence) for ecosystems and performed ordination and cluster analyses. In total, we studied 10,034 specimens from 497 species and found that 13% of all species and 10% of the character species were predominately found in the urban ecosystems. Community analyses showed that the three ecosystems harbour distinct species assemblages. While communities at forest sites are quite dissimilar from those at urban and agricultural sites, these latter share more than one third of all character species, which indicates either that agricultural areas function as source habitats for urban communities or that agricultural species have survived urbanisation in situ. Overall, our study identified a distinct urban arthropod community that enriches landscape (gamma) diversity in Switzerland. Urban sites may provide novel habitats for species of former extensive agriculture, or species otherwise not, or scarcely, occurring in the region. The present study illuminates the value of urban arthropods for overall biodiversity which should be incorporated in planning decisions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Agriculture; Alien; Community composition; Forest; Gamma diversity; Trophic guilds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054853277

The floral anthesis occurred between 6 and 8 hrs, and the average floral longevity was of 25 hrs. Four phenological flower phases were recognized: (1) Female with herkogamy, (2) Homogamy with herkogamy, (3) Homogamy with not herkogamy, and (4) Senescence. Although the stigmas were receptive during all floral phases, there was a higher fruit production from pollination carried out at the second and third phases. Pollen donation occurs at phase 2 with 96% of viability. The production of nectar showed an increasing tendency through the floral life. Pollination experiments showed that although P. edulis f. edulis is highly auto-compatible, it requires of pollinators to increase fruit harvesting, as indicated by the low percentage (33%) of fruits obtained without pollinators. Our results suggest that gulupa has a mixed reproductive strategy promoting endogamy in some floral phases while promoting crossing in others.

After verifying the existence of the entomophily syndrome, the following aspects were studied: floral morphology, taxonomic composition, richness and abundance of syrphid species identified as flower visitors, and their cephalic and oral morphometry. S. bogotensis presents entomophily syndrome with absence of selfing. The Syrphid community associated with S.bogotensis included the following nine species in five genera: Allograpta neotropica Curran, 1936, Allograpta exotica Wiedermann, 1830, Allograpta annulipes Macquart, 1850, Allograpta aenea Hull, 1937, Lejops mexicana Macquart, 1842, Platycheirus ecuadoriensis Fluke, 1945, Platycheirus fenestrata Macquart, 1842, Syrphus shoree Fluke, 1950 and Toxomerus sp. 1. The species of flower flies (Syrphidae), as a whole, showed behavioral and morphological characteristics associated with low-efficiency pollinators, with a low rate of visits, inability for activation of levers staminal and minimal contact insect body with the anthers and stigma of the flower. Additionally, the flies showed a very low load of pollen grains of S. bogotensis in the body, and with high investment of time in cleaning its body (grooming). Flowers visited by these flies did not result in fruit. These results suggest that flower flies do not effectively participate in the pollination of S. bogotensis. Other insect visitors that might be responsible for the pollination of S. bogotensis were species of the families Apidae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae. Flower flies feed on the pollen of S. bogotensis but do not interfere with growth and plant development, indicating a commensalistic relationship with S. bogotensis.",Comensalism; Diptera; Flowers flies; Lamiaceae; Polinization; Salvia bogotensis; Syrphidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455190122

In a phylogeographic framework, we therefore expect that the fates of organisms interacting specifically are also tightly interrelated. Here we investigate such a scenario by analyzing the genetic structures of species interacting in an obligate plant-insect pollination lure-and-trap antagonism, involving Arum maculatum (Araceae) and its specific psychodid (Diptera) visitors Psychoda phalaenoides and Psycha grisescens. Because the interaction is asymmetric (i.e., only the plant depends on the insect), we expect the genetic structure of the plant to be related with the historical pollinator availability, yielding incongruent phylogeographic patterns between the interacting organisms. Using insect mtDNA sequences and plant AFLP genome fingerprinting, we inferred the large-scale phylogeographies of each species and the distribution of genetic diversities throughout the sampled range, and evaluated the congruence in their respective genetic structures using hierarchical analyses of molecular variances (AMOVA). Because the composition of pollinator species varies in Europe, we also examined its association with the spatial genetic structure of the plant. Our findings indicate that while the plant presents a spatially well-defined genetic structure, this is not the case in the insects. Patterns of genetic diversities also show dissimilar distributions among the three interacting species. Phylogeographic histories of the plant and its pollinating insects are thus not congruent, a result that would indicate that plant and insect lineages do not share the same glacial and postglacial histories. However, the genetic structure of the plant can, at least partially, be explained by the type of pollinators available at a regional scale. Differences in life-history traits of available pollinators might therefore have influenced the genetic structure of the plant, the dependent organism, in this antagonistic interaction. © 2011 Espíndola, Alvarez.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455173244

Maintaining crucial ecosystem processes and services requires resilience to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. However, the resilience and stability of surviving biological communities remain poorly quantified. From a 10-y dataset comprising 2,880 bird censuses across a land-use gradient, we present three key findings concerning the resilience and stability of Costa Rican bird communities. First, seed dispersing, insect eating, and pollinating guilds were more resilient to low-intensity land use than high-intensity land use. Compared with forest assemblages, bird abundance, species richness, and diversity were all ?15% lower in low-intensity land use and ?50% lower in high-intensity land use. Second, patterns in species richness generally correlated with patterns in stability: guilds exhibited less variation in abundance in low-intensity land use than in high-intensity land use. Finally, interspecific differences in reaction to environmental change (response diversity) and possibly the portfolio effect, but not negative covariance of species abundances, conferred resilience and stability. These findings point to the changes needed in agricultural production practices in the tropics to better sustain bird communities and, possibly, the functional and service roles that they play.",Agriculture; Avian; Compensation; Countryside biogeography; Intensification,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855486122

In two field experiments, we tested whether rates of cross-pollination differed between GM and non-GM lines of the predominantly self-pollinating wheat Triticum aestivum. In the first experiment, outcrossing was studied within the field by planting ""phytometers"" of one line into stands of another line. In the second experiment, outcrossing was studied over distances of 0.5-2.5 m from a central patch of pollen donors to adjacent patches of pollen recipients. Cross-pollination and outcrossing was detected when offspring of a pollen recipient without a particular transgene contained this transgene in heterozygous condition. The GM lines had been produced from the varieties Bobwhite or Frisal and contained Pm3b or chitinase/glucanase transgenes, respectively, in homozygous condition. These transgenes increase plant resistance against pathogenic fungi. Although the overall outcrossing rate in the first experiment was only 3.4%, Bobwhite GM lines containing the Pm3b transgene were six times more likely than non-GM control lines to produce outcrossed offspring. There was additional variation in outcrossing rate among the four GM-lines, presumably due to the different transgene insertion events. Among the pollen donors, the Frisal GM line expressing a chitinase transgene caused more outcrossing than the GM line expressing both a chitinase and a glucanase transgene. In the second experiment, outcrossing after cross-pollination declined from 0.7-0.03% over the test distances of 0.5-2.5 m. Our results suggest that pollen-mediated gene flow between GM and non-GM wheat might only be a concern if it occurs within fields, e.g. due to seed contamination. Methodologically our study demonstrates that outcrossing rates between transgenic and other lines within crops can be assessed using a phytometer approach and that gene-flow distances can be efficiently estimated with population-level PCR analyses. © 2011 Rieben et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84455173032

Mutualistic interactions may be especially vulnerable because of the potential for phenological mismatching if the species involved do not respond similarly to changes in temperature. Here we present an analysis of climate-associated shifts in the phenology of wild bees, the most important pollinators worldwide, and compare these shifts to published studies of bee-pollinated plants over the same time period. We report that over the past 130 y, the phenology of 10 bee species from northeastern North America has advanced by a mean of 10.4 ± 1.3 d. Most of this advance has taken place since 1970, paralleling global temperature increases. When the best available data are used to estimate analogous rates of advance for plants, these rates are not distinguishable from those of bees, suggesting that bee emergence is keeping pace with shifts in host-plant flowering, at least among the generalist species that we investigated.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855509047

Polyphenism has been key to the evolution of the Hymenoptera, and particularly the social Hymenoptera where the genome of a single species regulates distinct larval stages, sexual dimorphism and physical castes within the female sex. Transcriptomic analyses of social Hymenoptera will therefore provide unique insights into how changes in gene expression underlie such complexity. Here we describe gene expression in individual specimens of the pre-adult stages, sexes and castes of the key pollinator, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris.Results: cDNA was prepared from mRNA from five life cycle stages (one larva, one pupa, one male, one gyne and two workers) and a total of 1,610,742 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated using Roche 454 technology, substantially increasing the sequence data available for this important species. Overlapping ESTs were assembled into 36,354 B. terrestris putative transcripts, and functionally annotated. A preliminary assessment of differences in gene expression across non-replicated specimens from the pre-adult stages, castes and sexes was performed using R-STAT analysis. Individual samples from the life cycle stages of the bumblebee differed in the expression of a wide array of genes, including genes involved in amino acid storage, metabolism, immunity and olfaction.Conclusions: Detailed analyses of immune and olfaction gene expression across phenotypes demonstrated how transcriptomic analyses can inform our understanding of processes central to the biology of B. terrestris and the social Hymenoptera in general. For example, examination of immunity-related genes identified high conservation of important immunity pathway components across individual specimens from the life cycle stages while olfactory-related genes exhibited differential expression with a wider repertoire of gene expression within adults, especially sexuals, in comparison to immature stages. As there is an absence of replication across the samples, the results of this study are preliminary but provide a number of candidate genes which may be related to distinct phenotypic stage expression. This comprehensive transcriptome catalogue will provide an important gene discovery resource for directed programmes in ecology, evolution and conservation of a key pollinator. © 2011 Colgan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83655197836

The flora is predominantly composed of shrubs and trees, but also supports a large diversity of vine species. The majority of species (73.5%) have flowers less than 10 mm in diameter of which 80% are white or green in colour. The greatest number of species are in flower from September through to February, although a number of species flower during the cooler, drier winter months. The data compiled on floral features and phenology for individual plant species were assigned to the species lists derived from the IBISCA-Queensland (Qld) altitudinal gradient in Lamington National Park, Australia. No statistically significant changes in flower colour or size were detected with increasing altitude from 300 m to 1100 m a.s.l., but decreasing trends in the proportions of colourful flowers, flowers less than 5 mm in diameter and unisexual flowers were observed. No pollination studies conducted in Lamington National Park have been published although subtropical forests in general are believed to be predominantly generalist pollinated. Data on the morphology of flowers and timing of flowering provide some support for this idea. Determining the prevalence and species turnover of such generalist pollination systems along altitudinal gradients, such as the IBISCA-Qld gradient, could help determine the reproductive resilience of subtropical rainforest plant species under climate change. © The State of Queensland (Queensland Museum) 2011.",Altitudinal gradient; Flower morphology; Phenology; Pollination; Subtropical rainforest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859946904

The study involved six tropical maize inbred lines from the CIMMYT. Crosses were formed in CIMMYT's Maize Research Station in Tlaltizapan, Morelos during the summer of 2004. In order to produce F2 seeds, F1 crosses were grown at Tepalcingo, Mor. and Iguala, Guerrero. This was accomplished by controlling pollinations (half sibs). Seeds from the F1 and the F2 crosses were evaluated at the Colegio de Postgraduados, Montecillo, Mexico. F1 and F2 seeds were used to perform a standard germination test. Seed vigor was evaluated after conducting a seed aging treatment, and conductivity and seed weight were also determined. A test for emergence on sand bed was also conducted. Variables recorded included percentage, speed and index of emergence; canopy dry weight; seedling height and vigor indexes I and II. Significant (p?0.01) effects of the General Combining Ability (GCA) were observed for all traits in both the F1 and F2 generations. GCA effects were greater than those of Specific Combining Ability (SCA). The only exception was vigor after the accelerating age treatment for the F1 seed. Maternal effects in the F1 generation were significant (p?0.01) for all characters. However, seedling height, canopy dry weight and vigor indexes I and II were not influenced by the female parent in the F2 generation. Parents CML 396 and CML 407 had the highest GCA for seed vigor, while 245 CML expressed the same condition for seedling vigor traits in both generations for most traits evaluated. These materials might be considered for integrating a program of breeding for seed and seedling vigor.

Because B. juncea is distributed throughout Japan and is known to be high crossability with B. napus, it is assumed to be a recipient of B. napus. However, there are few reports for introgression of cross-combination in B. juncea × B. napus. To assess crossability, we artificially pollinated B. juncea with B. napus. After harvesting a large number of progeny seeds, we observed false hybrids and metaxenia of seed coats. Seed coat color was classified into four categories and false hybrids were confirmed by morphological characteristics and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Furthermore, the occurrence of false hybrids was affected by varietal differences in B. napus, whereas that of metaxenia was related to hybridity. Therefore, we suggest that metaxenia can be used as a marker for hybrid identification in B. juncea L. cv. Kikarashina × B. napus.

Herein, the thick petals form a floral chamber, which is accessible only to small insects. Flowers are protogynous, without overlap between the carpellate and the staminate phase. The anthesis starts in the afternoon (14.00-15.00 h), and the carpellate phase lasts until late morning of the next day. Pollen is released in the early afternoon (12.00-13.00 h) on the second day of flowering. The staminate phase ends between 14.45 and 15.45 h with the opening and shedding of the petals, which overlapped with the beginning of the carpellate phase of the next days' flowers. Both the carpellate and the staminate phase are accompanied by strong fruity scent and thermogenesis of up to 3.8 °C (carpellate) and 3.7 °C (staminate phase) above ambient temperature. Experiments showed that A. dolichocarpa is self-compatible, but pollinator-dependent for fruit set. Although stingless bees (Trigona sp.) regularly visit staminate phase flowers for pollen at the end of anthesis, only small nitidulid beetles (Colopterus spp.) were recorded as pollinators. They enter the floral chamber during the first hours of anthesis, feed on pollen during the staminate phase, and stay until the petals shed. Flowering is continuous and trees produce few flowers at a time. The beginning of visible fruit growth was delayed for a rather long period of up to nine months, varying strongly among single flowers.

Recent honey bee losses causing decline of bee diversity is found alarming for the pollination of both wild plant biodiversity and crop production. Therefore, determination of genetic diversity of honey bee populations is essential and will provide a valuable resource for conservation purposes. Twenty Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers were used to assess the genetic diversity in 720 worker bees collected from 360 colonies of 25 provinces in Turkey. Ten out of twenty primers produced 105 reproducible, bright bands, all were polymorphic. Mean genetic diversity values ranged between 0.035 and 0.175, coefficient of gene differentiation (GST) values were estimated as 0.060 to 0.441, and the private band patterns reflected a high level of genetic variation. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) partitioned the total genetic variation as 60% within, 40% among populations. The Mantel test did not reveal significant correlation between the genetic and geographic distances. First three Eigen values of principle coordinate analysis explained 63% of total variation, 27, 21, and 15% for the first, second and third respectively. The cluster analysis showed that the honey bees of Thrace region of Turkey and an island at a short distance were clustered together.

Current recommendations in western Canada are to follow a 1 in 4-yr rotation for canola or pea on a particular field, but producers are interested in increasing frequency of these crops. The objective of this study was to determine the impacts of frequency of broad-leaf crops canola and pea and fungicide application in various crop rotations on accumulation and distribution of nitrate nitrogen (N) and extractable phosphorus (P) in the soil profile after 8 yr on a Dark Brown Chernozem (Typic Boroll) loam at Scott, Saskatchewan. The field experiment (from 1998 and 2005) contained monoculture canola and monoculture pea compared with rotations that contained these crops every 2, 3, and 4 yr with wheat and/or flax. Two cultivars of canola were included, an herbicide-tolerant and blackleg-resistant hybrid, and a conventional (not herbicide tolerant) open-pollinated, blackleg-susceptible (OP) cultivar. Subplots were fungicide treatments that attempted to control both blackleg and sclerotinia stem rot in canola and myco sphaerella blight in pea. Residual soil nitrate N in most layers and extractable P in many layers were significantly affected by crop rotation or rotation length, with the greatest amounts after monocultures. Fungicide application resulted in decreased amount of residual soil nitrate N, but it had no effect on soil extractable P. Crop phase (i.e., individual crops that make up the rotation) had a significant effect on soil nitrate N in many crop rotations; for example, residual soil nitrate N tended to be greatest after pea or OP canola and also after flax in the 4-yr rotation with flax. Crop phase had no effect on soil extractable P in any crop rotation. The lower amounts of residual soil nitrate N were usually associated with greater cumulative seed yields, and more so with greater cumulative N removal in seed in various crop rotations and phases within rotations. In conclusion, the findings suggest that accumulation of residual nutrients in soil, especially nitrate N, can be minimized by extending crop rotations, using high-yielding disease-resistant canola cultivars, and applying fungicides in years with weather conditions conducive to diseases. © 2011 Crown copyright.",Broad-leaf crops; Canola; Extractable P; Frequency; Nitrate N; Pea; Phase; Residual soil nutrients; Rotation; Seed yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455246652

Honey bee larvae are directly exposed to transgenic products by the consumption of GM pollen. But most ERA studies only consider responses of adult bees, although Bt-proteins primarily affect the larval phases of target organisms. We adopted an in vitro larvae rearing system, to assess lethal and sublethal effects of Bt-pollen consumption in a standardized eco-toxicological bioassay. The effects of pollen from two Bt-maize cultivars, one expressing a single and the other a total of three Bt-proteins, on the survival and prepupae weight of honey bee larvae were analyzed. The control treatments included pollen from three non-transgenic maize varieties and of Heliconia rostrata. Three days old larvae were fed the realistic exposure dose of 2 mg pollen within the semi-artificial diet. The larvae were monitored over 120 h, until the prepupal stage, where larvae terminate feeding and growing. Neither single nor stacked Bt-maize pollen showed an adverse effect on larval survival and the prepupal weight. In contrast, feeding of H. rostrata pollen caused significant toxic effects. The results of this study indicate that pollen of the tested Bt-varieties does not harm the development of in vitro reared A. mellifera larvae. To sustain the ecosystem service of pollination, Bt-impact on A. mellifera should always be a crucial part of regulatory biosafety assessments. We suggest that our approach of feeding GM pollen on in vitro reared honey bee larvae is well suited of becoming a standard bioassay in regulatory risk assessments schemes of GM crops. © 2011 Hendriksma et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455238797

Three botanical varieties have previously been identified in this species: albomarginata, bituminosa and crassiuscula. B. bituminosa can be considered a genomic 'orphan' species with very few genomic resources available. New DNA sequencing technologies provide an opportunity to develop high quality molecular markers for such orphan species.Results: 432,306 mRNA molecules were sampled from a leaf transcriptome of a single B. bituminosa plant using Roche 454 pyrosequencing, resulting in an average read length of 345 bp (149.1 Mbp in total). Sequences were assembled into 3,838 isotigs/contigs representing putatively unique gene transcripts. Gene ontology descriptors were identified for 3,419 sequences. Raw sequence reads containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs were identified, and 240 primer pairs flanking these motifs were designed. Of 87 primer pairs developed this way, 75 (86.2%) successfully amplified primarily single fragments by PCR. Fragment analysis using 20 primer pairs in 79 accessions of B. bituminosa detected 130 alleles at 21 SSR loci. Genetic diversity analyses confirmed that variation at these SSR loci accurately reflected known taxonomic relationships in original collections of B. bituminosa and provided additional evidence that a division of the botanical variety bituminosa into two according to geographical origin (Mediterranean region and Canary Islands) may be appropriate. Evidence of cross-pollination was also found between botanical varieties within a B. bituminosa breeding programme.Conclusions: B. bituminosa can no longer be considered a genomic orphan species, having now a large (albeit incomplete) repertoire of expressed gene sequences that can serve as a resource for future genetic studies. This experimental approach was effective in developing codominant and polymorphic SSR markers for application in diverse genetic studies. These markers have already given new insight into genetic variation in B. bituminosa, providing evidence that a division of the botanical variety bituminosa may be appropriate. This approach is commended to those seeking to develop useful markers for genomic orphan species. © 2011 Pazos-Navarro et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455195497

We sought to determine the prevalence of sensitization to maize pollen among exposed workers and to identify the eliciting allergens. Methods. In July 2010, 8 out of 11 subjects were examined who were repeatedly exposed to maize pollen by pollinating maize during their work in a biological research department. All 8 filled in a questionnaire and underwent skin prick testing (SPT) and immune-specific analyses. Results: 5 out of the 8 exposed subjects had repeatedly suffered for at least several weeks from rhinitis, 4 from conjunctivitis, 4 from urticaria, and 2 from shortness of breath upon occupational exposure to maize pollen. All symptomatic workers had specific IgE antibodies against maize pollen (CAP class 1). Interestingly, 4 of the 5 maize pollen-allergic subjects, but none of the 3 asymptomatic exposed workers had IgE antibodies specific for grass pollen. All but one of the maize pollen-allergic subjects had suffered from allergic grass pollen-related symptoms for 6 to 11 years before job-related exposure to maize pollen. Lung function testing was normal in all cases. In immunoblot analyses, the allergenic components could be identified as Zea m 1 and Zea m 13. The reactivity is mostly caused by cross-reactivity to the homologous allergens in temperate grass pollen. Two sera responded to Zea m 3, but interestingly not to the corresponding timothy allergen indicating maize-specific IgE reactivity. Conclusion: The present data suggest that subjects pollinating maize are at high risk of developing an allergy to maize pollen as a so far underestimated source of occupational allergens. For the screening of patients with suspected maize pollen sensitization, the determination of IgE antibodies specific for maize pollen is suitable. © 2011 Oldenburg et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",cross-reactivity; IgE reactivity; maize pollen; maize pollination; sensitization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83255188929

The reproductive characteristics, such as the viability of pollens and of stigmas, the ratio of pollen grains and ovules per flower, the fecundity of pistils and their ability of receiving pollens under natural conditions, and self-compatibility levels, of pin and thrum flowers in Primula merrilliana Schltr. were comparatively investigated by experiments in greenhouse and surveys in wild populations. The studies of 13 wild populations indicated that the diameter of corolla and the width of corolla lobe were similar between pin and thrum morphs (P >0. 05). The corolla tube length of thrum (short-styled) flower (7. 33 mm) was significantly longer than that of pin (long-styled) flower (6. 35 mm). In thrum morph, anther (7. 30 mm high) was at the mouth of the corolla tube, and the stigma (3. 98mm high) was situated near the middle of the tubular corolla. In pin morph, however, the stigma (6. 50 mm high) was near the mouth of the corolla tube, and the anther (4. 09mm high) was at the middle of the tube. The mean number of the pin pollen grains per flower was significantly higher than that of thrum, but the diameter of the former was distinctly smaller than that of the latter. No significant difference was observed in the number of ovule between the two morphs, so the ratio of pollen grains to ovule was obviously higher in pin morph than in thrum morph. Under natural conditions, total pollen deposition at long-styled stigma was significantly higher than at short-styled stigma, but the legitimate pollen grains number (from the opposite morph flower) and filled seeds per fruit were not different significantly between the two morphs. In the cultivated condition, the longevity of pin and thrum flower was similar (about 20-21days). The pollen viability and stigma receptivity of pin flower were also similar to those of thrum. Pollen and stigma of two types flower kept fairly high viability during both prophase and metaphase of flowering (about 16 days) and only reduced distinctly at the end of flowering. And this phenomenon was more obvious in the pollen viability of long-styled flower. The results of artificial pollination indicated that self-compatibility in both morphs were similar, and that inter-morph, intra-morph and self pollinated all could bring filled seeds, but the mean filled seeds per fruit of inter-morph pollinated was higher than that of self-and intra-morph pollinated. The tubes of legitimate pollens (from the opposite morph flower) grew faster than those of illegitimate pollens (from the same morph or self flower) in pin style, but similarly in thrum style. The germination percentage of legitimate pollens was higher than that of illegitimate pollens at thrum stigma, but no such pattern was found in plants with pin stigma. Based on the results above, the breeding system and the mechanism of maintenance of the distylous syndrome in P. merrilliana were discussed.",Distyly; Floral syndrome; Primula merrilliana schltr; Reproductive characteristics; Selective pressure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955161664

The degree of auto-fertility was high in the four cultivars, reaching up to 88%, therefore, line cultivar could be produced. As line cultivar has a risk of low yield stability, the search for plant traits that attract pollinating insects could contribute to increase cross-fertilization and as a result heterosis could be used for the improvement of cultivars.

In bamboos and other periodical plants, the synchronicity of mass-flowering and withering has been often reported indicating these species are monocarpic (semelparous) species. Therefore, synchronicity and periodicity are often suspected to be fairly tightly coupled traits in these periodical plants. We investigate the periodicity and synchronicity of Strobilanthes flexicaulis, and a closely related species S. tashiroi on Okinawa Island, Japan. The genus Strobilanthes is known for several periodical species. Based on 32-year observational data, we confirmed that S. flexicaulis is 6-year periodical mass-flowering monocarpic plant. All the flowering plants had died after flowering. In contrast, we found that S. tashiroi is a polycarpic perennial with no mass-flowering from three-year individual tracking. We also surveyed six local populations of S. flexicaulis and found variation in the synchronicity from four highly synchronized populations (&98% of plants flowering in the mass year) to two less synchronized one with 11-47% of plants flowering before and after the mass year. This result might imply that synchrony may be selected for when periodicity is established in monocarpic species. We found the selective advantages for mass-flowering in pollinator activities and predator satiation. The current results suggest that the periodical S. flexicaulis might have evolved periodicity from a non-periodical close relative. The current report should become a key finding for understanding the evolution of periodical plants. © 2011 Kakishima et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-82855177826

Such double negative effects may lead to a change in fitness, because the negative effects of a loss of a mutualism may be counterbalanced by the positive effects of a loss of an antagonism. In spite of being of great importance, however, the assessment of such ecological relationships has traditionally been performed separately. Approach - We evaluated fragmentation and edge effects on floral and foliar display, frequency of pollinator visits, foliar herbivory, and reproductive success, assessed as number of fruits per plant, number of seeds per fruit, and number of seeds per plant, on Bomarea salsilla, a xenogamous vine from southern Chile. Results - Plants occurring at fragments and edges exhibited a smaller floral display and a larger foliar display, and were rarely visited and preyed upon by pollinators and herbivores, respectively. The number of fruits per plant, the number of seeds per fruit, and number of seeds per plant were lower in fragments and at edges than at the core of continuous forest. Although forest fragmentation had a detrimental effect on herbivory, herbivores did not play a modulating role on the lowered pollinator-mediated reproductive success of B. salsilla probably due to the scarcity of foliar attack. Conclusion - Decreased reproductive success of Bomarea salsilla plants due to forest fragmentation and the creation of edge habitats was not counterbalanced by foliar herbivory as expected. The ecological scenario faced by B. salsilla may be a representative phenomenon of numerous other species of the fragmented forests of South America. © 2011 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Fitness counterbalance; Forest fragmentation; Herbivory; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82455198991

This study was conducted to understand the role played by local and environmental factors on the visitation intensity of coffee flowers by different bee species. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to investigate the effects of light intensity, distance to forest, foraging time of the day, coffee blooming season and abundance of coffee floral resources on the flower visitation frequency of different bee species. Results indicated contrasting responses of different bee species. The most important factors for social bees included forest distance, light intensity and the time of the day, whereas most determinant factors for solitary bee species were the length of the flowering season and the abundance of coffee floral resources. There is a need for developing habitat and landscape management strategies for the conservation of frequent native species in the vicinity of coffee fields to increase the delivery of pollination services to coffee. It is recommended to farmers to grow their coffee farms in the adjacent of forest habitats and related semi-natural habitats to receive high bee visitations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Central Uganda; Coffea robusta; Enhancement of pollination services delivery; Social bees; Solitary bees; Visitation frequencies,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855204933

This study quantitatively examined variation in floral phenotypes and pollinator service of Heliconia bihai and H. caribaea across three Antillean islands. The prediction was that floral characters would correspond to the major pollinators of these species on each island. Analysis of floral phenotypes revealed convergence among species and populations of Heliconia from the Greater Antilles. All populations of H. caribaea were similar, characterized by long nectar chambers and short corolla tubes. In contrast, H. bihai populations were strongly divergent: on Dominica, H. bihai had flowers with short nectar chambers and long corollas, whereas on Hispaniola, H. bihai flowers resembled those of H. caribaea with longer nectar chambers and shorter corolla tubes. Morphological variation in floral traits corresponded with geographic differences or similarities in the major pollinators on each island. The Hispaniolan mango, Anthracothorax dominicus, is the principal pollinator of both H. bihai and H. caribaea on Hispaniola; thus, the similarity of floral phenotypes between Heliconia species suggests parallel selective regimes imposed by the principal pollinator. Likewise, divergence between H. bihai populations from Dominica and Hispaniola corresponded with differences in the pollinators visiting this species on the two islands. The study highlights the putative importance of pollinator-mediated selection as driving floral convergence and the evolution of locally-adapted plant variants across a geographic mosaic of pollinator species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Convergent evolution; Heliconia; Hummingbird; Islands; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855138657

Palmer's agave (Agave palmeri), an important resource for many pollinators, is a key native plant potentially threatened by E. lehmanniana. Understanding potential impacts of E. lehmanniana on A. palmeri is critical for anticipating the future of the desert community where they coexist and for addressing management concerns about associated threatened and endangered species. Our study provides strong indications that E. lehmanniana negatively impacts A. palmeri in several ways. Areas of high E. lehmanniana abundance were associated with significantly lower densities and greater relative frequencies of small A. palmeri, suggesting that E. lehmanniana may exclude A. palmeri. There were no significant differences in species richness, abundance, or community composition when comparing flower associates associated with A. palmeri in areas of high and low E. lehmanniana abundance. However, we did find significantly lower connectedness within the pollination network associated with A. palmeri in areas with high E. lehmanniana abundance. Although E. lehmanniana forms thick stands that would presumably increase fire frequency, there was no significant association between E. lehmanniana and fire frequency. Interestingly, medium to high densities of A. palmeri were associated with areas of greater fire frequency. The complex ramifications of E. lehmanniana invasion for the long-lived A. palmeri and interlinked desert community warrant continued study, as these species are likely to continue to be found in close association due to their similar soil preferences. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Wood chips from the tree are a source of camptothecin, a globally sought-after alkaloid with cancer-treating properties, and are harvested unsustainably in natural forests. We studied the pollination ecology of the species and asked if there are constraints in pollination and fruiting success in its natural populations. We also discuss the potential effects of wood extraction on pollinators and reproductive success in the population. Methods The study was carried out during the flowering season in two populations with varying exploitation levels, both located in the Protected Area Network in the Western Ghats of Karnataka State. We assessed floral resource availability and measured pollinator diversity and activity in the canopy from the perspective of the biology of the species. We quantified pollinator abundance and percent fruit set as a function of population density.Important FindingsFlowers belong to the fly pollination syndrome and are open to visits by generalists such as Apis dorsata and Trigona iridipennis. Fruiting success did not vary between exploited and unexploited sites, but there was a significant difference in pollinator assemblage. In a lean male flowering year, fruit set was low, suggesting pollen limitation in the population. No fruiting was recorded in the second year at the site where trees were felled soon after the flowering period. We argue that when male floral resources are altered in exploited populations, pollinators of generalist nature may show a shift in foraging pattern. Also, generalist plants may be as susceptible to pollination loss as are specialist plants. The need for outcrossing in the species would probably exacerbate this vulnerability. © 2011 The Author.",fruit set; generalist; over-harvest; pollen limitation; pollinator assemblage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955241396

Daily periodicities of several pollinators that frequently visited mango panicles were studied prior to the insecticide trial to determine the appropriate time of insecticide application. Pollinators were collected at 2-h intervals for 2 months in the dry season and 1 month in the wet season of 2009. Mean numbers of all pollinators were greater in the morning (0800 h) and peaked in the late afternoon, but remained low during other times of the day.

Neem oil at 2% was effective against adult thrips 96 h after the second application (59.8% reduction) and caused only 24.9% mortality of pollinators. Proper timing of neem oil application such as at midday when pollinators are least active would control thrips populations satisfactorily but less detrimental to mango pollinators.

Pollinator attraction is achieved by mimicking sex pheromones of virgin females of their pollinators, mostly bee species. In earlier investigations, we showed that the phylogenetically distinct Ophrys species O. chestermanii and O. normanii on Sardinia attract their pollinator, males of the cuckoo bumblebee B. vestalis, with the same bouquets of relatively polar volatile compounds. In this investigation, we studied the sex pheromone of virgin females of B. vestalis with the aim of identifying male-attracting compounds and of comparing them with labellum extracts of the two orchids, which were found to release male-attracting compounds in earlier investigations (Gögler et al. 2009). In bioassays, shock-frozen females, cuticle extracts and polar fractions of cuticle extracts of virgin females stimulated mating behaviour in the males. Using gas chromatography coupled with electroantennography (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we detected in polar fractions of cuticle extracts of B. vestalis females the same electrophysiologically active compounds as in labellum extracts of both orchid species, including aldehydes, esters, fatty acids and alcohols. Since statistical comparisons of the relative proportions of esters showed strong similarities between virgin females and orchids, our results support the hypotheses that this highly specialized Ophrys-pollinator relationship represents another case of chemical mimicry and that esters play a key role in male attraction. © 2011 Springer Basel AG.",B. vestalis; Chemical mimicry; O. chestermanii; O. normanii; Pollinator-attracting odour bouquets; Sexual deception,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80955158823

To evaluate this issue, we compared the phenology, reproductive success, pollination and pre-dispersal seed predation of the legume tree Senna multijuga in two differently managed protected areas in Southeastern Brazil: the Itatiaia National Park and the Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari, from December 2007 to December 2008. Vegetative and reproductive phenodinamycs were registered monthly in 80 individuals; other evaluations included 104 observation hours for pollination (March-May 2008) in 51 inflorescences; besides, fruit counts, fecundity and seed predation. Sexual reproduction of S. multijuga depends on the transfer of pollen by large bees (Bombus, Centris, Epicharis and Xylocopa), as the species is self-incompatible. Bruchidae species of the genus Acanthoscelides and Sennius predate seeds. Vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics differed among sites. Our results indicated that ecological interactions were lower at the protected area, but the reproductive processes in S. multijuga were not ruptured or critically degraded. This reinforces the idea that landscape areas with intermediate levels of protection, such as environmental protection areas, are suitable as buffer zones, and thus, relevant to the conservation of ecological processes when associated with more strictly protected areas.",Bee pollination; Biodiversity conservation; Bruchids; Fecundity; Fruit set; Leguminosae; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053242321

Although the heredity of some traits was found dominant in controlled crossings, the diversity within each progeny remained high. Cross-pollination is essential in most years and under most growing conditions for satisfactory fruit set; however, self-pollination can also result in fruit set with viable seeds. The present study aimed to determine the degree and type of genetic diversity in progenies from free-, self-, and controlled cross-pollinated olive trees. The data presented are based on progenies of 200-500 trees from each cultivar and treatment grown in breeding plots at Bet Dagan. Tree vigor, shape, leaf morphology, and fruit characteristics were determined. The level of variation of each character from the mother cultivar was calculated for each progeny. The level of distribution of characters in the progeny plants of free and self-pollination was rather similar except for fruit fresh weight. A dominant female heredity of tree size, leaf and fruit form, as well as oil content was found for specific mother cultivars. This, however, had no significant effect on the degree of diversity within each progeny, which might be a result of varying amounts of self-pollination in each treatment. © 2011 Science From Israel / LPPltd., Jerusalem.",dominance; olive breeding; progeny diversity; self- and free pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80755130504

However, this fact is more evident in earlier commercial hybrids. There are reports that suggest that bees are not required in modern commercial hybrids where a high level of self-compatibility occurs. The purpose of this study was to define formation capacity of fully developed fruits (FDF) and incompletely developed fruits (IDF) in two modern sunflower hybrids exposed to open and closed pollination.Two hybrids, one of half cycle and the other of short cycle, labelled HA and HB respectively, were submitted to two pollination regimes: auto-pollination (bagged treatment) where the heads were covered with mesh bags from the first anthesis (FA) to the last anthesis (LA), avoiding the action of pollinators and open pollination (open treatment). The study was conducted during three consecutive years in two different locations. In the first year, the experimental plots were located at the Chacra experimental Barrow (Tres Arroyos; 38°20' S; 60°13' W) and in the second and third year at the experimental field of Universidad Nacional del Sur, (Bahía Blanca; 38°45' S; 62°11' W), reaching an average plant density of 60.000 plants/ha. During the second year treatments were conducted only on the HA and during the third year only on the HB. The number of FDF and IDF, in the three experiments on both sites did not show significant differences among treatments. Nevertheless, a non-significant different response in the number of FDF and IDF was observed during two years, probably as a result of changes in environmental conditions during the anthesis period. We conclude that, due to the effect of a high level of self-compatibility, no differences in the generation of fully developed fruits can be observed when plants of modern commercial sunflower hybrids are excluded from pollinators.",Fruit set; Helianthus annuus; Pollination; Self compatibility; Sunflower; Yield,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860495254

This study assesses the extinction risks to species within an important genus of pollinating bees (Colletes: Apidae) by estimating the expected changes in the area and isolation of suitable habitat under predicted climatic condition for 2050. Suitable habitat was defined on the basis of the presence of known forage plants as well as climatic suitability. To investigate whether ecological specialisation was linked to extinction risk we compared three species which were generalist pollen foragers on several plant families with three species which specialised on pollen from a single plant species. Both specialist and generalist species showed an increased risk of extinction with shifting climate, and this was particularly high for the most specialised species (Colletes anchusae and C. wolfi). The forage generalist C. impunctatus, which is associated with Boreo-Alpine environments, is potentially threatened through significant reduction in available climatic niche space. Including the distribution of the principal or sole pollen forage plant, when modelling the distribution of monolectic or narrowly oligolectic species, did not improve the predictive accuracy of our models as the plant species were considerably more widespread than the specialised bees associated with them.

(Asparagales: Amaryllidaceae), crop fields grown for seed production require arthropod pollination for adequate seed yield. Although many arthropod species visit A. cepa flowers, for most there is little information on their role as pollinators. Small flower visiting arthropods (body width < 3 mm) in particular are rarely assessed. A survey of eight flowering commercial A. cepa seed fields in the North and South Islands of New Zealand using window traps revealed that small arthropods were highly abundant among all except one field. Insects belonging to the orders Diptera and Thysanoptera were the most abundant and Hymenoptera, Collembola, Psocoptera, Hemiptera, and Coleoptera were also present. To test whether small arthropods might contribute to pollination, seed sets from umbels caged within 3 mm diameter mesh cages were compared with similarly caged, hand-pollinated umbels and uncaged umbels. Caged umbels that were not hand-pollinated set significantly fewer seeds (average eight seeds/umbel, n = 10) than caged hand-pollinated umbels (average 146 seeds/umbel) and uncaged umbels (average 481 seeds/umbel). Moreover, sticky traps placed on umbels within cages captured similar numbers of small arthropods as sticky traps placed on uncaged umbels, suggesting cages did not inhibit the movement of small arthropods to umbels. Therefore, despite the high abundance of small arthropods within fields, evidence to support their role as significant pollinators of commercial A. cepa seed crops was not found. © This is an open access paper.

No ethylene emission was observed from perianth parts that were isolated at various periods after pollination. The increased ethylene emission by the column plus ovary was correlated with an increase in ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activity in these flower parts. The perianth parts, in contrast, only showed an increase in ACC oxidase activity, following pollination. The data show that pollination-induced early perianth senescence in Dendrobium is mediated by increased ethylene biosynthesis by the column. +. ovary, and not due to increased ethylene biosynthesis in the perianth parts.

However, rates of gain for yield using recurrent selection on populations appear equal to that recorded for commercial hybrid breeding. The inbred-hybrid method, while successful, was not ""the only sound basis"" for maize improvement, as evidenced by later experiences in the United States and worldwide. It appears that maize breeders have practiced objective science and achieved concrete goals, although personal interests and goals clearly direct the work at times. As society looks for tools for sustainability based on achieving multiple goals, a special dedication to scientific validation and broad objectivity may be required.

In 2010, it was cultivated on 5351ha, accounting for about 1.1% of the total production areas in Slovenia. It is mainly grown in the eastern part of Slovenia (Pomurje, Podravje) and in the Spodnje-Posavska region. From 1984 until 2010, 58 different genotypes of oilseed and fodder rape were grown in Slovenia, of which a total of 28 were registered in the National List of Varieties in each year.

Although the use of honey bees for pollination can disrupt the habitat, the effects on their physiology have never been determined. Recently, honey bee colonies have often collapsed when introduced in greenhouses for pollination in Japan. Thus, suppressing colony collapses and maintaining the number of worker bees in the colonies is essential for successful long-term pollination in greenhouses and recycling of honey bee colonies. To understand the physiological states of honey bees used for long-term pollination in greenhouses, we characterized their gene expression profiles bymicroarray.We found that the greenhouse environment changes the gene expression profiles andinduces immune-suppression and oxidative stress in honey bees. In fact, the increase of the number of Nosema microsporidia and protein carbonyl content was observed in honey bees during pollination in greenhouses. Thus, honey bee colonies are likely to collapse during pollination in greenhouses when heavily infested with pathogens. Degradation of honey bee habitat by changing the outside environment of the colony, during pollination services for example, imposes negative impacts on honey bees. Thus, worldwide use of honey bees for crop pollination in general could be one of reasons for the decline of managed honey bee colonies. © 2011 The Authors.",Greenhouse; Habitat degradation; Honey bee; Immune-suppression; Oxidative stress; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864326049

To map the genetic loci responsible for male-mediated nonrandom mating, we performed mixed pollinations with Col and RIL pollen on Col pistils. To map the genetic loci responsible for female-mediated nonrandom mating, we performed mixed pollinations with Col and Landsberg erecta pollen on RIL pistils.

The most effective means of increasing abundance and diversity of bumblebees on farmland is to sow simple, low cost mixtures of dicotyledons rich in pollen and nectar, as prescribed under the UK agri-environment schemes. The potential benefits of this management prescription for butterflies are unknown. Similarly, more information is needed on how to manage this habitat to maximise the provision of pollen and nectar resources whilst protecting breeding habitat for butterflies. This study aimed to devise mixtures and cutting management regimes which address these issues. We found significant effects of seed mixture, timing and frequency of cutting, and removal of cut material on vegetation composition, flower resource availability and pollinators (the abundance, species richness and temporal distribution of butterflies and bumblebees, including males and queens, attracted to the mixtures). We recommend that nectar flower mixtures are refined by the inclusion of the best performing species to provide mid- and late-season forage resources (Trifolium spp., Lotus corniculatus and Centaureanigra), and the removal of competitive grass species. Summer cutting in May or early June, with removal of herbage where possible, should be applied to half the patch to extend the flowering season, and minimise damage to butterfly breeding habitat. This should be accompanied by the typical autumn cut to the whole patch. Even with best management practice, such nectar flower mixtures are only effective for 3-4 years and this should be recognised in policies aimed at enhancing pollinator populations in agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agri-environment schemes; Bumblebees; Butterflies; Field margins; Habitat restoration; Pollination; Wildflowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855128746

Exploring a database of expressed sequence tags obtained from flower buds of two divergent Passiflora species, we obtained assembled sequences potentially corresponding to 15 different genes of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in these species. The obtained sequences code for putative enzymes are involved in the production of flavonoid precursors, as well as those involved in the formation of particular (""decorated"") anthocyanin molecules. We also obtained sequences encoding regulatory factors that control the expression of structural genes and regulate the spatial and temporal accumulation of pigments. The identification of some of the putative Passiflora anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes provides novel resources for research on secondary metabolism in passionflowers, especially on the elucidation of the processes involved in floral pigmentation, which will allow future studies on the role of pigmentation in pollinator preferences in a molecular level. © 2011 Lilian Cristina Baldon Aizza and Marcelo Carnier Dornelas.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84869068600

Some of its key wood properties are percentage heartwood, heartwood colour, basic density, wood stiffness and green moisture content. Variation in these properties affects log value, processing and marketing. Aims: This study aims to understand how genetics and environment affect these wood properties. Methods:Stem cores were taken from 16 open-pollinated blackwood families from the island of Tasmania, Australia, which were planted across three 18-year-old progeny trials.Results: Significant effects of genetics, environment and their interaction (GxE) were found for many of the wood properties examined. Both broad-scale and local environmental effects were apparent, with local effects associated with competition and/or allelopathy from a Eucalyptus globulus nurse crop present in one trial. No significant correlation of growth rate (i.e. stem diameter) with wood properties was detected at the family level apart from a positive relationship with heartwood width. At the phenotypic level, there were many significant correlations including growth rate with heartwood width, but not with basic density, or wood stiffness measured as standing tree time of flight. Faster growing trees had yellower heartwood while trees with higher basic and green densities tended to have darker, redder and less yellow heartwood. Conclusion: Both genetic and environment factors affect key wood properties of Australian blackwood, but in most cases these effects were independent of growth rate. © 2011 INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Blackwood; Genetics; Tonewood; Wood colour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856679847

Both processes can decrease outcrossing rates and genetic variation in remnant stands. Despite these risks, some tree species have pollen vectors that mitigate these negative consequences for fragmented populations. In this paper, we assess both pollen flow and diversity of pollen sources in continuous forest and isolated stands of Swietenia humilis, a tropical tree species pollinated by small insects. Using seven nuclear microsatellite markers, we test the hypothesis that genetic diversity and the number of pollen donors are lower in remnant populations. Results show that allelic richness of seeds is lower in isolated populations (6.1 vs. 8.3 alleles per locus), even though adult populations do not show this difference. Pollen pool structure is greater in isolated patches (? Iso=0.26) than in continuous forest (? For=0.14), which yields estimates of the average effective number of pollen donors (N ep) of 1.9 and 3.6 respectively. In addition, estimates of number of sires per mother indicate that isolated trees have half the number of pollen sources (4.98) than trees in the forest (9.8). Although extensive pollen movement (&gt;2000m) was recorded on both habitat conditions, indicating that fragmented patches are not isolated from pollen-mediated gene flow, this extensive pollen flow among trees in fragmented landscapes may not serve to counteract deleterious reproductive and genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Microsatellites; Neotropical trees; Pollen sources; Tropical dry forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83555174884

Yield reduction in material improved for other traits is one of the main constraints caused by self-incompatibility (SI). Genes regulating SI in cacao have not been identified; therefore, knowledge of the location of genetic markers for and the effects of alleles determining SI will be useful for selecting uniformly self-compatible cultivars with higher yields. In a mapping population originating from a cross between a self-incompatible clone, Pound-7, and a self-compatible clone, UF-273, we observed important differences in flower retention at 15, 21, and 28 days after pollination. Our results suggest that the best time to measure flower retention is 15 days after pollination or later and that selecting self-compatibility (SC) thresholds is genotype specific. Using marker-trait association analysis we identified one marker, mTcCIR222, strongly associated with SC, as well as three surrounding markers (mTcCIR168, mTcCIR115 and mTcCIR158), all located near the proximal end of linkage group 4.

Agricultural irrigation and runoff solubilizes Se from these shales, causing buildups of toxic levels of selenate (SeO 4 2-) in water and soil. Our main objective was to investigate the accumulation of Se in two Brassicaceae species chosen for their potential as phytoremediators of Se contaminated soils. We tested the hypothesis that Se will accumulate in the pollen and nectar of two plant species and negatively affect floral traits and plant reproduction. Certain species of Brassicaceae can accumulate high concentrations of Se in their leaf tissues. In this study Se accumulation in plant tissues was investigated under greenhouse conditions. Se accumulator (Brassica juncea) and Se hyperaccumulator (Stanleya pinnata) plants were irrigated in sand culture with 0?M selenate (control), 8?M selenate, and 13?M selenate.Nectar and pollen in S. pinnata contained up to 150?gSemL -1 wet weight and 12900?gSeg -1dry weight when irrigated with 8?M selenate. Se levels in nectar (110?gSemL -1wet weight) and pollen (1700?gSeg -1dry weight) were not as high in B. juncea. Floral display width, petal area and seed pod length were significantly reduced in the 13?M selenate Se treatment in B. juncea. S. pinnata floral traits and seeds were unaffected by the Se treatments.This study provides crucial information about where some of the highest concentrations of Se are found in two phytoremediators, and may shed light on the potential risks pollinators may face when foraging upon these accumulating plants. In the field, duration of the plant's exposure, Se soil and water concentrations as well as other environmental factors may also play important roles in determining how much Se is accumulated into the leaf and floral tissues. Our greenhouse study shed light on two species' ability to accumulate Se, as well as determined the specific plant tissues where Se concentrations are highest. © 2011.",Brassica juncea; Floral traits; Hyperaccumulator; Pollinators; Selenium; Stanleya pinnata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054030636

Floral scents are complex blends of volatiles of different chemical classes, including benzenoids and terpenoids. It has been hypothesized that benzenoids have evolved as pollinator attracting signals, while monoterpenoids serve as defensive compounds against antagonists. In order to test this hypothesis, we reduced terpene emission in flowers of Phlox paniculata with specific biosynthetic inhibitors and compared the responses of Lasius niger ants to natural and inhibited floral scent bouquets. While the natural odors were strongly repellent to ants, the bouquets with a reduced emission rate of terpenoids were not. The loss of the flowers' ability to repel ants could be attributed predominantly to reduced amounts of linalool, a monoterpene alcohol. Flying flower visitors, mainly hoverflies, did not discriminate between the two types of flowers in an outdoor experiment. Since individual compounds appear to be capable of either attracting pollinators or defending the flower from enemies, the complexity of floral scent bouquets may have evolved to allow flowers to respond to both mutualists and antagonists simultaneously. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Biochemical pathways; Direct defense; Floral volatiles; Lasius niger; Olfactometer experiments; Phlox paniculata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155188799

The number of flowers per flower head, flower lifetime, anthesis events and other floral characteristics, such as flower size, color, nectar, scent, and osmophore location, were studied. Stigma receptivity and pollen viability were evaluated. The flowers were observed and documented in a scanning electron microscope, after receiving a proper treatment. Tests were performed to investigate the reproductive system, aiming to evaluate the reliance on pollinators. Floral visitors were observed directly in the field and their frequency, duration of visits and behavior on flowers were registered. M. bimucronata showed an annual flowering pattern. The pollen grains are united in polyades with eight cells, which are interpreted as an adaptation to minimize mixed pollen grain loads on the minute stigma. Fruit set was low in natural conditions and there was no occurrence of agamospermy or spontaneous self-pollination. The flower and inflorescence morphology allow access to several orders of visitors. Members of Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera were observed visiting the flower heads. The visits were mostly by M. bimucronata bees (56.4%). The results allowed to conclude that, although dependent on pollen vectors for reproduction, this is a generalist entomophilous species and, therefore, well adapted to ruderal environments where its presence is prevalent.",Mimosa bimucronata; Pollination; Polyads; Reproductive system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856689218

Gene flow estimates and geographic distances between populations did not correlate significantly (r = -0.0258, P &lt; 0.3550). The excess heterozygosity may be attributed to high pollinator mobility and inbreeding coefficient within the subpopulation, relative to the total FIS value.

It has been demonstrated that using a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) improves the tolerance of pupae to low temperatures. Carbon dioxide emission rates were compared between four different FTRs, all with a base temperature of 6°C and a daily high-temperature pulse. Four different high-temperature pulses were examined, 15 or 25°C for 2h and 20°C for 1 or 2h. A subset of pupae at the FTR base temperature of 6°C exhibited continuous gas exchange and, once ramped to 20 or 25°C, shifted to cyclic gas exchange. As temperatures were ramped down from the high-temperature pulse to 6°C, the pupae reverted to continuous gas exchange. The following conclusions about the effect of FTR on the CO 2 emissions of M. rotundata pupae exposed to low-temperature storage during the spring incubation were reached: 1) the high temperature component of the FTR was the best predictor of respiratory pattern; 2) neither pupal body mass nor days in FTR significantly affected which respiratory pattern was expressed during FTRs; 3) cyclic gas exchange was induced only in pupae exposed to temperatures greater than 15°C during the FTR high temperature pulse; and 4) a two hour pulse at 25°C doubled the number of CO 2 peaks observed during the FTR pulse as compared to a two hour pulse at 20°C. © 2011.",Chill-coma; Cyclic gas exchange; Fluctuating thermal regime; Metabolic rate; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053182784

These 'nectar guides' may be mutually beneficial, if they reduce pollinators' handling time, leading to an increased visitation rate and promoting pollen transfer. Yet, many details regarding how floral patterns influence foraging efficiency are unknown, as is the potential for pollinator learning to alter this relationship. 2.We compared the responses of bumblebee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) foragers to artificial flowers that either possessed or lacked star-like patterns. By presenting each bee with two different foraging scenarios (patterned flowers rewarding/plain flowers unrewarding, plain flowers rewarding/patterned flowers unrewarding) on different days, we were able to assess both short- and long-term effects of patterns on bee foraging behaviour. 3.Bees discovered rewards more quickly on patterned flowers and were less likely to miss the reward, regardless of whether corollas were circular or had petals. Nectar guides' effect on nectar discovery was immediate (innate) and persisted even after experience, although nectar discovery itself also had a learned component. We also found that bees departed patterned flowers sooner after feeding. Finally, when conditions changed such that flowers no longer provided a reward, bees visited the now-unrewarding flowers more persistently when they were patterned. 4.On the time-scale of a single foraging bout, our results provide some of the first data on how pollinators learn to forage efficiently using this common floral trait. Our bees' persistent response to patterned flowers even after rewards ceased suggests that, rather than being consistently mutually beneficial to plant and pollinator, nectar guide patterns can at times promote pollen transfer for the plant at the expense of a bee's foraging success. © 2011 The Authors.

In Sweden semi-natural pastures cover approximately 500,000. ha. However, power-line corridors, road verges and clear-cuts cover larger areas (in total about 2,000,000. ha), and these open, less intensively managed habitats are potentially important for species associated with taller vegetation and flower resources (e.g. pollinating insects). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative importance of semi-natural pastures and the other three open habitats for butterflies in 12 forest-farmland mosaic landscapes in south central Sweden. Species composition differed significantly between habitats in multivariate analyses. Power-line corridors and semi-natural pastures harbored several species that were disproportionally abundant in these habitats (13 and 8 species, respectively), and power-line corridors also harbored several species that were classified as typical in indicator species analyses. There were more butterfly species, higher abundances and a tendency for more individuals of red-listed species in power-line corridors than in the other three habitats. Effects of the surrounding landscape composition seemed to be weaker than that of the local habitat. However, species composition was significantly associated with landscape composition and species with intermediate and low mobility were more abundant in forested landscapes than in landscapes dominated by arable fields. Analyses of flying time and host plants for larvae suggest that early flying species and species associated with dwarf shrubs were more common in power-line corridors than in the other habitats. A landscape perspective, which takes several habitats into account, is needed for conservation of butterfly communities in forest-farmland landscapes. Power-line corridors and road verges offer possibilities for creating habitats that are suitable for pollinating insects through conservation-oriented management. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Clear-cut; Density; Forest road verge; Landscape composition; Power-line corridor; Rhopalocera; Semi-natural pasture; Species richness; Zygaenidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83555176195

However, the relative importance of these cues is not well understood. Bees are the most important animal pollinators worldwide and here, we determined the importance of decoupled and combined visual and olfactory cues of Lysimachia punctata (Primulaceae) for host plant location in both sexes of the specialized, solitary bee, Macropis fulvipes (Melittidae). Lysimachia-inexperienced female bees preferred olfactory over visual cues though visual cues increased the attractiveness of olfactory ones. In experienced females, the importance of visual cues was increased. Both Lysimachia-naive and -experienced males relied more on visual cues as compared to females. This study demonstrates that the relative weighting of cues used for host plant finding depends on the sex and experience of M. fulvipes.

Objective: To assess the performance of ten early open pollination maize varieties (OPVs) and their F1 hybrids for grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and also identify productive cultivars under low N fertilizer regimes. Materials and Methods: The trials were set up in a split plot arrangement with three N fertilizer levels (0, 45 and 90 kg N ha-1) as main plot and the genotypes as sub-plot. Each plot within N level was four-row, laid out in a randomized complete block design of four replications. Ten OPVs were crossed in a half diallel to generate 45 F1 hybrids during 2004 and 2005 growing seasons. Planting were carried out on 20th July, 2005 and 2nd July, 2006. Agronomic characters studied were grain yield, maize establishment count, days to 50% tasselling and silking as well as plant and ear heights. Results: The year 2005 growing season was better for all observed characters amongst all the genotypes than the year 2006. Although, expressions of these traits in the hybrids were relatively higher than the OPVs including the grain yield. The total increase in grain yield observed was 1.72 t ha-1 and 1.95 t ha-1 for OPVs and hybrids respectively on application of 90 kg ha-1 over no N-application. However, NUE was optimum at 45 kg N ha-1 in both groups. Grain yield and NUE correlated positively with growth characters measured except for days to 50% silking. Higher genetic gains were recorded for plant and ear heights. Conclusion: Two drought tolerant varieties (Acr 90 Pool 16-Dt and Tze Comp3 Dt) that combined well with specific cultivars for grain yield and NUE probably have gene pools for low N-tolerance.",Diallel crosses; Maize cultivars; Nitrogen use efficiency; Open pollinated varieties,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871553081

Structures produced on the petal surface, in particular cone-shaped papillate (or conical) cells, have been shown to enhance bumblebee preference for flowers. One reason for this increase in preference is that the conical cells facilitate efficient handling of flowers. This is particularly clear when flower architecture requires bees to land on a vertical surface. We therefore tested the hypothesis that flowers that are held vertically show a greater tendency to produce conical cells. Analysis of 183 species finds that there is no significant relationship between the structures on the petal surface and flower orientation. We discuss the multifunctional properties of conical cells and other floral surface structures that may mean that other factors are of equal or greater importance in the relationship between pollinators and petal epidermal form. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conical cell; Floral orientation; Grip; Pairwise comparisons; Plant surface; Tactile structures,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81455158993

In North America, a number of once widespread Bombus species have suffered serious reductions in range and abundance, although other species remain healthy. To examine whether declining and stable species exhibit different levels of genetic diversity or population fragmentation, we used microsatellite markers to genotype populations sampled across the geographic distributions of two declining (Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus) and four stable (Bombus bifarius; Bombus vosnesenskii; Bombus impatiens and Bombus bimaculatus) Bombus species. Populations of declining species generally have reduced levels of genetic diversity throughout their range compared to codistributed stable species. Genetic diversity can be affected by overall range size and degree of isolation of local populations, potentially confounding comparisons among species in some cases. We find no evidence for consistent differences in gene flow among stable and declining species, with all species exhibiting weak genetic differentiation over large distances (e.g. >1000 km). Populations on islands and at high elevations experience relatively strong genetic drift, suggesting that some conditions lead to genetic isolation in otherwise weakly differentiated species. B. occidentalis and B. bifarius exhibit stronger genetic differentiation than the other species, indicating greater phylogeographic structure consistent with their broader geographic distributions across topographically complex regions of western North America. Screening genetic diversity in North American Bombus should prove useful for identifying species that warrant monitoring, and developing management strategies that promote high levels of gene flow will be a key component in efforts to maintain healthy populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",allelic richness; conservation; heterozygosity; microsatellites; pollinators; population structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855218599

In a factorial design, we manipulated one putative attraction trait (number of flowers) and one putative efficiency trait (spur length) previously shown to be subject to pollinatormediated selection in the deceptive orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica. Removal of half of the flowers reduced pollen removal, proportion of flowers receiving pollen, fruit set, and fruit mass compared to unmanipulated plants, while spur-tip removal increased fruit set and fruit mass but did not affect pollen removal or proportion of flowers receiving pollen. The effect of spurtip removal on fruit mass was stronger among plants with intact number of flowers compared to plants with experimentally reduced number of flowers. The results demonstrate that number of flowers and spur length are direct targets of selection and may affect female fitness nonadditively. More generally, they show that the adaptive value of a given trait can depend on floral context and illustrate how experimental approaches can advance our understanding of the evolution of trait combinations. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Adaptive significance; Correlational selection; Dactylorhiza lapponica; Floral evolution; Mechanism of selection; Phenotypic manipulation experiment; Pollination by deceit; Pollination efficiency; Pollinator attraction; Pollinator-mediated selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84555178399

Although pollution is among the possible causes of the widely observed pollinator loss, it is still poorly investigated and no studies are known, so far to test the effects of heavy metal contamination in bumblebees (Bombidae) - the second most important group of managed pollinators after honey bees (Apis mellifera Linneaus). We have tested heavy metal (Pb, Cd, and Zn) accumulation, species diversity and parasite load (focusing on the common Nosema bombi Fantham and Porter, Microsporidia: Nosematidae) in bumblebees. For this purpose, we have chosen three heavy metal gradients (Guryevsk, Belovo and Olkusz) and two additional control sites (Kouznetskiy Alatau and Gornaya Shoria). All gradients were approximately 20 km long, starting in close proximity (1.3 km or less) of an active zinc or metal smelter, and each consisting of 5 sites located on semi-natural or degraded meadows in various distance from the smelter. On each site min. 50 bumblebees were caught by sweep nets, each individual identified to species level and next, its abdomen homogenized and used for assessment of N. bombi infestation. Heavy metal levels in soil of the tested gradients varied between (Pb: 13.6-814.2 mg kg -1, Cd: 0.14-20.3 mg kg -1, Zn: 67.0-889.3 mg kg -1) Bumblebees accumulated Pb and Cd (Pb: 0.21-3.3 mg kg -1, Cd: 0.002-0.069 mg kg -1) in their bodies. The content of these metals in bumblebee bodies correlated with their content in soil (Pb: P &lt;0.01, Cd: P = 0.002). However, no correlation was found between the Zn contents in bumblebees (Zn: 74.7-81.9 mg kg -1) and the soil. We have also found that the metal contents in soil or in the bodies of bumblebees caused no changes in species diversity or dominance on polluted sites, irrespective of type and the level of contamination. The variation of Shannon diversity (H'), as well as Simpson's diversity (D) were similar in all studied sites and ranged from 0.543 to 0.81 and from 0.152 to 0.484 respectively. The proportion of infected individuals was generally not higher than 0.29 and did not differ significantly among the studied sites. Incidentally, based on variation in the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene, we have found a new strain of Nosema bombi in the Kouznetskiy Alatau and Gornaya Shoria (West Siberia, Kemerovo Region) samples. The new small subunit RNA sequence in the new strain of N. bombi was named N. bombi WS2 (West Siberia) SSU rRNA.

'Local' seed is often prescribed for restoration but in fragmented landscapes this restricts collecting to small, inbred populations. Six polymorphic microsatellites were used to examine genetic diversity and population genetic structure in seed collected from 18 fragmented natural populations and three restored populations of the wind-pollinated and dispersed tree Allocasuarina verticillata, a key restoration species. Smaller populations produced seed crops with significantly fewer alleles, lower allelic richness and less gene diversity. Most of the populations assessed, including the restored sites, produce genetically diverse seed crops suitable for restoration but smaller populations (<30 plants) should be augmented with seed from larger populations. Principal coordinate analysis, graph-theory and Bayesian analyses found little evidence of spatially predictable genetic structure across the study region, which probably reflects long distance gene dispersal preventing the development of strong spatial structure. The absence of strong spatial patterns suggests that seed can be moved beyond current 550-km limits while being mindful of strong selection gradients or conditions that might indicate locally adapted populations. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856846800

In forests of NW Patagonia, the only native bumble bee and major pollinator, Bombus dahlbomii, declined almost to extinction as the alien B. ruderatus increased in abundance since its first appearance about 17 years ago. To explore whether resource competition might have driven this displacement we studied the behavior and foraging efficiency of both bumble bees while they harvested nectar from flowers of Alstroemeria aurea, the main summer food resource in the forests of NW Patagonia. We compared the nectar content of flowers that bees selected, recently visited, and rejected with that of randomly-chosen neighboring flowers and assessed differences in visitation rates. The native bumble bee selects flowers with abundant nectar and mostly exploits nectar-rich flower patches by rejecting a higher proportion of flowers with little or no nectar. On the other hand, the alien bumble bee discriminated less with respect to sugar content per visited flower, but visited more flowers per minute. Workers of the native bumble bee harvested ~70% more sugar per unit of time than those of the alien species in absolute terms, and a similar amount when sugar harvested was expressed as a percentage of body mass. In contrast to expectation, the opportunistic foraging of the alien bumblebee was not more efficient and therefore cannot explain the ecological extinction of the native species through exploitative competition. These findings suggest that the displacement of the native species by the alien may be driven by other factors, such as the associated introduction of novel diseases or parasites. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Alstroemeria aurea; Bumble-bee invasion; Foraging efficiency; Native displacement; Nectar; Resource competition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80255130612

The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm, including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs).

A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes. The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested. Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns.

Bimodal networks are often analysed after being transformed into unimodal ones, since most attributes in network theory are defined for the latter. Such unimodal projections (e.g. of plants sharing flower visitors or seed dispersers) map potential inter-specific competition or facilitation, and can thus be useful for instance when identifying native species potentially sensitive to aliens in the communities. In this work, we introduce procedures to project unweighted and weighted bimodal networks into unimodals, for animals or plants, and calculate two centrality measures that inform us about the species' role in the communities. By using 20 empirical weighted networks worldwide, we obtained 160 unimodal networks via four projection methods and evaluated correlations among centrality parameters across the different methodologies to assess how consistent the results are when including different link weights between species. Degree centralities obtained by projecting unweighted and weighted bimodal networks were not significantly correlated, suggesting that the role of the species differs when considering link weights in the original bimodal networks. By contrast, betweenness centralities were highly correlated, indicating the consistent importance of the species as connectors regardless of the projection method used. We conclude that preserving the weighted information when transforming bimodal into unimodal networks may allow us to make more realistic predictions on the potential competitive or facilitative interactions among species of one set (e.g. plants) that share species of the other (e.g. flower visitors or dispersers). © 2011 Gesellschaft für ökologie.",Degree centrality; Pollination; Seed dispersal; Species strength; Weighted and unweighted betweenness centrality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255192544

Elastic deformation of the entire structure replaces the need for local hinges. This change becomes possible by using fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) such as glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) that can combine high tensile strength with low bending stiffness, thus offering a large range of calibrated elastic deformations. The employment of elasticity within a structure facilitates not only the generation of complex geometries, but also takes the design space a step further by creating elastic kinetic structures, here referred to as pliable structures. In this paper, the authors give an insight into the abstraction strategies used to derive elastic kinetics from plants, which show a clear interrelation of form, actuation and kinematics. Thereby, the focus will be on form-finding and simulation methods which have been adopted to generate a biomimetic principle which is patented under the name Flectofin.

The floral biology of this species was studied in cultivated individuals to describe phenology, flower longevity, reproductive system (using manipulative treatment of cross-pollination vs. self-pollination) and floral pollinators. Moreover, direct observations were made on plants exposed outdoors to identify pollinators, describing their foraging behavior and the duration of visits. The results showed that G. bifolia is a mainly self-incompatible, non-autogamous and pollinator-dependent species. The fruit set in manually cross-pollination flowers (100%) was higher than the manually self-pollinated flowers (30.8%), whereas the control flowers did not set fruits. Females of Centris trigonoides (Apidae, Centridini) were the exclusive pollinators, and the visit rate was low. Several Neotropical orchids of the subtribe Oncidiinae offer floral oils to the pollinators, like the Malpighiaceae familiy. Our results allow inferring that both groups of plants would be part of a guild of species pollinated by oil-collecting bees and that the deceit/pollination syndrome should not be applied to all Oncidiinae flowers.","Floral biology; Oil-rewarding flower; Oncidiinae, reproduction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861109488

This 3-year study examined the pollinator activity and the seed production in three populations of Lepidium papilliferum, a threatened mustard endemic to sagebrush-steppe habitat in southwest Idaho. Relative amounts of time visitor taxa spent foraging on flowers, visitation rates (number of flowers visited per unit time during a foraging bout), and pollination effectiveness (fruit set per single visit to a virgin flower) were recorded for each of 12 insect taxa that visited L. papilliferum flowers. Relative contributions to seed production were calculated as the product of relative interaction frequencies (the relative number of flowers visited by each taxon-the ""quantity"" component of pollination) and pollination effectiveness (fruit set per single visit to a virgin flower-the ""quality"" component of pollination). Despite the superiority of some insect taxa in terms of pollination effectiveness, estimates of relative pollinator contributions to seed production were influenced primarily by an insect taxon's interaction frequency with flowers. Pollinator assemblages varied widely both spatially and temporally, which suggest that L. papilliferum is not under strong selective pressure to shift from its generalist pollination strategy toward greater specialization. For this threatened plant, reliance on a diverse assemblage of insect pollinators may serve as an important buffer against disruption in reproductive success caused by fluctuations in population sizes of individual pollinator taxa. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Insect-mediated pollination; Interaction frequency; Lepidium papilliferum; Pollination effectiveness; Seed set; Threatened plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81455141490

In Europe, the distribution area of wild beet is limited to a few mountainous and coastal sites, and Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima L. Arcang. is the only wild beet species of importance in sugar beet cultivation/ multiplication areas. In Germany it can be found on Helgoland Island and at coastal sites between Fehmarn Island and Kiel. In 2010, sugar beet was cultivated on roughly 1.5 million ha in Europe, 380,000 ha of which were in Germany (WVZ 2010). Basic and certified seed are solely produced and processed in the favourable climate of a few regions in northern Italy and southern France, whereas pre-basic seed is exclusively produced in the immediate vicinity of a few breeding stations in Europe. The seed companies are solely responsible for seed production and processing and place great emphasis on relevant management. Hybrid variety seed is produced via stecklings, which are planted in rows to ensure pollen transfer from the male fertile pollinator to the male sterile maternal line. For four weeks during flowering, pollen can be transported over a distance of > 500 m by wind. To prevent seed contamination by cross-pollination, seed production is spatially separated from sugar beet growing areas and wild beet habitats. After harvest, the seed is delivered without losses in sealed containers first to regionally and later centrally located seed processing stations. After processing, the seed is marketed in sealed packages. The pelleted seed is placed precisely into the prepared seed bed and covered with soil. Seed dispersal is rare, but can occur within areas susceptible to water erosion. Such erosion can be avoided by mulching. Seeds split open by mice are incapable of germination because the endosperm is eaten. About 90% of seeds capable of germination (germination capacity in the laboratory about 95%) emerge. Seeds that do not emerge are not viable under the respective environmental conditions in the field. Sugar beet are biennial plants forming a beet in their first season. If the beets are not harvested, flowering shoots appear in the second year after vernalisation. However, the formation of flowering shoots (bolters) in the first year is possible (probability < 0.05%) owing to the genetic constitution of the plants and/or certain weather conditions. The flowers of bolters from hybrid varieties are semi-fertile, that is the seed set is lower than that of bolters from formerly grown, fully fertile varieties. Cross-pollination from cultivated beet to wild beet populations and vice versa requires spatially overlapping populations, synchronous flowering periods as well as adequate wind strength, wind direction and low air humidity. Because of the different flowering periods of cultivated and wild beet, their populations maintain their genetic divergence. A gene flow from cultivated beet to wild beet populations can be prevented through spatial separation of sugar beet cultivation. Annual bastards result from crosses between wild beets, annual bolting cultivated beets and flowering seed beets. Because they flower earlier, they are more crucial in terms of gene flow than bolters from hybrid varieties that flower later. Bolting sugar beets as well as bastards are of minor agronomic value and, therefore, usually eliminated by hand, mechanically or partly by selective herbicides. If such bolters are not removed, they develop seeds and establish a seed bank, becoming a permanent reservoir for germinating weed beets. The sugar beet root consists of two parts: the beet comprising the root, hypocotyl and lower compressed stem with dead petioles; and the crown, which is the upper compressed stem with living petioles. The upper part of the stem is potentially capable of regeneration. During harvesting, the beets are topped mechanically, but not in an optimal way for each beet. Losses of small beets and crowns of low topped beets that are capable of regeneration can be reduced by the adjustment of working speeds and lifters to the harvesting conditions. However, a certain proportion of crowns and small beets that are more or less capable of regeneration remain in the field, which are either buried through grubbing or ploughing during the sowing of the following crop or remain on the surface through mulching. Such remains are a good feed for wild boars, wild geese and others. Small beets or beet parts that survive over winter can completely be controlled by agronomic measures in the following crop. Damage caused by game animals can also occur during the vegetation period but, in general, the upper compressed stem with living petioles that is capable of regeneration is eaten preferentially. Immediately after the harvest, the beets are delivered to the sugar factory or stored temporarily in clamps at the field margin. Proper loading and locking of the goods to be conveyed as well as the correct return of lost beets and beet parts during loading effectively prevent the dispersal of plant material potentially capable of regeneration. In the sugar factory, the beets are cleaned in the beet washing house - either immediately or after temporary storage - and subsequently extracted at high temperatures. Cleaned leaf remains or small beet parts are incapable of regeneration and are either sold as animal feed together with pressed pulp or fermented in biogas plants in the sugar factory. Washed soil tare is stored for about three years and returned to the field or used for other purposes. Therefore, the sugar factory is a ""closed system"", in which all plant parts capable of regeneration are degenerated, products are sold and residual material is recycled. Besides sugar production, sugar and fodder beets are used as a substrate for biogas plants.",Beet residues; Closed systems; Distribution areas; Incross; Outcross; Pollen transfer; Seed processing; Seed propagation; Small beets,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865312289

The results showed that total 150 seedlings only occurred on line transects in riverside Dure population, but they all died half a month later; no seedlings occurred in other four hinterland desert populations indicating recruitment was a failure at all populations although flowers were plentiful. Reproductive success depends on pollinators. Nectar is 'reward' for pollinators, with 0.06 ?L-0.12 ?L and 0.15 ?L-0.35 ?L per flower in Dure and Kabu populations, respectively, in continuously two secreting days. Spontaneous self pollination is rare with nearly zero fruit production. Geitonogamous self pollination is predominant with 14.47% fruit set.

Consequently, the Dure population exhibited a significantly higher germination rate (about 90%) than those in other populations (about 30%).

Plants utilize self-incompatibility system as a genetic barrier to prevent self pollen from developing on the pistil, leading to hybrid vigor and diversity. In Brassica (canola, kale, and broccoli), an allele-specific interaction between the pollen SCR/SP11 (S-locus cysteine rich protein/S locus protein 11) and the pistil S Receptor Kinase, results in the activation of SRK which recruits the Arm Repeat Containing 1 (ARC1) E3 ligase to the proteasome. The targets of Arm Repeat Containing 1 are proposed to be compatibility factors, which when targeted for degradation by Arm Repeat Containing 1 results in pollen rejection. Despite the fact that protein degradation is predicted to be important for successful self-pollen rejection, the identity of the various proteins whose abundance is altered by the SI pathway has remained unknown. To identify potential candidate proteins regulated by the SI response, we have used the two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis analysis, coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight/MS. We identified 56 differential protein spots with 19 unique candidate proteins whose abundance is down-regulated following self-incompatible pollinations. The identified differentials are predicted to function in various pathways including biosynthetic pathways, signaling, cytoskeletal organization, and exocytosis. From the 19 unique proteins identified, we investigated the role of tubulin and the microtubule network during both self-incompatible and compatible pollen responses.

We also analyze natural flower motions exhibited by four hawkmoth-pollinated species. Our analysis shows these flowers have higher amplitude motions in the horizontal axis than that in the looming axis.

Milkweeds (Secamonoideae and Asclepiadoideae; Apocynaceae) are typically small plants of seasonally dry habitats, with pollinia and high pollen-transfer effi ciency. Their sister group (tribe Baisseeae and Dewevrella) is mostly comprised of giant lianas of African rainforests, with pollen in monads. Comparison of the two groups motivated a new hypothesis: milkweeds evolved in the context of African aridifi cation and the shifting of rainforest to dry forest. Pollinia and high pollen-transfer effi ciency may have been adaptations that alleviated mate-finding Allee effects generated by high mortality during droughts. We formally tested whether milkweeds have a drier climate niche by comparing milkweeds with plesiomorphic traits (Secamonoideae) and the milkweed sister group in continental Africa. Methods: We georeferenced specimens of the milkweed sister group and Secamonoideae in continental Africa, extracted 19 climatic variables from the Worldclim model, conducted factor analysis to identify correlated suites of variables, and compared the frequency distributions of the two lineages relative to each factor. Key results: The distributions of Secamonoideae and the milkweed sister group differed signifi cantly relative to four factors, each correlated with a distinct suite of climate parameters: (1) air temperature (Secamonoideae: cooler), (2) total and (3) summer precipitation (Secamonoideae: drier), and (4) temperature seasonality and isothermality (Secamonoideae: more seasonal and less isothermal). Conclusions: Secamonoideae in continental Africa inhabit drier, cooler sites than do the milkweed sister group, consistent with a shift from rainforests to dry forests in a cooling climate. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Africa; Allee effect; Apocynaceae; Aridifi cation; Climate niche; Functional evolution; Pollen-transfer efficiency; Pollination; Pollinium; Tropical forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858386953

We asked whether removal of CWD affected the structure and functioning of an arid woodland ecosystem in mid-western Argentina. These woodlands are protected by national laws and inhabited by indigenous local pastoralists who have land rights to use natural resources, including wood for fuel and construction material. We hypothesized that removal of CWD affected negatively the populations of wood-nesting pollinators, the reproductive performance of Prosopis flexuosa (the dominant tree species), plant cover, richness and composition, and nutrient cycling in the soil. We conducted a manipulative experiment consisting of four pairs of 70. m radius circular plots, each pair with an experimental (CWD removal) and a control (no removal) plots. Experimental CWD extraction affected negatively flower visitor abundance, although the magnitude of this effect decreased over time. In contrast, extraction had a significant, positive effect on seed production of P. flexuosa. No significant effects of extraction were found on cover, richness and composition of understory plants and soil properties. Thus, CWD did not have the generally negative effects expected under our hypotheses. © 2011 CONICET/Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.",Argentina; Monte Desert; Plant reproduction; Pollination; Soil properties; Wood extraction; Wood-nesting bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255192240

However, Eurasian columbines show similar taxonomic diversity despite to be mainly pollinated by bumblebees. This situation makes Eurasian columbines an ideal counterpoint to explore diversification process under low pollinator diversity but high environmental heterogeneity scenarios. In this paper we explore diversification rates and patterns of habitat (habitat and altitudinal range) transitions underlying the European columbines evolution. A density-dependent lineal model of diversification best fitted our data, which implies a lineal decrease of diversification rate through radiation. Our results point to an important role of habitat (14.3-15.8 habitat transitions) in driving European columbines diversification. Habitat and altitudinal range reconstruction showed a pattern from wide altitudinal range (encompassing 1000-1200 m) and generalist ancestors to narrow altitudinal ranges (= 800 m) and open-rocky habitats in more recent taxa (i.e. those species inhabiting mountains regions of South Europe). Ecological opportunity has been the preferred explanation for density-dependence diversification during a radiation. Glacial impacts on European flora and the coincidence of the initiation of the radiation with the onset of Mediterranean climate probably did generate ecological opportunities for niche expansion and habitat specialization and evolution. However, we suggest that some biological features of Aquilegia (low seed dispersal, small population sizes and frequent inbreeding depression) unrelated to ecological opportunity together with the orography might also be involved in density-dependent speciation and habitat evolution in this genus. Specifically, we propose that high geographical isolation between and within distinct South European peninsulas, restricted geographical range size and specialization on open-rocky habitats combined with low seed dispersal might have contributed to the density-dependence mode of diversification in European columbines.",Altitudinal range; Aquilegia; Density-dependent diversification; European columbines; Glaciations; Habitat specialization; South european peninsulas,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855925842

To help distinguish among the contributions of these different dispersal modes to the orchid species richness on the island of Sardinia, we investigated the genetic structure and phylogeographic relationship of the only Platanthera bifolia var. kuenkelei population on the island. By using plastid DNA sequence variation, we show that this recently discovered population is more closely related to the Tunisian P.bifolia var. kuenkelei than to the geographically closer P.bifolia populations from peninsular Italy. Results from haplotype network construction support the hypothesis that the current distribution of P.bifolia var. kuenkelei (Sardinia and Tunisia) is most likely explained by over-sea dispersal. However, haplotype diversity and mismatch analysis of this unique Sardinian population suggest that, if a long-distance dispersal event did occur, it was not recent. More likely, temporarily favourable climatic conditions generated a suitable habitat on the island (also in terms of suitable mycorrhizas and pollinators) and thus a transient opportunity for seedling growth and population establishment of P.bifolia var. kuenkelei from North Africa.© 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 167, 466-475. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Mediterranean basin; Phylogeography; Plant distribution; Plastid DNA; Seed long-distance dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855194763

To assess the genetic constitution of fragmented Polylepis australis mountain forests of central Argentina, analyses of the structure and diversity of ISSR markers were carried out for 90 trees distributed throughout five river basins with differing degrees of fragmentation. Overall, average polymorphism (P) ranged between 87.2 and 94.9% (95% criterion) while marker diversity index (M) varied between 0.35 and 0.39; values which are comparable with other wind-pollinated tree species. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that most genetic variation occurred within river basins (97.8%), with only a little occurring between river basins (2.2%; ? ST = 0.02). In addition, Mantel's test indicated that P. australis does not follow the usual pattern of isolation by distance; instead the UPGMA method showed that trees from the two most degraded river basins formed a group while trees from the three better preserved basins formed another. As such, either effective pollen flow has maintained high levels of genetic diversity, or present day genetic variability is a remnant of a recently fragmented ancestral panmictic population. We conclude that, at present, genetic degradation in P. australis populations of central Argentina is not as important as ecological degradation - such as soil loss, intensive browsing by livestock or increased frequencies of wildfires, and that genetic variability is still fully available for forest restoration.",Argentina; Conservation; Fragmentation; Genetic diversity; ISSR; Polylepis australis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858422076

The pollen study reveals the dominance of conifers, especially of Pinus along with lower value of associated taxa, viz., Cedrus, Picea, Abies and Tsuga. However, broad leaved taxa, like Quercus, Alnus, Betula, etc. are represented rank-wise in lesser frequency as compared to the conifers. Among nonarboreals, grasses are predominant over other alpine herbs like Verbenaceae, Fabacae, Tubuliflorae, Artemisia, Rubiaceae and Potentilla, signifying the existence of alpine meadow in the valley. The fair value of Cerealia along with Caryophyllaceae, Xanthium, Chenopodiaceae, Acanthaceae and Apiaceae indicate the pastoral activity in near vicinity. The pollen analysis reflects predominance of the extra-regional arboreals over local nonarboreals. From the present study, it is also evident that high concentration of Pine pollen in the atmosphere, insect pollination of several species in the extant vegetation and the biotic pressure on ground vegetation vitiate the pollen spectra so that the vegetation composition is not adequately reflected by them. Moreover, it is to be noted that pollen content from moss cushion/surface samples, if considered in complete ignorance of the botanical framework of the valley would reveal that the valley is wooded and is devoid of open areas (meadow). But this is contrary to what is observed there. It is, therefore, very significant that actual significance of the AP/NAP ratio should be assessed not only honestly but also in accordance with a thorough botanical knowledge of the area. Marked evidence of crop pollen (> 60?m: cerealia) along with culture pollen (weeds) already alarms that the open vegetation is under intensive anthropogenic pressure, due to which the true AP/NAP ratio becomes misleading. Evidence of fair amount of fungal spores, mostly belonging to Deuteromycetes and Ascomycetes suggest that they have probably originated from nearby pastoral area. Among fern the allies, monolete spores dominate triletes, suggesting an average drier climate condition in and around the study area as found today. The whole study although does not fully cohere with the extant vegetation, the permutation and combination of the palynodata could be a significant measure for palaeoclimatic interpretation since LGM in Pindar valley. © 2011 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.",Kumaun Himalaya; Modern Pollen Assemblage; Pindar Valley; Pollen Analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859172404

Scholars from other disciplines such as history, sociology, literature, and cultural studies, that do not traditionally cross-pollinate ideas with neuroscientists, also study memory from a variety of angles. In this article, we describe the founding of a multidisciplinary discussion series in which faculty and staff from the arts, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences come together to explain how memory is integral to their scholarship and teaching. After panelists from different disciplines present opening comments, the floor is open for discussion with the audience that includes students, staff, and community members, as well as other faculty. Each year the series is anchored by a keynote address by an eminent scholar engaged in cross-disciplinary memory research. We outline the benefits of such thematic discussion series, highlighting the synchrony with the academy's increasing focus on interdisciplinarity, and on the need to train scholars to speak clearly about their work beyond their own disciplinary boundaries. More specifically, we focus on the need to train scientists to communicate with non-scientists. We have experienced success with this series and believe that the format could be adapted to a wide range of issues that cross disciplines (e.g., development, language, music, environmental studies). © 2011 Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience.",Interdisciplinarity; Memory; Multidisciplinary discussion series; Scientist/non-scientist dialogue; Speaker series,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859119872

This species presents particular floral syndromes including violet, tubular flowers with trichome elaiophores that produce oil. Oil flowers are associated with specialised bees with an oil-collecting apparatus. To better understand the reproductive biology of M. aphylla, the mating system, flowering phenology, the associated pollinator assemblage and foraging behaviour was determined at the southern-most part of its distributional range. Results were compared with those of previous studies and discussed. At this southern location M. aphylla is a self-incompatible species; it relies on pollinators for fruit production and presented a low fruit set. Flowering occurred during the spring, from October to December. M. aphylla was pollinated by three species of bees (Apidae); two generalist species (Centris brethesi and Mesonychium jenseni) and one specialist to M. aphylla (Centris vardyorum). M. jenseni is a cleptoparasite of Centris species. Centris species are oil-collecting bees and showed territorial behaviour (i.e. they always visited a restricted group of plants which they protected from other visitors), they visited several flowers/plants, which enhanced geitonogamous self-pollination and reduced pollination efficiency, and which might explain the low natural fruit set observed in M. aphylla. C. vardyorum was the most important pollinator of M. aphylla in the study area. The reproductive biology of M. aphylla differs along its distributional range. Apparently, southern populations of M. aphylla are more specialised than the northern populations, the former being pollinated by a few related pollinator species whereas at the northern location a variety of visitors were observed. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856833506

The lack of efficient pollinators and dichogamy are often argued to be the main constraints resulting in this low reproductive success. Herein, we describe the reproductive barriers exhibited by this crop and whether wind and insects play a role in cherimoya pollination in Spain, the main region of cultivation. A. cherimola exhibits marked protogynous dichogamy with large differences in the duration of female (around 28 h) and male (>8 h) phases. Stigma receptivity and pollen release do not fully coincide with the morphological changes of the petals defining the female and male phases. Synchronization of sexual phases among different flowers from different trees of the same genotype was high during the whole blooming season. Effective herkogamy of approach type also limits pollen deposition within the same flower. Wind does not play any role in cherimoya pollination. Insect visitors to cherimoya flowers in Spain were found to be inefficient in transferring pollen grains. Cherimoya flowers do not reject self-pollen to achieve fertilization. A. cherimola shows preferential allogamy based on efficient dichogamy reinforced by elevated synchrony among flowers in their sexual phases. Herkogamy hampers autogamy, although pollen deposition by gravity in cherimoya pendulous flowers explains the reduced reproductive success observed in isolated flowers. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Annona cherimola; Annonaceae; Dichogamy; Herkogamy; Reproductive barriers; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80955163796

General theory predicts that mixed-mating populations should evolve quickly toward high rates of selfing, driven by rapid purging of genetic load and loss of inbreeding depression (ID), but the substantial number of mixed-mating species observed in nature calls this prediction into question. Lower average ID reported for selfing than for outcrossing populations is consistent with purging and suggests that mixed-mating taxa in evolutionary transition will have intermediate ID. We compared the magnitude of ID from published estimates for highly selfing (r > 0.8), mixed-mating (0.2 ?r? 0.8), and highly outcrossing (r < 0.2) plant populations across 58 species. We found that mixed-mating and outcrossing taxa have equally high average lifetime ID (?= 0.58 and 0.54, respectively) and similar ID at each of four life-cycle stages. These results are not consistent with evolution toward selfing in most mixed-mating taxa. We suggest that prevention of purging by selective interference could explain stable mixed mating in many natural populations.

We combined several vegetation databases to test whether patterns of changes in plant diversity after land abandonment in different habitats followed similar pathways. The impacts of land abandonment and subsequent woody colonization on vegetation composition and plant traits were studied in five semi-natural open habitats and two arable habitats in six regions of Europe. For each habitat, vegetation surveys were carried out in different stages of succession using either permanent or non-permanent plots. Consecutive stages of succession were defined on a physiognomic basis from initial open stages to late woody stages. Changes in vegetation composition, species richness, numbers of species on Red Lists, plant strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values of the vegetation, Grime CSR strategy types and seven ecological traits were assessed for each stage of the successional pathway. Abandonment of agro-pastoral land-use and subsequent woody colonization were associated with changes in floristic composition. Plant richness varied according to the different habitats and stages of succession, but semi-natural habitats differed from arable fields in several ecological traits and vegetation responses. Nevertheless, succession occurred along broadly predictable pathways. Vegetation in abandoned arable fields was characterized by a decreasing importance of R-strategists, annuals, seed plants with overwintering green leaves, insect-pollinated plants with hemi-rosette morphology and plants thriving in nutrient-rich conditions, but an increase in species considered as endangered according to the Red Lists. Conversely, changes in plant traits with succession within the initially-open semi-natural habitats showed an increase in plants thriving in nutrient-rich conditions, stress-tolerant plants and plants with sexual and vegetative reproduction, but a sharp decrease in protected species. In conclusion, our study showed a set of similarities in responses of the vegetation in plant traits after land abandonment, but we also highlighted differences between arable fields and semi-natural habitats, emphasizing the importance of land-use legacy. © 2011 The Author(s).",Arable field; Natural forest regeneration; Secondary succession; Semi-natural habitat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81955168120

However, network research is, generally, short-term and depict ecological networks as static structures only, devoid of any dynamics. This hampers our understanding of how nature responds to larger disturbances such as changes in climate. In order to remedy this we studied the long-term (12-yrs) dynamics of a flower-visitation network, consisting of flower-visiting butterflies and their nectar plants. Global network properties, i.e. numbers of species and links, as well as connectance, were temporally stable, whereas most species and links showed a strong temporal dynamics. However, species of butterflies and plants varied bimodally in their temporal persistance: Sporadic species, being present only 1-2(-5) years, and stable species, being present (9-)11-12 years, dominated the networks. Temporal persistence and linkage level of species, i.e. number of links to other species, made up two groups of species: Specialists with a highly variable temporal persistence, and temporally stable species with a highly variable linkage level. Turnover of links of specialists was driven by species turnover, whereas turnover of links among generalists took place through rewiring, i.e. by reshuffling existing interactions. However, in spite of this strong internal dynamics of species and links the network appeared overall stable. If this global stability-local instability phenomenon is general, it is a most astonishing feature of ecological networks. © 2011 Olesen et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857887503

In the context of Genetically Modified Organisms, approaches to quantify geneflow in small-scale systems are widely unexplored. We aimed at bridging this gap by contributing to the scientific discussion on the uncertainties of the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops in the region. The safety issue is: Would it be possible to withdraw a variety in case that unexpected and undesirable effects occur? e.g. the resistance of pests which make the variety no more useful. Methods: We used a GIS approach to determine the location of maize cultivation sites, field geometries and applied a model for the calculation of geneflow scenarios. Results: The data revealed that the given cropping density provides optimal conditions for transgene spread, potentially limiting the possibility for coexistence between GM and non-GM fields. On average, we found about 60 fields within a nearest distance of 100 m, and cropping density of 56 fields per square kilometer. The resulting cross-pollination rate from the single GM field into the neighbouring conventional fields was estimated to be about 0.12%. Conclusions: GM varieties if introduced could remain in cultivation even if their admission has expired or has been retracted. This would be undesirable and could cause long-term, undesirable stacked combination of transgenes which cannot be tested with respect to eventual combinatory effects. These developments pose major challenges for fielder livelihoods, and conservation of maize genetic resources with potentially negative consequences for the African food export sector. © 2011 Aheto et al.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867215747

However, many flowering plant species are derived through allopolyploidization, i.e. interspecific hybridization with genome doubling. This mode of plant speciation can be expected to considerably alter the consequences of inbreeding and outbreeding. We investigated the F1 fitness consequences of mating over a range of (genetic) distances in the allohexaploid plant species Geum urbanum. Offspring was raised under controlled conditions (632 plants).

To understand the significance of acorn abortion in Quercus serrata, artificial pollination of different mating patterns (outcross, self-, and nonpollination) was performed, and the timing of abortion and the size and internal development of acorns from each mating type were investigated. Acorns were aborted similarly in every pollination treatment until 80 days after pollination. Almost all self- and nonpollinated acorns were rapidly aborted during the period 80-120 days after pollination. During that period, differences in internal fruit development between outcross-pollinated and unsuitably pollinated (self- and nonpolinated) acorns were observed. In addition, cotyledon development and a rapid increase in fruit size were observed in the acorns gained by outcross pollination. The correspondence between the timing of abortion and the timing of rapid size growth and the development of storage organs suggests that this acorn-maintenance strategy may be the consequence of a maternal adaptation that allows better reproductive success under resource limitation. © 2010 The Japanese Forest Society and Springer.",Abortion; Acorn development; Acorn-maintenance strategy; Mating pattern; Quercus serrata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255143123

First, habitat fragmentation can produce a mosaic genetic structure. Second, life history aspects of a species such as dispersion, mating system, and pollination can generate a genetic structure at a finer level. The interplay of these levels has rarely been studied together. In order to assess the effects of forest fragmentation we analyzed the genetic structure at two spatial scales of the terrestrial orchid Cyclopogon luteoalbus, which lives in patches inside forest fragments in a cloud forest of eastern Mexico. We hypothesized high differentiation between forest fragments and strong spatial genetic structure within fragments under this scenario of strong fragmentation and restricted dispersal patterns. Using 11 allozymic loci we found high genetic diversity at fragment level with moderate differentiation among fragments, and at patch level, strong and variable spatial genetic structure among life cycle stages with high inbreeding coefficients. We also found bottlenecks indicating recent population size reductions. While both inbreeding and restricted seed dispersal may explain the strong spatial genetic structure at patch level, reduction in population size may explain the genetic structure at fragment level. However, the levels of genetic diversity indicate that some between-fragment gene flow has occurred. Bottlenecks and high inbreeding at patch level may result in local extinctions, but as long as an important number of fragments remain, patch recolonization through immigration is possible in C. luteoalbus. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Allozymes; Autocorrelation; Heterozygosity; Inbreeding; Outcrossing rate; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80955163800

Earl's Together) during growth, maturation and ripening stages were investigated in relation to ethylene and respiration production. While melons exhibited a small respiration peak 48 days after pollination (DAP), ethylene production was negligible throughout the developmental stages. Thus, this cultivar should be classified as a non-climacteric type. Using headspace SPME, 27 aroma volatile compounds were identified (10 esters, 8 aldehydes, 7 alcohols, 1 sulfur compound and 1 terpene). Among them, (Z)-6-nonenal, nonanal, (E,Z)-2,6-nonadienal and (E)-2-nonenal were largely and mainly found in immature fruits, and they were still major to the later stages. However, from 45 DAP many esters appeared and their percentages increased as fruits were ripening. Two major ester formation genes, alcohol dehydrogenase and alcohol acyl transferase transcriptions were up-regulated to some extent. For that reason, it may be possible to form ester compounds in non-climacteric melons through ethylene independent pathways. © 2011 Korean Society for Horticultural Science.",climacteric; ethylene; flavor; respiration; ripening,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864487817

The CTRAMP models are characterized by features such as a full simulation of travel decisions for discrete households and persons, explicit tracking of time in half-hourly increments, the use of time constraints on the generation of travel, and explicitly modeled intrahousehold interactions across a range of activity and travel dimensions. These important features allow for greater behavioral realism in representing the response to numerous transportation policies. Each implementation of the CT-RAMP system, as for many ABM systems used in practice over the years, shares certain common features with others. However, each implementation is tailored to address specific regional conditions and includes additional advanced features to provide increased policy sensitivity and greater behavioral realism. These features are explained in the paper and analyzed in the context of model applications for different transportation projects and policies. Some of these features stem from ongoing intensive research and development in the field, including cross-pollination of ideas between the CT-RAMP family and other ABMs developed elsewhere, but many other features are unique and were driven by practical needs. The main conclusion of this paper is that it is too early to establish a completely generic and standard approach to an ABM design in practice. The evolution of features in ABMs still continues and is driven by theoretical achievements in behavior research and practical considerations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857823952

Of the total four cell types in developing endosperm, basal endosperm transfer cells (BETCs) are known to perform a major role in solute acquisition from post-phloem maternal tissues of developing seeds of the plant. To identify all transcripts expressed in the BETCs, we employed here a simplified microdissection method to isolate the BETCs from developing kernels at 12 days after pollination. Total RNA was extracted from such BETCs and used for cDNA synthesis. The 5,790 reads of cDNAs with an average length of 218 nucleotides were generated through 454 sequencing of a partial (1/16) run of a picotiter plate. After trimming, a total of 4,505 reads were used for clustering and assembly that led to 682 contigs and 1,791 singletons. A select set of genes showing high abundance in the above transcript reads were tested and validated for the BETC-specific expression by qPCR and by in situ hybridization. Positive results from these tests and the undetectability of expression of the marker genes relating to the embryo surrounding region located adjacent to the BETCs suggested that our microdissection method was successful in harvesting the BETC-enriched cells.

The roles of apoplastic proteins in pollen germination and in pollen tube growth are comparatively less well understood. To investigate the functions of apoplastic proteins in pollen germination, the global apoplastic proteins of mature and germinated Arabidopsis thaliana pollen grains were prepared for differential analyses by using 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) saturation labeling techniques. One hundred and three proteins differentially expressed (p value ? 0.01) in pollen germinated for 6 h compared with un-germination mature pollen, and 98 spots, which represented 71 proteins, were identified by LC-MS/MS. By bioinformatics analysis, 50 proteins were identified as secreted proteins. These proteins were mainly involved in cell wall modification and remodeling, protein metabolism and signal transduction. Three of the differentially expressed proteins were randomly selected to determine their subcellular localizations by transiently expressing YFP fusion proteins. The results of subcellular localization were identical with the bioinformatics prediction. Based on these data, we proposed a model for apoplastic proteins functioning in pollen germination and pollen tube growth. These results will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of pollen germination and pollen tube growth. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

After walking through grassland, 68 pollen grains/cm 2 were found on clothes (tape samples). The amount of grass pollen, and especially pollen from insect-pollinated plants, increased from the shirt towards the shoes. The amount of pollen on clothes aired outdoors in a yard depended on the concentration in the ambient air and the texture of the fabrics. On vacuumed samples, 1.2 grains/cm 2/h adhered to the furry fabric of fleece and wool, whereas only 0.3 grains/cm 2/h adhered to a tight weave polyamide coat and a denim jacket. A moist cotton shirt gave slightly higher pollen counts in both the tape (8.6 grains/cm 2/h) and the vacuumed samples (1.0 grains/cm 2/h) compared to a dry shirt (5.6 and 0.6 grains/cm 2/h), but the difference was not significant. Tape samples gave tenfold higher pollen numbers compared to vacuumed samples, probably due to the more optimal location of the tape sampling area on top of the shoulders. We conclude that clothing constitutes an important route for carrying allergenic pollen into houses. Pollen transport can be decreased by shaking outdoor clothing before entering a residence.

Pollen with natural inoculum was obtained from an infected orchard and pollen harvested without any contamination by Psa was experimentally inoculated at approximately the same contamination level. Two pollination techniques were used in glasshouse experiments: dusting and spraying. In parallel, field trials in commercial orchards were carried out: two plots were designed in two orchards, where bacterial canker was present at low incidence. From petal fall to 3 weeks before harvesting, leaf and fruit samples were taken and analysed for the presence of Psa, using two different PCR protocols and direct isolation. Results confirmed the dissemination of Psa through pollen, especially when using the aqueous suspensions. Both in glasshouse experiments and in the orchards Psa was found as an epiphyte for several weeks after pollination. Pathogen populations on leaves were, initially, 10 to 100 times less than on fruitlets. As the summer continued, the epiphytic contamination levels of fruits decreased constantly, being no more detectable from early August, whereas Psa was present at detectable levels on leaves until early October, approx. 20 days before harvesting time. Our results confirmed the role of pollen in disseminating Psa, the long epiphytic survival of the pathogen on kiwifruit leaves and the increasing unsuitability of fruits to harbour detectable, epiphytic populations of the bacterium through the summer season in commercial orchards with low disease incidence, when they are reaching the final development stage. Thus, kiwifruit surfaces do not appear to be a suitable niche for a long term survival of Psa as an epiphyte and, therefore, kiwifruits should not represent a pathway for Psa dissemination and pose a negligible risk for the introduction of the pathogen into new areas.",Actinidia spp.; Bacterial canker of kiwifruit; Pathogen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857859971

During our study we registered 1 hummingbird species (Hylocharis leucotis) and 7 plant species (Fuchsia thymifolia, F. microphyla, Salvia amarissima, S. elegants, Cestrum roseum, Penstemon campanulatus and Lonicera mexicana). Before the sudden climatic phenomena we registered 66 records of hummingbirds, 8 700 flowers, and 6 hummingbird visits to flowers. During the phenomena, there were zero hummingbird records, 160 flowers and zero visits. A month after the event there were 67 hummingbirds records, 1 825 flowers and 13 visits. Hummingbird activity recovered rapidly after the snowstorm, but 6 of 7 plants species lost all their flowers, except for L. mexicana, which received all hummingbird visits a month after the climatic event.",Bird pollinated flowers; Global climate change; Hummingbirds; Ornithophylous plant species; Snowstorm effect; Sudden changes in the average state of the time,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855226873

The results showed that E. songoricum exhibits a mixed mating system. It is self-compatible, but depends strictly on pollinators to set fruits. Only two effective pollinators were detected and they triggered the specialized pollination mechanism (a 'brush type' and 'tripping mechanism'). Geitonogamy becomes predominant in natural populations, because (74.5±1.3)% of visiting activity happened within or between inflorescences and (24.3±1.4)% occurred between ramets. As a result, inbreeding depression caused by geitonogamous selfing inevitably happened under natural conditions, showing 2.36 times less fruit set than was achieved by hand cross-pollination. The results explained the rarity of the species due to its breeding system, and will assist to develop suitable conservation strategies in severe desert environments.",Geitonogamy; Inbreeding depression; Inland sand dunes; Pollen brush; Self-fertilization; Tripping mechanism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860900474

Mating using an immature style 'one stop pollination' method between parents was carried out to produce progeny for testing under 500 mM salt waterlogging. The effect of parental genetic distance on seed production and early seedling survival was examined and inheritance of salt/or waterlogging tolerance was assessed by testing performance of progeny in comparison to parents. Diversity was moderate among the nine provenances and the families, and most of the diversity was distributed within rather than between families. Genetic relationships showed no structure in relation to provenance indicating any adaptation to saline environments has not affected genetic similarity. Breeding for salt and water tolerance may be achieved without decline in genetic diversity. There was a significant correlation between capsule production and parental genetic distance and a positive trend between increasing parental genetic distance and increasing number of germinated seeds/capsule, and seedling survival at 2 weeks and 9 months. These trends indicate expression of inbreeding depression in crosses between genetically similar parents. Heritability values, under 500 mM saltwaterlogging treatment, indicated that height had moderate heritability (h 2 = 0.5).

The genetic variation among and within 12 natural populations was examined for nine isozyme loci. Results indicate high average proportion of polymorphic loci (93 %) and expected heterozygosity (H e = 0.467), with an excess of observed heterozygotes in relation to Hardy-Weinberg expectations (H o = 0.521, F IS = -0.1179).

Changes in mating system parameters can provide evidence of anthropogenic impacts on populations of rare plants. Tetratheca paynterae subsp. paynterae is a critically endangered perennial shrub confined to a single ironstone range in Western Australia. Mining of the range removed 25% of plants in 2004 and further plants may be removed if the viability of the remaining populations is not compromised. To provide baseline genetic data for monitoring mining impacts, we characterised the mating system and pollen dispersal over two seasons in T. paynterae subsp. paynterae and compared mating system parameters with two other ironstone endemics, T. paynterae subsp. cremnobata and T. aphylla subsp. aphylla that were not impacted by mining. T. paynterae subsp. paynterae was the only taxon showing evidence of inbreeding (tm = 0. 89), although hand pollination revealed pre-zygotic self-incompatibility limits the production of seed from self-pollen. In a year of lower fruit set (2005), the estimate of correlated paternity increased from 20 to 35%. Direct estimates of realised pollen dispersal, made by paternity assignment in two small populations where all adult plants were genotyped, revealed a leptokurtic distribution with 30% of pollen dispersed less than 3 m and 90% less than 15 m. Restricted pollen dispersal maintains the strong genetic structuring of the adult populations in succeeding generations. As a consequence of preferential outcrossing, any reduction in effective population size, flowering plant density and/or the abundance and activity of pollinators may impact negatively on population viability through reduced seed set, increased inbreeding and increased correlated paternity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Breeding system; Microsatellite; Mining impacts; Paternity analysis; Pollen flow; Tetratheca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855123809

Despite a requirement for non-GM food, especially for export, there is no system for coexistence of GM and non-GM crop. Gene flow is a major contributor to commingling, and different distances of cross-pollination have been recorded for maize, using a variety of field-trial designs under different environmental conditions, with the furthest distance being 650 m. However, these trials have usually been small plots and not on the scale of commercial farming. There are also no published data regarding the extent of cross-pollination for maize in South Africa, even after a decade of commercialization of GM. Thus, the aim of this study, conducted from 2005 to 2007, was to determine the extent of GM maize cross-pollination under South African conditions in the context of commercial farming practice. Materials and methods: Field trials were planted with a central plot of yellow GM maize (0.0576 ha) surrounded by white non-GM maize (13.76 ha), in two different geographic regions over two seasons with temporal and spatial isolations to surrounding commercial maize planting. Cross-pollination from GM to non-GM maize was determined phenotypically across 16 directional transects. Pollen counts during flowering were compared to weather data as well as percentage cross-pollination. The data were transformed logarithmically, and mean percentage cross-pollination was compared to high cross-pollination. Results and discussion: Although there was a general congruency between wind data, pollen load and cross-pollination, it is evident that wind data and pollen load do not solely explain the directional extent of cross-pollination and that swirling winds may have contributed to this incongruence. Based on the logarithmic equations of cross-pollination over distance, 45 m is sufficient to minimize cross-pollination to between <1.0% and 0.1%, 145 m for <0.1% to 0.01% and 473 m for <0.01% to 0.001%. However, compared to this, a theoretical isolation distance of 135 m is required to ensure a minimum level of cross-pollination between <1.0% and 0.1%, 503 m for <0.1% to 0.01% and 1.8 km for <0.01% to 0.001% based on high values of cross-pollination. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, the use of mean values of cross-pollination over distance may result in an underestimation of gene flow. Where stringent control of gene flow is required, for example, for non-GM seed production or for GM field trials under contained use, the high values of cross-pollination should be used to determine isolation distance. However, this may not be practical in terms of the isolation distance required.

Growers who can offer high-quality watermelons [Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Matsum. &amp; Nakai] that are also highly nutritious will have better market opportunities. To accomplish that, germplasm must be identified that has enhanced phytonutrient levels. Surprisingly, there is little information on the genetics of nutritional quality in watermelon. The present study was performed on 56 watermelon cultivars, breeding lines, and PI accessions (hereafter collectively referred to as cultigens) to determine the importance of genotype and environmental effects on L-citrulline concentration in fruit, an amino acid that helps regulate blood pressure. Our results demonstrated that L-citrulline concentration was affected by environment and the amount of environmental effect varies among cultigens. The mean of fruit tested in Lane, OK, was 3.10 mg·g -1 fresh weight and in College Station, TX, it was 1.67 mg·g -1 fresh weight. All cultigens had a higher mean L-citrulline concentration when grown in Lane, OK, instead of College Station, TX. Additionally, the L-citrulline concentration varied considerably within cultigens; i.e., 'Congo' had a 1.26 to 7.21 mg·g -1 fresh sample deviation. The cultigen 'AU-Jubilant' had the most stable L-citrulline concentration (2.23 to 4.03 mg mg·g -1 fresh deviation) when tested from one location. Environment did not significantly increase within-genotype variation (average SE of 10 cultigens tested at each location was ± 35.3% for College Station, TX, and ± 32.9% for Lane, OK). L-citrulline concentration did not correlate with watermelon type (open-pollinated or F1 hybrid) or flesh color (red, orange, salmon yellow, or white). Differences among cultigens for L-citrulline were large (1.09 to 4.52 mg·g -1 fresh sample). The cultigens with the highest L-citrulline concentration were 'Tom Watson', PI 306364, and 'Jubilee'. These could be used to develop cultivars having a high concentration of L-citrulline.",Amino acids; Citrullus lanatus; Fruit quality; Genotype by environment; Phytonutrients,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84255209680

Seed supply is greatest from trees with large crowns, that are positioned in the upper canopy and seeding is greatest in mast years. Maintaining at least five mature white spruce trees per hectare within cut areas or dense stands of spruce on edges of cutovers ensures pollination success as well as even seed distribution. The most suitable seedbeds for white spruce germination are mineral soil, mineral soil with a thin organic layer, or large downed rotten logs. Mineral soil seedbeds are available for a short time after fire or other disturbances, while downed wood becomes available over time; this results in recruitment immediately after disturbance or several decades later. To increase the availability of suitable seedbeds the soil can be scarified during or after harvest and nurse logs should be left; on wet sites mounding should be considered. Partial canopy cover can protect seedlings from climate extremes while limiting competing vegetation. Using natural regeneration, a range of stocking outcomes can be expected -from no stocking to overstocking of spruce. Such variation in the amount of spruce versus broadleaf species, however, is consistent with the range of variation in forest composition found naturally in the boreal mixedwood region.",Establishment; Forest management; Picea glauca; Regeneration microsite; Seed dispersal; Seed germination; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871674335

When these functions rely on insects, e.g. the nutrition uptake of carnivorous plants such as Dionaea, Aldrovanda, and Utricularia or the cross-pollination mechanism of Stylidium, then these movements must be both very rapid (faster than the second time scale) and repetitive. This paper discusses the different strategies these plants have developed to achieve this goal, and is aimed at pointing out how intricate the involved biological, chemical and physical mechanisms are. Before presenting some recent advances in the modelling of these plants, the paper first describes the functioning of motor cells, which is based on the equilibration of osmotic pressures, as well as the electric signalling through the propagation of action potentials, by which the stimulation due to the insect is transmitted to these motor cells. The paper then discusses the mechanisms these plants use to perform movements well below the second time scale, which are essentially based on the physical phenomenon known as snap-buckling in material sciences.

Here we show that in pollinated ovaries fruit-set is associated with an increase in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content and high transcript levels of ToFZY, a gene involved in the tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathway. In unpollinated ovaries developed parthenocarpically in response to the synthetic auxin chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA), ToFZY mRNA levels and IAA content slightly increase. The most likely sequence of events after fertilization involves auxin-mediated activation of gibberellin (GA) synthesis. Fertilization events not only strongly increase SlGA20ox1 and SlGA20ox3 message levels but also increase SlGA2ox2, SlGA2ox4, and SlGA2ox5 mRNA levels, suggesting a concerted regulation to modulate the level of bioactive GAs, GA1 and GA3. 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid was found to mimic the fertilization events in the stimulation of SlGA20ox1 and SlGA20ox3 mRNA levels, which were also enhanced and increased earlier, but in contrast with pollinated ovaries, SlGA2ox2, SlGA2ox4, and SlGA2ox5 mRNA levels were repressed leading to higher levels of bioactive GAs. We have also analyzed the content of abscisic acid (ABA) and its metabolites dihydrophaseic acid, phaseic acid, and ABA-glucosyl ester and the level of cytokinins (CKs) (free bases and their corresponding ribosides and ribotides) in pollinated and auxin-treated tomato fruits.

In maize (Zea mays), the endosperm-embryo signals are not known, but endosperm cellularization is a key event for embryos to form shoots and roots. We screened seed mutants for nonautonomous functions in endosperm and embryo development with genetically nonconcordant seeds and identified the recessive mutant rough endosperm3 (rgh3). The wild-type Rgh3 allele is required in the endosperm for embryos to develop and has an autonomous role in embryo and seedling development. Endosperm cell differentiation is defective in rgh3. Results from endosperm cell culture indicate that rgh3 mutants remain in a proliferative state through mid-seed development. Rgh3 encodes the maize U2AF35 Related Protein (URP), an RNA splicing factor involved in both U2 and U12 splicing. The Rgh3 allele produces at least 19 alternative splice variants with only one isoform encoding a full-length ortholog to URP. The full-length RGH3a isoform localizes to the nucleolus and displays a speckled pattern within the nucleoplasm, and RGH3a colocalizes with U2AF65. A survey of alternatively spliced transcripts found that, in the rgh3 mutant, a fraction of noncanonical splicing events are altered. Our findings suggest that differentiation of maize endosperm cell types is necessary for embryos to develop. The molecular cloning of Rgh3 suggests that alternative RNA splicing is needed for cell differentiation, development, and plant viability. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856481986

The trees were measured or scored for various traits at 13, 35, 49, 61, 72, 85, 96, and 106 months after planting. Mortality rate, height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH), volume (V), and fork height (FH) varied strongly among populations and origins. The best population means after 106 months for growth H (21. 1 m), DBH (21. 1 cm), and V (278 dm 3) were for the CSO families. Narrow sense heritabilities for the CSO families increased gradually with age but remained lower after 106 months for DBH (h 2 = 0. 24) and V (h 2 = 0. 34) than for H (h 2 = 0. 51) and FH (h 2 = 0. 56). Overall, the CSO families were also straighter, less forked, and grew more vertically than the native provenance and seed-derived sources. Such differences did not exist for flowering ability, and at 106 months, the great majority of the trees of the various origins had not yet entered the flowering stage. Overall, at 106 months, the phenotypic correlations between the various quantitative and qualitative traits were weak, except between straightness and bending with values higher than 0. 50.

Although some geographic effects on combining ability have been reported, the main groups which appear are characterised by cms maintenance or male fertility restoration. The collections defined should be useful in similar studies for the determination of genome sequences controlling important phenotypic characters, although for characters determined by parts of the genome poorly represented by the markers, enriched or specific collections may be necessary.

However, papaya is extremely susceptible to disease caused by the papaya ring spot virus. Although transgenic papaya has been developed, commercial cultivation of transgenic plants in Thailand is still illegal. One concern is cross-pollination to conventional varieties. In this study, windborne-pollen dispersion of papaya (Carica papaya L.) was investigated using geographic information systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data. Pollen traps were placed around a papaya plot in eight geographic directions, with radiuses varying from 5 to 900 m from the plot. Pollen counts were made for 12 different dates, and data were input into a GIS database. The distribution of pollen and its relation to land use were analyzed using land use data obtained from Quickbird imagery acquired during 2007. Comparative analyses of pollen dispersal, wind direction, and speed were made using data collected from a micro-climatic station set up at a papaya plot. The furthest distance from the plot that pollen was found was at 0.9 km, a distance at which only 1 pollen grain was found. The number of pollen grains carried by wind decreased as distance increased. The direction of dispersal was not in accordance with wind direction data. Most pollen grains were found in agricultural areas and bare land. The total number of pollen grains found in exposed areas was considerably higher than the total found in areas sheltered by dense tree lines. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855252436

This means advancing or delaying the emergence relative to the natural activation term. The aim of the research was to determine the effect of reducing the duration of diapause of both males and females on insemination. Individuals activated earlier might, after mating and consequent nesting, be used in greenhouses for pollinating crops. Successful insemination is the prerequisite for obtaining a new generation. Therefore, there is a possibility that red mason bee females activated earlier in winter could give rise to two generations of offspring a year. Groups of red mason bees - 30 males and 30 females (in 3 replications) had diapause terminated in different months. After being removed from cocoons, they were placed in plexiglass isolation cages and kept in the laboratory with appropriate feeding and light conditions. After 14 days, the females were removed and killed, and the filling of their spermatheca was examined. Diapause was terminated in the first ten days of each November to March, and in April which is the month of the red mason bee's natural emergence and copulation time. The percentages of dead females to live (analysed) females and successfully inseminated to analysed females were compared with Chi-square contingency tests (procedure 'prop.test' from R package). Termination months differed significantly for both mortality and the successful insemination of Osmia rufa. Compared with natural activation in April, the most convenient month for terminating diapause was January, as differences in both mortality and insemination were not significantly different between these two months.",Copulation; Diapauses; Mating; Osmia rufa L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855874058

In recent years, phosphoinositides have been shown to play a critical role in polarized secretion in plants, as perturbations of phosphoinositide metabolism, through loss of function mutants, result in defects in root hair elongation and pollen tube growth, where polarized secretion occurs rapidly. In the Brassicaceae, responses of stigmatic papillae to compatible pollen are also thought to involve highly regulated secretory events to facilitate pollen hydration and penetration of the pollen tube through the stigmatic surface. We therefore sought to analyze the female sporophyte fertility of the root hair defective4-1 mutant and the PI 4-kinase?1/?2 double mutant, which differentially affect phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) levels. Stigmas from both mutants supported slower rates of pollen grain hydration, and the fecundity of these mutants was also diminished as a result of failed pollination events. This study therefore concludes that PI4P is integral to appropriate pistil responses to compatible pollen. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Arabidopsis; Compatible pollen; Phosphoinositide phosphatase; PI 4-kinase; Pollen-pistil interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255185338

In consequence, the Cry toxins expressed in the pollen of Bt maize will be dispersed by wind in the surrounding vegetation leading to exposure of non-target organisms (NTO). NTO like lepidopteran larvae may be affected by the uptake of Bt-pollen deposited on their host plants. Although some information is available to estimate pollen deposition on host plants, recorded data are based on indirect measurements such as shaking or washing off pollen, or removing pollen with adhesive tapes. These methods often lack precision and they do not include the necessary information such as the spatial and temporal variation of pollen deposition on the leaves. Here, we present a new method for recording in situ the amount and the distribution of Bt-maize pollen deposited on host plant leaves. The method is based on the use of a mobile digital microscope (Dino-Lite Pro, including DinoCapture software), which can be used in combination with a notebook in the field. The method was evaluated during experiments in 2008 to 2010.

High density genotyping-by-sequencing markers were used to delineate the position of ga1 to a 2.6 Mbp region of the B73 reference sequence (AGP version 2). We also mapped ga1 based on its inheritance in backcross between W22 (ga1) and a near-isogenic line carrying Ga1-s on a chromosome segment introgressed from a popcorn variety. The chromosome blocks introgressed from popcorn into W22 were identified with a high-density SNP assay. We created simple sequence repeat markers targeting sequences linked to ga1 to track its inheritance in the W22 backcross populations. Recently, other researchers independently mapped ga1 in crosses of Chinese dent and popcorn lines, and we compared our results to theirs with reference to the B73 reference sequence. All lines of evidence were consistent, with the intervals containing ga1 among all studies overlapping in a 2.2 Mbp interval on chromosome 4 containing 13 predicted genes in the B73 reference sequence.",Compatibility; Gametophyte factor; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857675839

The investigation encompassed the period 2008-2009. Interspecific F1 plants were obtained by embryo rescue techniques, and BC2, F3 were obtained as a result of self-pollination and backcrossing with cultivated sunflower. The heritability in the first generation was intermediate, but the plants strongly resembled the wild species in most biomorphological traits. The plant with pubescent leaves was selected for drought resistance. The F2 plants were also investigated for broomrape resistance using tests performed under artificial inoculation with broomrape seeds from two infested areas in Romania. Concerning drought and broomrape resistance the results indicated good resistance, suggesting successful gene introgression. Resistant lines will be self-pollinated and retested in the next year and some of the obtained hybrid forms will be included in the sunflower breeding program as genetic sources for drought and broomrape resistance.",Drought and broomrape resistance; Embryo rescue; Germplasm; Interspecific hybridization; Wild sunflower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860481762

To better understand the role of landscape complexity and farming systems in shaping plant assemblages, it is of interest to focus on functional traits rather than on floristic composition, which may help to highlight trends in vegetation patterns. We analysed the relative abundance of various functional attributes (different life forms, growth forms, wind-pollinated species and wind-dispersed species) at three contrasted field positions (boundary, edge and centre) of 29 organic and 29 conventional cereal fields distributed in 15 agrarian localities of NE Spain. Agricultural intensification affected the biological attributes of the vegetation in dryland Mediterranean cereal fields; local factors (farming system and position) had a more prominent role in affecting plant functional composition than the surrounding landscape. Local factors were important for life form distribution, growth form and pollination type, whereas landscape complexity mainly affected the proportion of wind-dispersed species. Therefore, depending on the objective of the study, it is important to select functional attributes sensitive to the different scales of agricultural intensification, especially because landscape complexity and land-use intensity are commonly related. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Functional trait; Landscape complexity; Mediterranean cereal field; Organic farming; Relative abundance; Within-field position,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856002232

Cistus ladanifer is a Mediterranean shrub that displays self-incompatibility, entomophyly and polymorphism for the presence of a dark coloured blotch in the base of their petals (var. maculatus with blotched petals and var. ladanifer with unblotched petals). In order to investigate the effect of the petal blotch and geography in C. ladanifer reproductive success, variation in female reproductive output (flower production, fruit set, seed set) was analysed in four and three Iberian populations of var. ladanifer and var. maculatus, respectively. Additionally, we tested whether co-existence of these two C. ladanifer phenotypes yielded different reproductive output (ovule production, seed set) in a subset of two populations. Significant differences in flower production (56.4-229.4%), fruit set (64.9-93.8%) and seed set (82.8-98.0%) among populations were reported. Geographical and taxonomic variables did not significantly explain this variation. Significant results between floral morphs within a single population were found neither for ovule nor for seed production. Our findings suggest that the petal blotch in C. ladanifer should be considered to be neutral in its effect on fruit and seed production and its occurrence may simply reflect a relaxed selection under current conditions. © 2011 Società Botanica Italiana.",Cistaceae; Flower production; Fruit set; Multi-population approach; Petal colour polymorphism; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858033271

The Grey-headed Flying-fox is a key species in maintaining forest ecosystems through the pollination of native trees and the dispersal of rainforest seeds. This threatened species is unique in that it is also recognised as a horticultural pest, predominantly in coastal orchards of south-eastern Australia. In times of native resource (pollen, nectar and rainforest fruits) shortage, flying-foxes are known to utilise commercial fruit crops. As such, the species is affected by control techniques employed by horticulturists to mitigate flying-fox damage, including shooting and netting. The NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change and the NSW Department of Primary Industries are working collaboratively to investigate flying-fox damage to commercial crops, quantify the levels of flying-fox damage (temporally and spatially), determine the factors contributing to trends in crop damage, and assess the effectiveness of mitigative measures employed by horticulturists to reduce flying-fox damage.The project is funded for two financial years through the Australian Government's Natural Heritage Trust Strategic Reserve funding and State Government contributions (cash and in-kind), and addresses several recovery actions of the draft National Recovery Plan for the Grey-headed Flying-fox. The project proposal was also strongly supported by the NSW Flying-fox Consultative Committee. The project commenced in October 2006 and focuses on commercial crops in the western Sydney Basin.

In this study of Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus, we measured about 60 chemical leaf traits of trees growing in a common garden to address the following questions: (1) how much variation is there between geographic regions, populations within regions and within populations? (2) How do chemical traits vary over the species' geographic range? (3) If so, does E. globulus ssp. globulus exhibit distinct chemotypes - plants that are morphologically similar but which differ chemically? (4) Are the affinities between E. globulus ssp. globulus and closely related subspecies apparent in the chemical variation? Variation among trees within populations contributed most variation in leaf chemistry followed by variation between geographic regions. For many traits, variation among populations within proposed races and variation among proposed races within geographic regions explained little of the total variation. There was a cline in the concentration of secondary chemicals with the lowest concentrations in Tasmanian populations and the highest in those from eastern Victoria, with intermediate concentrations in populations from Bass Strait Islands. We identified three chemotypes, characterised by specific terpenes and formylated phloroglucinol compounds. The frequency of occurrence of these chemotypes showed a geographic pattern also, with ""chemotype 1"" predominating in Tasmania, while ""chemotypes 2 and 3"" occurred at highest frequency in eastern Victoria. We suggest that the chemotypes reflect introgression between E. globulus ssp. globulus and the three closely related subspecies - E. globulus ssp. bicostata, E. globulus ssp. maidenii and E. globulus ssp. pseudoglobulus. Although the formation of land-bridges with fluctuating sea levels has no doubt shaped the evolutionary history of all four subspecies, we propose that the migratory swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), an important pollinator and a species closely associated with E. globulus, has helped shape the evolution of the four tree subspecies. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Available nitrogen; Chemical variation; Herbivory; Phenotype; Swift parrot,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82455210851

The consequences of these changes for the functioning of tropical forest ecosystems have rarely been explored in a comprehensive approach. In a Kenyan rainforest, we studied six animal-mediated ecosystem processes and recorded species richness and community composition of all animal taxa involved in these processes. We used linear models and a formal meta-analysis to test whether forest fragmentation and selective logging affected ecosystem processes and biodiversity and used structural equation models to disentangle direct from biodiversity-related indirect effects of human disturbance on multiple ecosystem processes. Fragmentation increased decomposition and reduced antbird predation, while selective logging consistently increased pollination, seed dispersal and army-ant raiding. Fragmentation modified species richness or community composition of five taxa, whereas selective logging did not affect any component of biodiversity. Changes in the abundance of functionally important species were related to lower predation by antbirds and higher decomposition rates in small forest fragments. The positive effects of selective logging on bee pollination, bird seed dispersal and army-ant raiding were direct, i.e. not related to changes in biodiversity, and were probably due to behavioural changes of these highly mobile animal taxa. We conclude that animal-mediated ecosystem processes respond in distinct ways to different types of human disturbance in Kakamega Forest. Our findings suggest that forest fragmentation affects ecosystem processes indirectly by changes in biodiversity, whereas selective logging influences processes directly by modifying local environmental conditions and resource distributions. The positive to neutral effects of selective logging on ecosystem processes show that the functionality of tropical forests can be maintained in moderately disturbed forest fragments. Conservation concepts for tropical forests should thus include not only remaining pristine forests but also functionally viable forest remnants. © 2011 Schleuning et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-81155134285

Pesticides or environmental effects may target the biochemistry of insect chitin and cuticle coating. Denaturing of chitin involves a combination of deacetylation, intercalation, oxidation, Schweiger-peeling, and the formation of amine hydrochloride salt. The term ""denatured chitin"" calls attention to structural and property changes to the internal membranes and external carapace of organisms so that some properties affecting biological activities are diminished. Methodology/Principal Findings: A case study was performed on honey bees using silver staining and microscopic computer-tomographic x-ray radiography (micro-CT). Silver nitrate formed counter-ion complexes with labile ammonium cations and reacted with amine hydrochloride. Silver was concentrated in the peritrophic membrane, on the abdomen, in the glossa, at intersegmental joints (tarsi), at wing attachments, and in tracheal air sacs. Imaged mono-esters and fatty acids from cuticle coating on external surfaces were apparently reduced by an alcohol pretreatment. Conclusions/Significance: The technique provides 3-dimensional and sectional images of individual honey bees consistent with the chemistries of silver reaction and complex formation with denatured chitin. Environmental exposures and influences such as gaseous nitric oxide intercalant, trace oxidants such as ozone gas, oligosachharide salt conversion, exposure to acid rain, and chemical or biochemical denaturing by pesticides may be studied using this technique. Peritrophic membranes, which protect against food abrasion, microorganisms, and permit efficient digestion, were imaged. Apparent surface damage to the corneal lenses of compound eyes by dilute acid exposure consistent with chitin amine hydrochloride formation was imaged. The technique can contribute to existing insect pathology research, and may provide an additional tool for research on CCD. © 2011 Peter R. Butzloff.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-81155134399

Here, we show that two existing valuation methods, previously thought to be unrelated, are each a special case of a more general equation. We then present a new method, termed attributable net income, for valuing insect pollination of crops. The attributable net income method improves upon previous methods in three ways: (1) it subtracts the cost of inputs to crop production from the value of pollination, thereby not attributing the value of these inputs to pollinators; (2) it values only the pollination that would be utilized by the crop plant for fruit production, thereby not valuing pollen deposited in excess of the plants' requirements; and (3) it can attribute value separately to different pollinator taxa, for example to native vs. managed pollinators. We demonstrate all three methods using a data set on watermelon pollination by native bees and honey bees in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. We discuss the reasons why different methods produce disparate values, and why the attributable net income method most accurately reflects the actual ecosystem service that is being valued, marketable fruit production. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Apis mellifera; Biodiversity-ecosystem function; Ecosystem service valuation; Ecosystem services; Native bee; Pollinator; Valuation; Wild bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055056449

In turn, some ES affect agricultural productivity. Managing agricultural lands to provide more ES and higher quality ES may be essential for the long-term sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. Most agricultural lands, however, are managed for the short-term production of food, fiber, and fuel, often at the expense of other ES. Proposed solutions to the underprovision of ES often involve government regulation or market incentives. A growing number of scholars, however, recognize the potential for a third approach-cooperative solutions. One important element in determining if an ES is a suitable candidate for cooperative solutions is its resource characteristics. Accordingly, this paper: 1.) provides a framework for determining an ES's suitability for collective management based on its resource characteristics, 2.) provides an in-depth analysis of three agricultural-based ES to show how the framework differentiates between ES and 3.) uses the framework to analyze fourteen agricultural-based ES for their suitability for collective management. Ten out of the fourteen ES analyzed may be well suited (e.g. pollination), suited (e.g. flood control), or moderately suited (e.g. nature recreation) for collective management under current incentive systems in agricultural ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Agricultural ecosystems; Carbon sequestration; Collective management; Ecosystem services; Nature recreation; Pollination services,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055030398

Therefore, breeding almond to produce self-compatible genotypes is very important. The purpose of this investigation was determination and evaluation of self- compatible and late flowering cultivars with good kernel characteristics in 38 almond genotypes resulting from crosses between self-compatible cultivar, Touno (male parent) and selfincompatible cultivar, Fragnees (female parent). Determination of self-compatible genotypes was carried out by investigation of fruit set levels, microscopic study of pollen tube after self pollination and PCR method. In addition, flowering and fruit characteristics were studied according to Gulcan descriptor. Genotypes number Tf23 and Tf6 were identified as very late flowering and self-compatible genotypes, in which their flowering time is coincidental with the very late flowering commercial cultivar, Tardi nonpariel. However, fruits of both genotypes were rather small. The highest fruit dry weight (4.24 and 4.06 g) was for self-incompatible genotype Tf28 and self-compatible genotype Tf15, respectively. These two genotypes had also the highest kernel weight being 1.16 and 1.13 g, respectively. Genotypes number Tf24 and Tf31 also had high dry weight fruit and kernel, which Tf24 had been identified as self-compatible, and Tf31 as self-incompatible genotypes.

The modern environmentalist movement as it emerged first in the late-nineteenth century and, in its more recent incarnation, in the 1960s, gave rise to a rich array of fictional and nonfictional writings concerned with humans' changing relationship to the natural world. Only since the early 1990s, however, has the long-standing interest of literature studies in these matters generated the initiative most commonly known as ""ecocriticism,"" an eclectic and loosely coordinated movement whose contributions thus far have been most visible within its home discipline of literature but whose interests and alliances extend across various art forms and media. In such areas as the study of narrative and image, ecocriticism converges with its sister disciplines in the humanities: environmental anthropology, environmental history, and environmental philosophy. In the first two sections, we begin with a brief overview of the nature, significance, and evolution of literature-environment studies. We then summarize in more detail six specific centers of interest: (a) the imagination of place and place-attachment, (b) the enlistment and critique of models of scientific inquiry in the study of literature and the arts, (c) the examination of the significance of gender difference and environmental representation, (d) the cross-pollination of ecocritical and postcolonial scholarship as ecocriticism has extended its horizons beyond its original focus on Anglo-American imagination, (e) ecocriticism's evolving interest in indigenous art and thought, and (f) ecocri-ticism's no less keen and complex attentiveness to artistic representation and the ethics of relations between humans and animals. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Several efforts have been conducted to improve the ?-tocopherol content in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] through transgenic technology by overexpressing genes related to ?-tocopherol biosynthesis or through changes to crop management practices. Varieties with high ?-tocopherol content have been identified in soybean germplasms. The heritability of this trait has been characterized in a cross between high ?-tocopherol variety Keszthelyi Aproszemu Sarga (KAS) and low ?-tocopherol variety Ichihime. In this study, the genetic mechanism of the high ?-tocopherol content trait of KAS was elucidated.Results: Through QTL analysis and fine mapping in populations from a cross between KAS and a Japanese variety Ichihime, we identified ?-TMT3, which encodes ?-tocopherol methyltransferase, as a candidate gene responsible for high ?-tocopherol concentration in KAS. Several nucleotide polymorphisms including two nonsynonymous mutations were found in the coding region of ?-TMT3 between Ichihime and KAS, but none of which was responsible for the difference in ?-tocopherol concentration. Therefore, we focused on transcriptional regulation of ?-TMT3 in developing seeds and leaves. An F5line that was heterozygous for the region containing ?-TMT3 was self-pollinated. From among the progeny, plants that were homozygous at the ?-TMT3 locus were chosen for further evaluation. The expression level of ?-TMT3 was higher both in developing seeds and leaves of plants homozygous for the ?-TMT3 allele from KAS. The higher expression level was closely correlated with high ?-tocopherol content in developing seeds. We generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring GUS gene under the control of ?-TMT3 promoter from KAS or Ichihime. The GUS activity assay showed that the activity of ?-TMT3 promoter from KAS was higher than that of Ichihime.Conclusions: The genetic variation in ?-TMT3, which plays a major role in determining ?-tocopherol concentration, provides significant information about the regulation of tocopherol biosynthesis in soybean seeds. This knowledge will help breeding programs to develop new soybean varieties with high ?-tocopherol content. © 2011 Dwiyanti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80355131551

Pollen was removed from insects by pressing their bodies (excluding actively-collected pollen on bees' hind legs) with a cube of gelatinefuchsin. In this study, there appears to be a strong correlation between mean estimated pollen counts for each insect species and previously published data recording mean number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas for the same species.

We analyzed the species richness of three groups of pollinators (bees and wasps, butterflies, hummingbirds) in six tropical forests in the Bolivian lowlands along a gradient of climatic seasonality and precipitation ranging from 410 mm to 6250 mm. At each site, we sampled the three pollinator groups and their food plants twice for 16 days in both the dry and rainy seasons. The richness of the pollinator groups was related to climatic factors by linear regressions. Differences in species numbers between pollinator groups were analyzed by Wilcoxon tests for matched pairs and the proportion in species numbers between pollinator groups by correlation analyses. Species richness of hummingbirds was most closely correlated to the continuous availability of food, that of bees and wasps to the number of food plant species and flowers, and that of butterflies to air temperature. Only the species number of butterflies differed significantly between seasons. We were not able to find shifts in the proportion of species numbers of the different groups of pollinators along the study gradient.

Because other ecological interactions such as mutualisms between plants and their pollinators and seed dispersers are inherently based in consumer-resource relationships we hypothesize that processes shaping food webs should organize mutualistic relationships as well. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a likelihood-based model selection approach to compare the performance of food web models and that of a model designed for mutualisms, in reproducing the structure of networks depicting mutualistic relationships. Our results show that these food web models are able to reproduce the structure of most of the mutualistic networks and even the simplest among the food web models, the cascade model, often reproduce overall structural properties of real mutualistic networks. Conclusions/Significance: Based on our results we hypothesize that processes leading to feeding hierarchy, which is a characteristic shared by all food web models, might be a fundamental aspect in the assembly of mutualisms.

This highlights private gardens as a landscape wide resource for pollinators but also the lack of sufficient pollination of wild plants in contemporary agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Agriculture; Apoidea; Bombus; Campanula; Landscape; Pollinator; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052598177

However, our understanding of the causes and consequences of these changes is still limited. Using an alpine gynodioecious species, Cyananthus delavayi, we investigated the factors affecting floral closure and estimated the fitness consequences of floral closure. • Methods: The timings of floral closure and fertilization were determined. The effects of pollen load, pollen type (cross- or self-pollen) and floral morph (female or perfect flower) on the occurrence of floral closure were examined. Ovule fertilization and seed production were examined to investigate the causes and consequences of floral closure. Flowers were manipulated to prevent closing to detect potential benefits for female fitness. • Key Results: Floral closure, which could be induced by a very low pollen load, occurred within 4-7 h after pollination, immediately following fertilization. The proportion of closed flowers was influenced by pollen load and floral morph, but not by pollen type. Floral closure was more likely to occur in flowers with a higher proportion of fertilized ovules, but there was no significant difference in seed production between closed and open flowers. Those flowers in which closure was induced by natural pollination had low fruit set and seed production. Additionally, seed production was not influenced by closing-prevented manipulation when sufficient pollen deposition was received. • Conclusions: The occurrence of floral closure may be determined by the proportion of fertilized ovules, but this response can be too sensitive to ensure sufficient pollen deposition and can, to some extent, lead to a cost in female fitness. These results implied that the control of floral receptivity by the recipient flowers does not lead to an optimal fitness gain in C. delavayi. © The Author 2011.",Cyananthus delavayi; female fitness; floral closure; floral longevity; gynodioecy; pollination; post-pollination phenomenon; sexual conflict,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054881112

However, the reproductive impact of flower herbivory may be contingent on a petal that is damaged. Flowers having nectar guides are expected to suffer reduction in reproductive success when damage is concentrated on these structures compared to petals less involved in pollinator attraction. In this study, we recorded the reflectance pattern of distinctive yellow tepals of Alstroemeria ligtu and examined their functional role for pollinator attraction and reproductive success.We quantified the richness and abundance of pollinator species attracted to flowers and estimated fruit set and seed production in flowers subject to (1) nectar guide removal, (2) lateral red tepal removal, and (3) unmanipulated flowers. Results indicate that nectar guide removal reduced pollinator visitation rate but did not affect community-level descriptors such as pollinator species richness and flower diversity. The reduction in visitation rate translated into a reduced fruit set and seed production, hence confirming that nectar guides have a clear functional role in the pollination process. We conclude that the location where damage occurs is a relevant factor for pollinator attraction and subsequent reproductive success in this species, suggesting that nectar guide damage may disrupt fine-tuned plant-pollinator communication systems. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Optimum bee stocking rates have, however, yet to be established. To determine stocking rates, five pollination trials were conducted. For each trial, 50 plants of Capsicum annuum L. var. grossum (L.) Sendt cv. Aries were placed in each of two glasshouses and a colony of T. carbonaria randomly assigned to one of the two glasshouses. The other glasshouse contained no bees and acted as a control. The grade and weight of fresh fruit increased by 26% and 24%, respectively, for plants subjected to bee pollination. To determine the number of pollination events required for optimum pollination, during the final trial, 110 flowers were randomly selected and covered with organza draw-string bags. The bags were removed between 10.00 and 11.00 h on the day of assessment to allow between one to ten pollination events to occur. A pollination event was deemed to have occurred each time a bee touched the stigma. There were no significant increases in pollen grain numbers on stigmatic surfaces after three pollination events. It was therefore determined that for optimum pollination to occur, T. carbonaria needed to come into contact with C. annuum stigmatic surfaces three times. The stocking rate was calculated from number of pollen foragers per hour, the mean number of foraging hours per day, the mean number of flowers that bees visited per hour, the number of flowers per plant in anthesis at any given time and the number of pollination events required to reach optimum pollination. The mean light intensity, temperature and relative humidity for all observations were 17869 Lx, 23°C and 47%, respectively and, under these conditions, one T. carbonaria OATH hive per ?1900 C. annuum plants was optimal.

Given that diploid seed dispersal contributes more to shaping fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS) than haploid pollen flow, we tested whether fine-scale SGS can be sensitive to fragmentation even if extensive pollen dispersal is maintained. Castanopsis sclerophylla (Lindley & Paxton) Schottky (Fagaceae), a wind-pollinated and gravity seed-dispersed tree, was studied in an area of southeast China where its populations have been fragmented to varying extents by human activity. Using different age classes of trees in areas subject to varying extents of fragmentation, we found no significant difference in genetic diversity between prefragmentation vs. postfragmentation C. sclerophylla subpopulations. Genetic differentiation among postfragmentation subpopulations was also only slightly lower than among prefragmentation subpopulations. In the most fragmented habitat, selfing rates were significantly higher than zero in prefragmentation, but not postfragmentation, cohorts. These results suggest that fragmentation had not decreased gene flow among these populations and that pollen flow remains extensive. However, significantly greater fine-scale SGS was found in postfragmentation subpopulations in the most fragmented habitat, but not in less fragmented habitats. This alteration in SGS reflected more restricted seed dispersal, induced by changes in the physical environments and the prevention of secondary seed dispersal by rodents. An increase in SGS can therefore result from more restricted seed dispersal, even in the face of extensive pollen flow, making it a sensitive indicator of the negative consequences of population fragmentation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Castanopsis sclerophylla; fragmentation; gene flow; isolation; spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054829105

In this study we quantified bumblebee abundance along hedgerow transects in MFC (field bean) vs non-MFC (wheat) margins. Surveys were conducted on east and west-facing margins twice daily (morning and afternoon) for three or four days during the main MFC flowering period (June) over four years involving paired bean and wheat fields in Devon and Cornwall, southwest England. Although no single bumblebee species showed any consistent change in relative frequency, when taken across all years and bumblebee species combined, we observed twice as many bumblebees visiting flowers adjacent to the MFC. However, when we compared bumblebee activity along hedgerow transects two weeks after bean flowering, there was no difference between crops. We thus conclude that although there is evidence for pollinator spill-over from the bean MFC to nearby semi-natural habitat, the effect is comparatively short lived and not specific to any single bumblebee species. We also suggest that while pollinator services to native plant species might be briefly enhanced by MFC cultivation, the possible repercussions of bumblebee spill-over from MFCs to semi-natural habitats and the other pollinator groups they support should be evaluated before MFC cultivation is considered as a means of conserving declining bumblebee populations. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055081689

We might thus expect wind-pollinated plants to be less prone to pollen limitation than their insect-pollinated counterparts. Yet, if pollen loads on stigmas of wind-pollinated species decline with distance from pollen donors, seed set might nevertheless be pollen-limited in populations of plants that cannot self-fertilize their progeny, but not in self-compatible hermaphroditic populations. 2.Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing pollen limitation between dioecious and hermaphroditic (monoecious) populations of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua. 3.In natural populations, seed set was pollen-limited in low-density patches of dioecious, but not hermaphroditic, M. annua, a finding consistent with patterns of distance-dependent seed set by females in an experimental array. Nevertheless, seed set was incomplete in both dioecious and hermaphroditic populations, even at high local densities. Further, both factors limited the seed set of females and hermaphrodites, after we manipulated pollen and resource availability in a common garden experiment. 4.Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that pollen limitation plays a role in the evolution of combined vs. separate sexes in M. annua. Taken together, they point to the potential importance of pollen transfer between flowers on the same plant (geitonogamy) by wind as a mechanism of reproductive assurance and to the dual roles played by pollen and resource availability in limiting seed set. Thus, seed set can be pollen-limited in sparse populations of a wind-pollinated species, where mates are rare or absent, having potentially important demographic and evolutionary implications. © 2011 The Authors.

Under such circumstances, the contribution of pollinator-mediated seed set to total seed production also may be more variable compared with situations in which pollinator abundances are high or populations consist of large numbers of individuals. Despite the widespread acceptance of the reproductive assurance hypothesis, only limited empirical evidence exists that autonomous selfing confers reproductive output and guarantees constant seed set under variable pollination environments. Methods: We performed emasculation experiments in 22 populations of the short-lived, monocarpic plant Centaurium erythraea in a fragmented dune landscape. Key results: Floral emasculations resulted in a significantly lower seed set compared with that of intact flowers. Seed set in emasculated flowers also declined significantly with decreasing population size and pollinator availability, whereas seed set of intact flowers did not depend on population size nor on pollinator availability. Variability in seed set among individuals was significantly lower in intact than in emasculated flowers and decreased significantly with increasing population size when flowers were emasculated but not in intact flowers. Conclusions: These results indicate that pollinator-mediated seed set is strongly dependent both on population size and on pollinator availability but that reproductive assurance through autonomous selfing guarantees relatively constant levels of total seed production, even when populations are small and/or pollinator limited. High variation in seed set of emasculated flowers suggests strong unpredictability in pollinator services in small populations. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Delayed selfing; Floral emasculation; Hoverflies; Mixed mating; Pollination limitation; Reproductive assurance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858419024

M. japira inflorescence bears 12-21 yellow flowers, which are in anthesis for 7 days, whereas M. urens inflorescence bears 36-54 greenish flowers, but only 1-3 flowers are in anthesis simultaneously that last one night. Nectar volume and sugar concentration were measured, and the amount of sugar was estimated. Qualitative and quantitative nectar sugar composition was determined. Both species had a constant nectar sugar concentration (ca. 10% for M. japira and ca. 16% for M. urens) and secreted high volumes of nectar (ca. 340 ?l per flower for M. japira and 310 ?l per flower for M. urens), during 5 days for M. japira and 6 h for M. urens, but after the first removal, i.e., when flower opening mechanism is triggered, nectar production stops immediately. Nectar resorption occurred in both species. Nectar sugar composition showed some similarities between the species. Variation in nectar sugar composition occurred in both species. The Mucuna species are dependent on their pollinators to produce fruits and seeds, and they have different strategies to promote the necessary interaction with birds or bats, especially related to nectar and flower characteristics. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Cacicus haemorrhous; Glossophaga soricina; Mucuna japira; Mucuna urens; Nectar features; Nectar resorption,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054795575

This has been attributed primarily to effects of increased inbreeding but also to pollen limitation. In contrast, little is known about the reproduction of 'old rare' species that are naturally restricted to small and isolated habitats and thus may have developed strategies to cope with long-term isolation and small population size. Here we study the effects of pollen source and quantity on reproduction of the 'old rare' bumblebee-pollinated herb, Astragalus exscapus. In two populations of this species, we tested for pollen autodeposition, inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression. Caged plants were left unpollinated or were pollinated with pollen from the same plant, from the same population or from a distant population (50km). Additionally, we tested for pollen limitation by pollen supplementation in four populations of different size and density. In the absence of pollinators, plants did not produce seed whereas self-pollinated plants did. This indicates a self-compatible breeding system dependent on insect pollination. Both self-pollination and, in one of the two populations, cross-pollination with pollen from plants from the distant population resulted in a lower number of seeds per flower than cross-pollination with pollen from plants from the resident population, indicating inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Pollen addition enhanced fruit set and number of seeds per flower in three of the four populations, indicating pollen limitation. The degree of pollen limitation was lowest in the smallest but densest population. Our results suggest that, similar to 'new rare' plant species, also 'old rare' species may be at risk of inbreeding depression and pollen limitation. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Breeding system; Habitat fragmentation; Inbreeding depression; Pollen limitation; Pollen-ovule ratio,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053920530

Here, we investigated floral Se distribution and speciation in flowers and the effects of floral Se on pollen quality and plant-pollinator interactions. • Floral Se distribution and speciation were compared in Stanleya pinnata, an Se hyperaccumulator, and Brassica juncea, a comparable nonhyperaccumulator. Pollen germination was measured from plants grown with varying concentrations of Se and floral visitation was compared between plants with high and low Se. • Stanleya pinnata preferentially allocated Se to flowers, as nontoxic methyl-selenocysteine (MeSeCys). Brassica juncea had higher Se concentrations in leaves than flowers, and a lower fraction of MeSeCys. For B. juncea, high floral Se concentration impaired pollen germination; in S. pinnata Se had no effect on pollen germination. Floral visitors collected from Se-rich S. pinnata contained up to 270?gg -1, concentrations toxic to many herbivores. Indeed, floral visitors showed no visitation preference between high- and low-Se plants. Honey from seleniferous areas contained 0.4-1?gSeg -1, concentrations that could provide human health benefits. • This study is the first to shed light on the possible evolutionary cost, through decreased pollen germination in B. juncea, of Se accumulation and has implications for the management of seleniferous areas. © 2011 The Authors.

This bee is, however, a poor pollinator of several crops compared with native insects. Indeed, honey bees can displace native pollinators and reduce their diversity. The present study evaluated the potential impacts of A. mellifera on the diversity of native pollinators of highland coffee (Coffea arabica) and its putative consequences for coffee production at the state of Veracruz, Mexico. 2 The abundance of A. mellifera and diversity of native pollinators were assessed during blooming at 12 shade coffee plantations and pollination experiments were conducted to determine the impacts of pollinators on coffee fruit production. Regression analyses were used to assess whether the abundance of honey bees was related to native pollinator diversity, and whether fruit production was influenced by both the diversity of pollinators and the abundance of A. mellifera. 3 Native pollinator diversity decreased as the number of honey bees increased. Furthermore, although coffee fruit production was positively related to the diversity of native pollinators, an increasing abundance of A. mellifera was correlated with a decrease in fruit production. 4 Highland shade coffee plantations are considered as reservoirs of the Mexican insect fauna. Thus, native pollinator diversity could be better preserved if beekeepers reduced the number of managed hives that they brought into plantations. This may also help to increase coffee yield by decreasing the putative negative effects of A. mellifera on native pollinators. © 2011 The Authors.

We studied the rare perennial herb Dictamnus albus as a model plant, with the aim of describing the plant-pollinator system from both plant and pollinator perspectives and analysing features that promote outcrossing in an entomophilous species. The breeding system and reproductive success of D. albus were investigated in experimental and natural conditions, showing that it is potentially self-compatible, but only intra-inflorescence insect-mediated selfing is possible. Nectar analysis showed gender-biased production towards the female phase, which follows the male phase, and during flowering, full blooming is found in flowers at the bottom of the raceme. Among a wide spectrum of insect visitors, three genera (Bombus, Apis, Megachile) were found to be principal pollinators. A study of insect behaviour showed a tendency towards bottom-to-top flights for the most important pollinators Bombus spp. and Apis mellifera: upward movements on the racemes could be explained by foraging behaviour, from more to less rewarding flowers. In accordance with the 'declining reward hypothesis', bumblebees and honeybees leave the plant when gain of reward is low, after which few flowers are visited, reducing the chance of self-pollen transfer among flowers. Intra-flower self-pollination is prevented in D. albus by protandry and herkogamy, while the nectar-induced sequential pattern of pollinator visits avoids geitonogamy and tends to maximise pollen export, promoting outcrossing. All these features for preventing selfing benefit plant fitness and population genetic structure. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Breeding system; Dictamnus albus; Foraging behaviour; Gender-biased nectar production; Plant-pollinator interaction; Pollinator behaviour,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053915042

This may result in decreased population viability. We compared the effects of population size and isolation on the reproductive success of two orchid species, Gymnadenia conopsea (nectar-producing) and Orchis mascula (nectarless) growing in highly fragmented calcareous grassland in southern Belgium. We expected that the nectar-producing species would be more susceptible to the negative reproductive consequences of habitat fragmentation compared to the nectarless species. Nectar production has been associated with increased geitonogamous pollination and, therefore, with lower seed viability. Our results show that seed viability increased with increasing population size in O. mascula, whereas it was always low in G. conopsea, even in large populations. In contrast, percentage fruit set was positively related to population size in the nectar-producing G. conopsea, but no such effect was observed in the nectarless O. mascula, where fruit set was low even in large populations. Population isolation was not related to reproductive success for either species. Our results suggest that even in large populations, where pollinators are expected to be more abundant, increased geitonogamous pollination reduces seed viability in the nectar-producing G. conopsea. In contrast, seed viability in O. mascula seems to benefit from increased pollinator availability in larger populations. For the latter species, however, fruit set remains low, even in large populations, compared to G. conopsea. This may be explained by the relatively low attractiveness of nectarless orchid species for pollinators. Our results indicate that small population size may negatively influence reproductive success in both nectarless and nectar-producing orchids by reducing seed viability and fruit set, respectively. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Calcareous grasslands; Deceptive orchids; Habitat fragmentation; Nectar production; Tetrazolium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054020140

To analyze the origin of style curvature in these species, we mapped this and correlated characters onto molecular phylogenetic trees that were constructed using the combination of the chloroplast DNA sequences of ndhF and the rpl16 intron. The results showed that style curvature evolved at least five times in species with herkogamous flowers. The occurrence of style curvature was associated with a shift to annual or perennial herbs with herkogamous flowers, which have similar ecological distributions with unpredictable pollinator environments.

It is a common species in the Mediterranean region. 3.Orchis anthropophora is wintergreen and has leaves throughout the winter. Flowering takes place between mid-May and mid-June. Vegetative adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by the reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed. In most cases, dormancy does not last longer than 1year. Orchis anthropophora is long-lived (half-life of cohorts ranges from 4.0 to 7.8years). 4.Orchis anthropophora is not autogamous, and pollinators are required for successful pollination and fruit-set. Flowers are predominantly pollinated by beetles and sawflies. Terpenes are the major compounds of the floral scent profile of O. anthropophora. Natural levels of fruit-set are generally low. Recorded values are mostly <20% but reached >80% in a population in southern France. 5.Orchis anthropophora hybridizes with several other species in the genus Orchis, including O. italica, O. simia, O. purpurea and O. militaris. Intergeneric hybrids have been reported with Barlia, Dactylorhiza and Neotinea. In Britain, hybrids with O. simia and O. purpurea have been reported. 6.Orchis anthropophora has declined markedly in Britain during the last century, and at present, it is rare and classified as endangered. Very few new populations are becoming established, and many populations have become extinct, mainly because of agricultural intensification (ploughing and fertilization of old fields). Conservation of the remaining populations requires moderate grazing by sheep to maintain a short turf and to promote seedling recruitment. © 2011 The Authors.

Invasive flammable grasses, deforestation, historical fire suppression and human ignition are increasing fire frequency and intensifying its severity, as well as introducing fire to previously fireproof biomes. In many of these habitats, bees are key pollinators. Many, often most of the solitary bee species and individuals in these biomes nest underground (so-called "" mining"" bees). To evaluate their susceptibility to fire, we tested heat tolerances of bees' four life stages using an experimental design that mimicked heat conduction dynamics of natural soils. All life stages survived heating of up to 45. °C for 27. min, but none survived heating at 54. °C for 9. min; the pupal stage survived best. At near-lethal temperatures, more prolonged heating caused more mortality. These data were related to published studies of heat penetration depths in soil during fire and an exhaustive compilation of published nesting depths reported for mining bees. We conclude that a small fraction (9%) of the shallowest-nesting mining bee species is likely to die from soil heating by wildfire. Among these, ground-nesting megachilids (Osmia, Megachile) will be most vulnerable, owing to their shallow horizontal nests. Because mining bees prevail in most biomes of the temperate zone, any vegetation rehabilitation efforts should therefore expect that bee communities will largely survive the immediate effects of wildfire, and therefore will need pollen and nectar resources in the year(s) after fire. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Apiformes; Apoidea; Fire; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052568093

This may have important consequences for the pollination of crops and native plant species. In Spain, as in other parts of Europe, land abandonment has led to a decrease in the number of non professional beekeepers, which aggravates the problem of honeybee decline as a result of bee diseases In this study, we investigated the effects of honeybees on the pollination of three native plant species in northern Spain, namely wildcherry Prunus avium L., hawthorn Crataegus monogyna Jacq., and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus L. We quantified fruit set of individuals from the target species along transects established from an apiary outwards. Half the samples were bagged in a nylon mesh to avoid insect pollination. Mixed-effects models were used to test the effect of distance to the apiary on fruit set in non-bagged samples. The results showed a negative significant effect of distance from the apiary on fruit set for hawthorn and bilberry, but no significant effects were detected for wildcherry. This suggests that the use of honeybees under traditional farming practices might be a good instrument to increase fruit production of some native plants. This may have important consequences for wildlife conservation, since fruits, and bilberries in particular, constitute an important feeding resource for endangered species, such as the brown bear Ursus arctos L. or the capercaillie Tetrao urogallus cantabricus L. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Apis mellifera; Bilberry; Cantabrian Mountains; Hawthorn; Pollination; Tetrao urogallus; Ursus arctos; Wildcherry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054722788

However, studies on the effects of interspecific pollen transfer have focused on interactions between species pairs. The potential exists for diverse interactions among heterospecific pollen (HP) grains on the stigma, and for these to affect plant reproduction, alone or in combination with conspecific pollen (CP) loss, but these interactions have not yet been explored. • We used hand-pollinations to simulate increasing community diversity and CP loss on Mimulus guttatus stigmas. We used pollen mixes of one to three heterospecific donors to determine how species composition and CP load size affect seed production and to characterize the mechanisms underlying fertilization failure. • Heterospecific pollen deposition reduced M. guttatus seed production and while the effect increased with the number of heterospecific donors, the strength depended on species composition and was independent of conspecific load size. Different types of interactions (additive and synergistic) are hypothesized to underlie the diverse effects on M. guttatus reproductive success. • Our results suggest that an increase in the diversity of heterospecific donors will not always lead to a greater decrease in fitness because multispecies effects depend on the interacting species. © 2011 The Authors.

The objectives of this study are to characterize the reproductive phenology, floral morphology, breeding system and pollination and seed dispersal of the species. The study was conducted in an area of cerrado in São Carlos (SP). It was found that Pera glabrata is dioecious, showing massive flowering and the flowers of both sexes are small, involuted, yellow and with diurnal anthesis. The male flowers provide nectar, and emit a sweet odor, while the female ones do not offer visible reward to visitors. The flowers were visited by 32 small species of Diptera and Hymenoptera.

We previously identified primordial anther-specific DNA damage and organ-specific ethylene perception responsible for the arrest of stamen development in female flowers, but little is known about how the two processes are linked. • To identify potential links between the two processes, we performed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) stamens of male and female flowers at stage 6, with stamens at stage 5 of bisexual flowers as a control. • Among the differentially expressed genes, we identified an expressed sequence tag (EST) encoding a cucumber homolog to an Arabidopsis calcium-dependent nuclease (CAN), designated CsCaN. Full-length CsCaN cDNA and the respective genomic DNA sequence were cloned and characterized. The CsCaN protein exhibited calcium-dependent nuclease activity. CsCaN showed ubiquitous expression; however, increased gene expression was detected in the stamens of stage 6 female flowers compared with male flowers. As expected, CsCaN expression was ethylene inducible. It was of great interest that CsCaN was post-translationally modified. • This study demonstrated that CsCaN is a novel cucumber nuclease gene, whose DNase activity is regulated at multiple levels, and which could be involved in the primordial anther-specific DNA damage of developing female cucumber flowers. © 2011 The Authors.

Bees have evolved multimodal communication to recruit nestmates to rewarding food sources. Highly social bees can use visual and chemical information to recruit nestmates to rich food sources. However, no studies have determined if this information is redundant or has an additive effect such that multimodal information is more attractive than either modality presented by itself to free-flying bees. We tested the effect of two modalities, forager-deposited odor marks and the visual presence of foragers, on the orientation of stingless bee (Scaptotrigona mexicana) recruits. Our results show that odor marks alone were significantly more attractive than multimodal information, and that multimodal information was significantly more attractive than visual forager presence alone. Given the high olfactory sensitivity and limited visual acuity of insects, odor marks likely attracted recruits over a greater distance than the visual presence of nestmates. Thus, multimodal information in S. mexicana is redundant, not additive, in terms of orientation to food sources. © 2011 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Multimodal communication; Odor marks; Recruitment; Visual cues,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052596199

Plants may employ visual and/or olfactory sensory channels to signal the presence of ripe fruit. Visual signals of ripe fruit have been extensively investigated. However, the volatile signatures of ripe fruit that use olfactorily-oriented dispersers have been scarcely investigated. Moreover, as in flowers, where floral scents are produced at times when pollinators are active (diurnal versus nocturnal), whether plants can modulate the olfactory signal to produce fruit odours when dispersers are active in the diel cycle is completely unknown. We investigated day-night differences in fruit odours in two species of figs, Ficus racemosa and Ficus benghalensis. The volatile bouquet of fruit of F. racemosa that are largely dispersed by bats and other mammals was dominated by fatty acid derivatives such as esters. In this species in which the ripe fig phase is very short, and where the figs drop off soon after ripening, there were no differences between day and night in fruit volatile signature. The volatile bouquet of fruit of F. benghalensis that has a long ripening period, however, and that remain attached to the tree for extended periods when ripe, showed an increase in fatty acid derivatives such as esters and of benzenoids such as benzaldehyde at night when they are dispersed by bats, and an elevation of sesquiterpenes during the day when they are dispersed by birds.

Different cultivars coincident at flowering with the cultivars studied were evaluated as adequate pollenizers in each orchard. To determine which factors that intervene in the reproductive process could be related to the lack of fruit set, microscopic observations of pollen germination, pollen tube growth, pollen-pistil incompatibility, and ovule development were analyzed in flowers of different pollination treatments. Results allowed dismissal of pollen viability, pollen transfer, and pollen-pistil incompatibility as the cause of lack fruit set. However, the observation of ovule development revealed a high incidence of premature ovule degeneration on final fruit set in the three low-producing cultivars. The lack of fruit set in orchards with no apparent adverse environmental conditions is traditionally studied by analyzing the pollination process and the pollen-pistil incompatibility relationships, but the stage of development of the ovules is not usually considered. The approach used in this work may prove valuable to other species and situations of lack of fruit set, which could help to identify the causes for premature ovule degeneration.",Female sterility; Pollen germination; Pollen tube growth; Pollen-pistil incompatibility; Pollination; Prunus salicina; S-RNase alleles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81755163909

They can become naturalized and invasive in countries where the associated pollinator is also established. Figs (syconia) are also also utilized by a diverse community of organisms that are potentially detrimental to the pollinators or seed production. Ficus benjamina is a widely-planted fig tree with the ability to establish outside its native range. We examined the impact of an undescribed gall midge species associated with F. benjamina within the plant's natural range in Xishuangbanna, south-western China. Observations on the levels of abundance of the midge together with fig abortion and seed germination rates showed that the gall midge had a strong negative effect on reproduction. The gall midge reduced pollinator survival and at high densities eliminated all pollinators, due primarily to premature abortion of figs. Seed numbers were only reduced at high gall midge densities, but seed quality, as measured by germination success and root growth rates, was greatly reduced whenever the gall midge was present. Within its presumed natural range the gall midge appears to be host specific, and given its dramatic impact on host reproductive success, is a potential candidate for the biological control of F. benjamina. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Biocontrol; Cecidomyiidae; Ficus; Fig wasp; Gall midge; Mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81055140472

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), an important and widespread crop in the world, is sensitive to moderate levels of salt in the soil. To generate tomato plants that can adapt to saline soil, AVP1, a vacuolar H +- pyrophosphatase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, and PgNHX1, a vacuolar Na +/H + antiporter gene from Pennisetum glaucum, were co-expressed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. A sample of transformants was self-pollinated, and progeny were evaluated for salt tolerance in vitro and in vivo. It is reported here that co-expression of AVP1 and PgNHX1 confers enhanced salt tolerance to the transformed tomato compared with the AVP1 and PgNHX1 single gene transgenic plants and the wild-type. These transgenic plants grew well in the presence of 200mM NaCl while wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis and died within 3 weeks. The transgenic line co-expressing AVP1 and PgNHX1 retained more chlorophyll and accumulated 1.4 times more proline as a response to stress than single gene transformants. Moreover, these transgenic plants accumulated a 1.5 times higher Na + content in their leaf tissue than the single gene transformants. The toxic effect of Na + accumulation in the cytosol is reduced by its sequestration into the vacuole. The physiological analysis of the transgenic lines clearly demonstrates that co-expression of AVP1 and PgNHX1 improved the osmoregulatory capacity of double transgenic lines by enhanced sequestration of ions into the vacuole by increasing the availability of protons and thus alleviating the toxic effect of Na +. © 2011 The Author.",Co-expression; H +-pyrophosphatase; Na +/H + antiporter; salt tolerance; sodium sequestration; transgenic tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255183804

We analyzed 250 offspring (nursery reared seedlings) collected after a logging episode from 14 open-pollinated seed trees. These were compared to 367 seedlings from 20 open-pollinated seed trees previously collected from the pre-logging primary forest. The genetic diversity was significantly lower in the post-logging seed cohort. In contrast to the pre-logging population, significant levels of selfing were detected in the post-logging population (tm=0.962, P&lt;0.05). However, correlated matings were reduced and the effective number of pollen donors almost doubled after harvesting (3.8 against 7.2). Logging also reduced pollen immigration into the plot (from 55% to 38%) and we found no significant correlation between the size of the pollen donors and the number of seeds fathered. Inside the plot, pollen dispersal distance was shorter before logging than after (827 and 952m, respectively) and the reproductive pollination neighbor area (Aep) was larger (average of 178ha). The individual and average variance effective population size within families (ranged from 1.80 to 3.21, average of 2.47) was lower than expected in panmictic populations (Ne=4). The results indicate that while logging greatly reduced the levels of genetic diversity after logging, it also increased genetic recombination within the population and constrained crossing among related individuals. The results show that low-density tropical tree species such as H. courbaril, when harvested in moderate levels may be resilient to a reduction in the reproductive population and may maintain similar levels of outcrossing and pollen dispersal after logging. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Gene flow; Jatobá; Pollen dispersal; Reduced impact logging; SSR loci; Tropical trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051940699

Gongronema latifolia has very few and scanty records of heterosis studies and known levels of vitamin contents because it has been harvested from the wild and has a long gestation period of 14-16 months; thus, manual cross-pollination could be difficult in the species. This study was therefore undertaken to determine the levels of certain vitamins and lycopene in genotypes of Gongronema latifolia and to estimate heterosis for the traits across two years. Stem cuttings of five parent plants and their resulting hybrids were established in a field in a randomized complete block design in 2008. Young leaves from these genotypes were harvested and used to determine the levels of vitamins and lycopene and to estimate heterosis in 2009 and 2010. Better parent heterosis (BPH) ranged from -90% to 203% in both years. All vitamins and lycopene, with the exception of Vitamin C, showed positive heterosis in a minimum of five cross combinations. Vitamin E showed the highest BPH of 109% in 2009. Vitamin C had a BPH of 65% in 2010. Vitamin A, on the other hand, had a lower BPH of 52% in 2009. Two hybrids, ENS-8-MBU × AKS-33-EKPENE EDIENE and IMS-20-NJIABA × AKS-33-EKPENE EDIENE, complemented each other by exhibiting heterosis for the determined vitamins and lycopene. Selection of two hybrids with a higher level of vitamins and lycopene than in the parents should improve the availability of these nutrients, eventually at a commercial level. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Gongronema latifolia; Heterosis; Hybrids; Lycopene; Selection; Vitamins,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858728726

With its extensive native range, photoperiod response varies widely within the species. To synchronize flowering among cultivars of distinct origin, disparities in light-driven developmental responses often require breeders to develop elaborate photoperiod regimens. The objective of this research was to identify a simple photoperiod treatment that could be used to evoke sexual reproductive development for three upland cultivars of switchgrass: Cave-In- Rock (origin 37°N), Sunburst (origin 42°N), and Dacotah (origin 46°N). To evaluate photoperiod sensitivity, switchgrass clones were grown in the greenhouse under various local natural ambient photoperiods, as well as under a 24-h low-irradiance daylight extension. Despite previously being described as a short-day plant, these upland cultivars of switchgrass were induced to flower under 24-h low-irradiance daylight-extended photoperiod. This daylight extension method was valid for use in addition to any ambient photoperiod. These results identified a simple system that used inexpensive equipment (common fluorescent bulbs) and required no alternating light and dark periods to promote panicle production in switchgrass. This system will be useful for improving seed yield components, via controlled pollination in the greenhouse, most especially when the ambient photoperiods are not favorable for floral induction. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053626661

Orange fruits accumulate the monoterpene limonene at high levels in the oil glands of their fruit peels. When limonene production was downregulated in orange fruits by the transgenic expression of a limonene synthase (CitMTSE1) in the antisense configuration, these fruits were resistant to the fungus Penicillium digitatum (Pers.) Sacc. and the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp citri and were less attractive to the medfly pest Ceratitis capitata. These responses were reversed when the antisense transgenic orange fruits were treated with limonene. To gain more insight into the role of the limonene concentration in fruit responses to pests and pathogens, we attempted to overexpress CitMTSE1 in the sense confguration in transgenic orange fruits. Only slight increases in the amount of limonene were found in sense transgenic fruits, maybe due to the detrimental effect that excessive limonene accumulation would have on plant development. Collectively, these results suggest that when limonene reaches peak levels as the fruit develops, it becomes a signal for pest and pathogen attraction, which facilitate access to the fruit for pulp consumers and seed dispersers. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Co-evolution; Defense; Repellency; Secondary metabolism; Seed dispersers; Trophic interaction; Volatiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255151086

The plasticity of floral longevity to pollination may be an adaptation of plants to pollen limitation. However, this adaptation is less critical in short-lived flowers. To evaluate pollen limitation and the plasticity of floral longevity to pollination in Potentilla tanacetifolia, a gynodioecious herb with short-lived flowers, we analyzed its breeding system, tested sex-differential pollen limitation, and compared variations in floral display size in natural populations in Duolun County, Inner Mongolia, China. Hand pollination experiments and pollinator exclusion treatments revealed that P. tanacetifolia is self-compatible and non-autonomously apomictic and shows sex-differential pollen limitation. The plasticity of floral longevity to pollination was observed; the floral duration of female plants was prolonged by approximately 3-4 hours with pollination exclusion treatment. Moreover, the percentage of flowers displayed on female plants during pollination exclusion treatment was significantly higher than that during natural pollination. Under natural pollination conditions, the percentage of flowers displayed on female plants was significantly higher than on hermaphrodite plants.

Two of the most geographically and ecologically divergent of these species are the rhizomatous T. ambiguum from high altitudes in eastern Europe and western Asia and the stoloniferous T. occidentale from sea level in western Europe. Attempts were made to hybridize these species to ascertain whether, despite this separation, gene flow could be achieved, indicating the retention of the genetic factors necessary for hybridization. • Methods: Three F 1 hybrids formed after embryo rescue were described, characterized by conventional and molecular cytogenetics, subjected to fertility tests and progeny generations were developed. • Results and Conclusions: Partially fertile hybrids between Trifolium ambiguum and T. occidentale were obtained for the first time. The F 1 hybrids produced seeds after open-pollination, and also produced triploid progeny in backcrosses to T. occidentale from the functioning of unreduced gametes in the hybrids. These plants were fertile and produced progeny with T. occidentale and with T. repens. Meiotic chromosome pairing in the F 1 showed six to eight bivalents per pollen mother cell, indicating pairing between the parental genomes. A chromosome-doubled form of one hybrid, produced using colchicine, showed some multivalents, indicative of interspecific chromosome pairing. The hybrid plants were robust and combined phenotypic characteristics of both species, having stolons, thick roots and a few rhizomes. Results show that despite separation by the entire breadth of Europe, the speciation process is incomplete, and these taxa have partially retained most of the genetic compatibilities needed for hybridization (possibly except for endosperm development, which was not tested). The fertile progeny populations could lead to new clover breeding strategies based on new hybrid forms. © The Author 2011.",Caucasian clover; genetic bridge; interspecific hybridization; introgression; speciation; T. occidentale; T. repens; Trifolium ambiguum; unreduced gametes; western clover; white clover,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054911200

To infer the evolution of these inflorescence traits, we reconstructed the molecular phylogeny of the genus, using DNA sequences from one nuclear, one mitochondrial, and three plastid loci (Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS), atpA, rbcL, trnL-F, and trnH-psbA). Involucres and bracteoles characters were mapped onto the phylogeny to analyze the sequence of inflorescence trait evolution. In all analyses, species with showy involucres and bracteoles formed the most derived clade, while ancestral Tacca had small and plain involucres and short bracteoles, namely less conspicuous inflorescence structures. Two of the species with the most elaborate inflorescence morphologies (T. chantrieri in southeast China and T. integrifolia in Tibet), are predominantly self-pollinated, indicating that these conspicuous floral displays have other functions rather than pollinator attraction. We hypothesize that the motile bracteoles and involucres may facilitate selfing; display photosynthesis in the dim understory, and protect flowers from herbivory. © 2011 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",atpA; Bracteoles; Bracts; ITS; Molecular phylogeny; rbcL; Tacca; trnH-psbA; trnL-F,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81255207545

In the 2000/ 2001 cropping year, four nitrogen rates were applied (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha -1). The estimated available N to the maize calculated from the contribution from the soil, cover crops and N fertilizer varied from 27 to 192 kg ha -1. All evaluated variables presented high dependence on available N, and reached its maximum level near to the highest level of available N (192 kg ha -1). With this level of availability, at the stage of pollination, the largest values of LAI (4.41) and the highest leaf N concentration were observed, however, the highest N accumulation in the above ground biomass was observed at the milk grain stage and the shoot dry matter accumulation at the dent stage.

Intergenotypic competition is an important factor of environmental variation. The use of competition covariables generally reduces the estimates of variance components and influences genetic gains in the studied traits.

Garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis, 2n = 2x = 20) is an economically important vegetable that is native to the Mediterranean region but widely cultivated in many countries. The genus Asparagus is comprised of over 100 species. Asparagus kiusianus (2n = 2x = 20) is a wild asparagus species endemic to Japan. This species occurs on the coast and is likely to be a salt-resistant species. Although the geographic distribution of these two species is not close, molecular phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these two species are closely related. In this study, a reciprocal cross between A. officinalis and A. kiusianus was carried out by hand pollination, and progeny were obtained from both crossings. These progeny exhibited a morphologically intermediate phenotype in terms of flower shape, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis confirmed that these were indeed interspecific hybrids. The interspecific hybrids were fertile, and backcross progeny with garden asparagus was also generated. These interspecific hybrids are expected to supply novel traits to garden asparagus. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Backcross; Flow cytometry; Interspecific hybrid; Morphological comparison; Pollen fertility; Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80255140474

Due to its chemical similarity to sulphur, most plants readily take up and assimilate Se. Se accumulators such as Brassica juncea can accumulate Se between 0.01% and 0.1% of dry weight (DW), and Se hyperaccumulators such as Stanleya pinnata (Brassicaeae) contain between 0.1% and 1.5% DW of Se. While Se accumulation offers the plant a variety of ecological benefits, particularly protection from herbivory, its potential costs are still unexplored. This study examines the effects of plant Se levels on reproductive functions. In B. juncea, Se concentrations >0.05-0.1% caused decreases in biomass, pollen germination, individual seed and total seed weight, number of seeds produced, and seed germination. In S. pinnata there was no negative effect of increased Se concentration on pollen germination. In cross-pollination of B. juncea plants with different Se levels, both the maternal and paternal Se level affected reproduction, but the maternal Se concentration had the most pronounced effect. Interestingly, high-Se maternal plants were most efficiently pollinated by Se-treated paternal plants. These data provide novel insights into the potential reproductive costs of Se accumulation, interactive effects of Se in pollen grains and in the pistil, and the apparent evolution of physiological tolerance mechanisms in hyperaccumulators to avoid reproductive repercussions. © 2011 The Author.",Hyperaccumulation; Indian mustard; phytoremediation; pollen germination; prince's plume,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255183793

We demonstrate the occurrence of demes highly genetically differentiated, kin-structured, characterized by moderate effective population sizes, differing in propensity for selfing, and arising from nonrandom genetic subsets of the seed bank. Only one deme identified in the first survey year significantly contributed to the weed beets that emerged in the second year. Spatial structuring appears to be primarily due to gravity seed dispersal and limited pollen flow among weed beet demes. Within each genetic cluster identified by Bayesian assignments and multivariate analyses, F IS estimates and level of biparental inbreedingrevealed by progeny analysesdropped to non-significant values. This suggests that random mating occurs at the scale of genetically distinct demes over a very short scale.

With respect to post-glacial migration patterns known from the northern hemisphere, we tested the prediction that the southernmost populations of a subtropical tree line species have lower within-population genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation than the central and northernmost populations. Methods: We used AFLP to assess the genetic structure of 18 populations of the wind-pollinated Polylepis australis (Rosaceae) sampled over its entire distributional range in three Argentinean high mountain regions. Genetic diversity was calculated as a percentage of polymorphic bands (P) and Nei's expected heterozygosity (He); genetic differentiation was assessed using AMOVA, ? ST - statistics, and Bayesian cluster analysis. Key results: Contrary to our expectations, the northernmost Polylepis australis stands had lower within-population genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation than the central and southernmost stands. Populations grouped into two major clusters, the first containing the southern populations and four central populations and the second containing the northern and one central population. Conclusions: Patterns of Polylepis australis genetic structure and diversity differ from historical migration scenarios observed for the northern hemisphere. The decline in genetic diversity toward the north may point to an equatorward migration following past climatic changes. Populations within the south and central part appear to be connected by effective long-distance pollination while gene flow in the northern part is probably hampered by geographic isolation. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",AFLP; Climate change; High mountain forests; Neotropics; Population genetics; Tree migration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858433251

They typically contain nectar and often strongly influence pollinator specificity, potentially mediating reproductive isolation. The identification of Antirrhinum majus mutants with ectopic petal spurs suggested that petal-spur development is dependent on the expression of KNOTTED 1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes, which are better known for their role in maintaining the shoot apical meristem. Here, we tested the role of KNOX genes in petal-spur development by isolating orthologs of the A. majus KNOX genes Hirzina (AmHirz) and Invaginata (AmIna) from Linaria vulgaris, a related species that differs from A. majus in possessing long, narrow petal spurs. We name these genes LvHirz and LvIna, respectively. Using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, we show that LvHirz is expressed at high levels in the developing petals and demonstrate that the expression of petal-associated KNOX genes is sufficient to induce sac-like outgrowths on petals in a heterologous host. We propose a model in which KNOX gene expression during early petal-spur development promotes and maintains further morphogenetic potential of the petal, as previously described for KNOX gene function in compound leaf development. These data indicate that petal spurs could have evolved by changes in regulatory gene expression that cause rapid and potentially saltational phenotypic modifications. Given the morphological similarity of spur ontogeny in distantly related taxa, changes in KNOX gene expression patterns could be a shared feature of spur development in angiosperms. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",evolution; flower development; KNOX genes; Linaria vulgaris; petal shape; petal spur,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855123483

Hence, the demise of honey bee colonies in Europe, USA, and Asia caused much concern and initiated many studies and research programmes aiming at elucidating the factors negatively affecting honey bee health and survival. Most of these studies look at individual factors related to colony losses. In contrast, we here present our data on the interaction of pathogens and parasites in honey bee colonies. We performed a longitudinal cohort study over 6 years by closely monitoring 220 honey bee colonies kept in 22 apiaries (ten randomly selected colonies per apiary). Observed winter colony losses varied between 4.8% and 22.4%; lost colonies were replaced to ensure a constant number of monitored colonies over the study period. Data on mite infestation levels, infection with viruses, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae, and recorded outbreaks of chalkbrood were continuously collected. We now provide statistical evidence (i) that Varroa destructor infestation in summer is related to DWV infections in autumn, (ii) that V. destructor infestation in autumn is related to N. apis infection in the following spring, and most importantly (iii) that chalkbrood outbreaks in summer are related to N. ceranae infection in the preceding spring and to V. destructor infestation in the same season. These highly significant links between emerging parasites/pathogens and established pathogens need further experimental proof but they already illustrate the complexity of the host-pathogen-interactions in honey bee colonies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Chalkbrood; Colony losses; Honey bees; Nosema ceranae; Varroa destructor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054091091

We assessed the efficiency of simple marker-free Agrobacterium-mediated transformation techniques in alfalfa: regeneration without selection, or marker-less, and co-transformation with two vectors, one containing the SMG and one containing a non-selected gene. To easily estimate the efficiency of marker-less transformation, the nptII and the GUS markers were used as non-selected genes. After Agrobacterium treatment, somatic embryos were regenerated without selection. The percentage of transgenic embryos was determined by a second cycle of regeneration using the embryos as starting material, in the presence of kanamycin, by PCR screening of T1 progenies, and by the GUS test. In two experiments, from 0 to 1.7% of the somatic embryos were transgenic. Co-transformation was performed with two vectors, one with the hemL SMG and one with the unselected nptII gene, each carried by a different culture of Agrobacterium. Only 15 putative co-transformed plants were regenerated from two experiments, with an average co-transformation percentage of 3.7. Southern blot hybridizations and/or T 1 progeny segregation were used to confirm transgene integration, and qPCR was also used to estimate the T-DNA copy number. In the T 1 progenies obtained by crossing with a non-transgenic pollinator, marker-free segregants were obtained.

Insect pollinators represent such examples; the introduction of commercial bumble bee species for crop pollination has resulted in competition for an ecological niche with native species, genetic disturbance caused by mating with native species, and pathogen spillover to native species. The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, was first introduced into Japan for apiculture in 1877, and queen bees have been imported from several countries for many years. However, its effects on Japanese native honey bee, Apis cerana japonica, have never been addressed. We thus conducted the survey of honey bee viruses and Acarapis mites using both A. mellifera and A. c. japonica colonies to examine their infestation in native and non-native honey bee species in Japan. Honey bee viruses, Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), and Sacbrood virus (SBV), were found in both A. mellifera and A. c. japonica colonies; however, the infection frequency of viruses in A. c. japonica was lower than that in A. mellifera colonies. Based on the phylogenies of DWV, BQCV, and SBV isolates from A. mellifera and A. c. japonica, DWV and BQCV may infect both honey bee species; meanwhile, SBV has a clear species barrier. For the first time in Japan, tracheal mite (Acarapis woodi) was specifically found in the dead honey bees from collapsing A. c. japonica colonies. This paper thus provides further evidence that tracheal-mite-infested honey bee colonies can die during cool winters with no other disease present. These results demonstrate the infestation of native honey bees by parasite and pathogens of non-native honey bees that are traded globally. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80255133248

This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the intersection of NO signalling with the signalling pathways of ABA, GA, and ethylene; plant hormones that control the release of plant seeds from dormancy and germination. The cross-talk of NO and ROS is involved in the light- and hormone-specific regulation of seeds' developmental processes during the initiation of plant ontogenesis. Similarly to seed germination, the mechanisms of plant pollen hydration, germination, tube growth, as well as pollen-stigma recognition are tightly linked to the proper adjustment of NO and ROS levels. The interaction of NO with ROS and secondary messengers such as Ca 2+, cAMP and cGMP discovered in pollen represent a common mechanism of NO signalling.

However, this technique remains not well controlled in Tunisia. This study was conducted during two successive years, 2009 and 2010, to investigate different pollination conditions, i.e. number of caprifigs and repetitions of caprification on fruiting of two cultivars Bouhouli (San Pedro type) and Zidi (Smyrna type). In addition, the efficiency of four pollen sources was evaluated to identify the most effective pollinator for female cultivar Zidi. The following parameters were recorded: fruit number per shoot, fruit set, productivity, fruit characteristics and vegetative growth.Results indicated that caprification realized at four times with an interval of 4 days between each time could be efficient to improve fruit set (74.1 and 70.8% for Bouhouli and Zidi, respectively) and fruit quality (112. g per fruit, 19.4°Brix for Bouhouli, and 102. g per fruit, 20.3°Brix for Zidi). Compared with others caprifigs, the pollen of caprifig Djebba 2 resulted in higher productivity (6. fruits/20. cm), fruit weight (75.6-83.8. g), a large flesh thickness (23-25.1. mm) and better taste of fruits (16°Brix and 0.18% titrable acidity). These results suggested that caprifig Djebba 2 should be selected as the adequate pollinator for the edible Zidi fig in north-west Tunisia. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Caprification efficiency; Caprifig; Ficus carica; Fig; Fruit quality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054123262

Although studies have shown that most tropical tree species are predominantly outcrossing, there is no empirical support for this species prior to this study, with regard to its mating system. Information on its reproductive biology is also scanty. We report the estimation of the outcrossing rates of K. malaccensis using microsatellite markers, based on a fruiting season at the Semangkok Forest Reserve, Selangor. Microsatellite analysis was performed for an average of 46 seeds each from nine adult K. malaccensis trees, using four polymorphic microsatellite loci (Kma050, Kma067, Kma147 and Kma180). Single and multilocus population outcrossing estimates (t s and t m respectively) were determined using the software MLTR version 3.0. Results showed that this timber species was predominantly outcrossing (t m = 0.890). Biparental mating (t m - t s) was very low, only 0.026, suggesting low tendency of mating between relatives. Outcrossing estimates obtained for individual mother trees were in the range of 0.637 to 0.994. The relatively lower outcrossing rates exhibited by a few progeny arrays indicated that K. malaccensis was not completely self-incompatible. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.",Bee-pollinated; Kempas; Leguminosae; Tropical rain forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054879160

We assessed the potential value of urban ""green roofs"" for native pollinator conservation in the Chicago region, comparing them with reference habitats of tallgrass prairie natural areas and traditional city-park green spaces. We found that native bees are present on green roofs, though at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats. Green-roof and prairie bee communities were distinct from each other, while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two habitat types. Bee-community patterns were related to habitat characteristics at both the site and landscape scales. Overall, bee abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of green space in the surrounding landscape. However, this relationship disappeared in cases where green space was dominated by turf grass. At the site scale, bees benefited from greater plant diversity, and bee and plant-community composition were significantly correlated. Green roofs are potentially valuable sites for bee conservation in urban areas, particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging resources, and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting habits. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Green roofs; Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila; Native bees; Pollinator conservation; Urban ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052662510

We know only little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g. distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis. In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can support the bees. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Citizen science; Solitary bees; Spatial distribution; Sun exposure; Trap nest; Urban landscape structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052659782

The species is incipiently domesticated and little studied, despite its growing economic importance for smallholder farmers and gatherers. Studies on the mating system are required for the conservation and use of the species' genetic resources. Our objective was to estimate mating system parameters of the Tucumã palm using microsatellite markers. Plants of 11 progenies of a spontaneous population were genotyped with eight microsatellite loci and the mating system parameters estimated. The population outcrossing rate was estimated at 0.978, and ranged from 0.774 to 1at the family level. The estimates of the correlation of paternity (0.176 and 0.205) suggest a low probability of full-sibs within progenies.

We investigated whether successional context determined the impact of consumers and mutualists by quantifying their effects on reproduction by the shrub Vaccinium membranaceum in primary and secondary successional sites at Mount St. Helens (Washington, USA), and used simulations to explore the effects of these interactions on colonization. Species interactions differed substantially between sites, and the combined effect of consumers and mutualists was much more strongly negative for primary successional plants. Because greater local control of propagule pressure is expected to increase successional rates, we evaluated the role of dispersal in the context of these interactions. Our simulations showed that even a small local seed source greatly increases population growth rates, thereby balancing strong consumer pressure. The prevalence of strong negative interactions in the primary successional site is a reminder that successional communities will not exhibit the distribution of interaction strengths characteristic of stable communities, and suggests the potential utility of modeling succession as the consequence of interaction strengths. © 2011 Yang et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054783143

However, the evolutionary processes that gave rise to these associations remain poorly understood. We reconstructed the times of divergence, diversification patterns, and interaction networks of a diverse group of specialized orchids and their bee pollinators. In contrast to a scenario of coevolution by race formation, we show that fragrance-producing orchids originated at least three times independently after their fragrance-collecting bee mutualists. Whereas orchid diversification has apparently tracked the diversification of orchids' bee pollinators, bees appear to have depended on the diverse chemical environment of neotropical forests. We corroborated this apparent asymmetrical dependency by simulating co-extinction cascades in real interaction networks that lacked reciprocal specialization. These results suggest that the diversification of insect-pollinated angiosperms may have been facilitated by the exploitation of preexisting sensory biases of insect pollinators.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053158441

Flowering extends from October to February, the anthesis is diurnal. We found the reproductive system to be partially autogamous without the possibility of intra-floral selfing. Therefore the bromeliad is pollinator-dependent, but the flowers do not need to be cross-pollinated. Mean nectar sugar concentration was 20.7% with a high sucrose proportion. Flowers secreted 73.9 ?l nectar per day. Although the flowers show ornithophilous features like tubular and scentless flowers and higher energetic nectar in the morning hours, besides two hummingbird species we recorded 28 species of insects and spiders also associated with the flowers of V. friburgensis. Species richness of flower visitors was higher in restinga than in secondary forest. In both habitat types hummingbirds and bees were the most frequent visitor groups, but whereas hummingbirds were the most frequent animals visiting flowers in secondary forest, followed by bees, the opposite was the case in the restinga habitats. Because V. friburgensis is partially autogamous, small bees might also be pollinators, transferring self-pollen. Thus, there is redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees, leading to a high probability of successful reproduction in this bromeliad species.",Bees; Bromeliaceae; Flowering biology; Hummingbird; Nectar analysis; Omithophily; Santa Catarina Island; Southern Brazil; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054701410

Box 630, 6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands","Background: Parthenocarpy is a desirable trait in Capsicum annuum production because it improves fruit quality and results in a more regular fruit set. Previously, we identified several C. annuum genotypes that already show a certain level of parthenocarpy, and the seedless fruits obtained from these genotypes often contain carpel-like structures. In the Arabidopsis bel1 mutant ovule integuments are transformed into carpels, and we therefore carefully studied ovule development in C. annuum and correlated aberrant ovule development and carpelloid transformation with parthenocarpic fruit set.Results: We identified several additional C. annuum genotypes with a certain level of parthenocarpy, and confirmed a positive correlation between parthenocarpic potential and the development of carpelloid structures. Investigations into the source of these carpel-like structures showed that while the majority of the ovules in C. annuum gynoecia are unitegmic and anatropous, several abnormal ovules were observed, abundant at the top and base of the placenta, with altered integument growth. Abnormal ovule primordia arose from the placenta and most likely transformed into carpelloid structures in analogy to the Arabidopsis bel1 mutant. When pollination was present fruit weight was positively correlated with seed number, but in the absence of seeds, fruit weight proportionally increased with the carpelloid mass and number. Capsicum genotypes with high parthenocarpic potential always showed stronger carpelloid development. The parthenocarpic potential appeared to be controlled by a single recessive gene, but no variation in coding sequence was observed in a candidate gene CaARF8.Conclusions: Our results suggest that in the absence of fertilization most C. annuum genotypes, have parthenocarpic potential and carpelloid growth, which can substitute developing seeds in promoting fruit development. © 2011 Tiwari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054758483

The ants feed on the mutualistic fig-pollinating wasps as well as on parasitic non-pollinating fig wasps. Nevertheless fig-wasps may not constitute a sufficient food source to ensure permanent presence of ants on the tree as the ants were observed to be frequently associated with hemipterans such as coccids and aphids. Fig wasps seem to constitute a reliable and sufficient food source on some dioecious Ficus species. On the contrary, in monoecious Ficus species, resident ants have always been observed to tend homopteran in addition to feeding on fig wasps. Frequent fruiting, prolonged fruit ripening period, ramiflory and rapid growth could constitute traits facilitating strong association based on fig-wasps' consumption of the monoecious F. subpisocarpa with ants.

These characteristics make this virus difficult to control. We show here that the over-expression of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in tomato and petunia is related to TSWV resistance.Results: The open reading frame and full-length sequence of the tomato AOX gene LeAox1au were cloned and introduced into tomato 'Healani' and petunia 'Sheer Madness' using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Highly expressed AOX transgenic tomato and petunia plants were selfed and transgenic R1 seedlings from 10 tomato lines and 12 petunia lines were used for bioassay. For each assayed line, 22 to 32 tomato R1 progeny in three replications and 39 to 128 petunia progeny in 13 replications were challenged with TSWV. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays showed that the TSWV levels in transgenic tomato line FKT4-1 was significantly lower than that of wild-type controls after challenge with TSWV. In addition, transgenic petunia line FKP10 showed significantly less lesion number and smaller lesion size than non-transgenic controls after inoculation by TSWV.Conclusion: In all assayed transgenic tomato lines, a higher percentage of transgenic progeny had lower TSWV levels than non-transgenic plants after challenge with TSWV, and the significantly increased resistant levels of tomato and petunia lines identified in this study indicate that altered expression levels of AOX in tomato and petunia can affect the levels of TSWV resistance. © 2011 Ma et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054684838

Therefore, producing breeding selfcompatible almond genotypes is of great importance. In this research work, the growth of pollen tube was studied in 38 genotypes obtained after crossing ""Touno"" (male parent) with ""Shahrood 12"" (female parent). To study fruit set during years 2009 and 2010, four branches of each genotype were bagged in stage D. Results showed that some genotypes were self- compatible. On the other hand, crosspollination increased the fruit set of self-compatible genotypes. For microscopic study, flowers were harvested at 24, 72 and 120 h after hand pollination. Results of two years (2009 and 2010) study indicated that 24 and 72 h were not enough for the pollen tube to reach the base of style, whereas 120 h were an appropriate time. To double check the status of self-compatible those genotypes and to determinate the situation of genotypes recognized as doubtful by the use of fluorescent microscopy, PCR reaction was carried out with specific primers of SfF and SfR. PCR results confirmed the situation of self-compatible genotypes. In addition, it indicated that five doubtful genotypes were self-compatible. However, another four genotypes were recognized as self-incompatible. In general, 50% of genotypes were realized as self-compatible and another 50% were self-incompatible. © 2011 Academic Journals.",Cross compatibility; Fluorescent microscopy; Fruit set; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Self compatibility; Self pollination; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80355134536

Germinated pollen tubes were observed on stigmas four days after pollination (DAP), and penetrated into the ovaries between seven and fourteen DAP. Zygotes were observed in embryo sacs 3-4 weeks after pollination (WAP). Fruits began to develop six WAP, with seeds containing a minute embryo, however, unable to germinate. The seed germination percentage was 7.5% at eight WAP and 39.4-62.7% between ten to fourteen WAP. The fruits could generate more than 63,838 seeds per capsule and more than 95% of the seeds contained an embryo.

However, it is not known whether this benefit is received by each participant node in proportion to its overall contribution to network persistence. This issue is critical to understanding the trade-offs faced by individual nodes in a network. We address this question by applying a suite of structural and dynamic methods to an ensemble of flowering plant/insect pollinator networks. Here we report two main results. First, nodes contribute heterogeneously to the overall nested architecture of the network. From simulations, we confirm that the removal of a strong contributor tends to decrease overall network persistence more than the removal of a weak contributor. Second, strong contributors to collective persistence do not gain individual survival benefits but are in fact the nodes most vulnerable to extinction. We explore the generality of these results to other cooperative networks by analysing a 15-year time series of the interactions between designer and contractor firms in the New York City garment industry. As with the ecological networks, a firm's survival probability decreases as its individual nestedness contribution increases. Our results, therefore, introduce a new paradox into the study of the persistence of cooperative networks, and potentially address questions about the impact of invasive species in ecological systems and new competitors in economic systems. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We determined the suitability of microcapillary tubes to estimate the energetic value of Acrotriche patula R.Br. (Ericaceae) nectar from total sugar mass. We collected a standing crop of nectar from individual flowers with microcapillary tubes and subsequently washed the flowers to recover putatively any residual sucrose, glucose, and fructose. We assessed microcapillary nectar volume as a predictor for total sugar mass in a flower by regression analysis, identified the percentage of sugar missed by microcapillary tubes, and compared sugar ratios between microcapillary samples and total nectar. Nectar volume collected with microcapillary tubes cannot be used to predict total nectar sugar contents in a flower. Microcapillary tubes missed 71% of the floral sugar on average, but not a large volume, indicating that sugar is not evenly distributed in a flower's nectar. Proportions of different sugars did not differ significantly between microcapillary samples and total samples. Animals with different tongue morphologies and feeding behaviours may obtain different energetic rewards from the same flower with low nectar volume.

Experiment treatments were compared in a split-plot design by a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Main factors included non-stress, drought stress in 6 to 7 leaves (vegetative) stage, drought stress in pollination stage and drought stress in grain filling stage. Sub factors were 7 inbred lines. Five stress tolerance indices, including mean productivity (MP), stress tolerance (TOL), stress susceptibility (SSI), stress tolerance index (STI) and geometric mean productivity (GMP) were used in this study. Drought stress in grain filling stage had the minimum grain yield that showed severe effects of drought stress at this stage of growth. Data analysis revealed that the MP, GMP and STI indices were the more accurate criteria for selection of drought tolerant and high yielding inbred lines. The positive and significant correlation of STI and grain yield under all conditions revealed that this index is more applicable and efficient for selection of parental inbred lines in producing hybrids tolerant to drought in vegetative, pollination and grain filling stages and high yielding under non-stress and stress conditions. Based on the STI, GMP and MP indices, K166B proved to be the most drought tolerant line. Biplot analysis allowed us to distinguish groups of tolerant and sensitive inbred lines.

Fasciated plants produce more seed capsules on average; however, the cause of fasciation in V. thapsus is not known. This study investigated whether fasciation in V. thapsus has a simple genetic basis, or whether it is caused by physical damage or pathogenic bacteria. Plants derived from self-pollinated fasciated and normal plants were grown in a field common garden and subjected to mechanical damage (simulated herbivory) and natural herbivory. Bacteria cultured from normal and fasciated plants were compared, and field plants were inoculated with a slurry of fasciated tissue. In the common garden, 31% of plants developed fasciation, but fasciation did not follow a simple monogenic pattern of inheritance. Artificial damage substantially reduced fasciation rates; damaged plants were between 1.3 and 32 times less likely to become fasciated, compared with undamaged plants. Bacterial isolates were similar between normal and fasciated plants and no inoculated plants developed fasciation, suggesting that bacteria do not cause fasciation. Fasciated and normal plants often grow less than 1 m apart, indicating that climatic factors are not inducers of fasciation.

We have previously shown that ectopically expressing Arabidopsis thaliana JA O-methyltransferase in Nicotiana attenuata (35S-jmt) strongly reduces the herbivory-elicited jasmonate bursts by acting as metabolic sink that redirects free JA towards methylation; here we examine the consequences of this metabolic sink on N. attenuata's secondary metabolism and performance in nature. In the glasshouse, 35S-jmt plants produced fewer seed capsules due to shorter floral styles, which could be restored to wild type (WT) levels after hand-pollination, and were more susceptible to Manduca sexta larvae attack. When transplanted into the Great Basin Desert in Utah, 35S-jmt plants grew as well as WT empty vector, but were highly attacked by native herbivores of different feeding guilds: leaf chewers, miners, and single cell feeders. This greater susceptibility was strongly associated with reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds (hexenylesters, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and profound alterations in the production of direct defenses (trypsin proteinase inhibitors [TPI], nicotine, diterpene glycosides [DTGs] and phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugates) as revealed by a combination of targeted and metabolomics analyses of field collected samples. Complementation experiments with JA-Ile, whose formation is outcompeted in 35S-jmt plants by the methylation reaction, restored the local TPI activation to WT levels and partially complemented nicotine and DTG levels in elicited but not systemic leaves. These findings demonstrate that MeJA, the major JA metabolite in 35S-jmt plants, is not an active signal in defense activation and highlights the value of creating JA sinks to disrupt JA signaling, without interrupting the complete octadecanoid pathway, in order to investigate the regulation of plants' defense metabolism in nature. © 2011 Stitz et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053916546

Using the reciprocal fig-fig wasp mutualism, we show that nonlinear amplification of interference competition between fig wasps - which limits the fig wasps' ability to use a common resource (i.e. female flowers) - keeps the common resource unsaturated, making cooperation locally stable. When interference competition was manually prevented, the fitness correlation between figs and fig wasps went from positive to negative. This indicates that genetic relatedness or reciprocal exchange between cooperative players, which could create spatial heterogeneity or self-restraint, was not sufficient to maintain stable cooperation. Moreover, our analysis of field-collected data shows that the fitness correlation between cooperative partners varies stochastically, and that the mainly positive fitness correlation observed during the warm season shifts to a negative correlation during the cold season owing to an increase in the initial oviposition efficiency of each fig wasp. This implies that the discriminative sanction of less-cooperative wasps (i.e. by decreasing the egg deposition efficiency per fig wasp) but reward to cooperative wasps by fig, a control of the initial value, will facilitate a stable mutualism. Our finding that asymmetric interaction leading to an indeterminate fitness interaction between symbiont (i.e. cooperative actors) and host (i.e. recipient) has the potential to explain why conflict has been empirically observed in both well-documented intraspecific and interspecific cooperation systems. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Asymmetric cooperation; Chaotic oscillation; Fig-fig wasp; Interference competition; Mutualism; Tragedy of the commons,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961134910

Other prominent hypotheses predict that either contemporary climate or species richness affect biotic specialization. To gain insight into geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization and its drivers, we use network analysis to determine the degree of specialization in plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks sampled at 31 localities, spanning a wide range of climate regimes across the Americas. We found greater biotic specialization at lower latitudes, with latitude explaining 20-22% of the spatial variation in plant-hummingbird specialization. Potential drivers of specialization - contemporary climate, Quaternary climate-change velocity, and species richness - had superior explanatory power, together explaining 53-64% of the variation in specialization. Notably, our data provides empirical evidence for the hypothesized roles of species richness, contemporary precipitation and Quaternary climate-change velocity as key predictors of biotic specialization, whereas contemporary temperature and seasonality seem unimportant in determining specialization. These results suggest that both ecological and evolutionary processes at Quaternary time scales can be important in driving large-scale geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization, at least for co-evolved systems such as plant-hummingbird networks. © 2011 Dalsgaard et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053605229

One strategy used to overcome this problem is to search for mutations of inflorescence morphology. Long-peduncle (lp), branched-raceme (br) and top-flowering (tf) inflorescence mutations increase the number of flowers per inflorescence, but they do not improve seed set per flower. Here we assessed pollen tube growth in styles of those inflorescence mutants and we observed embryo and endosperm development in seeds 1 to 16 days after pollination (DAP). The number of pollen tubes penetrating the style and the ovary was similar in all tested mutants and in the reference cultivar Radius. At 2 DAP, fertilized ovules were 2.7-3.9 times less numerous in certain inflorescence mutants than in the short-raceme cv. Radius. Ovule degeneration progressed at 2-4 DAP in all analyzed plants. Most ovules were not properly developed in the control cultivar (62%), nor in the forms with mutated inflorescence morphology (69-86%). The number of seeds per pod was lowest in the tf form despite its having the highest number of ovules per ovary. It appears that the number of ovules per pistil is not a crucial factor in seed set in alfalfa when fertilization efficiency is very low. Both poor fertilization and gradual ovule degeneration were factors causing poor seed set in the investigated alfalfa genotypes. © Polish Academy of Sciences and Jagiellonian University, Cracow 2011.",Embryo development; Inflorescence mutants; Medicago sativa; Pollen tubes; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053373752

While the sweetest nectar offers the greatest energetic rewards, the sharp increase of viscosity with sugar concentration makes it the most difficult to transport. We here demonstrate that the sugar concentration that optimizes energy transport depends exclusively on the drinking technique employed. We identify three nectar drinking techniques: active suction, capillary suction, and viscous dipping. For each, we deduce the dependence of the volume intake rate on the nectar viscosity and thus infer an optimal sugar concentration consistent with laboratory measurements. Our results provide the first rationale for why suction feeders typically pollinate flowers with lower sugar concentration nectar than their counterparts that use viscous dipping.",Biocapillarity; Biomechanics; Optimal concentration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053644847

Melons in India may be feral or cultivated, have netted or smooth rinds, be sweet and eaten as a dessert fruit or not sweet and consumed as a vegetable fresh, cooked, or dried. The fruit may be processed for sweet juice and confectionary flavoring, and the seeds are a source of high-quality cooking oil and high-protein seed meal. This chapter reviews genetic variation for resistance to fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases and to nematodes and insects; and tolerance to soil salinity, drought, flooding, and high temperatures with a focus on melon accessions of Indian origins. Some of these resistances have knowing or unknowingly been transferred through scientifically based breeding programs into open-pollinated and hybrid sweet melon cultivars grown in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Americas for domestic and export markets. Indian melons include unique sources of high acidity and sugar:acid ratio that enable breeding for new combinations of sweet and sour flavors for fresh and processed melon products. Genetic variation in carotenoids (?-carotene), ascorbic acid, and micronutrient (Fe and Zn) contents in Indian germplasm promise more nutritious melons. High percentages of unique alleles are present in southern (24.2%)andeastern (30.4%) Indian landraces and in ""wild"" accessions from northern India (34.5%). Extensive collection, preservation, and evaluation of Indian melon landraces is vital to prevent further genetic erosion in this primary center of melon diversity, to increase genetic variability for melon breeding, and to introduce new traits into modern melon cultivars. International collaborations are developing genomics tools for melon that will facilitate allele mining within Indian germplasm and introduce new genetic variability.We are on the verge of an exciting era of melon genetic improvement as whole-plant breeding and genomics technologies combine to preserve and fully characterize the complete array of genetic variability in melon and exploit that germplasm and information for the further improvement of salad and dessert melons for diverse markets worldwide. © 2012 Wiley-Blackwell.",Breeding; Cucumis melo; Flavor; Genetics; Host plant resistance; Molecular markers; Phytonutrient,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84255174474

Some are widely grown, while cultivation of others is restricted. They differ in ploidy, genome size, and breeding system, but their grains are all highly nutritious. Their most common nonfood uses are in brewing and as livestock feeds. Millets are C 4 plants adapted to marginal lands in hot, drought-prone arid and semiarid regions. Selection for plant phenology and architecture, panicle shape, spikelet structure and reduced shattering, seed dormancy, and seed coat hardness contributed to their domestication. Approximately 161,708 millet accessions are preserved in gene banks globally. These show exceptional diversity associated for phenology, photoperiod sensitivity, tolerance to abiotic stresses, resistance to biotic stresses, seed storability and shelf life, and specific grain characteristics associated with end user preferences. Contributions from wild relatives' toward enhancing cultivated gene pools have been limited to pearl millet and foxtail millet. Core or minicore/reference collections have been used to identify new sources of biotic stress resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. Waxy mutants have been selected in barnyard millet, foxtail millet, and proso millet for specific food uses. Pearl millet hybrids and open pollinated varieties (OPVs) with high iron and zinc grain densities will soon be available in India. While no transgenic work has reached field level, DNA markers are routinely used to assess millets' population structure and genetic diversity. Genetic maps of varying density are reported in finger millet, foxtail millet, pearl millet, proso millet, and tef. Major quantitative trait loci associated with resistance to downy mildew, rust, and blast and tolerance to terminal drought stress have been backcrossed into elite inbred pearl millet hybrid parents. Markerassisted backcrossing has been used to improve downy mildew resistance in pearl millet. Cytoplasmic-genetic male sterility (CMS)-based hybrids of pearl millet are extensively cultivated, and CMS systems for foxtail millet are under development. An aligned genome sequence of foxtail millet will be released in the near future as this millet is closely related to several polyploid bioenergy grasses. This foxtail millet genome sequence is highly syntenic with those of rice, sorghum, and maize, which should allow comprehensive surveys of genetic diversity for identifying and conserving diversity in grass germplasm with bioenergy crop potential. © 2012 Wiley-Blackwell.",Diversity; Domestication; Genetic markers; Genome synteny; Phylogeny; Population structure; Quantitative trait loci; Stress tolerance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859647501

These include insect pollinators, to whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape. With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary bees. © 2011 Rands, Whitney.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053453054

Information compiled from field trials on GM trees is essential to propose measures to minimize the transgene dispersal. We have conducted a field trial of seven consecutive years to investigate the maximum frequency of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop transgene flow in a citrus orchard, and its relation to the genetic, phenological and environmental factors involved. Methodology/Principal Findings: Three different citrus genotypes carrying the uidA (GUS) tracer marker gene (pollen donors) and a non-GM self-incompatible contiguous citrus genotype (recipient) were used in conditions allowing natural entomophilous pollination to occur. The examination of 603 to 2990 seeds per year showed unexpectedly low frequencies (0.17-2.86%) of transgene flow. Paternity analyses of the progeny of subsets of recipient plants using 10 microsatellite (SSR) loci demonstrated a higher mating competence of trees from another non-GM pollen source population that greatly limited the mating chance of the contiguous cross-compatible and flowering-synchronized transgenic pollen source. This mating superiority could be explained by a much higher pollen competition capacity of the non-GM genotypes, as was confirmed through mixed-hand pollinations. Conclusions/Significance: Pollen competition strongly contributed to transgene confinement. Based on this finding, suitable isolation measures are proposed for the first time to prevent transgene outflow between contiguous plantings of citrus types that may be extendible to other entomophilous transgenic fruit tree species. © 2011 Pons et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053462824

DNA fingerprinting and pedigree reconstruction can substitute for artificial matings, by allowing parentage delineation of naturally produced offspring. Here, we report on the efficacy of a breeding concept called ""Breeding without Breeding"" (BwB) that circumvents artificial matings, focusing instead on a subset of randomly sampled, maternally known but paternally unknown offspring to delineate their paternal parentage. We then generate the information needed to rank those offspring and their paternal parents, using a combination of complete (full-sib: FS) and incomplete (half-sib: HS) analyses of the constructed pedigrees. Using a random sample of wind-pollinated offspring from 15 females (seed donors), growing in a 41-parent western larch population, BwB is evaluated and compared to two commonly used testing methods that rely on either incomplete (maternal half-sib, open-pollinated: OP) or complete (FS) pedigree designs. BwB produced results superior to those from the incomplete design and virtually identical to those from the complete pedigree methods. The combined use of complete and incomplete pedigree information permitted evaluating all parents, both maternal and paternal, as well as all offspring, a result that could not have been accomplished with either the OP or FS methods alone. We also discuss the optimum experimental setting, in terms of the proportion of fingerprinted offspring, the size of the assembled maternal and paternal half-sib families, the role of external gene flow, and selfing, as well as the number of parents that could be realistically tested with BwB. © 2011 El-Kassaby et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053444121

Visitors to C. florida varied considerably across sites and between years, however bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae were consistently present and are expected to be key pollinators of flowering dogwood. Although halictid bees were also common visitors to C. kousa the most common visitors to Chinese dogwood were scarab, cerambycid, and cantharid beetles. © 2011 Kansas Entomological Society.",Andrenidae; Anthophilid hymenoptera; Chinese dogwood; entomophily; floral visitors; flowering dogwood; Halictidae; insect pollinators; pollen coverage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855952164

Flowering invasive plant species that are visited by native insects and overlap with native plant species in their pollinators may facilitate or disrupt native flower visitation and fertilisation by forming large, dense populations with high numbers of flowers and copious rewards. We investigated the direction of such a proposed effect for the alien invasive Rhododendron ponticum in Irish habitats. Flower visitation, conspecific and alien pollen deposition, fruit and seed set were measured in a self-compatible native focal plant, Digitalis purpurea, and compared between field sites that contained different relative abundances of R. ponticum. Flower visitation was significantly lower at higher alien relative plant abundances than at lower abundances or in the absence of the alien. Native flowers experienced a significant decrease in conspecific pollen deposition with increasing alien abundance. Heterospecific pollen transfer was very low in all field sites but increased significantly with increasing relative R. ponticum abundance. However, lower flower visitation and lower conspecific pollen transfer did not alter reproductive success of D. purpurea. Our study shows that indirect interactions between alien and native plants for pollination can be modified by population characteristics (such as relative abundance) in a similar way as interactions among native plant species. In D. purpurea, only certain aspects of pollination and reproduction were affected by high alien abundances which is probably a result of high resilience due to a self-compatible breeding system. Native species that are more susceptible to pollen limitation are more likely to experience fitness disadvantages in habitats with high relative alien plant abundances. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Plant diversity; Pollen deposition; Pollinator visitation; Reproductive output; Rhododendron ponticum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052651378

The two adjacent habitats on the same successional gradient were sampled by sweeping with additional data from pitfall traps for bees and by direct observation with close focus binoculars and occasional verification through capture with a net for butterflies. The sampling was done during 11 visits in 2008 beginning 16 May and ending 13 September. Both bee and butterfly diversity were higher in the post-fire burned alvar woodland compared to the adjacent unburned woodland based on species richness, number of individuals and Brillouin's Biodiversity Index which takes evenness and heterogeneity into account. No bees were captured in the unburned area, but 34 species and 201 individuals were captured in the burned site. The most abundant bee species was Augochlora aurata. Lepidoptera were represented in the burned site by 35 species and 408 individuals compared to 15 species and 21 individuals in the unburned woodland. The most common butterfly species in the burned woodland was Callophrys polios. The higher diversity of pollinators in the burned site was correlated with both higher vascular plant diversity and much higher cover and frequency values for insect-pollinated plants providing nectar and pollen including flowering shrubs such as Amelanchier alnifolia var. compacta, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi and Prunus virginiana. The burned site also provided more cover of larval food plants for butterflies and apparently more nesting sites for bees. We suggest that a decrease in fire frequency and in the availability of open successional habitats are contributing factors in the decline of pollinators, and that endangered ecosystems where fire has been a natural phenomenon may require fire or fire-simulated management to sustain their biodiversity.",Alvar; Biodiversity; Canada; Fire; Hymenoptera; Lepidoptera; Ontario; Pollinators; Succession,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866013019

Firstly, if range limits are imposed by biotic factors, current and future distribution ranges might not be constrained by climate. Secondly, if biotic interactions limit the distribution ranges of species, anthropogenic impacts on these interactions are likely to have a major effect on biodiversity. Here we test the role of pollination in limiting plant distributions by studying plant community assembly in a guild of 15 oil-secreting orchids (Coryciinae) along a pollination gradient. In all members of the guild, seed production depends on pollination by the oil-collecting bee Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae). While the mode of aboveground reproduction is uniform across the guild, the orchid species differ widely in their capacity for belowground clonal reproduction through the formation of bulbils, and hence span a range of predicted dependence on pollination (and subsequent seed set) for population persistence. Pollination rate by R. peringueyi varied across the landscape from 0 to 98% of flowers pollinated. With decreasing pollination, species richness of the orchid guild declined, and species were lost by the successive deletion of the least clonal species. Thus, pollination is shown to act as a biotic filter, excluding non-clonal species from pollinator-poor communities. The findings are consistent with the idea that pollination mutualisms matter ecologically by limiting the distribution of non-clonal plants. Conversely, the results suggest that clonality allows some plant species to escape from the range of their pollinators. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053050461

However, the contributions and spatial scales at which these drivers operate and interact are not fully understood, particularly in the developing world. The impact of both local management and landscape context on insect pollinators and natural enemy communities and on their capacity to deliver related ecosystem services to an economically important tropical crop, pigeonpea was investigated. The study was conducted in nine paired farms across a gradient of increasing distance to semi-native vegetation in Kibwezi, Kenya. Results show that proximity of fields to semi-native habitats negatively affected pollinator and chewing insect abundance. Within fields, pesticide use was a key negative predictor of pollinator, pest and foliar active predator abundance. On the contrary, fertilizer application significantly enhanced pollinator and both chewing and sucking insect pest abundance. At a 1. km spatial scale of fields, there were significant negative effects of the number of semi-native habitat patches within fields dominated by mass flowering pigeonpea on pollinators abundance. For service provision, a significant decline in fruit set when insects were excluded from flowers was recorded. This study reveals the interconnections of pollinators, predators and pests with pigeonpea crop. For sustainable yields and to conserve high densities of both pollinators and predators of pests within pigeonpea landscapes, it is crucial to target the adoption of less disruptive farm management practices such as reducing pesticide and fertilizer inputs. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Bio-control; Farm management; Fruit set; Landscape context; Pollination; The developing world,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860389239

Using Abronia alpina, a rare alpine endemic of the California Floristic Province, we demonstrate that there are exceptions to these predictions. Methods: We present the results of both a pollination experiment and a genetic study using AFLPs (amplified fragment length polymorphisms). Using controlled hand-pollination and pollinator observations, we examined the breeding system, pollination ecology, and mechanism for self-incompatibility in A. alpina. Key results: Abronia alpina exhibits an allogamous mating system with probable self-incompatibility resulting from limited growth of pollen tubes originating from self-pollination. Only xenogamous crosses and open-pollinated controls produced seed, and only xenogamous crosses produced pollen tubes that reached the ovary. The molecular study shows that A. alpina has substantial genetic diversity for a rare, endemic species, evidenced by the high percentage of polymorphic loci and average expected heterozygosity. Gene flow among subpopulations, as inferred from AFLP markers, appears to be substantial, although the Kern River is an important physical barrier. Conclusions: Our results indicate that A. alpina is dependent on insects for both seed production and the maintenance of genetic diversity. This finding suggests that pollinators may be crucial to the long-term adaptive potential of rare, endemic plants and that conservation of rare endemics is, in part, dependent on community-level interactions such as plant - pollinator mutualisms. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Abronia; AFLP; Allogamy; Endemic; Genetic diversity; Outcrossing; Pollination biology; Population structure; Rare plant; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857355262

Here we show that the scent from virgin flowers of the host Yucca glauca is sufficient to attract its obligate pollinator Tegeticula yuccasella in Y-tube olfactometer tests. Interestingly, both sexes of moths were attracted to the scent stimulus. Because yucca moths mate inside host flowers, the attraction of both females and males to host floral volatiles is likely to increase encounter rates. In a second test, female moths did not discriminate between virgin and hand-pollinated flowers, indicating no post-pollination change in scent production by the host that would lead to a reduction in pollinator attraction and thereby limit exploitation of the available seeds in host flowers. However, other mechanisms that could stabilise the mutualism between T. yuccasella and its yucca hosts have already been documented, i.e. selective abortion of heavily infested flowers, and a female-derived host-marking pheromone.

To overcome this problem, in this study, we report on selection of self-pollinated A. annua plants and characterize their development and artemisinin biosynthesis. Self-pollinated F2 plants selected were grown under optimized growth conditions, consisting of long day (16 h of light) and short day (9 h of light) exposures in a phytotron. The life cycles of these plants were approximately 3 months long, and final heights of 30-35 cm were achieved. The leaves on the main stems exhibited obvious morphological changes, from indented single leaves to odd, pinnately compound leaves. Leaves and flowers formed glandular and T-shaped trichomes on their surfaces. The glandular trichome densities increased from the bottom to the top leaves. High performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling analyses showed that leaves, flowers, and young seedlings of F2 plants produced artemisinin. In leaves, the levels of artemisinin increased from the bottom to the top of the plants, showing a positive correlation to the density increase of glandular trichomes. RT-PCR analysis showed that progeny of self-pollinated plants expressed the amorpha-4, 11-diene synthase (ADS) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 71 AV1 (CYP71AV1) genes, which are involved in artemisinin biosynthesis in leaves and flowers.

(Euphorbiaceae) is presented and compared of those of J. mollissima (Pohl) Baill. and J. mutabilis (Pohl) Baill. The study was undertaken in an area of hyperxerophilous caatinga at the Estação Biológica de Canudos, Bahia State, Brazil, from May 2005 to June 2007. The flowers of the three species are disposed in a protogynic dichasium. In J. ribifolia both staminate and pistilate flowers last for about 48 hours and flower opening is diurnal, while in J. mollissima and J. mutabilis the staminate flowers last from 12 to 15 hours and the pistilate flowers from 36 to 48 hours, with flower opening occurring at sunset. Nectar production, pollen viability, and stigma receptivity initiate soon after full opening of both floral types, and sexual activity overlaps until senescence. Nectar production varied throughout the day, with higher production by the pistilate flowers; pollen viability and stigma receptivity during the lifetime of the flower occurred in all three species. Significant differences occurred between the reproductive system treatments of J. mollissima (KW = 59.796), J. mutabilis (KW = 59.058), or J. ribifolia (KW = 63.660). The three species produced fruits by experimental geitonogamy as well as experimental xenogamy, while only J. ribifolia produced fruits by spontaneous geitonogamy. The bees Apis mellifera, Xylocopa frontalis and X. grisescens and the hummingbirds Chlorostilbon lucidus and Anopetia gounellei are potential pollinators for J. mollissima and J. mutabilis and A. mellifera and X. grisescens are potential pollinators for J. ribifolia. The diversity of anthophiles on flowers of the three species allows pollen flow and fruit set. On the other hand asynchronous flowering and differences of flower morphology and anthesis help maintain the reproductive isolation and prevent the loss of interspecific pollen due to sharing of pollinators.",Bees; Floral biology; Melittophily; Ornithophyly; Reproductive system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856057322

Seemannia sylvatica is an herb that occurs in dense populations in the riverbeds at Serra da Bodoquena. Goals of this study were to report the floral biology (on the first five days of anthesis), as well as to determine the breeding system and the pollinators of S. sylvatica. Data collection was conducted from June 2005 to July 2006 through monthly field trips, lasting for five days. Data on floral biology, breeding system and on the floral visitors were taken from individuals located along a track 2500 m long, in riparian forest of Salobrinha river. Flowers of S. sylvatica are tubular, red, with no perceptive odor and lasted more than five days (ca. 10 - 20 days in individuals transferred to an urban garden and kept in vases). Seemania sylvatica is protandrous, and the male phase occurred between the first and the fourth days of anthesis, while the female one started in the fifth day. Mean nectar volume secreted was 4.77 ± 3.2 ?l, with a significative variation among flowers of different ages. Otherwise, nectar concentration average was 9.71 ± 4.41%, and did not varied significantly in flowers of different ages. The flowers of S. sylvatica were pollinated mainly by the hummingbirds Phaethornis pretrei and Thalurania furcata, and pierced by the bee Ceratina chloris. The butterfly Parides anchises orbygnianus was considered an occasional pollinator of these flowers. Seemannia sylvatica is selfcompatible, since fruit set occurred on the experiments of spontaneous self-pollination, manual self-pollination, cross- pollination and open pollination (control). The protandry, coupled with the pattern of nectar production, characterized by low volume and solute concentration, which induces the pollinators to visit different flowers in a given circuit foraging, act maximizing the likelihood of cross-pollination in S. sylvatica. Moreover, the high proportion of fruit set by autogamy is an important strategy considering that S. sylvatica is visited by few species, being pollinated mainly by P. pretrei. Therefore, in the absence of these visitors, the formation of fruits may be achieved.",Breeding system; Ornithophily; Phaethornis pretrei; Protandry; Riparian forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860911361

The data set covers an 11-year period (1999-2009) and includes one of the largest spectra, with 19 taxa, as well as seven meteorological variables (minimum-, maximum- and mean temperature, total radiation, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed). For highly skewed data, such as the annual total number of pollen counts or annual peak pollen concentrations, the Mann-Kendall test has a substantially greater predictive power than the t-test. After performing Mann-Kendall tests, the annual cycles of daily slopes of pollen concentration trends and annual cycles of daily slopes of climate variable trends are calculated. This kind of trend analysis is a novel approach as it provides information on annual cycles of trends. In order to represent the strength of their relationships an association measure (AM) and a multiple association measure (MAM) are introduced. Based on climate sensitivity, the individual taxa are sorted into three categories. The results obtained for the pollen quantity and phenological characteristics are compared with two novel climate change related categories, namely risk and expansion potential due to the climate change for each taxon. The total annual pollen count and annual peak pollen concentrations indicate a small number of changes when using ordinary linear trends, while the total annual pollen count calculated via daily linear trends show significant trends (70% of them positive) for almost all taxa. However, except for Poaceae and Urtica, there is no significant change in the duration of the pollination season. The association measure performs well compared to the climate change related forces. Furthermore, remarkable changes in pollen season characteristics are also in accordance with the risk and expansion potential due to climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Climate change; Pollen; Pollination season; Respiratory allergy; Trend,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81155159729

Thirty-five pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.) fields ranging from 0.6 to 26.3 ha, 12 supplemented with A. mellifera hives and 23 not supplemented, were sampled during peak flowering over three successive weeks in 2008 and 2009.

A. mellifera, Bombus impatiens Cresson, and Peponapis pruinosa (Say) accounted for 99% of all bee visits to flowers. A. mellifera and B. impatiens visited significantly more pistillate flowers than would be expected by chance, whereas P. pruinosa showed no preference for visiting pistillate flowers.

This article reevaluates pollen and tapetal characters, with a focus on one major subclade, the parietal clade. Pollen structure and, where possible, development are examined in representatives of the parietal clade from Passifloraceae (Passiflora, Turnera), Salicaceae (Populus, Salix), and Violaceae (Viola), and in Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae), Hypericum (Hypericaceae), and Linum and Reinwardtia (Linaceae) from other Malpighiales. Pollen and tapetal characters in the parietal clade and selected outgroups are tabulated, using both original observations and an extensive literature search. Optimization of pollen and tapetal characters onto a recent molecular phylogeny indicates that lalongate endoapertures are a potential synapomorphy for the parietal clade. Passifloraceae (including the former Turneraceae) have some potential apomorphies: larger pollen size, greater diversity in endoaperture shape, and a plasmodial tapetum. The occurrence of a thick bilayered or channeled apertural intine may support a sister relationship between Passifloraceae and Violaceae, together with pollen with more than three colporate apertures. Very small pollen size indicates that Goupiaceae are potentially more closely related to the Lacistemataceae-Salicaceae clade than to Passifloraceae-Violaceae. Highly apomorphic, thin-walled, inaperturate pollen occurs in the wind-pollinated Populus. Outside the parietal clade, Malpighiales pollen is highly diverse, including large, intectate, baculate pollen in Linaceae with an exine composed of sporopollenin granules that could be an example of paedomorphosis, and unusual aperture structure in Euphorbia, with similarities to opercula. This pollen diversity may be a consequence of the considerable ecological diversity of Malpighiales and their rapid radiation in the mid-Cretaceous, and it indicates the need for further work on pollen and tapetal characters in this clade. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Ujazdowskie 4, 00-478, Poland","Background and AimsMolecular evidence indicates that the Neotropical sub-tribe Zygopetalinae is sister to Maxillariinae. Most members of the latter sub-tribe have deceit pollination strategies, but some species produce rewards such as nectar, pseudopollen, resin and wax, and are pollinated by a range of pollinators that include stingless bees (Meliponini), wasps and hummingbirds. By contrast, relatively little is known about the pollination of Zygopetalinae species. However, some are pollinated by fragrance-gathering, male euglossine bees or employ nectar deceit strategies. The aim of this study is to describe the labellar micromorphology of Zygopetalinae and to compare it with that of Maxillariinae sensu lato (s.l.) as part of an ongoing project to record the range of labellar characters found within the tribe Maxillarieae, and to assess whether these characters represent synapomorphies or homoplasies resulting from similar pollination pressures.MethodsThe labella of 31 species of Zygopetalinae, including Cryptarrhena R. Br. and representatives of the Zygopetalum, Huntleya and Warrea clades, were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the range of labellar characters was recorded. These characters were subsequently compared with those of Maxillariinae s.l. which formed the subject of our previous investigations.Key Results and ConclusionsThe labellar micromorphology of Zygopetalinae is less diverse than that of Maxillariinae and does not reflect the currently accepted phylogeny of the former sub-tribe based on molecular studies. Instead, the relative uniformity in labellar micromorphology of Zygopetalinae is probably due to homoplasies resulting from similar pollinator pressures. Labellar trichomes are relatively uncommon in Zygopetalinae, but occur in certain members of both the Zygopetalum and Huntleya clades. Trichomes are unbranched, uniseriate and multicellular with rounded apices, or unbranched and unicellular, with tapering, pointed and flexuose apices. Hitherto, unicellular trichomes of this kind have been observed only for euglossophilous orchid taxa, and the adoption of a relatively limited range of pollination strategies by Zygopetalinae may have resulted in reduced investment in micromorphological labellar characters. © The Author 2011.",Cryptarrhena; epidermis; homoplasy; Huntleya clade; labellum; Maxillariinae; papillae; trichomes; Warrea clade; Zygopetalum clade,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053266428

B. umbellata is facultatively self-incompatible, showing higher fruit production through cross-pollinators (46.6%), and B. rotunda is mainly self-compatible, with fruit production in all treatments, even through agamospermy (60%), although higher production was achieved in geitonogamy (90%). We observed 42 and 16 species of bees in B. umbellata and B. rotunda flowers, respectively. Centris aenea and C. (Trachina) sp.n. were considered the main pollinators of B. umbellata flowers and C. aenea of B. rotunda. Both Byrsonima species present important ecological function, representing important resources to several species of bees during flowering season deficit in the studied environment.",Breeding system; Byrsonima rotunda; Byrsonima umbellata; Centridini; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860909829

In particular, robust laboratory methods for assessing adverse effects on honey bee brood are required. In addition, from a statistical point of view, the shared origin of test individuals must be considered when analysing ecotoxicological data. 2.To improve honey bee in vitro rearing, we adopted a nongrafting method to collect honey bee larvae without direct manipulation. Linear mixed effects model to evaluate LD 50, larvae survival and prepupae weights integrated the colony background of larvae as a random factor into the statistical analyses. The novel rearing approach and appropriate statistical tools for data analyses are illustrated in an in vitro case study on acute oral dimethoate toxicity. 3.We recommend our honey bee larvae collection approach for in vitro larvae-rearing applications, because of (i) a mere 3% background mortality upon the prepupae stage, (ii) a high quantitative capacity and (iii) because of robustness of performance which are great benefits for standardization. 4.The analyses indicate clear adverse effects of dimethoate by a significant survival reduction and prepupae weight reduction. For second instars, the acute 48-h LD 50 was 1·67?g dimethoate per larva. 5.We conclude that both our larvae collection method and the applied statistical approaches will help to improve the quality of environmental risk assessment studies on honey bees, to secure honey bee pollination and to sustain biodiversity. © 2011 The Authors.

Such interactions were investigated between a focal species, Pedicularis monbeigiana, and a co-flowering species, Vicia dichroantha, which was mediated by behaviour alteration of the shared bumble-bee pollinator.MethodsFloral display size and floral colour change of P. monbeigiana were compared between pure (P. monbeigiana only) and mixed (P. monbeigiana and V. dichroantha) plots in two populations. Pollinator visitation rates, interspecific floral switching and successive within-plant pollinator visits were recorded. In addition, supplemental pollination at plant level was performed, and the fruit set and seed set were analysed in pure and mixed plots with different densities of P. monbeigiana.Key ResultsPollinator visitation rates were dramatically higher in mixed plots than in pure plots. The higher pollinator visitation rates were recorded in both low- and high-density plots. In particular, successive flower visits within an individual plant were significantly lower in mixed plots. Supplemental pollination significantly increased fruit set and seed set of individuals in pure plots, while it only marginally increased seed set per fruit of plants in mixed plots.ConclusionsThe presence of V. dichroantha can facilitate pollination and increase female reproductive success of P. monbeigiana via both quantity (mitigating pollinator limitation) and quality (reducing geitonogamy) effects. This study suggests that successive pollinator movements among flowers within a plant, as well as pollinator visitation rates and interspecific flower switching, may be important determinants of the direction and mechanisms of interaction between species. © The Author 2011.",Bombus richardsi; bumble-bee; facilitative interaction; Floral traits; foraging behaviour; Orobanchaceae; Pedicularis monbeigiana; pollen limitation; pollination; reproductive success; Vicia dichroantha,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053293057

Variation can be observed among and within plant populations. We investigated the changes in floral phenotype within populations and the probability of plant pollinator visits in relation to small-scale variation in soil moisture and plant cover in a semiarid ecosystem. We measured the variability of floral phenotypes of three wild populations of Madia chilensis along a gradient constituted by three topographic positions (south-facing slope, north-facing slope, and ravine). Changes in soil moisture, plant density, leaf water content, and internode elongation were measured for one population over two study years. Pollinator visit probabilities were also estimated. Floral phenotypes were strongly segregated among topographic positions but less segregated among populations. Plants with the lowest water contents and the smallest or least-conspicuous flower heads grew in the drier north-facing slope, while plants with the highest water contents and showier flower design and display grew in the wetter ravine. Probabilities of pollinator visits were higher on the north-facing slope. Differences in floral phenotypes and probabilities of pollinator visits of M. chilensis were strongly connected to topographic variations at small spatial scale. Topographic heterogeneity at small spatial scale could thus have important consequences for floral trait evolution and pollination ecology. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

By the 1990s, most were buying hybrid seed, though the adoption rates of new seed types were slowing. With the collapse of the Zimbabwean economy many small farmers returned to planting OPVs and saving seed, not only because hybrid seed was unavailable but also as a rational response to economic risks. Initially these risks were tied to Zimbabwe's economic structural adjustment programme, which cut extension services, reduced short-term credit and destabilised maize prices. Subsequently risks increased as land invasions on seed producing farms forced the importation of seeds with which small-scale farmers were unfamiliar, and when escalating inflation precluded the use of money as a store of value.

It has evolved many times in flowering plants and is widespread among distinct Angiosperm families. It is viewed as a reproductive strategy to reduce endogamy, and to promote optimal resource allocation between male and female sexual functions. Neea theifera is a common species in Cerrado, neotropical savannas in Brazil, but information regarding its reproductive biology is still incomplete. In order to investigate how environmental conditions possibly affect this dioecious species, we studied its floral biology, sex ratio and spatial distribution of sexual morphs along a soil-altitudinal gradient. The sex ratio did not significantly deviate from the expected 1:1 ratio. However, flower abundance in the population was significantly biased towards staminate flowers. Female individuals were larger than male individuals and plant size was negatively correlated with altitude, but did not differ between sexual morphs. The population did not show spatial segregation of sexes and male individuals were sexually mature earlier than female ones. Staminate flowers were larger than pistillate flowers and presented high pollen viability. Meliponini bees, small flies and thrips were potential pollinators, but pollination success was very low. Dioecy in N. theifera corroborates many general features of this reproductive strategy, such as woody habit, inconspicuous flowers, pollination by small generalist insects and differential resource allocation between male and female plants. However, reproduction in this species seems to be impaired by pollinator limitation. The results showed that the soil-altitude gradient influenced the growth pattern of the species and may play an important role in its reproductive biology but did not affect dioecy directly.",Altitudinal gradient; Dioecy; Neotropical savanna; Pollination; Sexual structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856606258

To investigate the potential impacts of this trade, we conducted questionnaires in 45 settlements across 12 population centres within Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, a region previously identified as a hunting hotspot. By combining results from 63 hunter and 88 vendor interviews, we highlight two population centres (Palangka Raya and Buntok/Tamiang Layang) with higher hunting rates than other areas, which act as flying fox trading hubs. Flying fox populations were perceived to be declining province-wide: declines in captures and sales were reported by 81% of hunters and 60% of market vendors, who also reported availability as the key factor underlying temporal variations in trade. There was substantial risk of zoonotic disease transmission between bats, hunters and traders: the vast majority of respondents were unaware that flying foxes carry potentially fatal viruses, and so few people protected themselves from physical contact. Moreover, both hunters and vendors were frequently bitten and the majority of bites drew blood. Most hunters (58%) also reported unintentional by-catches that included keystone bird species and slow lorises. The scale of hunting over Central Kalimantan represents a serious threat to the long-term viability of flying fox populations (and potentially those of other species), and could have serious public health implications. Reducing or eliminating hunting and trade would mitigate the risk of disease transmission, while maintaining the economic and ecosystem benefits that flying foxes provide, in terms of pollination and seed dispersal. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Bat; Emerging infectious disease; Henipavirus; Hunting; Pteropus vampyrus; Wildlife trade,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860388884

The increase of a resource (e.g. nitrogen) could trigger an expansion, but in other instances, species have overcome biological limitations (e.g. an Allee effect) like accumulating sufficient genetic diversity for successful reproduction. Understanding the ecological mechanisms governing plant invasions, such as nutrient enrichment or Allee effects, can be used to improve invasive plant management. We used the invasive, introduced grass Phragmites australis as a model to evaluate the role of nutrient enrichment and Allee effects in invasion. Based on recent studies that demonstrated the importance of sexual reproduction in this plant's spread, we chose to focus our efforts on reproductive output. We examined the effects of patch-level genetic diversity on viable seed production across watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay, USA, with differing levels of anthropogenic development (a proxy for nutrient enrichment). In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we treated Phragmites plants originating from forested and developed watersheds with elevated vs. ambient nutrients and cross vs. self-pollination and determined the effects on viable seed, floret and inflorescence production. The proportion of viable seeds produced at field sites varied widely and was not directly related to watershed development. Instead, seed viability was positively related to patch-level genetic diversity, and patches in more developed watersheds had higher genetic diversity. Also, plants in larger patches produced a higher proportion of viable seeds. In the mesocosm experiment, seed viability was substantially higher for out-crossed plants. Elevated nutrients resulted in greater floret and inflorescence production, particularly for plants originating from developed vs. forested watersheds. These findings have important management implications: small populations should be controlled before they accumulate sufficient genetic variation for prolific viable seed production, and landscape-scale nutrient management could further limit reproductive output. Synthesis and applications. Our research shows how nutrient enrichment and a weak Allee effect can interact across multiple scales to impact invasion success and how understanding the ecological mechanisms governing plant invasions can be used to better inform invasive plant management. © 2011 The Authors.

However, little is known about the hybridization and introgression among Cypripedium species. To investigate the evidence for hybridization and the pattern of introgression between Cypripedium yunnanense and C. tibeticum in Shangrila County, Yunnan Province, China, morphological characters and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data for both the species and their putative hybrids were studied. Hand pollination was also performed to verify the crossability of the putative parents. Principal coordinate analysis based on morphological characters and the AFLP data suggested that the putative hybrids were true hybrids of these two Cypripedium species. Analysis with the NewHybrids software indicated that the putative hybrids were F1 generation individuals and backcrosses to C. yunnanese, but no F2 generation was found. Analysis with the Structure software demonstrated asymmetric introgression from C. tibeticum to C. yunnanense.

Negative effects on the biota are numerous, ranging from interruption of gene flow among populations, to the loss of genetic diversity within populations, to a decline in species richness over time. Orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) are of major conservation interest due to their function as pollinators of numerous orchid species and other tropical plants. Here, we used microsatellite markers to investigate the effects of geographic distance and habitat fragmentation on gene flow among populations. Populations of Euglossa dilemma in three geographic regions-the Yucatán peninsula (Mexico), Veracruz (Mexico), and Florida (USA)-were genetically structured predominantly across the regions, with the strength of differentiation among populations being positively correlated with geographic distance. Within geographic regions only little substructure was found, suggesting that dispersal is substantial in the absence of geographic or ecological barriers. In a second study, patterns of genetic differentiation among eight species of Euglossa were not related to habitat fragmentation following deforestation in southern Mexico (Veracruz). Specifically, most bee populations in the 9,800 ha forest remnant of Los Tuxtlas (Volcano San Martin) were neither differentiated from, nor had less genetic diversity than, populations in near-continuous forest separated from Los Tuxtlas by 130 km of agricultural land. Either occasional long distance dispersal across open areas has buffered the expected genetic effects of fragmentation, or the history of fragmentation in southern Mexico is too recent to have caused measurable shifts in allelic composition. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Euglossa dilemma; Euglossa viridissima; Forest fragmentation; Gene flow; Long-distance dispersal; Pollinator decline,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052448792

Banners, levers, platforms, and pumps have evolved that attract pollinators and then manipulate their movement. Given this three-dimensional floral complexity, the taxonomy of Vigna and relatives has been confounded by the study of mostly two-dimensional museum specimens. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was undertaken in the effort to resolve long-standing taxonomic questions centered on floral morphology. Methods: The phylogenetic analysis included cpDNA trnK and nuclear ribosomal ITS/5.8S (ITS) sequence variation. The American species were comprehensively sampled and outgroups included Old World relatives. Key results: The trnK and ITS data analyses concurred in resolving six well-supported clades of American Vigna that are most closely related to other American genera: Dolichopsis, Macroptilium, Mysanthus, Oryxis, Oxyrhynchus, Phaseolus, Ramirezella, and Strophostyles. These 14 American clades ranked here as genera are resolved as sister to a clade comprising the mainly Old World species of Vigna. Conclusions: American Vigna clades were reassigned to the genera Ancistrotropis, Cochliasanthus, Condylostylis, Leptospron, Sigmoidotropis, and the newly described Helicotropis. Vigna sensu stricto in the Americas now includes relatively few and mostly pantropical species. Elaborate floral asymmetries are readily used to apomorphically diagnose nearly all of the American genera. The age estimates of the extant diversification of the American and its Old World sister clade are approximately coeval at ca. 6 - 7 million yr, which belies much greater floral variation in the Americas. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Biogeography; Floral evolution; Geographic phylogenetic structure; Phaseolus; Phylogenetic systematics; Rates analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858424372

We challenge this view with experimental data from Comastoma pulmonarium, a selfing annual experiencing a high ratio of nectar robbing in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. • We manipulated robbing (robbed or netted) and pollination mode (hand-selfed or hand-outcrossed) in a factorial design and measured the number of developing ovules and mature seeds, together with seed weight and seed germination, in each treatment. • Robbing decreased the number of mature seeds, but not the number of developing ovules, suggesting a negative influence of robbers through indirect effects via selective seed abortion. We found no evidence for early-acting inbreeding depression, but found later-acting inbreeding depression. Our data also suggested that later-acting inbreeding depression of progeny from robbed flowers could be reduced in comparison with that from unrobbed flowers. • We suggest that nectar robbing can have both negative and positive effects on the quantity and quality, respectively, of progeny produced in selfing plants, and challenge the view that robbing has no effect on selfing species. © 2011 New Phytologist Trust.",Comastoma pulmonarium (Gentianaceae); Nectar robbing; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; Resource limitation; The inbreeding depression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052386465

Pollinator shifts may drive speciation in Ophrys, since novel pollinators may in principle act as isolating factors immediately. It is thus possible that evolution of novel species occurs rapidly and with a progenitorderivative pattern. The aims of this study are to compare genetic structure and diversity among widespread and geographically restricted Ophrys taxa, to test whether genetic structure is associated with specific pollinators, and to investigate whether any widespread species may have acted as a progenitor for the evolution of more restricted taxa.MethodsGenetic differentiation and diversity were investigated in O. leucadica and O. cinereophila, the two taxa of the Ophrys fusca sensu lato complex widespread in the Aegean, and three geographically restricted taxa from Rhodes, O. attaviria, O. parvula and O. persephonae, all differing in their specific pollinators. This was done using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) DNA fingerprinting, and sequencing of the low-copy nuclear gene LEAFY (LFY).Key ResultsAll taxa were found to be separate genetic entities, with O. leucadica forming two geographic groups from the west and east of the Aegean. Genetic structure was significantly shaped by pollinators and geography, and comparison of sequence and AFLP data revealed ancestral polymorphisms shared among several taxa. Among the sampled taxa, O. leucadica harbours the greatest genetic differentiation and geographic structure, and the highest genetic diversity. Part of the genome of O. parvula, endemic to Rhodes, may be derived from O. leucadica.ConclusionsPollinators probably influence the genetic structure of the investigated Ophrys species. The genetic pattern identified is consistent with O. leucadica being the oldest of the sampled taxa, making O. leucadica a candidate progenitor species from which more restricted taxa such as O. parvula may have evolved. © The Author 2011.",AFLP; genetic diversity; genetic structure; low-copy nuclear genes; Ophrys; pollination; progenitorderivative speciation; sexually deceptive orchids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053251284

In addition, interactions with pollen vectors were expected to explain the structural complexity of the architecture of these flowers since operative flower strength may be determined by a combination of morphological traits which form part of an intrafloral functional module.MethodsSix papilionate species were studied: Collaea argentina, Desmodium uncinatum, Galactia latisiliqua, Lathyrus odoratus, Spartium junceum and Tipuana tipu. Measurements were made of the strength needed to open keels and the strength that pollinators were capable of exerting. Morphological traits of all petals were also measured to determine which of them could be either mutually correlated or correlated with operative strength and moment of strength and participated in a functional module.Key ResultsIt was observed that pollinators were capable in all cases of exerting forces higher and often several times higher than that needed to access floral rewards, and no association could be detected between floral operative strength and strength exerted by the corresponding pollinators. On the other hand, strong and significant correlations were found among morphometric traits and, of these, with operative strength and moment. This was particularly evident among traits of the keel and the wings, presumably involved in the functioning of the floral moveable mechanism.ConclusionsThough visitors are often many times stronger than the operative strength of the flowers they pollinate, exceptionally weak bees such as Apis mellifera cannot open the strongest flowers. On the other hand, strong correlations among certain petal morphometric traits (particularly between the keel and wings) give support to the idea that an intrafloral module is associated with the functioning of the mechanism of these legume flowers. In addition, the highly significant correlations found across petals support the view of functional phenotypic integration transcending the ontogenetic organization of flower structure. © The Author 2011.",bee; biomechanic; Fabaceae; filtering mechanism; floral phenotypic integration; functional module; legume; papilionate flowers; pollination; strength,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053227330

The likelihood of detecting costs should depend on the range of variation in reproductive effort that can be induced, and also on the shape of the cost function across this range, which should be affected by resource availability. Here, we experimentally examined the effects of both reduced and increased fruit production in two populations of the long-lived orchid Gymnadenia conopsea located at sites that differ in length of the growing season. Plants that were prevented from fruiting produced more flowers in the population with a longer growing season, had higher survival in the other population, and grew larger compared to control plants in both populations. Fruit production was pollen-limited in both populations, and increased reproductive investment after supplemental hand-pollination was associated with reduced fecundity the following year. The results demonstrate that the shape of the cost function varies among fitness components, and that costs can be differentially expressed in different populations. They are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in temporal overlap between allocation to reproduction and other functions will induce among-population variation in reproductive costs. © 2011 The Author(s).",Fitness components; Hand-pollination; Life-history evolution; Reproductive allocation; Trade-off,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052681736

The benefits of this approach are expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental differences in their ecology. We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50×50m), sown with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives) and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins. The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field margins in 3years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing treatment on either species group were detected. Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage. Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to be in place for several years. © 2011 The Authors.

Approximately half of all fig species are monoecious and produce a mixture of wasps and seeds within the same fig. In functionally dioecious fig trees male and female functions are separate. Figs on male trees produce wasps and pollen, whereas figs borne on female plants produce only seeds. Dioecious fig phenology provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the effect of sexual specialization on the obligate fig-fig wasp interaction and the non-pollinators associated with the system. Here we describe laboratory studies of phenological variation between two sexes in terms of vegetative growth and fig production in a dioecious fig tree Ficus montana.

Intrasexual asynchrony was observed for the plants, with synchrony between the sexes with year-round production of figs. Male plants grew more rapidly, but leaf phenology was very similar.

Their effects on one another can be competitive, neutral, or facilitative. We manipulated the floral neighborhood of the high-alpine cushion plant Eritrichium nanum in the Swiss Alps and measured the effects of co-flowering neighbors on both the number of seeds produced and the degree of inbreeding and outbreeding in the offspring, as deduced from nuclear microsatellite markers. Seed set of E. nanum did not vary significantly with the presence or absence of two Saxifraga species growing as near neighbors, but it was higher in E. nanum cushions growing at low conspecific density than in those growing at high density. In addition, floral neighborhood had no detectable effect on the degree of selfing of E. nanum, but seeds from cushions growing at low conspecific density were more highly outbred than seeds from cushions at high density. Thus, there was no evidence of either competition or facilitation between E. nanum and Saxifraga spp. as mediated by pollinators at the spatial scale of our experimental manipulation. In contrast, the greater fecundity of E. nanum cushions at low density was consistent with reduced intraspecific competition for pollinators and might also represent a beneficial effect of highly outbred seeds as brought about by more long-distance pollinator flights under low-density conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Competition; Facilitation; Genetic paternity analysis; Inbreeding; Outbreeding; Realized mating; Scale effects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052676596

This is particularly evident among the flowering plants where form and diversity of flowers attest to the importance of both pollinator-mediated selection and phylogenetic constraint. Although this has been studied mostly using visible floral characters, invisible volatile chemicals emitted by the flowers should be subject to these same evolutionary forces. Unfortunately, most analyses of floral volatiles have over-emphasized the importance of natural selection and underplayed phylogenetic constraint without quantifying their respective roles in the evolution and composition of floral scents. Methods: We used multivariate analyses to test the relative importance of pollinators vs. phylogeny in determining the composition of floral scents among oil-secreting orchids in southern Africa. Floral scents of 42 oil-secreting taxa/ecotypes distributed among 12 subclades in the tribe Diseae were sampled using headspace adsorption and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Key results: We identified 257 scent compounds distributed over nine different compound classes, with the majority of scents dominated by aliphatic or benzenoid compounds. The only significant predictor of floral scent among these orchids above the species level was phylogeny. Nevertheless, in two of the clades there were differences in scent profiles at the species and ecotype level that corresponded to different pollinators and were thus suggestive of pollinator-mediated selection. Conclusions: Scent variation was greater than expected and phylogeny was more important than pollinator-mediated selection in predicting the composition of floral scents of oil-secreting orchids, despite the specialized nature of the pollinator reward system. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Coryciinae; Floral scents; Oil-collecting bees; Oil-secreting flowers; Orchids; Phylogeny; Pollination; Rediviva,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858407597

The impact of treatments on natural enemies as well as pollinators was also assessed. Integration of phytosanitation, mechanical control and prophylactic application of neem seed kernel extract (NSKE) exerted a satisfactory impact on the incidence and damage of L. orbonalis.

A ready-mix formulation (triazophos 40% + cypermethrin 4%), and carbofuran also offered good protection against the borer but both were found highly toxic and unsafe for predators i.e. predatory coccinellids and spiders and pollinating bees. Flubendiamide and rynaxypyr appeared comparatively more unsafe for bees than emamectin benzoate, while both allowed a substantial proportion of coccinellids and spiders to survive.

It has a number of elite genes for rice breeding in resistance or tolerance. However, breeding barriers are so serious that the gene transfer is much difficult by sexual cross method between O. sativa and O. officinalis. Characteristics of the breeding barriers were systemically studied in this paper. When both the diploid (AA, 2n=2x=24) and autotetraploid (AAAA, 2n=4x=48) cultivated rice were crossed as maternal parents with O. officinalis (CC, 2n=2x=24), none Fj hybrid seeds were obtained. The young hybrid ovaries aborted at 13-16 d after pollinations (DAP). By rescuing hybrid embryos, in vitro Fj plantlets were obtained in 2x×2x combinations with the crossabilities lower than 0.5%. Lower rates of double-fertilization and abnormal development of hybrid embryo and endosperm were mainly observed in both combinations of 2x×2x and 4x×2x. Free endosperm nuclei in hybrid degenerated early at 1 DAP in a large scale. Almost no normal endosperm cells formed at 3 DAP. Development of a lot of embryos ceased at globular- or pear-shaped stage as well as some degenerated gradually. The hybrid plantlets were both male and female sterility. Due to the abnormal development, a diversity of abnormal embryo sacs formed in hybrids, and hybrid pollen grains were typically abortive. It showed that conflicts of genome A and C in hybrid induced abnormal meioses of meiocytes. © 2011 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",Breeding barriers; Crossability; Hybrid sterility; Interspecific hybridization; Oryza officinalis; Oryza sativa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054950745

Considering the value of this crop, the development and documentation of infertile clones would be desirable. Triploid plants were evaluated for male and female fertility using pollen viability staining and seed set and germination, respectively. Pollen viability staining, seed set, and seed germination from triploid plants were reduced compared with diploids but varied considerably within each cytotype. Overall, relative female fertility of individual triploids clones [(% seed set · % germination for triploid)/(% seed set · % germination for diploid control)] was reduced substantially and ranged from 49% to 0.7%. Additionally, the reproductive pathways of triploid plants were examined by evaluating the 2C genome sizes of progeny derived from open pollination. The limited progeny arising from open-pollinated triploids were predominantly aneuploids with 2C genome sizes intermediate between diploids and triploids. There was no clear evidence of apomixis, selfing, or triploid · triploid fertilization events observed among triploid parents. Formation of unreduced gametes was rare for both ploidy levels ('1%).

The defect in floral abscission was found to be due to a deficiency in the timing of cell separation of the abscission zone cells. Down-regulation of INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION (IDA) may contribute to the delay of the floral abscission in 35S:FYF flowers. FYF was found to be highly expressed in young flowers prior to pollination and was significantly decreased after pollination, a pattern that correlated with its function. Ethylene insensitivity in senescence/abscission and the down-regulation of ETHYLENE RESPONSE DNA-BINDING FACTOR 1 (EDF1) and EDF2, downstream genes in the ethylene response, in 35S:FYF Arabidopsis suggested a role for FYF in regulating senescence/abscission by suppressing the ethylene response. This role was further supported by the fact that 35S:FYF enhanced the delay of flower senescence/abscission in ethylene response 1 (etr1), ethylene-insensitive 2 (ein2) and constitutive triple response 1 (ctr1) mutants, which have defects in upstream genes of the ethylene signaling pathway. The presence of a repressor domain in the C-terminus of FYF and the enhancement of the delay of senescence/abscission in FYF+SRDX (containing a suppression motif) transgenic plants suggested that FYF acts as a repressor. Indeed, in FYF-DR+VP16 transgenic dominant-negative mutant plants, in which FYF was converted to a potent activator by fusion to a VP16-AD motif, the senescence/abscission of the flower organs was significantly promoted, and the expression of BOP2, IDA and EDF1/2 was up-regulated.

However, breeding system studies have been performed in fewer than 7% of species, and other types of breeding systems (e.g., self-compatibility and apomixis) have been reported in this family. In the present study, the reproductive biology of C. antisyphilitica was investigated by field observation of flower visitors and floral events. Moreover, reproductive biology of this species was examined through experimental pollinations, analyses of pollen tube growth and ovule penetration using fluorescence microscopy, verification of pistil longevity, and a histological analysis of unpollinated vs. self-pollinated pistils. Finally, morphological aspects, quantities and germination were investigated in seeds that resulted from different pollination treatments. Natural pollination was effected by large- and medium-sized bees, and their visiting behaviour favours a high proportion of geitonogamy and no pollen limitation. Self-pollinated flowers produced no fruits, and all of the characteristic post-pollination events cited above were verified, witnessing the occurrence of LSI with post-zygotic rejection of selfed pistils in C. antisyphilitica. Although some indications of extended pistil longevity were found in selfed pistils, this feature seemed to be affected by unidentified environmental factors. The seeds were always monoembryonic and with high viability. A larger variation in the number of viable seeds was found in fruits derived from natural pollination. A low fruit set was observed after both natural and cross-pollination, and most crossed fruits underwent abortion at several points during the juvenile phase, even when protected against herbivory. The formation of surplus flowers/juvenile fruits and the apparently wasteful selfing mechanism control implied in LSI are discussed in the context of the perennial life style of tropical woody plant species. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Breeding system; Floral biology; Late-acting self-incompatibility; Low fruit set; Pistil longevity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053450994

These relationships are commonly explained as a consequence of sex allocation on the basis of a simple model proposed by Charnov. Indeed, the theoretical expectation from the model has been the basis for interest in the empirical pattern. However, the predicted relationship is a necessary consequence of the mathematics of the model, which therefore has little explanatory power, even though its predictions are consistent with empirical results. The evolution of pollen-ovule ratios is likely to depend on selective factors affecting mating system, pollen presentation and dispensing, patterns of pollen receipt, pollen tube competition, female mate choice through embryo abortion, as well as genetic covariances among pollen, ovule, and seed size and other reproductive traits. To the extent the empirical correlations involving pollen-ovule ratios are interesting, they will need explanation in terms of a suite of selective factors. They are not explained simply by sex allocation trade-offs. © 2011 The Author(s).

Unit of Lecce, Via Monteroni, 73100 Lecce, Italy","A novel strategy to induce parthenocarpy in tomato fruits by the induction of resveratrol biosynthesis in flower tissues was exploited. Two transgenic tomato lines were considered: a higher resveratrol-producing (35SS) line, constitutively expressing a grape stilbene synthase cDNA, and a lower resveratrol-producing (LoxS) line, expressing stilbene synthase under a fruit-specific promoter. The expression of the stilbene synthase gene affected flavonoid metabolism in a different manner in the transgenic lines, and in one of these, the 35SS line, resulted in complete male sterility. Resveratrol was synthesised either in 35SS or LoxS tomato flowers, at an even higher extent (about 8-10 times) in the former line. We further investigated whether stilbene synthase expression may have resulted in impaired naringenin accumulation during flower development. In the 35SS flowers, naringenin was significantly impaired by about 50%, probably due to metabolic competition. Conversely, the amount of glycosylated flavonols increased in transgenic flowers, thereby excluding the diminished production of flavonols as a reason for parthenocarpy in tomato. We further investigated whether resveratrol synthesis may have resulted changes to pollen structure. Microscopic observations revealed the presence of few and abnormal flake-like pollen grains in 35SS flowers with no germination capability. Finally, the analysis of coumaric and ferulic acids, the precursors of lignin and sporopollenin biosynthesis, revealed significant depletion of these compounds, therefore suggesting an impairment in structural compounds as a reason for pollen ablation. These overall outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, reveal for the first time the major role displayed by resveratrol synthesis on parthenocarpy in tomato fruits. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Flavonoids; Parthenocarpy; Solanum lycopersicum; Stilbene synthase; Trans-resveratrol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053212157

Fifteen fruit quality traits including fruit size and shape, skin colour, russet and sensory eating characteristics were evaluated for individual seedlings. Estimates of genetic variance-covariance matrices (G) were obtained and compared between the two treatments (OR versus VP) using Mantel's test and regression approaches. Empirical estimates of correlations, at the individual-tree and family-mean levels, between the two treatments were compared with those obtained from deterministic simulations. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability (h2) were higher in the VP population than in the OR population for 11 of the 15 traits. The estimated G matrices were significantly different between the two treatments. Simulation study showed that with an increase in the total genetic variance, the correspondence between the two treatments at the family-mean level improved dramatically for different family sizes. As the ratio of dominance/additive variance increased from 0 to 1, the family-mean correlations between the two treatments decreased for all family sizes. The average estimated correlations between the two treatments at the family-mean level were higher than at the individual-tree level (0.78 and 0.42, respectively). These observed correlations were very similar to our theoretical expectations. In the light of these results, caution is required when comparing apple seedlings tested on their own roots with those tested on 'M. 9' rootstock, as potential cultivar breeding parents. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding values; Fruit quality; Genetic parameters; Malus x domestica (Borkh.); Own-rooted seedlings; Propagules,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052759315

Legr. (Myrtaceae), known as guabiju, are widely consumed fresh as well as dried, processed into jam, marmalade, and juices. In this study, chemical composition and antichemotactic and antioxidant activities of fruits from a wild type (GB) and 2 genotypes, PL2 and PL1, of guabiju were investigated. Total anthocyanins for the genotypes ranged from 334 to 531 mg/100 g dry weight (dwt). Total flavonoids and polyphenols ranged from 79.8 to 154 mg/100 g and 2438 to 4613 mg/100 g (dwt), respectively. A reversed phase liquid chromatography method with photodiode array detection was used to determine chemical profiles of the main anthocyanins found in the extracts. An HPLC method for the quantification of flavonoids is proposed, providing a simple procedure with rapid sample preparation. All samples contained 5 identical anthocyanidins, distributed differently, with cyanidin as the main compound. Identified flavonoids were quercitrin, hyperoside, and isoquercitrin; their relative amounts varied among the extracts. The antioxidant activity of guabiju methanolic extract was comparable to that of Trolox, and at a test concentration of 0.25 mg/mL, GB and PL2 activities were higher than those exhibited by Trolox. Total dry extracts of guabiju exhibited greater inhibition of chemotaxis at a concentration of 4 ?g/mL, except for GBH (wild-type hydrolyzed extract) which already presented high values at a concentration of 2 ?g/mL. These results suggest that the consumption of this fruit, rich in polyphenols, may be beneficial to human health. Practical Application: The paper is the first attempt on the improvement of this native fruit, since it is widely consumed regularly as part of the South American diet. The content of phenolic compounds demonstrates that consumption of guabiju would be beneficial to human health. Differences among samples, originating from open pollination of plants growing on the same site, lead to the conclusion that improvements can be made in the chemical composition and beneficial activity of guabiju fruits by simply selecting genotypes for these characteristics among open-pollinated seedlings. © 2011 Institute of Food Technologists ®.",Antichemotaxis; Antioxidant; Flavonoids; HPLC; Myrcianthes pungens,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054767685

This traditional classification was very effective during a long period of time. Based on more update knowledge of the origin centers of the different species, the technological advances in the fruit crops and, in the fruit conservation and specially the genetic breeding created exceptional for the cropping of tropical species and temperate in subtropical climate. In this research were select the atemoya, persimmon, fig tree and guava crop based not only in the national and regional importance but also in the different contributions that the scientific research offered to the fruit plants. Atemoya - within the fruit species exploited in a large scale may be the more recent introduction in cropping in Brazil, initiated in the 1980 decade. Several techniques of cropping were developed such as root stocks more adequate for each region, pruning, artificial pollination, pest management and disease control and several others technologies that permitted a fast expansion of the fruit crops in several country regions. Although the remarkable contribution of the Universities, Research Institutes and Extension Agencies, was fundamental the pioneer contribution of the producers to solve the problems of the crops indicating the necessity for more research in this crop fruit. Persimmon - the Brazilian production of persimmon (IBGE - 2009) was 171,555 tons was obtained in a area of 8,770 ha and represented a value of 146,67 real millions. The major production states in Brazil were São Paulo (111,646 tons) Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná and Rio de Janeiro. The main cultivars in production are: 'Rama Forte', 'Giombo' and 'Fuyu' which are found in the internal market. Fig tree - the Brazilian production of fig at 2009 according to IBGE - IBRAF were 24,146 tons being the major production states in Brazil the Rio Grande do Sul and São Paulo. At São Paulo the fig production is concentrate in the Campinas region, being a production of 9,469 tons in 2010 (IEA).

E 19°17?). The nearest known populations of this Mediterranean plant inhabit the Adriatic coast (ca. 450 km away) in Croatia, therefore this new occurrence represents a significant long distance dispersal event. The circumstances of the occurrence argue against introduction, but we can not decide now whether this new appearance is temporary or permanent. The permanent establishment of this strictly entomophilous plant requires the presence of its specific pollinator in the close neighbourhood of the habitat. However, no pollination was observed on the three flowers of the plant until 9 th May, and one day later the stem had disappeared most likely due to grazing. Whatever the long-term fate of the plant is, this discovery represents a significant long distance (jump) dispersal event, and testifies to the dispersal ability of Ophrys species. Additionally, the appearance of a mature Adriatic plant in Central Europe fits well into the currently observed, climate change driven northward expansion of European orchids, therefore this finding most likely reflects a growing Mediterranean-like climatic influence in the region. © 2011 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.",climate change; Hungary; long distance dispersal; Ophrys establishment; Orchidaceae; seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961157506

In plants, the subdivision of male function via the gradual presentation of pollen might minimize these constraints by preventing the saturation of receptive stigmas. Here, we report on an investigation of (1) patterns of investment in male function by plants in hermaphroditic (monoecious) and dioecious populations of Sagittaria latifolia, and (2) patterns of siring success by males versus hermaphrodites in experimental mating arrays. We show that in natural populations, males from dioecious populations had greater investment in male function than hermaphrodites in monoecious populations. However, as a proportion of total flower production, males presented substantially fewer flowers at once than hermaphrodites. In comparison with hermaphrodites, therefore, males prolonged the period over which they presented pollen. In mating arrays comprised of females, males, and hermaphrodites, siring success by males increased linearly with flower production. This finding is consistent with the existence of a linear gain curve for male function in S. latifolia and supports the idea that the gradual deployment of male function enables plants to avoid diminishing returns on the investment in male function. © 2011 The Author(s).

We show here that the genome of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) contains 44 terpene synthase (TPS) genes, including 29 that are functional or potentially functional. Of these 29 TPS genes, 26 were expressed in at least some organs or tissues of the plant. The enzymatic functions of eight of the TPS proteins were previously reported, and here we report the specific in vitro catalytic activity of 10 additional tomato terpene synthases. Many of the tomato TPS genes are found in clusters, notably on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10. All TPS family clades previously identified in angiosperms are also present in tomato. The largest clade of functional TPS genes found in tomato, with 12 members, is the TPS-a clade, and it appears to encode only sesquiterpene synthases, one of which is localized to the mitochondria, while the rest are likely cytosolic. A few additional sesquiterpene synthases are encoded by TPS-b clade genes. Some of the tomato sesquiterpene synthases use z,z-farnesyl diphosphate in vitro as well, or more efficiently than, the e,e- farnesyl diphosphate substrate. Genes encoding monoterpene synthases are also prevalent, and they fall into three clades: TPS-b, TPS-g, and TPS-e/f. With the exception of two enzymes involved in the synthesis of ent-kaurene, the precursor of gibberellins, no other tomato TPS genes could be demonstrated to encode diterpene synthases so far. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

To explore whether floral volatiles, morphological characters of flower and seed and breeding system are correlated with their distributions, we measured length and width of corolla, trichome density at corolla throat, level of stigma/anthers relationship, seed size and weight. The results indicated that these characteristics were significantly different between the two species (P<. 0.01). Bagging experiments revealed that B. davidii is a self-incompatible plant while B. yunnanensis is self-compatible. Thick trichome density at the corolla throat may reduce out-crossing in B. yunnanensis. Autogamy plays an important role in fruit production of this species while B. davidii requires pollinators for fruiting. Scents were collected using dynamic headspace adsorption method and identified with coupled gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. In total, 27 floral scent compounds were identified. The volatile composition in the two species was very different.

However, some genes involved in rose floral scent metabolism are less well understood. Here, wild-type scented rose (WR) and its spontaneous non-scented mutant rose (MR) were analyzed. SPME-GC/MS analysis showed that relative content of 1-ethenyl-4-methoxy-benzene represented was significantly different between WR and MR. We have isolated an EST encoding a MYB family of transcription factor from SSH libraries of the two roses in the previous studies, and designated RhMYB1. In the study, the full-length cDNA of RhMYB1 was identified and characterized by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The RhMYB1 full-length cDNA was 1,125 bp containing an 882 bp open reading frame, which encodes a precursor protein of 294 amino acids. Sequence alignments revealed that RhMYB1 shared high similarity with other plants R-type MYB, and RhMYB1 contained a DNA binding domain. Northern blot analysis revealed that RhMYB1 was expressed specifically in flower petal, moreover, the expression level of RhMYB1 in WR increased along with scent emission, and decreased when the scent emission decreased. It is suggested that RhMYB1 might be a putative identification of gene involved in the biosynthesis of rose scent. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",1-ethenyl-4-methoxy-benzene; RhMYB1; Rose; Scent-related gene; SPME-GC/MS,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052437718

In the studied progeny test, high rates of inconsistency were found between the observed and expected genotypes. The average rates of pollen contamination from outside the orchard and self-fertilization were 58.47% and 0.65%, respectively. We divided the individuals of the studied progeny test into two groups based on their genotype data, for which: (1) both parents were elite trees and (2) only the mother trees were elite trees, and then compared them with respect to the growth performance and morphological traits of progenies using data at 20 and 30 years old. Significant adverse effects of contaminating pollen were detected in relation to straightness, but not tree height and DBH. The results suggest that the genetic gains for straightness generally show higher narrow-sense heritability than growth traits, which should be increased by reduction of pollen contamination. Breeding with paternal analysis (BWPA) is an effective approach for evaluating breeding materials based on maternal and paternal information revealed by DNA markers. The use of BWPA in progeny test allows effective forward- and backward selection without laborious and time-consuming tasks. In this study, we also suggest that the significant pollen contamination and paternal deviation found in the open-pollinated progeny test are serious impediments for BWPA. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",BWB; Conifer; GCA; Genetic gain; Selection; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052710703

The fate of glyphosate resistance in a giant ragweed population is dependent on the fitness of the resistant biotype. Our objective was to determine the fitness of glyphosate-resistant giant ragweed in the absence and presence of glyphosate. We compared the growth and seed production of glyphosate-resistant (GR) and glyphosate-susceptible (GS) giant ragweed under field conditions in the absence of glyphosate. A greenhouse study was also conducted to determine the survival of GR and GS giant ragweed and their open-pollinated progeny from the field study under glyphosate-induced selection pressure. In the absence of glyphosate, GR giant ragweed displayed rapid, early season growth, but 50 d after planting, the biotypes were similar in height, shoot weight, and leaf area. During reproduction, the GR biotype flowered earlier and produced 25% less seed than the GS biotype. In the presence of glyphosate, an outcrossing rate of 31% was detected between GR and GS biotypes because 61% of progeny were resistant to glyphosate at 840 g ae ha -1. A second application 14 d later at 2,520 g ae ha -1 completely removed the GS alleles from the population, whereas several homozygous and heterozygous GR plants survived and produced seed. These results indicate GR will persist in the population when subjected to glyphosate and that glyphosate resistance in giant ragweed has the potential to spread rapidly in our current agricultural ecosystem.

This 3-yr study examined nitrogen fertilization management effects on corn (Zea mays L.) plant characteristics and grain yield in rain fed environment under conventional tillage system. Nitrogen fertilization management consisted of two timing methods of N application [all N at planting and as split with 35 kg N ha-1 applied at planting and remaining N applied at vegetative (V) 6 growth stage] and five N rates (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg N ha-1). Insufficient rainfall at reproductive stage in 2008 and 2009 likely resulted in significant reduction of grain yield compared with grain yield in 2007, average 2.9 vs. 5.9 Mg ha-1. Grain yield increased with N application up to 45 kg ha-1; however, no further increase in N application resulted in increased yields. Plant height, ear height, relative chlorophyll (SPAD) content, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at reproductive (R1) stage increased with increasing N rate up to 90, 90, 135, and 90 kg N ha-1, respectively. Corn grain yield significantly correlated with plant height at R1, SPAD at V8, NDVI and LAI at V8 and R1 stage. The combination of plant height, NDVI, and LAI of R1 stage explained most of the variability of grain yield (r-square = 0.71). The fertilization timing had no effect on corn grain yield and plant characteristics. These observations showed that applying more than 45 kg N ha-1 to corn under dryland conditions with insufficient rainfall, especially during corn pollination, may not significantly increase grain yields.",Corn grain yield; Correlation; N fertilizer; Plant characteristics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84055176782

However, the pollination biology and taxonomic understanding of Allium is far from complete, in part because floral structures have been investigated in detail for only a few species. Accordingly, this study provides a description and micro- and macromophological comparative analysis of floral characteristics (including the adjacent bulbils of A. geyeri var. tenerum) of four New World Allium species (A. cernuum, A. geyeri var. tenerum, A. stellatum, and A. textile). Observations of fresh material demonstrated that A. geyeri var. tenerum is distinguished from the closely related A. textile by a larger perianth with elliptical tepals (as opposed to ovate to oblong), filaments slightly shorter than tepals (as opposed to 2/3 as long as tepals), and globose young inflorescences (as opposed to ellipsoid). Ridged cuticles from a variety of floral parts have often been reported in Allium as the main type of epidermal cell covering; results from this study indicate that shape and distribution of cuticles are of systematic significance in conjunction with location of the septal nectary opening, development of ovarian processes, and shape of anther apexes. The presence of ovarian processes is considered a recently derived character; we hypothesize that these structures function as non-secretory visual attractants to pollinators, and in concert with broader inner filaments and clearly concave inner tepals may also represent a special adaptation to facilitate retention of abundant nectar secreted in nodding flowers of A. cernuum and in widely spreading flowers of A. stellatum. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.",Cell pattern; cuticle ornamentation; ovarian process; SEM; septal nectary opening,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855218960

A machine vision system was developed to monitor the fluorescence in order to detect the immature chicory seeds. It comprised a monochromatic light source, a highpass filter and a monochromatic CCD camera sensitive to red and infrared. With this device, blue light reflected by the seeds was blocked whilst red fluorescence was measured by the camera. A segmentation algorithm was designed to estimate separately the fluorescence intensities of the pappus, a crown of scales, and the main body of the pericarp. Experiments were carried out on five clones of cross-pollinated chicory plants used for seed production. Two hundred flower heads were labelled at flowering and harvested at different times during the maturation process expressed in "" days after flowering"" (DAF). Germination tests were performed according to the recommendations of the International Seed Testing Association to measure the germination percentage (GP) and the germination rate (GR), an indicator of seed vigour. Seed chlorophyll content diminished during maturation following a different logistic trend for the pappus and the pericarp. The GP increased from 18 DAF to reach its maximum value at 21 DAF, but the GR remained low until 30 DAF and increased afterwards.

These secondary metabolites provide disease and stress resistance, help in pollination to the plants. The secondary metabolites are primarily used by medical sciences to control various diseases and ailments. Catharanthus roseus commonly called Sadabahar in India, belongs to the family apocynaceae, is an ornamental plant commonly seen growing in gardens. Catharanthus roseus or Vinca rosea contains some very useful secondary metabolites falling under the category of alkaloids. V. rosea contain three such important alkaloids viz., Vincristine, Vinblastine and Vindiscline which are used in the treatment of cancer. These alkaloids interfere with the mitotic cell division process of the cancerous cells. They stop formation of microtubules and thus chromosomes are unable to arrange on metaphase plate. Various explants from the plants were in vitro cultured to find out best hormonal combinations to produce good amount of callus. This callus can be used to extract the anticancerous metabolites which are otherwise largely extracted from the field grown plants. Naturally grown plants of Vinca rosea contain very low concentrations of the alkaloids. Present work suggests a quick protocol for good amount of callus production form Vinca rosea nodal explants. Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium supplemented with Kinetin and BAP each with 1.0mg/l and 2, 4-D, IAA each 1mg/l combinations showed good callus production.

However, their digestive capability to assimilate sugars can limit their total energy intake, particularly when sugar concentration in nectar is low. Our experimental study evaluated the effect that changes in sugar concentration of nectar have on the foraging behavior of the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae in captivity. We measured foraging behavior and food intake when bats fed at different concentrations of sucrose (5, 15, 25 and 35%. wt/vol.). To compensate for low-energy intake, both bat species reduced their flight time, and increased feeding time when sugar concentration decreased. Our results suggest that nectar-feeding bats in nature confront two scenarios with complementary ecological effects: 1) bats feeding on dilute nectars (i.e. ? 15%. wt/vol.) should increase the number of flowers visited per night enhancing pollination, and 2) bats feeding on concentrated nectars could spend more time flying, including long- and short-distance-flights increasing food patch exploration for use during subsequent nights, and thus enhancing plant gene flow. Further studies on foraging behavior of nectarivorous bats under natural conditions are necessary to corroborate these hypotheses. © 2011.",Activity patterns; Behavioral compensation; Energy balance; Foraging behavior; Intake response; Phyllostomid bats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960697849

By the initiative of some pioneer growers, and the fiscal incentive that allowed investing part of the income tax on orchard implantation and the support of state governments to developing projects, the apple culture had and expressive boost from the '80s. In the '70s, Brazil depended on importations, what represented at that time more than 100million dollars. The production was approximately 13,263ton and reached 183,299ton and 857,615ton in the '80s and '90s, respectively. Recently, Brazil has reached an producing area of around 37,000ha with 3450 growers, and in 2009/2010 it was harvested 1,253 thousand tons of apples. Since 1994, Brazil became an apple exporter, and after 2000 exportations have beaten importations. The apple sector is an important source of employment generation with three direct and indirect jobs per hectare, representing more than 100 thousand employment in the apple productive chain. These advances are due to important technologies that were introduced throughout the years, which also let an increase of quality and yield per unit of area; in the '70s and '80s yield was inferior to 15ton/ha and nowadays is near to 40ton/ha, although some areas produce above 50ton/ha. Evolution also occurred with the cultivars. The first plantings were based on the cultivars Golden Delicious, Starkrimson, Blackjon, etc. These cultivars were progressively being substitute by 'Gala' and 'Fuji', and from the '90s clones that produce redder fruits of both cultivars were planted. Greater progress occurred to the quality of the vegetative material, since rootstocks and scions were virus-contaminated. The introduction of free-virus material led to an increase in yield and to the use of dwarfing rootstocks in high density orchards. The first apple orchards were performed with 500 to 800 trees per hectare; currently, orchard density consists of 2500 to 3000 trees per hectare. As the apple producing region in the South of Brazil has no adequate chilling to attempt the requirements to release dormancy, technologies were developed to induce bud burst and blooming, and consequently no alternate bearing. Besides these technologies, it must be highlighted the advances in the training systems and pruning, harvest management, chemical thinning, pollination, phytosanitary control and fruit conservation and storage. Moreover, the latter permitted the market supplying for twelve months of the year with high quality fruits.

This approach includes in vitro culturing of immature embryos into plantlets, which saves time because of no waiting for seed maturation. In addition to selection for kanamycin resistance and PCR identification of the gene of interest (here, insect resistance), we also incorporate methods such as plantlet grafting and growth regulation. In this way, embryos aged 20-30days postanthesis can develop directly into plantlets in another 10-15days. Here, kanamycin and PCR selection plantlets were grafted using a new and efficient technique called cotton joint graft, which can provide a reliable survival rate of 90-100%. Growth of the grafted plants was regulated for rapid development by adjusting the soil nutrients. We also treated the pedicels of hybridized or back-crossed bolls with a mixture of naphthalene acetic acid and gibberellic acid to prevent shedding. Over the course of 1year, we were able to produce three or four generations at intervals of about 90-120days, i.e. from immature embryo culture through pollination and fecundation. Using this procedure, we transferred the Cry1Ac gene into three recurrent cultivars, 'Han93-2', 'Jimian20' and 'Nongda94-7'.

We utilized the honey bee model and a newly developed spatial avoidance conditioning assay to probe effects of biogenic amines octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) on avoidance learning. In this new protocol non-harnessed bees associate a spatial color cue with mild electric shock punishment. After a number of experiences with color and shock the bees no longer enter the compartment associated with punishment. Intrinsic aspects of avoidance conditioning are associated with natural behavior of bees such as punishment (lack of food, explosive pollination mechanisms, danger of predation, heat, etc.) and their association to floral traits or other spatial cues during foraging. The results show that DA reduces the punishment received whereas octopamine OA increases the punishment received. These effects are dose-dependent and specific to the acquisition phase of training. The effects during acquisition are specific as shown in experiments using the antagonists Pimozide and Mianserin for DA and OA receptors, respectively.

The Maize Breeding Programme at the Crops Research Institute, Ghana, in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria identified high yielding and drought tolerant open-pollinated and hybrid maize varieties for evaluation and eventual release to farmers. The mother-baby trial model was adopted for the evaluation of these varieties in the major season of 2009 in three farming communities in the target agro-ecology. The Farmers variety showed poor yield performance in both the mother and baby trials and in the ranking of varieties by farmers and researchers in both early and medium maturity groups. Almost all the improved varieties were appreciated by both researchers and farmers. The yields of the drought tolerant varieties in both normal and drought affected environments were higher than the farmers variety in both cases. The two most promising drought tolerant varieties, TZE-W Pop STR QPM CO and IWD C2 S YN F2 out-yielded the Farmers' variety by as much as 23 to 90% across locations.

Recent decline of pollinating insects due to anthropogenic modification of habitats and climate, in particular from 1950's onwards, is a major and widespread concern. However, few studies document the extent of declines in species diversity, and no studies have previously quantified local abundance declines. We here make a quantitative assessment of recent historical changes in bumblebee assemblages by comparing contemporary and historical survey data. Methodology/Principal Findings: We take advantage of detailed, quantitative historical survey data from the 1930's on bumblebee (Bombus spp.) abundances and species composition in red clover (Trifolium pratense) fields, an important floral resource and an attractant of all bumblebee species. We used the historical survey data as a pre-industrialization baseline, and repeated the same sampling protocol at nearly the same localities at present, hence setting up a historical experiment. We detected historical changes in abundances (bees/m 2) of both workers (the ""pollinatory units"") and queens (effective population size), in addition to species composition. In particular, long-tongued bumblebee species showed consistent and dramatic declines in species richness and abundances throughout the flowering season of red clover, while short-tongued species were largely unaffected. Of 12 Bombus species observed in the 1930's, five species were not observed at present. The latter were all long-tongued, late-emerging species. Conclusions/Significance: Because bumblebees are important pollinators, historical changes in local bumblebee assemblages are expected to severely affect plant reproduction, in particular long-tubed species, which are pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees. © 2011 Dupont et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053169567

However, their presence can also inform about resource quality by providing inadvertent social information. Few studies have investigated whether foragers perceive conspecifics as informers or competitors. Here, we experimentally tested whether variation in the density of demonstrators ('none', 'low' and 'high'), whose location indicated flower profitability, affected decision-making of bumble-bees Bombus terrestris. Bumble-bees foraged on either 'simple' (two colours) or 'complex' (four colours) artificial floral communities. We found that conspecifics at low density may be used as sources of information in first flower choices, whereas they appeared as competitors over the whole foraging sequence. Low conspecific densities improved foragers' first-visit success rate in the simple environment, and decreased time to first landing, especially in the complex environment. High conspecific densities did not affect these behavioural parameters, but reduced flower constancy in both floral communities, which may alter the efficiency of pollinating visits. These results suggest that the balance of the costs and benefits of conspecific presence varies with foraging experience, floral community and density. Spatio-temporal scales could thus be an important determinant of social information use. This behavioural flexibility should allow bumble-bees to better exploit their environment. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Bombus terrestris; Competition; Decision-making; Foraging behaviour; Inadvertent social information; Plant-pollinator interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051506019

Understanding these factors is important for determining the ecological conditions that permitted hybridization and the evolutionary potential inherent in hybrids. Here, we characterized morphological, nuclear, and chloroplast variation in a putative hybrid zone between Schiedea menziesii and S. salicaria, endemic Hawaiian species with contrasting breeding systems. Schiedea menziesii is hermaphroditic with moderate selfing; S. salicaria is gynodioecious and wind-pollinated, with partially selfing hermaphrodites and largely outcrossed females. We tested three hypotheses: 1) putative hybrids were derived from natural crosses between S. menziesii and S. salicaria, 2) gene flow via pollen is unidirectional from S. salicaria to S. menziesii and 3) in the hybrid zone, traits associated with wind pollination would be favored as a result of pollen-swamping by S. salicaria. Schiedea menziesii and S. salicaria have distinct morphologies and chloroplast genomes but are less differentiated at the nuclear loci. Hybrids are most similar to S. menziesii at chloroplast loci, exhibit nuclear allele frequencies in common with both parental species, and resemble S. salicaria in pollen production and pollen size, traits important to wind pollination. Additionally, unlike S. menziesii, the hybrid zone contains many females, suggesting that the nuclear gene responsible for male sterility in S. salicaria has been transferred to hybrid plants. Continued selection of nuclear genes in the hybrid zone may result in a population that resembles S. salicaria, but retains chloroplast lineage(s) of S. menziesii.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052903700

Inflorescences were emasculated before capfall, immediately manually pollinated (EP) and fruit development was compared to emasculated but non-pollinated (ENP) and self-pollinated inflorescences (NESP). The diameter of berries derived from pollinated flowers (EP and NESP) was significantly higher than from non-pollinated flowers (ENP) at 21 days after emasculation/pollination (DAE), and a rapid increase in the size of the inner mesocarp, together with the presence of an embryo-like structure, were observed. The expression of gibberellin oxidases (GA20ox and GA2ox), anthranilate synthase (related to auxin synthesis) and cytokinin synthase coding genes was studied to assess the relationship between hormone synthesis and early berry development, while flower patterning genes were analyzed to describe floral transition. Significant expression changes were found for hormone-related genes, suggesting that their expression at early stages of berry development (13 DAE) is related to cell division and differentiation of mesocarp tissue at a later stage (21 DAE). Expression of hormone-related genes also correlates with the expression of VvHB13, a gene related to mesocarp expansion, and with an increased repression of floral patterning genes (PISTILLATA and TM6), which may contribute to prevent floral transition inhibiting fruit growth before fertilization takes place. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Anthesis; ASB1; Berry flesh; Embryo development; Flower patterning; L1L; Parthenocarpy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960312583

Focusing on the mating environment, we assessed the effect of conspecific tree density on mating patterns in the naturally scattered forest tree Sorbus domestica L. In an area of more than 100km2, we mapped and genotyped all 189 adult trees and performed a paternity analysis on seeds produced by single mothers. Despite a self-incompatibility system, average selfing rate was 31.9%, but with high variation among mother trees. Over 70% of this variation was explained by local density of conspecifics (i.e. within a radius of 300m), with isolated trees being more prone to selfing. While we detected high selfing rates in progeny, adult trees showed no signs of inbreeding. As almost all inbreeding in the offspring could be attributed to self-fertilisation, we hypothesise that there is strong selection against selfed individuals. The effective reproductive output of isolated trees, which mainly self, is therefore greatly reduced. These findings have important consequences for the management of naturally scattered, insect-pollinated temperate tree species, often belonging to the family of Rosaceae. For these species, local density of conspecifics should be maintained above a certain threshold (i.e. 0.05trees/ha in S. domestica), to avoid negative fitness consequences from selfing. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Conspecific density; Individual inbreeding coefficient; Mating environment; Outcrossing; Rare tree species; Selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960072317

In Scotland, 84 native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) woodlands are recognised by the Forestry Commission and they occupy highly diverse environments from the maritime west coast to continental sites in eastern Scotland. However, it is not known whether adaptations to local environments along sharp temperature and rainfall gradients have occurred in different populations and as a result, the seed transfer guidelines of the species are based only on data from isozymes and monoterpenes. In this study of an outdoor common-garden trial, we used chlorophyll fluorescence to examine whether seedlings from 32 open-pollinated families and eight populations from sites experiencing contrasting annual temperature regimes differed in their response to variation in natural outdoor temperatures between September 2009 and May 2010. In addition, growth initiation in spring was recorded. Photochemical capacity at photosystem II Fv/Fm showed a distinct seasonal trend and remained at relatively high levels (?0.7) until November. Following a period of over 2. weeks with temperatures below or close to 0°C, Fv/Fm started decreasing towards its minimum values recorded in early March when population means varied between 0.35 and 0.45. By early May and along with rising temperatures, photochemical capacity had recovered to the same level as observed in early November. Populations were found to respond differently to the cold period starting in December. The largest drop in photochemical capacity was observed in seedlings from a low-altitude population located in the maritime western Scotland, while in seedlings from higher-altitude locations in the cooler eastern Scotland, the response was smaller. In March, the recovery of photochemical capacity was slowest in seedlings from the mildest and coolest sites. Evidence of adaptive genetic differentiation was also found in spring phenology. Initiation of shoot elongation and needle flush were earlier in families from higher altitudes (cooler areas), but population differences were not significant at the ?=0.05 level. These results suggest that adaptation to the spatially heterogeneous environment in Scotland has taken place in Scots pine and that in order to minimise the risk of planting maladapted seed stock, the patterns of environmental and adaptive genetic variation should be taken into account in the management of genetic resources in this species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptation; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Genetic differentiation; Scots pine; Seasonal variation; Spatial heterogeneity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960052106

The study was carried out in Chapadinha, State of Maranhão in northeastern Brazil. Bowdichia virgilioides has cornucopia flowering and annual pattern. Flowering occurred at the beginning of the dry season, between June and August; and fruiting in the middle of this season, between July and October. The anthesis of B. virgilioides is diurnal, and the main flower resource is the nectar. During the flower opening, the anthers becomes dehiscent and thus pollen grains are deposited at the stigma, promoting automatic selfpollination. The species is self-compatible and apomitic. In the study area, they were visited by nine species of bees, four butterflies, two wasps, and two hummingbirds. The visits began in early morning and persisted throughout the day, with a peak of activity between 8:00 and 9:00 hours. Species of Centris were the main visitors of B. virgilioides. The butterfly and wasp species were considered resource robbers, and other floral visitors were considered occasional visitors. Although the flowers of B. virgilioides are widely visited, the species shows a high rate of inbreeding because of automatic self-pollination.",Breeding system; Cerrado; Pollination; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052604131

Crop physiology uses a whole approach to study this complex trait, which can provide helpful information to plant breeders and molecular biologists. This study emphasizes the understanding of pre- and post-anthesis determinants of final grain weight. A field experiment was carried out in two growing seasons evaluating two wheat cultivars contrasting in grain weight potential. Carpel weight at pollination, grain dimensions, grain water, dry matter and volume dynamics were assessed. Among grain dimensions, grain length was the trait, which explained final grain weight (r2=0.78; P&lt;0.01 and r2=0.94; P&lt;0.001 for the 1st and 2nd season, respectively) and it was the first trait to stabilize after anthesis. Water content of grains stabilized little later and also showed a strong association with final grain weight (r2=0.93; P&lt;0.01 and r2=0.98; P&lt;0.01 for the 1st and 2nd season respectively). Most importantly, carpel weight at pollination showed a positive and linear association with final grain weight (r2=0.79, P&lt;0.01 and r2=0.86 P&lt;0.01 for the 1st and 2nd season, respectively) irrespective of the cultivar and grain position. In addition, positive associations were also found between grain volume, water content, grain length, and carpel weight at pollination. Therefore, the associations between pre- and post-anthesis traits found in this study support the hypothesis that grain weight is determined before anthesis and fruit tissues (i.e., pericarp in cereals and sunflower) set an upper limit to grain weight. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Grain filling; Grain volume; Grain yield; Kernel,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959978867

However, the macroecological and macroevolutionary processes underpinning past and present biodiversity patterns are only beginning to be explored on a global scale. It is also particularly important, in the face of the global extinction crisis, to understand these processes in order to be able to use this knowledge to prevent future biodiversity loss and loss of ecosystem services. Unfortunately, efforts to understand mammalian biodiversity have been hampered by a lack of data.

All colonize plant xylem vessels and cause wilt diseases, but with significant biological differences. R. solanacearum is a soilborne bacterium that infects the roots of a broad range of plants. R. syzygii causes Sumatra disease of clove trees and is actively transmitted by cercopoid insects. BDB is also pathogenic to a single host, banana, and is transmitted by pollinating insects. Sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated that despite their phenotypic differences, these three plant pathogens are actually very closely related, falling into the Phylotype IV subgroup of the R. solanacearum species complex. To better understand the relationships among these bacteria, we sequenced and annotated the genomes of R. syzygii strain R24 and BDB strain R229. These genomes were compared to strain PSI07, a closely related Phylotype IV tomato isolate of R. solanacearum, and to five additional R. solanacearum genomes. Whole-genome comparisons confirmed previous phylogenetic results: the three phylotype IV strains share more and larger syntenic regions with each other than with other R. solanacearum strains. Furthermore, the genetic distances between strains, assessed by an in-silico equivalent of DNA-DNA hybridization, unambiguously showed that phylotype IV strains of BDB, R. syzygii and R. solanacearum form one genomic species. Based on these comprehensive data we propose a revision of the taxonomy of the R. solanacearum species complex. The BDB and R. syzygii genomes encoded no obvious unique metabolic capacities and contained no evidence of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria occupying similar niches. Genes specific to R. syzygii and BDB were almost all of unknown function or extrachromosomal origin. Thus, the pathogenic life-styles of these organisms are more probably due to ecological adaptation and genomic convergence during vertical evolution than to the acquisition of DNA by horizontal transfer.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052525932

The exploitation of hidden resources may require specially adapted morphological or sensory tools for resource location and utilisation. Differences in tool diversity and complexity can determine not only how many species can utilize these hidden resources but also how they do so. Methodology and Principal Findings: The sclerotisation, gross morphology and ultrastructure of the ovipositors of a seven-member community of parasitic wasps comprising of gallers and parasitoids developing within the globular syconia (closed inflorescences) of Ficus racemosa (Moraceae) was investigated. These wasps also differ in their parasitism mode (external versus internal oviposition) and their timing of oviposition into the expanding syconium during its development. The number and diversity of sensilla, as well as ovipositor teeth, increased from internally ovipositing to externally ovipositing species and from gallers to parasitoids. The extent of sclerotisation of the ovipositor tip matched the force required to penetrate the syconium at the time of oviposition of each species. The internally ovipositing pollinator had only one type of sensillum and a single notch on the ovipositor tip. Externally ovipositing species had multiple sensilla types and teeth on their ovipositors. Chemosensilla were most concentrated at ovipositor tips while mechanoreceptors were more widely distributed, facilitating the precise location of hidden hosts in these wasps which lack larval host-seeking behaviour. Ovipositor traits of one parasitoid differed from those of its syntopic galler congeners and clustered with those of parasitoids within a different wasp subfamily. Thus ovipositor tools can show lability based on adaptive necessity, and are not constrained by phylogeny. Conclusions/Significance: Ovipositor structure mirrored the increasingly complex trophic ecology and requirements for host accessibility in this parasite community.

Four previously published full length stigmatic S-alleles from the genus Papaver exhibited remarkable sequence divergence, but these studies failed to amplify additional S-alleles despite crossing evidence for more than 60 S-alleles in Papaver rhoeas alone. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using RT-PCR we identified 87 unique putative stigmatic S-allele sequences from the Papaveraceae Argemone munita, Papaver mcconnellii, P. nudicuale, Platystemon californicus and Romneya coulteri. Hand pollinations among two full-sib families of both A. munita and P. californicus indicate a strong correlation between the putative S-genotype and observed incompatibility phenotype. However, we also found more than two S-like sequences in some individuals of A. munita and P. californicus, with two products co-segregating in both full-sib families of P. californicus. Pairwise sequence divergence estimates within and among taxa show Papaver stigmatic S-alleles to be the most variable with lower divergence among putative S-alleles from other Papaveraceae. Genealogical analysis indicates little shared ancestral polymorphism among S-like sequences from different genera. Lack of shared ancestral polymorphism could be due to long divergence times among genera studied, reduced levels of balancing selection if some or all S-like sequences do not function in incompatibility, population bottlenecks, or different levels of recombination among taxa. Preliminary estimates of positive selection find many sites under selective constraint with a few undergoing positive selection, suggesting that self-recognition may depend on amino acid substitutions at only a few sites. Conclusions/Significance: Because of the strong correlation between genotype and SI phenotype, sequences reported here represent either functional stylar S-alleles, tightly linked paralogs of the S-locus or a combination of both. The considerable complexity revealed in this study shows we have much to learn about the evolutionary dynamics of self-incompatibility systems. © 2011 Paape et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052319273

Sinosenecio jishouensis D. G. Zhang, Y. Liu & Q. E. Yang is a new Asteraceous species (genus Sinosenecio) recently ascertained. According to IUCN Red Species List S. jishouensis ranked as the Critically Endangered Species (CR), for its extremely small and rare populations. However, little is known about the reproductive biology of this endangered species. Our results demonstrated that S. jishouensis occurred only in the Dehang Geological Park, Jishou City, Hunan Province. S. jishouensis distributed on an altitude of 260-340 m, and the environmental conditions were mildly warm and relatively humid. The yellow-red soil in its habitat, which was rich in calcium, has a pH value of about 6.8. There were totally 2000-3000 individuals distributed in 3 populations in the Dehang Geological Park, suggesting this species is at risk of becoming extinct. The Canyon Fall population was the largest one, with nearly 2000 individuals, which is an important population for conservation priorities. Its shoots began to sprout in Early Februray, and the scape appeared by the end of February or the early March; the flowering season was from mid- March to mid-May. S. jishouensis has herkogamy flowers with a 3-5d longevity. For a single capitulum, it could last 18 days. Secondary pollen presentation, a typical phenomenon in Asteraceae, were conspicuous during floret openning. Our observation suggested that Caliroa sawfly, Apis cerana and syrphid fly were the effective pollinators and visited flowers for collecting pollen. Our study indicated that floral structures, flowering synchronizatio, and ""brush-like mechanism"" were floral adaptations to improve the effective pollination. Furthermore, characteristics of its breeding system, such as small achenes without pappus and relying mainly on both clone production and sexual production, ensure reproductive success even when pollinators are scarce in the Canyon Fall special habitat. It may be adaptive strategies to the Canyon Fall special habitat. On the other hand, the human-made interference, the scarce flower-visiting pollination, low visiting frequency and efficiency, the small number of seeds with poor quality and dispersal, together with its strict demands on habitat conditions were the main causes for the rare and endangered status of S. jishouensis.",Conservation; Ecological adaptation; Endemic plants; Phenology characteristic; Propagation; Sinosenecio jishouensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052155786

These interacting assemblages may also be altered (directly or indirectly) by introduced species, especially on oceanic islands. In this study, we analyzed the effects of opportunistic nectar-feeding passerine birds and native (semi-slugs) and introduced (rats) floral herbivores on the reproductive success of Canarina canariensis.Methods: Manual pollination experiments were conducted to determine plant breeding system and pollen limitation. We also identified floral visitors and their visitation frequencies by censuses. Bird pollination effectiveness was evaluated by selective exclosures. The intensity of floral herbivory by native vs. introduced herbivores and its effect on plant fitness was estimated in different areas within the Canary island of Tenerife.Key results: Canarina canariensis had a very low spontaneous selfing ability and high pollen limitation, despite being selfcompatible. Birds increased fruit set and the percentage of viable seeds per fruit, while florivores, the principal floral visitors, reduced them. Semi-slugs mainly consumed male reproductive organs, while rats preferred female. There was a strong withinisland spatial variation in the herbivory intensity.Conclusions: Opportunistic nectar-feeding birds increase the production of viable seeds in C. canariensis, but their beneficial effects are counteracted by the high incidence of floral herbivory. Because native semi-slugs damaged anthers more frequently than did introduced rats, these florivores may differ in their effects on male and female plant reproductive success. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Bird pollination; Breeding system; Canarina; Cyanistes; Floral herbivory; Phylloscopus; Plutonia; Pollen limitation; Pollination effectiveness; Rattus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855469303

Variations in these traits may influence pollinator movements, pollen receipt, and seed number. To assess how floral display size and flowering plant density affect parameters of pollinator visitation rate, pollen receipt per flower, seed number per fruit and the between-plant pollinator movements, we studied the self-incompatible plant, Nierembergia linariifolia. Per-flower pollinator visitation rate and bout length increased linearly with increasing floral display size. Pollen receipt per flower increased linearly with increasing flowering plant density. For seed number per fruit, a polynomial model describing an increased seed number per fruit at low density and a decreased seed number per fruit at high density provided a significant fit. Per-flower pollinator visitation rate was not associated with pollen receipt per flower and seed number per fruit. Bees visited plants located near to the center of the population more frequently than plants located at the periphery. Increases in both floral display size and flowering plant density led to an increased chance of a plant being chosen as the center of the pollinator foraging area. These results suggest that even though large floral displays and high flowering plant density are traits that attract more pollinators, they may also reduce potential mate diversity by restricting pollen movement to conspecific mates that are closely located. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Centris tricolor; Floral display size; Flowering plant density; Nierembergia linariifolia; Pollen receipt; Pollinator visitation rate; Seed number,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051928337

Disruption of plant-pollinator relationships is predicted to cause plant mating system evolution, although this process has not been directly observed. This study demonstrates the immediate evolutionary effects of pollinator loss within experimental populations of a predominately outcrossing wildflower. Initially equivalent populations evolved for five generations within two pollination treatments: abundant bumblebee pollinators versus no pollinators. The populations without pollinators suffered greatly reduced fitness in early generations but rebounded as they evolved an improved ability to self-fertilize. All populations diverged in floral, developmental, and life-history traits, but only a subset of characters showed clear association with pollination treatment. Pronounced treatment effects were noted for anther-stigma separation and autogamous seed set. Dramatic allele frequency changes at two chromosomal polymorphisms occurred in the no pollinator populations, explaining a large fraction of divergence in pollen viability. The pattern of phenotypic and genetic changes in this experiment favors a sequential model for the evolution of the multitrait ""selfing syndrome"" observed throughout angiosperms. © 2011 The Author(s).

Plant size, phenotypic gender, and flower production were measured in experimental populations of an aquatic, insect-pollinated herb Sagittaria trifolia (Alismataceae) under highly different densities. The comparison of ramets produced clonally can reduce confounding effects from genetic and environmental factors. In the high-density population, 48% of ramets were male without female flowers, but in the low-density population all ramets were monoecious. We observed allometric growth in reproductive allocation with ramet size, as evident in biomass of reproductive structures and number of flowers. However, within both populations female and male flower production were isometric with ramet size, in contrast to an allometric growth in femaleness as predicted by SDS. Phenotypic gender was not related to ramet size in either population. The results indicated that large plants may increase both female and male function even in animal-pollinated plants, pointing towards further studies to test the hypothesis of size-dependent sex allocation using different allocation currencies. © 2011 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Alismataceae; Clonal reproduction; Flower production; Insect-pollinated; Monoecious; Sagittaria trifolia; Size-dependent sex allocation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83655164142

Using traditional estimates of effectiveness (visitation rate and seed set), our results show that hummingbirds were the most effective pollinators as expected. Bees and ants were less effective, and their contributions were one-fourth to one-tenth of that observed for hummingbirds. We then modified this measure of effectiveness by adding two components, fitness of progeny and temporal availability of visitors, both of which refine estimates of flower visitor effectiveness. With these new estimations, we found that the effectiveness values of all three animal visitors decreased; however, the role of hummingbirds as the principal pollinator was maintained, whereas the effectiveness values of bees and ants approached zero.

In addition, all flower visitors were recorded. The carpenter bee's seasonal rhythm of activity, its foraging behavior on flowers, its pollination efficiency, the fructification rate and the number of seeds per pod were recorded. Individuals from 16 species of insects were recorded visiting flowers of P. coccineus in the 2 years. Xylocopa calens was the most frequent, followed by Chalicodoma cincta cincta and Apis mellifera. Apart from bees, wasps were also recorded as likely predators. Xylocopa calens mainly foraged for nectar resources. The mean foraging speed was 9.62 flowers/min. Flowers visited by X. calens had higher fruiting rate compared with others, while those bagged had the lowest. In addition, seed formation was higher in X. calens-visited flowers compared with all others. The results show that this crop experiences pollination deficit even under normal circumstances, considering that flowers visited by X. calens had higher yields compared with those under unlimited access by all visitors. The fruiting rate, the number of seeds/pod and the percentage of normal seeds of unprotected inflorescences were significantly higher than those of inflorescences protected from insects.

We paired putatively insect-pollinated Cyperus obtusiflorus and Cyperus sphaerocephalus with related, co-flowering, co-occurring wind-pollinated species, and compared pairs in terms of pollination mode and functional roles of floral traits. Experimentally excluding insects reduced seed set by 56-89% in putatively insect-pollinated species but not in intermingled wind-pollinated species. The pollen of putatively insect-pollinated species was less motile in a wind tunnel than that of wind-pollinated species.

Some cycads in the genus Cycas have floating seeds allowing oceanic dispersal, and have colonized remote islands such as Fiji, Guam, and Madagascar. This seems to contradict the expected requirement that specific beetle pollinators be present in order for cycads to establish in remote localities. We therefore postulated that these 'island' cycads are wind pollinated. We tested for adaptations associated with wind pollination in a laboratory study of pollen aerodynamics. The pollen from a range of (non-cycad) wind-pollinated plants was not relatively 'buoyant': the settling velocities of wind-pollinated species exceeded those of insect-pollinated cycads and some animal-pollinated angiosperms. We attributed this result to settling velocity being, in part, correlated with pollen size, as cycad pollen was consistently smaller. A better predictor for pollination vector was the tendency of pollen to aggregate during a vertical fall. Pollen of wind-pollinated plants separated into single grains, whereas cycad pollen and pollen of animal-pollinated angiosperms adhered in large aggregations, the settling velocity of which increased rapidly with aggregate size. The pollen of cycads known to be insect pollinated was similar in morphology, settling speed, and clumping behaviour to pollen of 'island' cycads of unknown pollination biology. Based on these aerodynamics, we predict that cycad species on oceanic islands have insect pollinators. More broadly, we propose that pollen aggregation during a vertical fall provides a sound test for wind versus animal pollination when the pollination vector is unknown. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Araucaria; Cyathea; Cycas micronesica; Cycas revoluta; Cycas seemannii; Cycas thouarsii; Lepidozamia; Pinus; Zamia; Zea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860401962

Although induced plant responses to herbivory are well studied as mechanisms of resistance, how induction shapes community interactions and ultimately plant fitness is still relatively unknown. Using a wild tomato, Solanum peruvianum, native to the Peruvian Andes, we evaluated the disruption of pollination as a potential ecological cost of induced responses. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic changes in herbivore-attacked plants, such as the herbivore-induced emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alter pollinator behavior and consequentially affect plant fitness. We conducted a series of manipulative field experiments to evaluate the role of herbivore-induced vegetative and floral VOC emissions as mechanisms by which herbivory affects pollinator behavior. In field surveys and bioassays in the plants' native habitat, we found that real and simulated herbivory (methyl jasmonate application) reduced attractiveness of S. peruvianum flowers to their native pollinators. We show that reduced pollinator preference, not resource limitation due to leaf tissue removal, resulted in reduced seed set. Solitary bee pollinators use floral plant volatiles, emitted in response to herbivory or methyl jasmonate treatment, as cues to avoid inflorescences on damaged plants. This herbivory-induced pollinator limitation can be viewed as a general cost of induced plant responses as well as a specific cost of herbivory-induced volatile emission. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Cajacay province; Constancy; Cost of defenses; Herbivory; Indirect defenses; Induced resistance; Peru; Peruvian Andes; Pollination; Pollinator limitation; Solanaceae; Wild tomato (Solanum peruvianum),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961168454

Such an assessment is needed in order to evaluate the potential for roadside verges to act as biodiversity refugia and corridors in otherwise transformed landscapes. Here, we document the impact of a two-lane tar road on pollination by birds in the Cape fynbos of South Africa. To do so, we developed a quick and widely applicable method of determining pollination rates in bird-pollinated members of the large genus Erica. Experiments with caged birds showed that the status of the anther ring (broken/perfect) indicated a sunbird visit with 92% accuracy, while field surveys confirmed anther ring status also serves as a proxy for pollen receipt to stigmas. Using this technique we determined pollination rate in Erica perspicua at three distances from the road (0-10, 20-30 and 40-50m). After controlling for flower colour, robbing rate and plant density, significantly fewer anther rings were disturbed in close proximity to the road.

The focus was on the establishment method (undersowing or seed mixture sown post-tillage), seed mixture (competitive Festuca pratensis-Phleum pratense-Trifolium pratense or less competitive Agrostis capillaris-Festuca ovina mixture) and duration (1 or 2 years) of the fallow. The seed mixture and duration affected the pollinators more than the method of establishment. Pollinator species richness was higher in fallows sown with less competitive than with competitive grasses and it increased in the second year. Stubble fields reached as high pollinator species richness already during the first year as fallows with less competitive grasses did in the second year. Pollinator abundance was highest in those treatments in which species richness of flowering plants was highest.

This alternative control strategy is referred to as pollinator-and-vector technology. The present study was designed to investigate the capacity of B. terrestris to fulfil this role in greenhouse strawberry flowers, which were manually inoculated with a major plant pathogen, the grey mould Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. A model microbiological control agent (MCA) product Prestop-Mix was loaded in a newly developed two-way bumblebee dispenser, and, in addition, the use of the diluent Maizena-Plus (corn starch) was tested. Results: Importantly, loading of the MCA caused no adverse effects on bumblebee workers, with no loss of survival or impairment of flight activity of the workers during the 4 week flowering period. Secondly, vectoring of Prestop-Mix by bumblebees resulted in a higher crop production, as 71% of the flowers developed into healthy red strawberries at picking (preharvest yield) as compared with 54% in the controls. In addition, these strawberries were better protected, as 79% of the picked berries remained free of B. cinerea after a 2 day incubation (post-harvest yield), while this percentage was only 43% in the control. Overall, the total yield (preharvest × post-harvest) was 2-2.5 times higher than the total yield in the controls (24%) in plants exposed to bumblebees vectoring Prestop-Mix. Thirdly, the addition of the diluent Maizena-Plus to Prestop-Mix at 1:1 (w/w) resulted in a similar yield to that of Prestop-Mix used alone, and in no negative effects on the bumblebees, flowers and berries. Conclusions: This greenhouse study provides strong evidence that B. terrestris bumblebees can vector a MCA to reduce B. cinerea incidence in greenhouse strawberries, resulting in higher yields. Similar yields obtained in the treatments with Prestop-Mix and Prestop-Mix + Maizena-Plus suggest an equally efficient dissemination of the biocontrol agent into the flowers with only half the initial concentration of Prestop-Mix, which illustrates the importance of the diluent. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",Bombus terrestris; Botrytis cinerea; Diluent; Dispenser; Greenhouse; Pollinator-and-vector; Strawberry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051942630

More than 50 insect species belonging to 10 orders were collected in May-June, while only five species of Hymenoptera Apoidea were collected in July. The quality of fruits arising from the second bloom showed that Hymenoptera alone were able to guarantee effective pollination.

Herbivores and pollinators may select on the same traits and/or mediate each others effects. Erysimum capitatum (Brassicaceae) is a widespread and variable plant species with generalized pollination that is attacked by a number of herbivores. The following questions were addressed. (a) Are pollinators and herbivores attracted by similar plant traits? (b) Does herbivory affect pollinator preferences? (c) Do pollinators and/or herbivores affect fitness and select on plant traits? (d) Do plant compensatory responses affect the outcome of interactions among plants, pollinators and herbivores? (e) Do interactions among E. capitatum and its pollinators and herbivores differ among sites and years? MethodsIn 2005 and 2006, observational and experimental studies were combined in four populations at different elevations to examine selection by pollinators and herbivores on floral traits of E. capitatum. Key Results Pollinator and herbivore assemblages varied spatially and temporally, as did their effects on plant fitness and selection. Both pollinators and herbivores preferred plants with more flowers, and herbivory sometimes reduced pollinator visitation. Pollinators did not select on plant traits in any year or population and E. capitatum was not pollen limited; however, supplemental pollen resulted in altered plant resource allocation. Herbivores reduced fitness and selected for plant traits in some populations, and these effects were mediated by plant compensatory responses. ConclusionsIndividuals of Erysimum capitatum are visited by diverse groups of pollinators and herbivores that shift in abundance and importance in time and space. Compensatory reproductive mechanisms mediate interactions with both pollinators and herbivores and may allow E. capitatum to succeed in this complex selective environment. © The Author 2011.

Exploring expression profiles of in vivo grown pollen tubes is important. Nevertheless, it is difficult to obtain accessible pollen tubes for profiling studies in most model plants. By taking advantage of the hollow styles of lily (Lilium longiflorum), in vivo pollen tubes harvested from pollinated styles which had been cut open were used here to study their protein and transcript profiles. Pollination quantitatively and qualitatively altered the total protein composition of elongating pollen tubes. cDNAs generated and amplified from total RNAs of 24 h in vivo grown and 12 h in vitro cultured pollen tubes were used for suppression subtractive hybridization analyses and preparation of home-made array chips. Microarray analyses conducted with different probe sets revealed 16 transcripts specifically present and/or enriched in in vivo pollen tubes. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), in situ hybridization and Northern blotting were applied to validate their unique pollination-induced expression features. Interestingly, several transcripts were simultaneously detected on the stylar transmitting tract epidermis, where in vivo pollen tubes tightly adhered during pollination. Their deduced amino acid sequences showed that most of them encoded small proteins and could be classified into several families. Transient assay revealed filament-like structures decorated by these proteins and one probably localized in the generative cell. These small peptides might be critical for pollen tube growth during pollination, and further exploration of their biological functions and mechanisms of action are of great interest. © 2011 The Author.",Cell-cell interaction; In vivo pollen tube; Lilium longiflorum; Pollination; Small proteins; Transcripts,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052888790

For instance in pro-ovigenic species, when oviposition sites are abundant, females may quickly become devoid of eggs. Conversely, in the absence of suitable oviposition sites, females may die before laying all of their eggs. In pollinating fig wasps (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae), each species has an obligate mutualism with its host fig tree species [Ficus spp. (Moraceae)]. These pro-ovigenic wasps oviposit in individual ovaries within the inflorescences of monoecious Ficus (syconia, or 'figs'), which contain many flowers. Each female flower can thus become a seed or be converted into a wasp gall. The mystery is that the wasps never oviposit in all fig ovaries, even when a fig contains enough wasp females with enough eggs to do so. The failure of all wasps to translate all of their eggs into offspring clearly contributes to mutualism persistence, but the underlying causal mechanisms are unclear. We found in an undescribed Brazilian Pegoscapus wasp population that the lifetime reproductive success of lone foundresses was relatively unaffected by constraints on oviposition. The number of offspring produced by lone foundresses experimentally introduced into receptive figs was generally lower than the numbers of eggs carried, despite the fact that the wasps were able to lay all or most of their eggs. Because we excluded any effects of intraspecific competitors and parasitic non-pollinating wasps, our data suggest that some pollinators produce few offspring because some of their eggs or larvae are unviable or are victims of plant defences. © 2011 The Authors.

Flies are trapped within a bulbous base of the flower after moving through an elongated corolla tube that is frequently lined with stiff hairs. When these hairs wilt after several days, insects held in the bulbous chamber at the base of the corolla tube are released. Despite such complex adaptations for trapping pollinators, key aspects of the pollination ecology including the identity of pollinators, presence or absence of nectar rewards, duration of pollinator trapping, and pollination success remain undescribed for most Ceropegia species. Importantly, no studies have empirically tested the role that trapping hairs may have on pollen export and receipt. We documented the pollination biology of Ceropegia ampliata in two natural populations and found that C. ampliata can be regarded as a generalist, being pollinated by flies from at least four families (Tachinidae, Sarcophagidae, Muscidae, and Lauxaniidae). The duration of the trapping phase lasted 2-5 days and flowers produce small quantities of nectar. Pollination success was highly variable but generally low with occasional peaks suggesting that flies are likely to visit this species sporadically. Flowers that had already proceeded beyond the trapping phase generally had a significantly greater number of pollinaria removed than flowers that were still in the trapping phase, probably reflecting the longer exposure to pollinators. In contrast we found no differences in pollinarium removal between flowers with trapping hairs present and flowers with hairs experimentally disabled. The role of trapping hairs in the pollination success of C. ampliata therefore remains uncertain although we propose, on the basis of this experiment, that trapping may be an adaptation to enhance female success through pollen deposition rather than pollen export. Given the low rates of natural pollen deposition, an experiment with a large number of replicates is required to test this hypothesis in Ceropegia. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Asclepiadoideae; Ceropegia ampliata; Fly-pollination; Pollen transfer efficiency; Trap-flower pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051949473

To explore the interaction between variation in floral form and pollinator behavior, we observed the foraging behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) when presented with both wild-type Mimulus lewisii plants and each of three chemically induced single-locus mutants with altered floral phenotypes, including loss of the three lower petals, loss of nectar guides, and a change in petal color patterning. We found that each of the mutants attracted successful pollinator visits at just 29-80% of the rate relative to wild-type flowers, suggesting that effective recruitment of bumblebee pollinators requires the landing platform provided by the lower petals, and visual cues provided by the nectar guides and petal color pattern. Since single-locus recessive mutations are capable of ablating the lower petals, nectar guides, and color pattern, such changes in floral form provide insight into the driving forces behind plant adaptation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Color contrast; Floral form; Mimulus; Nectar guides; Petal number; Pollinator choice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051671151

We observed post-pollination processes microscopically in styles collected after self-morph and inter-morph hand pollination (with standardized pollen load on the stigmas) in four genets each from the following three 'genet types': self-incompatible long-styled (SI), partially self-compatible long-styled (SC) and self-incompatible short-styled morph genets. Irrespective of the genet type, pollen germination began within 24h after pollination and tubes of pollen reached to the style base with 48-96h after inter-morph pollination. Although pollen tubes germinated after self-pollination in the SC genets, the number of germinated pollen tubes was significantly lower than in the case of inter-morph pollination. Few pollen tubes germinated after self-pollination of the SI or short-styled genets. In SC genets, the rate of pollen-tube growth did not differ between self-morph and inter-morph pollination (~1.9mm/day). Therefore, differences in self-compatibility between SC and SI genets in P. sieboldii are likely to be attributable to differential pollen germination rates rather than to differential pollen-tube growth rates. © 2011 The Authors.

There are many different indices of topological importance, including centrality indices, but it is likely that a small number are sufficient to explain variation in topological importance. We used 14 indices to describe topological importance of plants and pollinators in 12 quantitative mutualistic (plant-pollinator) networks. The 14 indices varied in their consideration of interaction strength (weighted versus unweighted indices) and indirect interactions (from the local measure of degree to meso-scale indices). We use principal components approximation to assess how well every combination of 1-14 indices approximated to the results of principal components analysis (PCA). We found that one or two indices were sufficient to explain up to 90% of the variation in topological importance in both plants and pollinators. The choice of index was crucial because there was considerable variation between the best and the worst approximating subsets of indices. The best single indices were unweighted degree and unweighted topological importance (Jordán's TI index) with two steps (a measurement of apparent competition). The best pairs of indices consisted of a measure of a TI index and one of closeness centrality (weighted or unweighted) or d' (a standardised species-level measure of partner diversity).

A common mapping approach is to apply established empirical relationships to ecosystem property maps. Often, ecosystem properties that provide services to humanity are strongly related to the land use and land cover, where the spatial allocation of the land cover in the landscape is especially important. Land use and land cover maps are, therefore, essential for ES mapping. However, insight into the uncertainties in land cover maps and how these propagate into ES maps is lacking. To analyze the effects of these uncertainties, we mapped pollination efficiency as an example of an ecosystem function, using two continental-scale land cover maps and two global-scale land cover maps. We compared the outputs with maps based on a detailed national-scale map. The ecosystem properties and functions could be mapped using the GLOBCOVER map with a reasonable to good accuracy. In homogeneous landscapes, an even coarser resolution map would suffice. For mapping ESs that depend on the spatial allocation of land cover in the landscape, a classification of satellite images using fractional land cover or mosaic classes is an asset. © 2011 by the authors.",Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem services; Geometric uncertainty; Land cover maps; The netherlands; Thematic uncertainty,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80755182325

However, GM crops do not exist in traditional agricultural environments; thus, the risks resulting from the application of GM crops to agriculture must be made clear. Crops, such as rice belonging to the Gramineae family, can be cross-pollinated by wind. This enables non-GM crops to be pollinated by GM crops. Prior to the cultivation of GM crops, the degree of cross-pollination must be estimated. This should take into consideration meteorological conditions, because of their importance in pollen flow. We constructed a system model to calculate the cross-pollination distribution by using data on the geographical distribution of GM donor and non-GM recipient crop fields, meteorological elements, and flowering data. The system consists of a main program to calculate cross-pollination rates, a program to include the isolation distance, and a sub-program to average the maps of the cross-pollination rates in recipient fields. The system can predict the regional cross-pollination rate by incorporating the isolation distance and differences in the flowering period. The system was applied to three areas around Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, with different distributions of paddy fields and hypothetical donor (ratio 30%) and recipient (ratio 70%) fields. The general trend was that the cross-pollination rates were lower in areas of clustered donor fields. The calculated cross-pollination rate can mostly be explained by the length of the border between the donor and recipient fields. This is because rice pollen is dispersed only within short distances from donor fields. In order to clarify the influence of meteorological conditions on the variation in the cross-pollination rate, 10 years of simulations were performed. The cross-pollination rate varied by about a factor of three (0.03-0.09% for one of the simulated fields) during the simulated 10 years. © 2011, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

We studied the floral biology of Xyris tennesseensis, a federally endangered species, at a site (Willett Springs) in north central Alabama. We described floral behavior and flowering phenology, supplemented pollen onto stigmas from self and outcross sources to determine its effect on seed production and germination ability, documented the floral visitor fauna, and collected data on behavior, abundance and pollen loads of floral visitor species during two years (199899). Flowering of the population lasted from July to September each year, but individual flowers completed blooming in about a 3-hr period beginning in late morning. On average, a single flower was visited by three insects for a total of five floral visits during its brief period of anthesis. Floral visitation was greatest when flowers first opened and declined steeply by the time flowers began to close. Halictid bees were the most abundant floral visitors, along with four species of pollen-consuming syrphid flies. Based upon quantity of pollen carried, location on the body, and visitation frequency, we concluded that the halictid bee Lasioglossum zephyrum was the single most important pollinator species on the study site. However, the pollen supplementation study showed that flowers produce seeds without visitation by insects, likely by self-pollination.

This interaction is of particular relevance in agronomically important species where seeds or fruits are the edible part. Over time some agronomically species have been selected for the ability to produce fruit without seeds. While this phenomenon is critical for commercial production in some species, very little is known about the events behind the production of seedless fruit. In this work, the relationship between pollenpistil interaction and the onset of fruiting was investigated in citrus mandarin. •Methods: Pistils were sequentially examined in hand-pollinated flowers paying attention to pollen-tube behaviour, and to cytochemical changes along the pollen-tube pathway. To evaluate which of these changes were induced by pollination/ fertilization and which were developmentally regulated, pollinated and unpollinated pistils were compared. Also the onset of fruiting was timed and changes in the ovary examined. •Key Results: Conspicuous changes occurred in the pistil along the pollen-tube pathway, which took place in a basipetal way encompassing the timing of pollen-tube growth. However, these changes appear to be developmentally regulated as they happened in the same way and at the same time in unpollinated flowers. Moreover, the onset of fruiting occurred prior to fertilization and the very same changes could be observed in unpollinated flowers. •Conclusions: Pollen-pistil interaction in citrus showed similarities with unrelated species and families belonging to other taxa. The uncoupling of the reproductive and fruiting processes accounts for the parthenocarpic ability of unpollinated flowers to produce fruit in citrus. However, the maintenance of a functional reproductive process reflects the potential to produce seeded fruits, providing a basis for the understanding of the production of seeded or unseeded fruits and further understanding of the process of parthenocarpy in other species. © The Author 2011.

In animal-pollinated species, male floral traits are predicted to be larger because competition for pollinators should favour larger displays. Floral dimorphism may be greater in dioecious than monoecious populations because of trade-offs between female and male function and opportunities for selfing in hermaphrodites. MethodsThese predictions were tested by surveying flower size, total flowers per inflorescence and daily display size in the insect-pollinated Sagittaria latifolia (Alismataceae). This species is useful for comparative analysis because populations are mostly either monoecious or dioecious. We examined floral dimorphism in 13 monoecious and 16 dioecious populations in eastern North America. Key Results Male flowers were significantly larger than female flowers in monoecious and dioecious populations, but there was no evidence for greater flower size dimorphism in dioecious populations despite their larger flower sizes overall. Although inflorescences in both dioecious and monoecious populations produced more male flowers, daily floral displays were significantly larger for female than male function due to more synchronous female flower opening. Daily floral display dimorphism was significantly greater in dioecious populations, due to greater female daily floral displays. There was a positive relationship between mean flower size and total flowers per inflorescence for both sexes in dioecious populations, but no relationship for either sex function in monoecious populations. Flower size dimorphism was positively correlated with the frequencies of females in dioecious populations. ConclusionsThe increased size and number of male flowers and protracted male floral displays in S. latifolia are probably shaped by sexual selection for more effective pollen dispersal. © The Author 2011.

Florivores can reduce fruit and seed production, so selection on flower size, floral longevity and/or number of flowers may thus be determined by the relative effects of both pollinators and florivores. In this study flowers of Cistus ladanifer, a large-flowered Mediterranean shrub, were monitored to evaluate the effects of flower size, floral longevity and number of flowers on levels of florivory in four populations. Number of flowers was variable but did not differ among populations. Both flower size and floral longevity of C. ladanifer showed broad variation and significantly differed among populations. Overall, 7% of flowers suffered attack by florivores, which were mainly ants picking the stamens and beetles consuming petals and pollen. Within-populations, larger and longer-lived flowers tended to be affected by florivores more frequently. The low overall incidence of florivores and its lack of between-population variation suggest that florivory may not influence intraspecific variation of these floral traits. However, moderate florivory levels on the largest and longest-lived flowers open the possibility of exerting selection towards smaller and shorter-lived flowers in some of the populations studied. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Floral longevity; Florivores; Flower size; Number of flowers; Variation within-populations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052089773

Additionally, we find that sympatric sister species are more likely to have one species with anthers that overtop their stigmas than allopatric sister species, suggesting that the evolution of automatic self-pollination may contribute to this pattern. Potential mechanisms underlying this pattern include reinforcement and a stepping stone model of parapatric speciation. © 2011 The Author(s).

To shed light on the mechanisms underlying this variation, we studied the relationships between geographic variation of floral traits and both biotic and abiotic factors of the hummingbird-pollinated plant, Nicotiana glauca, across its natural range. We obtained floral measures of 38 populations from an area about 1600 km long and 1050 km wide and an altitude range from 7 to over 3400 m. We used a MANOVA to detect between-population differentiations in flower traits and a DFA to determine the traits that best discriminate between populations. To test for associations between floral traits and climatic variables we used correlation analysis. We explored any possible distance-based pattern of variation (either geographic or altitudinal) in floral traits or bill length of pollinators using Mantel tests. Finally, we used a multiple regression to analyze simultaneously the effects and relative importance of abiotic predictor variables and bill length on corolla length. We found a high variation in flower traits among populations. Morphometric traits were the ones that best discriminated across populations. There was a clinal pattern of floral phenotypic variation explained by climatic factors. Differences in floral phenotypic distances were structured by altitudinal distances but not by geographic distances. Bill length of the hummingbird pollinators was structured both by altitudinal and geographic distances. Differences in bill length of hummingbird pollinators explained differences in corolla length across populations. Our findings support the assumption of flower evolution at a broad geographic scale. Floral traits seem to be structured not only by altitude but also by climatic factors. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Altitudinal gradients; Bill length; Clinal variation; Floral traits; Geographic variation; Hummingbirds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052084807

Commonly, more bumblebees visited GM eggplants compared to near-isogenic control, but this difference was only marginally significant. The mean length of feeding bouts was similar on the two treatments. Neither the number of flowers produced nor their size could explain bumblebees' tendency to prefer GM eggplants. Volatile compounds were extracted from five plants per genotype and separated using gas chromatography. Thirteen compounds were identified and five of them appeared significantly more abundant in GM eggplants. Six of the identified compounds [(+)-limonene, Z-jasmone, p-cymene, ?-pinene, methyl-salicilate, and (-)-limonene] were tested in electrophysiological bioassays with antennas detached from young bumblebees, and a response was recorded in all six cases.

Although the synthesis pathway of HFA is extensively studied, the regulatory mechanism underlying synthesis and accumulation of 20:1OH is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the fatty acid composition and lipid gene expression pattern in developing seeds of L. fendleri, from 7 days after pollination (DAP) to desiccation (49 DAP). The results showed that accumulation of 20:1OH started at 21 DAP, increased quickly between 21 and 35 DAP and reached a plateau, about 50-55% of total lipids, at 35-49 DAP. In addition, two other HFAs, ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-octadec-cis-9-enoic acid: 18:1OH) and auricolic (14-hydroxy-eicos-cis-11,17-enoic acid: 20:2OH) acids were present at low levels during various stages of seed development. Ricinoleic acid could be detected as early as 14 DAP whereas 20:2OH began to accumulate at 21 DAP or later. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, we quantified the transcript level of three lipid genes, LFAH12 (bifunctional oleate 12-hydroxylase:desaturase), LfKCS3 (3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase) and LfFen1 (oleate 12-desaturase). While all of these genes displayed a bell-shaped expression pattern with a peak at 35 DAP and a sharp decline at 42-49 DAP, they had different expression levels during early seed development and maximum inductions.

The degree of impact of fragmentation on plant populations depends on the level of specificity of plant-animal interactions, as well as on the availability of suitable sites for seedling recruitment. In this study, we describe the population density and structure, pollen limitation and reproductive success of the endangered tropical orchid Myrmecophila christinae, an epiphytic species with a specialized pollination system. We surveyed a total of 14 populations located in a fragmented landscape. Seedling density was related to habitat disturbance and host plant density; while density of juveniles was related to density of adults. Adult and total individual densities were related to habitat affectation. We also found that fragments <1ha had significantly fewer seedlings, as well as an over-representation of large adults. On the other hand, fruit production was higher in fragments >10ha, and fruit set was significantly lower in highly disturbed fragments. Hand pollination experiments showed that M. christinae was pollen limited in all the studied populations, suggesting that pollen limitation is unrelated to habitat disturbance. Overall, our results suggest that fragmentation has affected key demographic features of M. christinae, including reproduction and recruitment. © 2011 The Author(s).

Data were optimized into a consensus tree constructed from three large-scale molecular phylogenies of the genus based on nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F sequences. The number of styles combined with the stigma shape are the only floral/fruit characters that enable the separation of Cuscuta subgenera. In addition, gynoecium morphology is useful for delimiting species in some clades. The one-style gynoecium of subg. Monogynella is mostly likely ancestral whereas gynoecia with two styles are derived in subgenera Cuscuta and Grammica. Gynoecia with two styles encountered in the latter subgenera provide a greater morphological complexity and flexibility for various reproductive strategies. In subg. Cuscuta, both the equal styles and stigmas continue to elongate and modify their position after the flowers open, until pollination occurs. In subg. Grammica, the two unequal styles may cause a spatial separation of the sexes in the flower, herkogamy, while the two stigmas mature sequentially and have a differential timing of their receptivity for pollen. A nectary consisting of a ring of modified stomata at the base of the ovary, the equivalent of the hypogynous nectary disc present in many Convolvulaceae, was observed for the first time in all Cuscuta species. The vasculature of the styles is reduced, represented mostly by phloem; xylem is present only in subg. Monogynella. Some gynoecial characters, for example papillae diameter, stigma surface area, stigma width, and style width were moderately correlated with pollen volume, pollen polar-equatorial ratio and tectum perforation.

Although the Mediterranean region is a hotspot for bee species richness, their status remains poorly studied. There is an urgent need for cost-effective, reliable, and unbiased sampling methods that give good bee species richness estimates. This study aims: (a) to assess bee species richness in two common Mediterranean habitat types: semi-natural scrub (phrygana) and managed olive groves; (b) to compare species richness in those systems to that of other biogeographic regions, and (c) to assess whether six different sampling methods (pan traps, variable and standardized transect walks, observation plots and trap nests), previously tested in other European biogeographic regions, are suitable in Mediterranean communities. Eight study sites, four per habitat type, were selected on the island of Lesvos, Greece. The species richness observed was high compared to other habitat types worldwide for which comparable data exist. Pan traps collected the highest proportion of the total bee species richness across all methods at the scale of a study site. Variable and standardized transect walks detected the highest total richness over all eight study sites. Trap nests and observation plots detected only a limited fraction of the bee species richness. To assess the total bee species richness in bee diversity hotspots, such as the studied habitats, we suggest a combination of transect walks conducted by trained bee collectors and pan trap sampling. © 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE); Apoidea; Biodiversity hotspot; Hymenoptera; Mediterranean scrub; Olive groves; Pan traps; Phrygana; Sampling methods; Subunit-based rarefaction curves; Transect walks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052673321

Here we investigate Tritoniopsis revoluta, which has geographically variable tube lengths, thought to be adaptations to insects with different proboscis lengths. We found a narrow transition zone between plants differing by three-fold in perianth tube length. We determined whether strong gene-flow barriers result from assortative mating arising from different pollinators, a high prevalence of selfing, or post-pollination incompatibilities between plants with different tube lengths. We found that there was little evidence to support assortative mating through different pollinators. Both short- and long-tubed plants were mainly visited by bees with short proboscides. Selfing is unlikely to contribute significantly to seed set, plants with different tube lengths were interfertile and hybrid plants were fertile. We conclude that the contact zone is unstable because these ecotypes have not accrued enough allopatric differences to translate into strong gene-flow barriers, or, alternatively, bimodality is not a consequence of secondary contact but the result of a novel mutation for short tubes spreading through a long-tubed population. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Adaptive peaks; Assortative mating; Bimodal tube length; Gene-flow barriers; Hybrid zone; Pollination; Pollinator ecotypes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860412740

It has been hypothesized that these two types of pollen vectors might impose contrasting selective pressures on plant flowering phenology. In the present study we describe the flowering phenology of two sympatric dioecious species with contrasting pollination modes: Mercurialis perennis (wind-pollinated) and Tamus communis (insect-pollinated). We estimated selection differentials and gradients for flowering time and flowering synchrony. As flowering time might depend on the accumulation of enough internal resources, we also estimated direct and indirect selection on plant size. Both species have male-biased sexual ratios, and males are bigger and produce larger flower displays than females, but only in T. communis do males bloom earlier and for longer than females. Selection gradients suggest that selection tends to favor early-flowering females of T. communis. There is no evidence of direct current selection on the flowering phenology of M. perennis. Intersexual differences in phenology fit with sex allocation and sexual selection theories. As we hypothesized, phenology of the animal-pollinated species is under stronger selection than that of the wind-pollinated species and we discuss the potential role of pollen vectors in shaping the flowering phenologies of the study species. © 2011 The Authors.

However, up to now, only a few studies have quantified its strength and relative contribution to total reproductive isolation. In this study, we quantified floral isolation among three closely related, sympatric orchid species of the genus Ophrys by directly tracking pollen flow. Ophrys orchids mimic their pollinators' mating signals, and are pollinated by male insects during mating attempts. This pollination system, called sexual deception, is usually highly specific. However, whether pollinator specialization also conveys floral isolation is currently under debate. In this study, we found strong floral isolation: among 46 tracked pollen transfers in two flowering seasons, all occurred within species. Accounting for observation error rate, we estimated a floral isolation index ?0.98 among each pair of species. Hand pollination experiments suggested that postpollination barriers were effectively absent among our study species. Genetic analysis based on AFLP markers showed a clear species clustering and very few F 1 hybrids in natural populations, providing independent evidence that strong floral isolation prevents significant interspecies gene flow. Our results provide the first direct evidence that floral isolation acts as the main reproductive barrier among closely related plant species with specialized pollination. © 2011 The Author(s).

Ruta graveolens (Rutaceae) produce both quaternary (four petals and eight stamens) and quinary (five petals and ten stamens) flowers on the same cymes, while their pollination roles and the effects on the reproductive success remained unexplored. We experimentally examined the biomass of female versus male organs and pollen viability and stigma receptivity to explore the sex allocation patterns between the flowers. The breeding systems and reproductive outputs through either female function (seed set) or male function (pollen dispersal) were also studied for quinary and quaternary flowers to determine whether there was functional bias. The results showed that R. graveolens was protandrous, with a mixed mating system. Its stamens could slowly move one by one and only dehisce when positioning at the flower center, which could greatly enhance pollen dispersal. The first-opened quinary flower allocated significantly higher resources (dry biomass) in female organs while quaternary flowers allocated more resource in male organs. The quaternary flowers experienced higher pollen limitation in seed production but were more successful in pollen dispersal and the quinary flowers reproduced both through female and male functions. Our data suggested that quinary and quaternary flower on same inflorescence in R. graveolens functioned mainly as the sex role that most resources were allocated, which probably reflect an adaptation for floral phenology and pollination process in this plant. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Floral merosity; Inflorescence structure; Mating system; Pollen-ovule ratio; Pollination; Protandry; Stamen movement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052084393

The risks of relying on a single species are obvious. Other species have been developed for particular crops. Here we present an extension of the framework of Bosch and Kemp (2002) that deals on how to develop a bee species into a crop pollinator. We used nesting aids in different settings to address five important issues that are necessary for an effective management of a bee species in a commercial setting. Our study system was the red mason bee (Osmia bicornis) in apple orchards in eastern Germany, but our approach should be transferable to other settings. The first issue was to demonstrate that it is possible to increase population size of O. bicornis by providing nesting aids. Second, we present how someone can study landscape features that promote the occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis. Further, we studied the dispersal of the species inside the orchard, and could demonstrate that bees prefer to disperse along lines of trees. Finally, we studied the effect of nesting substrate and type of farming on the recruitment of bees. We found a close relationship between the length of nesting tubes and achieved sex ratio and a negative effect of conventional farming on the number of nests built. We conclude with recommendations on how our findings can be used to optimize the management of O. bicornis in apple orchards. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.",Apoidea; Management; Pollination; Solitary bees; Yield increase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054704310

Arabis alpina is currently being developed as a model system for studying the ecological genetics of arcticalpine environments, and is the focus of numerous studies on population structure and alpine phylogeography. Although it is highly inbreeding throughout most of its range, populations in central Italy have been identified that show inbreeding coefficients (FIS) more typical of self-incompatible relatives. The purpose of this study was to establish whether this variation is due to a functioning SI system. MethodsOutcrossing rate estimates were calculated based on 16 allozyme loci and self-compatibility assessed based on controlled pollinations for six Italian populations that have previously been shown to vary in FIS values. Putative SRK alleles (the gene controlling the female component of SI in other Brassicaceae) amplified from A. alpina were compared with those published for other species. Linkage of putative SRK alleles and SI phenotypes was assessed using a diallel cross. Key Results Functional avoidance of inbreeding is demonstrated in three populations of A. alpina, corresponding with previous FIS values. The presence is described of 15 putative SRK-like alleles, which show high sequence identity to known alleles from Brassica and Arabidopsis and the high levels of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation typical of genes under balancing selection. Also, orthologues of two other members of the S-receptor kinase gene family, Aly8 (ARK3) and Aly9 (AtS1) are identified. Further to this, co-segregation between some of the putative S-alleles and compatibility phenotypes was demonstrated using a full-sibling cross design. ConclusionsThe results strongly suggest that, as with other species in the Brassicaceae, A. alpina has a sporophytic SI system but shows variation in the strength of SI within and between populations. © The Author 2011.

So far, current research highlights the importance of artificial light with smaller wavelengths in attracting moths, yet the effect of the spectral composition of artificial light on species richness and abundance of moths has not been studied systematically. Therefore, we tested the hypotheses that (1) higher species richness and higher abundances of moths are attracted to artificial light with smaller wavelengths than to light with larger wavelengths, and (2) this attraction is correlated with morphological characteristics of moths, especially their eye size. We indeed found higher species richness and abundances of moths in traps with lamps that emit light with smaller wavelengths. These lamps attracted moths with on average larger body mass, larger wing dimensions and larger eyes. Cascading effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, e.g. pollination, can be expected when larger moth species are attracted to these lights. Predatory species with a diet of mainly larger moth species and plant species pollinated by larger moth species might then decline. Moreover, our results indicate a size-bias in trapping moths, resulting in an overrepresentation of larger moth species in lamps with small wavelengths. Our study indicates the potential use of lamps with larger wavelengths to effectively reduce the negative effect of light pollution on moth population dynamics and communities where moths play an important role. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Body-size dependent effect; Cascading effects; Ecology of the night; Lepidoptera; Light pollution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960906969

Field pollination data revealed that 'Zaoguan' displayed SC, whereas 'Xinya' and 'Yaqing' showed self-incompatibility (SI) upon self-pollination. Reciprocal pollinations between the varieties showed that most of the 'Zaoguan' flowers pollinated with 'Xinya' or 'Yaqing' pollen set fruits but that few of the 'Xinya' or 'Yaqing' flowers set fruit when pollinated with 'Zaoguan' pollen.

The highest daily pollen concentrations were achieved in the first half of May, and they were caused mainly by Betula and Pinus pollen. The second period of the high concentrations took place from the middle of July to the end of August (mainly Urtica pollen). Tree pollen seasons were shorter (18-24 days) in comparison with the most herbaceous pollen seasons (73-89 days), except at Artemisia and Ambrosia seasons (30 and 24 days, respectively).

Floral structure of relevant taxa was compared using fresh, pickled and herbarium specimens. Our results indicate that a broad concept of Dichromanthus corresponds to a strongly supported monophyletic group sharing several ecogeographical attributes and at least one putative floral synapomorphy (nectary formed by a narrow channel at the base of the labellum). Dichromanthus s.l. occupies a derived position within the Spiranthes clade, with Deiregyne being strongly supported as its sister genus. Stenorrhynchos, as delimited by most previous taxonomists, is shown to be polyphyletic; monophyly requires a narrower delimitation and this narrow concept is strongly supported as belonging in the Stenorrhynchos clade, which also includes members of the genera Eltroplectris, Mesadenella, Pteroglossa and Sacoila. The scant published information on natural pollination and inferences made from flower colouration and morphology suggest convergence in floral characteristics between species of Dichromanthus, Stenorrhynchos and probably other distantly related genera as a result of independent adaptation to pollination by hummingbirds.

Genes (or transgenes) conferring adaptive advantages persist in introgressed populations, enhancing competitiveness of wild or weedy plants. This represents an ecological risk that could increase problems of weed control. Introgression of cultivar alleles into wild plant populations via crop-wild hybridisations is primarily governed by their fitness effect. To evaluate this, we studied the second generation of seven wild-crop interspecific hybrids between weedy Helianthus petiolaris and cultivated sunflower, H. annuus var. macrocarpus. The second generation comprised open-pollinated progeny and backcrosses to the wild parent, mimicking crosses that occur in natural situations. We compared a number of morphological, life history and fitness traits. Multivariate analysis showed that the parental species H. annuus and H. petiolaris differed in a number of morphological traits, while the second hybrid generation between them was intermediate. Sunflower crop introgression lowered fitness of interspecific hybrids, but fitness parameters tended to recover in the following generation. Relative frequency of wild/weedy and introgressed plants was estimated through four generations, based on male and female parent fitness. In spite of several negative selection coefficients observed in the second generation, introgressed plants could be detected in stands of <100 weedy H. petiolaris populations. The rapid recovery of fecundity parameters leads to prediction that any trait conferring an ecological advantage will diffuse into the wild or weedy population, even if F1 hybrids have low fitness. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Backcross; Crop-wild hybridisation; Introgression; Life history; Morphology; Open pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961032232

The degree to which these problems undermine population viability remains debated. We explore genetic and reproductive processes in the critically endangered long-lived tropical tree Medusagyne oppositifolia, an endemic to the Seychelles with a naturally patchy distribution. This species is failing to recruit in three of its four populations. We evaluate whether recruitment failure is linked to genetic problems associated with fragmentation, and if genetic rescue can mitigate such problems. Medusagyne oppositifolia comprises 90 extant trees in four populations, with only the largest (78 trees) having successful recruitment. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we demonstrated that genetic diversity is high (H E: 0.48-0.63; H O: 0.56-0.78) in three populations, with only the smallest population having relatively low diversity (H E: 0.26 and H O: 0.30). All populations have unique alleles, high genetic differentiation, and significant within population structure. Pollen and seed dispersal distances were mostly less than 100 m. Individuals in small populations were more related than individuals in the large population, thus inbreeding might explain recruitment failure in small populations. Indeed, inter-population pollination crosses from the large donor population to a small recipient population resulted in higher reproductive success relative to within-population crosses. Our study highlights the importance of maintaining gene flow between populations even in species that have naturally patchy distributions. We demonstrate the potential for genetic and ecological rescue to support conservation of plant species with limited gene flow. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",artificial cross-pollinations; genetic rescue; Medusagyne oppositifolia; microsatellites; seychelles; spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052517342

In principle, lower seed production could lead to an Allee effect (a decline in the population growth rate with declining density), which, if severe, could cause the population to decline to extinction when recruitment is insufficient to replace dying individuals. 2.However, plants at low density may also grow or survive better than those at high densities, due to release from intraspecific competition. Few studies have examined the combined effects on plant population dynamics of positive density dependence in fecundity and negative density dependence in survival or growth. 3.To do so, we parameterized a density-dependent population projection matrix model for Piriqueta caroliniana, a widespread sandhill plant that often occurs at low density, using data from a demographic study of natural populations and from field experiments testing for effects of density on fecundity, growth and survival. We then tested for an Allee effect when various combinations of positive and negative density dependence are included in the model. 4.The model exhibits an Allee effect when only positive density dependence in fecundity is included, but when negative density dependence in survival is added, the Allee effect disappears. Thus the increase in survival as density declines overwhelms the effect of declining fecundity on the population growth rate. This occurs because survival has a greater influence on the population growth rate than fecundity (as measured by vital rate elasticities), increasingly so as density declines. 5.Synthesis. Our results caution against considering only declining fecundity at low density. We show that survival may increase at low densities, and will often have stronger effects on population growth than does fecundity, especially for perennial plants. Of course, reproductive failure and population collapse must eventually occur as the density of any non-selfing species approaches zero, or if pollinator abundance falls to low levels. © 2011 The Authors.

Advances in insect transgenesis are making it increasingly feasible to engineer genes conferring desirable phenotypes, and gene drive systems are required to spread these genes into wild populations. Medea provides one solution, being able to spread into a population from very low initial frequencies through the action of a maternally-expressed toxin linked to a zygotically-expressed antidote. Several other toxin-antidote combinations are imaginable that distort the offspring ratio in favor of a desired transgene, or drive the population towards an all-male crash.

Plants belonging to a single wild species of the Brassica oleracea group are largely used by songbirds for nectar feeding at Ventotene island and their pollen is commonly found on staging warblers. We studied the potential role of nectar feeding warblers in pollen dispersion of Brassica plants and compared it to that of insects. The study was carried out at Ventotene from the end of March to mid May during the years 2008 and 2009. Direct observations of bird and insect visits to plants showed that the frequency of bird visits was significantly higher than the frequency of flight-feeding insects, while no significant differences were found between the length of bird and insect visits. Plant caging with a 15 mm-mesh net in order to prevent bird visits, but not insect visits, resulted in a significant lowering of fruit production with respect to control plants. In summary, a mutualistic relationship could be hypothesised between songbirds and Brassica plants on Ventotene Island.

It is often accompanied by characteristic morphological and functional changes to the flowers (the selfing syndrome), including reduced flower size and opening. Little is known about the developmental and genetic basis of the selfing syndrome, as well as its adaptive significance. Here, we address these issues using the two closely related species Capsella grandiflora (the ancestral outbreeder) and red shepherd's purse (Capsella rubella, the derived selfer). In C. rubella, petal size has been decreased by shortening the period of proliferative growth. Using interspecific recombinant inbred lines, we show that differences in petal size and flower opening between the two species each have a complex genetic basis involving allelic differences at multiple loci. An intraspecific cross within C. rubella suggests that flower size and opening have been decreased in the C. rubella lineage before its extensive geographical spread. Lastly, by generating plants that likely resemble the earliest ancestors of the C. rubella lineage, we provide evidence that evolution of the selfing syndrome was at least partly driven by selection for efficient self-pollination.

One mechanism that could contribute to the maintenance of mixed mating in cleistogamous species is the ability to invest in the appropriate type of reproduction (outcrossing vs. selfing) for a given pollination environment. We tested whether Collomia grandiflora plants responded to pollen limitation by plastically shifting relative investment in cleistogamous (obligately self-fertilizing) versus chasmogamous (potentially outcrossing) reproduction. We estimated reproductive effort (seed production) for chasmogamous and cleistogamous reproductive modes in hand-pollinated and unpollinated plants. We also investigated whether plastic responses to pollen limitation could be constrained by water availability or early nutrient fertilization. Pollen limitation significantly increased cleistogamous reproductive effort, and responses were consistent across gradients of water availability and soil fertility. Our results suggest that dimorphic cleistogamy can provide more than a fixed level of reproductive assurance, as plasticity in allocation to cleistogamy versus chasmogamy can simultaneously enable outcrossing when pollinators are abundant and increase selfing when pollinators are scarce.We argue that such plasticity could be a factor in the evolutionary maintenance of mixed mating in cleistogamous plants. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Here we report an extensive study of the relationships among dichogamy, floral sex allocation (pollen-to-ovule ratios), nectar production, floral visitors, mating system, and fruit set in natural populations of Schefflera heptaphylla, a widespread paleotropical secondary forest tree that produces thousands of flowers in a blooming season. Each tree produces 15-30 sequentially blooming, paniculate, compound inflorescences. Each compound inflorescence has up to three orders of umbellets, which also bloom sequentially. While hand-pollinations showed that S. heptaphylla was capable of self-fertilization, our observations of thousands of flowers showed that strong intra- and interfloral protandry severely restricts both autogamous and geitonogamous self-pollination. All flowers were bisexual, thus the sexual system of the populations we studied was hermaphroditism. The pollen-to-ovule (P/O) ratios were characteristic of outcrossing species, and P/O ratios of flowers in the last-maturing (third order) umbellets were significantly higher than those in earlier-maturing (first and second order) umbellets. Floral visitors were primarily flies (Chrysomya sp. and Syrphinae sp.) and wasps (Vespula sp. and Eumenes sp.). Flowers produced nectar during both the male (pollen presentation) and female (stigma receptivity) stages of their development, and the volume of nectar production was higher in the female stage. Nevertheless, flowers received fewer visits in the female stage than they did in the male stage, and natural fruit set was low, especially in first and third order umbellets. Fruit set from hand cross- and self-pollinations was significantly higher than natural fruit set, indicating pollen limitation of fruit set. Schefflera heptaphylla has also been reported to be andromonoecious. Both hermaphroditism and andromonoecy are consistent with theoretical predictions for variation in sex allocation among sequentially maturing flowers in protandrous species. Further studies comparing hermaphroditic and andromonoecious populations of S. heptaphylla could elucidate the selective factors affecting sex expression, nectar production, and fruit set in species with numerous flowers displaying both intra- and interfloral dichogamy. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Araliaceae; Dichogamy; Hermaphroditism; P/O ratios; Phenology; Protandry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051950950

The character count procedure of the variable characters show that Longianthera populations are characteristic of the intermediate morphological traits between its putative parents Yanshan and Petrocosmea martinii. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region and three chloroplast regions of matK, trnL-F, and trnT-L are sequenced in the putative hybrid and the related species. Both alignment of DNA sequences and the phylogenetic trees could exclude all the other species in Petrocosmea as the parental species except for Yanshan and P. martinii. Eight haplotypes in the 31 internal transcribed spacer sequences and six haplotypes in 42 cpDNA sequences were found from 14 individuals of Longianthera populations. The analyses of DNA sequences, haplotypes, and phylogenetic trees indicate that Longianthera is likely a hybrid species between its putative parents Yanshan and P. martinii, in which Yanshan might be the most possible maternal parent. Several factors may contribute to the natural hybridization between these two parental species in Petrocosmea, such as the overlapped geographic distribution, habitats, flowering periods, and shared pollinators. Finally, the new species of Yanshan and the natural hybrid species of Longianthera are described. © 2011 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",Chloroplast DNA; Gesneriaceae; ITS; Morphology; Natural hybridization; Petrocosmea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83655190370

Talesh hills, located in Guilan province in northern part of Iran, are one of the main areas for natural distribution of hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.). Hazelnut trees in Talesh Mountains are a wild population (land race) and obtained from open-pollinated seedling. In this research, a population including 90 hazelnut samples was studied using 15 microsatellite markers. Totally, 98 polymorphic alleles were detected with an average of 6.53 alleles per locus. The lowest numbers of 3 alleles were observed in CaC-B005 and CaC-C114 and the highest number of 12 alleles in CaC-C101 locus. The average effective number of alleles (3.75), mean expected heterozygosity of (He=0.70) and average observed heterozygosity of (Ho=0.62) were estimated for studied loci. All loci showed high PIC with an average of 0.72 that the highest amount detected in CaC-B011 and CaC-B101 loci with values of 0.85 and 0.84, respectively. A dendrogram was generated by UPGMA clustering method that placed the 90 accessions into 7 main loose groups.

Pollinator preferences may exert direct selection on floral color; however, floral color might also be the indirect target of selection through genetic associations with other traits under selection. Malva moschata (Malvaceae) is a North American species that produces either red or white flowers. In the present study, we present reflectance spectrophotometry data that characterize the nature of floral color variation in this species and show that honey bees and bumble bees should be able to distinguish between the morphs through differential sensitivity at the green (long-wavelength) photoreceptor. Second, we use a series of phenotypic measures to investigate whether the color morphs differ with respect to other floral traits, vegetative traits or female reproductive success, and use a series of correlation analyses to infer the relative independence of color from these other traits. We found that red-flowered morphs produced more anthers per flower and had greater leaf area, and that white-flowered morphs had greater percentage fruit set; however, there were no reproductive success differences between the morphs. The relationship between flower size and anther number was the only correlation that differed between the morphs. Finally, a series of pollinator-choice experiments showed that bumble bees strongly prefer red morphs in terms of visit frequency and duration, but honey bees have no preference. Taken together, our results suggest that color is rather independent of other phenotypic traits, and that honey bee abundance is likely to play a role in maintaining color variation in this system. © 2011 The Authors.

Bi-directional consumer-resource (C-R) interactions have been the object of recent theory. In these interactions, each species acts, in some respects, as both a consumer and a resource of the other, which is the basis of many mutualisms. In uni-directional C-R interactions between two species, one acts as a consumer and the other as a material and/or energy resource, while neither acts as both. The relationship between insect pollinator/seed parasites and the host plant is an example of the latter interaction type of C-R, as the insect provides no material resource to the plant (though it provides a pollination service). In this paper we consider a different variation of the uni-directional C-R interaction, in which the resource species has both positive and negative effects on the consumer species, while the consumer has only a negative effect on the resource. A predator-prey system in which the prey is able to kill or consume predator eggs or larvae is an example. Our aim is to demonstrate mechanisms by which interaction outcomes of this system vary with different conditions, and thus to extend the uni-directional C-R theory established by Holland and DeAngelis (2009). By the analysis of a specific two-species system, it is shown that there is no periodic solution of the system, and the parameter (factor) space can be divided into six regions, which correspond to predation/parasitism, amensalism, and competition. The interaction outcomes of the system transition smoothly when the parameters are changed continuously in the six regions and/or initial densities of the species vary in a smooth fashion. Varying a pair of parameters can also result in the transitions. The analysis leads to both conditions under which the species approach their maximal densities, and explanations for phenomena in experiments by Urabe and Sterner (1996). © 2011 .",Amensalism; Competition; Population dynamics; Predation/parasitism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960747376

Their internal relationships and sister group affinities have not been studied with DNA methods. We used partial gene sequences for 28S rRNA, cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) and 16S rRNA (rrnL) for 158 species, representing most recognized subfamilies of Scarabaeidae, including 46 species of Hopliini. Combined analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference under the two preferred alignment parameters recovered the Hopliini as monophyletic. Hopliines were inserted at the base of a clade of Cetoniinae. +. Rutelinae. +. Dynastinae, being either recovered as their immediate sister group, or as part of an expanded set of basal branches that also includes the tribe Macrodactylini which has been classified as part of the Melolonthinae (may chafers). At the level of subtribes, we found Hopliina paraphyletic with respect to Pachycnemina which also includes the monophyletic clade of Heterochelina and Gymnolomina. Trait mapping under parsimony on the preferred tree resulted in inferences of three independent origins of sexual dimorphism, which coincided with shifts to 'flower-embedding' pollination. In contrast, night active taxa, which are general phyllophages as other pleurostict chafers, never show clear sexual dimorphism. South African lineages include several deep-branching lineages. The exceptional morphological and phylogenetic diversity of the South African fauna may therefore be due to their antiquity, in addition to sexual selection in the day-active lineages. Phylogenetic studies of the endemic South African plant radiations have demonstrated the repeated evolutionary shift to beetle pollination, but it remains to be investigated if this is driven by the hopliine pollinators present in the bioregion or by a propensity of the local plant lineages favoring this pollination syndrome. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Activity patterns; Classification; Melolonthinae; Scarabaeidae; Sexual dimorphism; Species diversification,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959658969

The number of flowers was estimated for each plant. The volume and concentration of nectar were measured for a sample of flowers of each species, and the data were used to estimate the caloric content available per flower and the general resource availability in the area throughout the study period. Focal observations of hummingbird visits were carried out on blooming individuals of all plant species. Hummingbird flowers occurred throughout the study period between January 2001 and June 2003. Only three of the studied plants did not present clear ornithophilous features. Six hummingbird species were recorded in the area, but total nectar availability in the area was seldom sufficient for the daily energy requirements of a single bird. Therefore, it can be inferred from the study that these hummingbirds need to move among the mosaic of different plant physiognomies in the region in order to obtain enough energy for their survival. These movements may also contribute to increasing gene flow and regeneration of plant populations isolated in forest patches as the one studied here. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Carrying capacity; Cerrado; Energy supply; Hummingbird-pollinated flowers; Nectar; Ornithophilous species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052415021

In this work, the effect of soil solarization on the growth and duration of the JP of olive seedlings was studied. Seedlings obtained fromopen pollination of 'Manzanilla de Sevilla' and from crosses between 'Arbequina' × 'Arbosana' and 'Picual' × 'Koroneiki' were tested. Solarization treatment consisted on covering the soil around the trees for 3 years by black plastic film in a split-plot design with the three progenies as the main factor and solarization/not solarization as the secondary factor. Solarization resulted in both higher soil temperature and soil moisture in solarized plots with respect to non-solarized. Significant differences between crosses were found for plant vigor and flowering measurements throughout the experiment. Soil solarization increased trunk diameter and the number of seedlings reaching AP in 'Manzanilla' open progeny. A positive effect of solarization on flowering index was also observed in 'Picual' × 'Koroneiki' progenies. These results suggest that soil solarization may be recommended as a tool for shortening the duration of the JP and thus accelerating the selection process in olive breeding programs.",Breeding; Flowering; Olea Europaea; Olive seedlings,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052754651

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to abiotic and biotic factors, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2.Pseudorchis albida is a native British herb growing in several plant communities of semi-natural habitats, typically in recently burned heather moorlands, upland well-drained pastures and meadows, and cliff ledges. Although the species is able to tolerate a wide range of ecological conditions from mildly acid to base-rich soils, it is limited mainly to open, short and nutrient-poor stands. Typical British plant communities include Calluna vulgaris heathlands, Anthoxanthum odoratum - Geranium sylvaticum hay meadows, and Nardus grasslands. The species often grows in transitions from heath to grass-dominated communities. The ecology of P. albida in the northern acidic environments is poorly understood. 3.Pseudorchis albida is a perennial geophyte whose populations are maintained predominantly by sexual reproduction, as vegetative spread is limited. The main perennating organ is a highly divided root tuber, which is completely replaced every year. Dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed and typically lasts for one, sometimes 2years. The adventitious roots and distal parts of the root tuber are colonized by basidiomycetes from the family Tulasnellaceae. 4.The species is pollinated by crepuscular pyralid and pterophorid moths, most likely attracted by the sweet scent. During the day, pollinia can be also transferred by dance flies (Empididae). The breeding system of P. albida is poorly known but high fruit set, often over 90%, raises the possibility of spontaneous autogamy, particularly in arctic-alpine areas. The probability of flowering in consecutive years in P. albida is strongly influenced by cost of flowering and fruiting. 5.Pseudorchis albida has suffered a significant decline in distribution in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, it has been lost from more than 65% of its historical sites, particularly in lowland areas. The main causal factors are the cessation of traditional agricultural practices, habitat fragmentation and disturbance associated with housing and road construction, and agricultural improvement, including reclamation, fertilization and overgrazing. Conservation of remnant populations primarily depends on the maintenance of a short turf by extensive grazing, controlled burning and shrub cutting to promote flowering of adult plants and seedling recruitment. © 2011 The Authors.

Nevertheless, its increasing cultivation in Latin America is harmed by the ""lethal yellowing"". Genetic resistance to this anomaly can be found in the germplasm of American oil palm or caiaué (E. oleifera), a native species from the Amazon rainforest. However, the procedures adopted to induce seeds of E. guineensis to germination frequently result mild for interespecific hybrids. Embryo in vitro cultivation can be a viable option. This work was aimed initially to test liquid MS medium supplemented with different glucose or sucrose concentrations for the in vitro cultivation of zygotic embryos from E. guineensis x E. oleifera controlled pollinations. Additionally we investigated different compost mixtures to acclimatize the regenerated hybrid plantlets. Concentrations of 10, 20 and 30g/L of both sugars were tested on flasks containing five mature zygotic embryos, with 15 repetitions per treatment in a total of 450 explants. The number of embryos displaying shoots and radicles at least 2mm in length per experimental unit was evaluated during phase one of in vitro cultivation. Plantlets displaying hoots and radicles were transferred to phase two of in vitro cultivation and subsequently to acclimatization, under 70% shading with manual water supply. The experiments of acclimatization were conducted with 130 plantlets randomly distributed in pure horticultural compost, 3:1 or 1:1 compost:sand mixtures and each plantlet was defined as an experimental unit. Data were submitted to ANOVA, t test and analyzes of correlation (p?0.05). Highest emergence rates were 97% for shoots and 73% for radicles, observed in MS medium supplemented with 20g/L (110mM) of glucose. This sugar in concentrations of 20 or 30g/L provided balanced shoot/root development, and this was considered one of the reasons for the higher frequency of plantlet establishment. The survival percentage was 55% after the first 43 days of acclimatization and by the fourth month, 66 plants developed simultaneously longer shoot and root systems in pure horticultural compost. In conclusion, radicle development was an impairment to plantlet establishment and was overcame under media with glucose above 110mM. Acclimatization could benefit from an extended period of in vitro development.",Amazon flora; Caiaué; Dendê; Embryo culture; Oil plants; Palms; Plant breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959230060

FCA interacts with FY to auto-regulate its own transcripts as well as to control flowering by downregulating flowering locus C (FLC). We report the cloning and characterization of the gamma (?) isoform of FCA from barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. McLeod). The deduced protein contained two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a glycine-rich region at the N-terminal end, a polyglutamine region immediately downstream of a WW domain. Barley FCA had greater protein sequence homology to wheat and rice FCA than to its Arabidopsis homolog. In developing barley embryos, FCA transcripts could be detected from 2 days after pollination (DAP) up to 40 DAP. FCA transcript levels in mature barley embryo were more abundant in non-germinated than in germinated seeds, with the levels declining as germination progressed. ABA inhibition of germination inhibited the decline of barley embryo FCA. Transient co-expression of FCA or a truncated FCA (lacking RRM) with maize VP1 promoter or wheat Em gene promoter in barley aleurone protoplasts led to increased VP1 and Em gene promoter activity.

The diurnal Macroglossum stellatarum is a closely related hawkmoth challenged with the same task but under illuminances 6-8 orders of magnitude higher. Here, we use flower models presenting color markings, 3D features, or both to study innate flower movements and sensory cues involved in the innate inspection behavior of M. stellatarum. On flat plain colored models, moths scanned the whole corolla with their proboscis, attaining intermediate success levels. When models presented color markings, moths biased proboscis placement, which affected inspection efficiency. Three-dimensional features affected inspection behavior and efficiency, by provoking strong ""diving"" responses. When both visual and tactile features were present, visual cues showed prevalence in the control of the inspection behavior. We evaluated learning abilities of moths, finding that M. stellatarum cannot only improve their efficiency by calibrating innate responses but also by changing their innate strategy. We discuss results on flower inspection behavior of M. stellatarum comparatively with known aspects of this behavior in M. sexta. Motor responses appear to be shared by these hawkmoths, but their sensory control shows important differences. Future studies will evaluate whether these differences are the result of an evolutionary divergence of their innate behavior associated with a switch to diurnal activity or the result of a flexible use of sensory information by the naïve animals. © 2011 The Author.",flower inspection; Lepidoptera; nectar guides; pollination; sensory ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052204535

However, Podostemaceae is considered an exception with the presence of only single fertilization (syngamy) though two male gametes are formed conventionally. To determine the cause for the failure of double fertilization in Dalzellia zeylanica (Gardn.) Wight, we closely tracked the movement of the male gametes from the time of pollen tube initiation to the time of entry into the megagametophyte to affect fertilization. We report for the first time, the presence of a novel type of three-nucleate/three-celled mature megagametophyte consisting of two synergids and an egg cell in D. zeylanica. Therefore, of the two male gametes formed in this plant, one fuses with the egg cell resulting in syngamy, whereas the other male gamete eventually degenerates due to the absence of its partner i. e. single polar nucleus of the central cell that degenerates prior to the entry of the pollen tube into the synergid. The present work not only highlights the highly reduced nature of megagametophyte but also the occurrence of single fertilization resulting in sperm selection in D. zeylanica. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Aquatic angiosperm; Male gametes; Megagametogenesis; Pollination; Single fertilization; Three-celled megagametophyte,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051672580

However, what we currently know about seed dispersal networks is based only on birds. Therefore, we wished to fill this gap by studying bat-fruit networks and testing how they differ from bird-fruit networks. As dietary overlap of Neotropical bats and birds is low, they should form distinct mutualistic modules within local networks. Furthermore, since frugivory evolved only once among Neotropical bats, but several times independently among Neotropical birds, greater dietary overlap is expected among bats, and thus connectance and nestedness should be higher in bat-fruit networks. If bat-fruit networks have higher nestedness and connectance, they should be more robust to extinctions. We analyzed 1 mixed network of both bats and birds and 20 networks that consisted exclusively of either bats (11) or birds (9). As expected, the structure of the mixed network was both modular (M = 0.45) and nested (NODF = 0.31); one module contained only birds and two only bats. In 20 datasets with only one disperser group, bat-fruit networks (NODF = 0.53 ± 0.09, C = 0.30 ± 0.11) were more nested and had a higher connectance than bird-fruit networks (NODF = 0.42 ± 0.07, C = 0.22 ± 0.09). Unexpectedly, robustness to extinction of animal species was higher in bird-fruit networks (R = 0.60 ± 0.13) than in bat-fruit networks (R = 0.54 ± 0.09), and differences were explained mainly by species richness. These findings suggest that a modular structure also occurs in seed dispersal networks, similar to pollination networks. The higher nestedness and connectance observed in bat-fruit networks compared with bird-fruit networks may be explained by the monophyletic evolution of frugivory in Neotropical bats, among which the diets of specialists seem to have evolved from the pool of fruits consumed by generalists. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Complex networks; Ecosystem services; Food webs; Guilds; Mutualisms,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051668576

There may be positive and negative effects of crossing individuals in fragmented populations. Conservation strategies may include introducing new genetic material into rare plant populations, which may be beneficial or detrimental based on whether hybrid offspring are of increased or decreased quality. Thus, it is important to determine the effects of pollen source on offspring fitness in rare plants. We established pollen crosses (i.e. geitonogamous-self, autonomous-self, intrasite-outcross, intersite-outcross and open-pollinated controls) to determine the effects of pollen source on fitness (seeds/fruit and seed mass) and early offspring traits (probability of germination, number of leaves, leaf area and seedling height) in the rare plant Polemonium vanbruntiae. Open-pollinated, intrasite-outcross and geitonogamous-self treatments did not differ in fitness. However, plants receiving autonomous-self pollen had the lowest fitness and the lowest probability of seed germination. Intersite-outcross plants contained fewer seeds/fruit, but seeds germinated at higher frequencies and seedlings were more vigorous. We also detected heterosis at the seed germination stage. These data may imply that natural populations of P. vanbruntiae exhibit low genetic variation and little gene flow. Evidence suggests that deleterious alleles were not responsible for reduced germination; rather environmental factors, dichogamy, herkogamy and/or lack of competition among pollen grains may have caused low germinability in selfed offspring. Although self-pollination may provide some reproductive assurance in P. vanbruntiae, the result is a reduction in germination and size-related early traits for selfed offspring. © 2011 The Authors.

To test this hypothesis, we identified parents of 184 seedlings in a local population within a metapopulation of a hermaphroditic, insect-pollinated tree species, Magnolia stellata (Siebold & Zucc.) Maxim., using 14 nuclear and 3 chloroplast microsatellite markers. Parent pairs of all the seedlings were determined, and both seed and pollen parents could be distinguished for 49.5% of the seedlings. We also measured the parents' plant size (diameter at breast height of the thickest ramet within each genet; DBHt) and the relative photosynthetic photon flux density (rPPFD) they received. The proportion of seedlings that originated from selfing was 20.7%. The number of seedlings parental trees produced as seed parents (S) was positively affected by DBHt and rPPFD. DBHt (but not rPPFD) also positively affected the number of seedlings sired as pollen parents (P). The femaleness of the parental trees (S/(S + P)) was positively affected by DBHt, probably because DBHt had a stronger effect on the trees' reproductive success as seed parents than on their success as pollen parents.

F1 plants of 3 cross combinations between the dwarf mutant and several representative wild-type plants, Erimo-shouzu, V. angularis accession Acc2265 and wild relative V. riukiuensis accession Acc2482, supported the dwarf genotype being recessive. In a total of 3328 F2 progeny of these 3 crosses, 65 dwarfs (2.0%) and 5 chimeric dwarfs (0.2%) segregated and the remainder were wild-type plants (97.8%). In F3 progeny derived from self-pollinated dwarf F2 plants, we observed wild type (54.3%), dwarf (39.1%), and chimeric dwarf (6.5%) plants. Two types of chimeric plants were observed: dwarf branches on the axils of wild-type plant stems and wild-type branches on the axils of dwarf stems. In 21 dwarf F2 plants, the dwarf trait cosegregated with simple sequence repeat marker CEDG154 on chromosome 4. Conversely, homozygote F2 plants at this chromosomal segment from the dwarf mutant frequently (>90%) expressed the wild-type phenotype.

Marker-based approaches have received attention because they can potentially be applied directly to wild populations. For long-lived, self-compatible plant species where pedigrees are inadequate, the regression-based method proposed by Ritland has the appeal of estimating heritabilities from marker-based estimates of relatedness. The method has been difficult to implement in some plant populations, however, because it requires significant variance in relatedness across the population. Here, we show that the method can be readily applied to compare the ability of different traits to respond to selection, within populations. For several taxa of the perennial herb genus Aquilegia, we estimated heritabilities of floral and vegetative traits and, combined with estimates of natural selection, compared the ability to respond to selection of both types of traits under current conditions. The intra-population comparisons showed that vegetative traits have a higher potential for evolution, because although they are as heritable as floral traits, selection on them is stronger. These patterns of potential evolution are consistent with macroevolutionary trends in the European lineage of the genus. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",columbine; evolvability; heritability; microsatellites; pollinators; relatedness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052087874

The Sri Lankan tea germplasm was characterized based on reproductive traits viz. floral morphology, pollen biology, stigma receptivity and phenology of flowering and fruit set. The variability in floral morphology, especially the style morphological features, formed phenotypic clines rather than distinct groups. Studies on pollen biology and stigma receptivity revealed significant variability and asynchrony that could result unequal reproductive success among the genotypes. Four distinct patterns were predictable among the genotypes based on flower and fruit abundance and the time of flowering and fruit set. Three well marked flowering periods occurred in February to April, July and in November. Nonetheless, major flowering period coincided February and March in all the genotypes allowing free crossing between the different genotypes. Profuse mature fruit crop was obtained in February to May. Approximately 26% success was achieved in tea controlled hybridization programmes. Fruits carry two seeds on average and became mature in 8-9 months after pollination. Zygotic development in tea takes more than 1 month after pollination and early embryonic development continued for 4 months after pollination.

Wilczek) is a self-pollinating crop that displays significant hybrid vigor in seed yield of F 1 hybrids. Thus there is the possibility to use hybrid varieties as a breakthrough to raise the yield plateau of mungbean. However, hybrid mungbean seeds can only be accomplished by hand-pollination and thus commercial production is not possible. To encourage hybrid seed set, the plant breeder needs to develop characters that promote higher outcrossing rate such as open flower (chasmogamy). In this experiment, new chasmogamous mutants were induced by gamma irradiation at the rate of 100 and 200 Gy. The mutants were identified at a low rate of 0. 4-0. 7% in the M 2 generation of accession V1197, and observed for their purity by growing in plant-to-row in the M 3 and M 4 generations. A uniform chasmogamous line was hybridized to normal flower lines to study the inheritance of this character. All F 1 plants had normal flowers, while the F 2 plants segregated well with 3 normal:1 chasmogamous ratio. When the F 1 was backcrossed to the chasmogamous parent, the progeny gave a ratio of 1 normal to 1 chasmogamous.

The possibility of advancing, depend on the forage quality when harvested at early growth stages and the method used to preserve it. The objective of this study was to evaluate the productivity and nutritive value of pearl millet harvested at four different stages of maturity for Silage (S) and Hay (H) methods of conservation. A randomized complete block design with five replications in a split plot outline was used for the methods of forage conservation. The open pollinated variety ICMV-221 was used. The ages of maturity at harvest were: Boot stage (B), female Flowering (F), Milk stage (M) and Dough stage (D). The production of total Dry Matter (DM ha-1) increased with maturity (p&lt;0.002). In contrast, DM from re-growth was higher (p&lt;0.0001) when forage was cut at B stage. This led to the total DM ha-1 resulted similar throughout four stages of maturity. During haymaking, there was a loss of grain by fauna which affected most of the variables studied. Protein Content (PC) varied (p&lt;0.01 ) from 6.93-11.35% with lowest values during M and D hay stages. The highest NDF, ADF and lignin content were observed during M and D hay stages. Apparent digestibility of dry matter was higher in silage than hay. Age of cutting only affected the digestibility of hay. It was concluded that the stage of maturity of pearl millet did not affect the quality of silage showing silage generally better nutritional value than hay. The loss of grain of haymaking in this study indicates that in the presence of fauna (lagomorphs, rodents and birds), pearl millet is adequate for haying only at booting and flowering stages. Re-growths were stronger in booting, compensating lower production of dry matter from the main stem during early cuttings. © Medwell Journals, 2011.",Birds; Forage; Lagomorphs; Maturity stages; Nutritive value; Pearl millet,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052083848

Hence, foundresses need to ensure that they choose the most suitable syconium. In three fig-wasp associations, we analysed if foundresses could indeed discriminate among syconia of different resource levels. In Ficus benghalensis, F. microcarpa and F. racemosa, the foundress wasps could easily discriminate between the empty and wasp-laden syconia and preferred to enter the former than the latter. Further, in two of these species (F. benghalensis and F. microcarpa), the speciesspecific foundresses were also capable of quantitatively assessing loads of the foundresses in the syconia on the basis of wings left behind at and around the ostiole. The wings load on the ostiole was strongly correlated to the foundresses loads. Foundresses preferred entering those syconia from which the wings were removed to those on which the wings were retained. The extent to which the foundresses preferred to enter the syconia was found to be influenced by the density of wings at and around the ostiole. Adding wings artificially to the empty syconia also deterred the foundresses from entering them, suggesting that these residual wings serve as negative feedback regulators for the preference and entry of foundresses. Thus, we show that pollinator wasps of fig-wasp associations choose the most suitable syconia to enter as long as they have opportunity.",Ficus; Fig-wasps; Foundress; Optimization; Syconia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053613800

Transferring these favorable genes from wild species to commercial cultivars of cotton by the traditional methods or classical plant breeding procedure will be very difficult and impossible. This is due to the following: Confronting disordering in flower structure, the problems involved in cotton flower pollens germination in stigma level and destruction of embryo and endosperm in different stages of evolution. The first sign of these problems is the falling of ovary. Therefore, the first and important barrier in crossing between diploid and tetraploid cotton species is the inability of hybrid seeds to produce. Solving of these problems can be the first step in hybridizations programs. The artificial control of fertilization by the gibberellic acid (GA 3) after crossing and hybrid embryo culture in the media will increase probability of hybrid plants production. In this study, three species named Sahel (tetraploid), Hashemabad (diploid) and Kashmar (diploid) were used. The parental species were planted on six plots and crosses were made between them. It must be noticed that we used Sahel species as paternal and the two diploid species as maternal species. As the study continues, two investigations were separately done on hybrids. Firstly, it consisted of using different amount of Gibberellic acid after pollination for the maintenance of bolls and secondly, 45 days embryos of all the crosses combined were cultured on liquid and solid M.S media. The results show that when hormone was not used, the amount of bolls that fell was 100%, but when Gibberellic acid was applied at 100ppm concentration, there was considerable differentiation in maintenance of bolls. The Hashemabad cultivar created bolls more than Kashmar but the percentage of seeds inside the bolls was so lower than Kashmar cultivar. In comparison between parents used and their hybrids, the latter's response was better. Also among the different media culture, it is seen that the growth of mature embryo in the liquid media was better than solid. © 2011 Academic Journals.",Cotton; Diploid species; Hybrid; Media culture; Tetraploid species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052143132

Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural sites across a UK city. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable. © 2011 Bates et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051603390

It occupies more than 27% of the total cropped area of the province, however, with a very low yield as compared to the achievable potential of 10 t ha -1. Such a low average yield is primarily due to a widespread use of low-yielding open-pollinated maize cultivars by farmers in different areas of the province. In the year 2000, Hybrid-oriented maize breeding research work for the development of indigenous maize hybrids was initiated at the cereal crops research institute (CCRI), Pirsabak, Nowshera, Pakistan. The main objective was to evolve single-cross maize hybrids of high yield potential, white kernel and low to medium maturity for the environments of Khyber Pakhtoonkhua province. A large number of replicated field experiments, both on-station and on-farm, were carried out in 2005 and 2006 to evaluate the experimental hybrids. Grain yield, Stover yield, and maturity were among the important traits used in these investigations. A highest grain yield of 9.84 t ha -1, and a Stover yield of 30.56 t ha -1, with maturity earlier than other hybrids, including a leading maize hybrid of private sector (Pioneer-3025) were observed for one of the experimental hybrids, FRW-2 x FRW-8.

Estimated probability density functions (PDFs) of settling velocity based on experimental measurements show strong variation between early morning and noon. The variation is correlated to the time-integrated vapor pressure deficit (VPDT) and reflects the drying of pollen grains. A model for the decrease in germination rate of pollen grains exposed to atmospheric conditions suggests that the decrease in settling velocity is accompanied by a decrease in pollen viability. A simple dispersion model is used to illustrate the possible consequences of changes in settling velocity and germination rate for pollen dispersal and cross-pollination of maize.

Furthermore, deployment of more or less genetically homogeneous individuals could impact stand uniformity and ecosystem processes. In this study, we aimed to compare stand uniformity and above- and belowground dry mass production among loblolly pine genotypes of contrasting inherent genetic homogeneity. We hypothesized that stand-level uniformity would increase as within-genotype inherent genetic variation decreased (open-pollinated (half-sib)&gt;full-sib&gt;clone). To examine genetic effects on stand uniformity and productivity, we grew ten different genotypes (three open-pollinated families, three full-sib families, three clones, and one seed orchard mix variety) in a plantation setting for 4years, at two different planting densities (?539 and 1077treesha-1), and used allometric relationships to estimate standing dry mass and annual dry mass production. In the low planting density treatment, age 3 total standing dry mass of the most productive genotype (5824kgha-1) was 82% higher than that of the least productive genotype (3207kgha-1). In the high planting density treatment, age 3 total standing dry mass of the most productive genotype (11,393kgha-1) was 110% higher than that of the least productive genotype (5427kgha-1). Genetic differences in annual dry mass production were of a similar magnitude with peak rates during the third year as high as 4221 and 8198kgha-1yr-1 in the low and high planting density treatments, respectively. More genetically homogeneous genotypes did not show greater stand-level uniformity under operational management conditions. Over time, genotypes showed no consistent differences in the coefficient of variation (CV) for ground-level diameter; however, two full-sib and two half-sib families showed significantly lower CV's for total tree height than all three clones. Moreover, genotypes with lower CV's for height growth displayed greater stand-level dry mass production which supports the premise that greater stand uniformity will lead to enhanced productivity. Since uniformity and stand-level productivity of loblolly pine clones will be principally governed by environmental heterogeneity, our results highlight the need for silvicultural prescriptions that maximize site uniformity. In addition, our results demonstrate how the deployment of highly productive loblolly pine genotypes may provide a means of enhancing southern pine ecosystem sustainability by sequestering C in both harvestable aboveground biomass and woody belowground biomass. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Dry mass production; Genetic variation; Pinus taeda L. clone; Stand uniformity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957911857

Effect of different growth regulators, culture media, ovule age, cultivars and mycorrhizal strains on successful in-ovulo embryo rescue were studied in this experiment. With respect to mean ovule age (days after pollination), maximum ovule-embryo growth (2.13 mm 2) were obtained when ovules were cultured at 24 days after pollination (DAP) but maximum germination (12.67%) was obtained when ovules were cultured at 28 DAP. The concentration of IAA (4 mg) + GA3 (0.5 mg) proved to be most effective for germination (13.84%). Among various media used for culturing ovules on modified MS medium (1/2 macro +1/1 micro) required minimum days to germinate (96.67) and registered highest germination (13.75%). Chilling treatment was proved to be one of the important factors for embryo maturation and 60 d of chilling treatment at 4 °C improved embryo germination. With respect to the effect of different growth regulators on various rooting and shooting parameters IBA (1.0 mg L -1) and NAA (1.5 mg-L -1) were found superior. While comparing different hardening strategies, a glass jar with polypropylene cap (GPP) was found to be most effective as far as hardening success (66.67%) was concerned. One of the serious impediments in the success of in vitro rescued plantlets is very high field mortality, field survival of rescued plantlets can be effectively increased by using different mycorrhizal strains (AMF) as bio-hardening agents.

It is now recognized that tolerance to salinity is genetically and physiologically complex and also inherited quantitatively. Barley is a short-season, early maturing, diploid and self pollinating crop, thus it is an ideal model plant for genetic and physiological studies of salinity tolerance. In order to map the genes/QTLs for salinity tolerance in barley, 72 doubled-haploid lines derived from a cross between 'Steptoe' and 'Morex' were used in an experiment using a randomized complete factorial design with three replications. The phenotypic traits under study included: chlorophyll contents, chlorophyll fluorescence (Fo, Fv, Fv/Fm), proline and carbohydrate rates, relative water content (RWC) and dry and wet weight of plant. Analysis of variance results showed that there were significant differences among the lines and different levels of salinity for all the traits. The strongest correlation was observed between dry and wet weight of plant (r = 0.95**). QTL analysis was performed using the genetic linkage map derived from 327 RFLP molecular markers and QTL cartographer software with the composite interval mapping method. Phenotypic ariations that were explained by these QTLs, ranged from 10.64 to 24.20. The highest and lowest phenotypic variances were related to chlorophyll content (Q3cls) and Fv/Fm (Q1fv/fms), respectively. LOD values ranged from 2.77 to 6.33.

This trend increases when stressful conditions affect plant growth immediately before (GS1) or during (GS2) silking, but the magnitude of change has not been documented for heat stress effects and hybrids of tropical background. In this work we evaluated mentioned traits in field experiments (Exp1 and Exp2), including (i) two temperature regimes, control and heated during daytime hours (ca. 33-40°C at ear level), (ii) two 15-d periods during GS1 and GS2, and (iii) three hybrids (Te: temperate; Tr: tropical; TeTr: Te×Tr). We also measured crop anthesis and silking dynamics, silk exposure of individual plants, and the anthesis-silking interval (ASI). Three sources of kernel loss were identified: decreased floret differentiation, pollination failure, and kernel abortion. Heating affected all surveyed traits, but negative effects on flowering dynamics were larger (i) for anthesis than for silking with the concomitant decrease in ASI, and (ii) for GS1 than for GS2. Heat also caused a decrease in the number of (i) florets only when performed during GS1 (-15.5% in Exp1 and -9.1% in Exp2), and only among Te and TeTr hybrids, (ii) exposed silks of all GS×Hybrid combinations, and (iii) harvestable kernels (mean of -51.8% in GS1 and -74.5% in GS2). Kernel abortion explained 95% of the variation in final kernel numbers (P&lt;0.001), and negative heat effects were larger on this loss (38.6%) than on other losses (?11.3%).

While many imprinted genes have been identified and intensively studied in mammals, smaller numbers have been characterized in flowering plants, mostly in Arabidopsis thaliana. Identification of additional imprinted loci in flowering plants by genome-wide screening for parent-of-origin specific uniparental expression in seed tissues will facilitate our understanding of the origins and functions of imprinted genes in flowering plants.Results: cDNA-AFLP can detect allele-specific expression that is parent-of-origin dependent for expressed genes in which restriction site polymorphisms exist in the transcripts derived from each allele. Using a genome-wide cDNA-AFLP screen surveying allele-specific expression of 4500 transcript-derived fragments, we report the identification of 52 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) displaying parent-of-origin dependent expression patterns in Arabidopsis siliques containing F1 hybrid seeds (3, 4 and 5 days after pollination). We identified these MEGs by developing a bioinformatics tool (GenFrag) which can directly determine the identities of transcript-derived fragments from (i) their size and (ii) which selective nucleotides were added to the primers used to generate them. Hence, GenFrag facilitates increased throughput for genome-wide cDNA-AFLP fragment analyses. The 52 MEGs we identified were further filtered for high expression levels in the endosperm relative to the seed coat to identify the candidate genes most likely representing novel imprinted genes expressed in the endosperm of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression in seed tissues of the three top-ranked candidate genes, ATCDC48, PDE120 and MS5-like, was confirmed by Laser-Capture Microdissection and qRT-PCR analysis. Maternal-specific expression of these genes in Arabidopsis thaliana F1 seeds was confirmed via allele-specific transcript analysis across a range of different accessions. Differentially methylated regions were identified adjacent to ATCDC48 and PDE120, which may represent candidate imprinting control regions. Finally, we demonstrate that expression levels of these three genes in vegetative tissues are MET1-dependent, while their uniparental maternal expression in the seed is not dependent on MET1.Conclusions: Using a cDNA-AFLP transcriptome profiling approach, we have identified three genes, ATCDC48, PDE120 and MS5-like which represent novel maternally expressed imprinted genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana seed. The extent of overlap between our cDNA-AFLP screen for maternally expressed imprinted genes, and other screens for imprinted and endosperm-expressed genes is discussed. © 2011 McKeown et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051589791

We study the natural variation of floral color in L. longituba by testing the components of water-soluble vacuolar pigments - anthocyanins - in its petals using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Four anthocyanins were identified, cyanidin-3-sophoroside (Cy3So), cyanidin-3-xylosylglucoside (Cy3XyGlc), cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy3Sa), and pelargonidin-3-xylosylglucoside (Pg3XyGlc), which occur at various amounts in L. longituba petals of different colors. A multivariate analysis was used to explore the relationship between pigments and flower color. Anthocyanins have been thought to play a major role in acting as a UV screen that protects the plant's DNA from sunlight damage and attracting insects for the purpose of pollination. Thus, knowledge about the content and type of anthocyanins determining the petal coloration of Lycoris longituba will help to study the adaptive evolution of flowers and provide useful information for the ornamental breeding of this species. © 2011 He et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961144803

Models investigating impacts of habitat fragmentation on pollen flow have categorized landscapes simply in terms of habitat and nonhabitat. We show that pollen flow depends strongly on types of land use between habitat fragments. We used paternity analysis of seeds and a combination of circuit and general linear models to analyze pollen flow for the endangered tree Gomortega keule (Gomortegaceae) [12] in the fragmented Central Chile Biodiversity Hotspot [13]. Pollination probability was highest over pine plantation, moderate over low-intensity agriculture and native forest, and lowest over clearfells. Changing the proportions of the land uses over one kilometer altered pollination probability up to 7-fold. We explain our results by the novel ""Circe principle."" In contrast to models where land uses similar to native habitat promote pollinator movement, pollinators may actually be waylaid in resource-rich areas between habitat patches. Moreover, pollinators may move with higher probability between habitat patches separated by some resource-poor land uses. Pollination research in fragmented landscapes requires explicit recognition of the nature of the nonhabitat matrix, rather than applying simple binary landscape models. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051469611

Typically these areas, entrepreneurship and auditing, are studied independently to the point that few entrepreneurial families appreciate the skills an internal auditor can offer. Can a ""good"" ESBO become more effective by adding auditing skills into their art and embrace the goals, functions, and skills of an internal auditor? This commentary explores that question by identifying the issues and differences between the entrepreneur-small business and the internal auditing function. Where the management function typically emphasizes conceptual skills, human skills, and technical skills, this paper suggests the addition of an auditing focus on the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the business would greatly enhance many entrepreneurial small businesses in their quest to improve both themselves and their enterprise. The small business owner's management function could become much more effective if owners would ""crossover"" and adopt certain goals, skills, and functions necessary to perform internal audit activities. ESBOs should not resist this cross-pollination application as these commonalities could be developed and applied at all levels of their organization. If crosspollination across small businesses and the auditing function could occur, failure rates for ESBOS might significantly decline so that external auditors may seldom be needed. Instead of ""show me the money,"" most ESBOs should be ""following the money."" As such, this paper concludes with proven solutions on how to ESBOs can improve business operations by performing the dual roles of manager and internal auditor.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961044185

Animals generally learn to use these signals through associative conditioning; however, signals are most effective when they elicit innate behavioural responses. Many plant species have flowers specialized for pollination by ground-dwelling mammals, but the signals used to attract these pollinators have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate the chemical basis for attraction of mammal pollinators to flowers of the dioecious parasitic plant Cytinus visseri (Cytinaceae). Two aliphatic ketones dominate the scent of this species; 3-hexanone, which elicits strong innate attraction in rodents, and 1-hexen-3-one, which repels them in isolation, but not in combination with 3-hexanone. The aliphatic ketone-dominated scent of C. visseri contrasts with those of insect-pollinated plants, which are typically dominated by terpenoids, aromatic or non-ketone aliphatic compounds. 3-hexanone is also known from some bat-pollinated species, suggesting independent evolution of plant signals in derived, highly specialized mammal-pollination systems. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Cytinaceae; Cytinus visseri; Dioecy; Floral syndrome; Nectar; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956122299

The melon research community has recently benefited from the determination of a complete draft genome sequence and the development of associated genomic tools, which have allowed us to focus on small RNAs (sRNAs). These are short, non-coding RNAs 21-24 nucleotides in length with diverse physiological roles. In plants, they regulate gene expression and heterochromatin assembly, and control protection against virus infection. Much remains to be learned about the role of sRNAs in melon.Results: We constructed 10 sRNA libraries from two stages of developing ovaries, fruits and photosynthetic cotyledons infected with viruses, and carried out high-throughput pyrosequencing. We catalogued and analysed the melon sRNAs, resulting in the identification of 26 known miRNA families (many conserved with other species), the prediction of 84 melon-specific miRNA candidates, the identification of trans-acting siRNAs, and the identification of chloroplast, mitochondrion and transposon-derived sRNAs. In silico analysis revealed more than 400 potential targets for the conserved and novel miRNAs.Conclusion: We have discovered and analysed a large number of conserved and melon-specific sRNAs, including miRNAs and their potential target genes. This provides insight into the composition and function of the melon small RNAome, and paves the way towards an understanding of sRNA-mediated processes that regulate melon fruit development and melon-virus interactions. © 2011 Gonzalez-Ibeas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960995874

The pyrethroid tau-fluvalinate and the organophosphate coumaphos have been used for Varroa control, with little knowledge of honey bee detoxification mechanisms. Cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification contributes to pyrethroid tolerance in many insects, but specific P450s responsible for pesticide detoxification in honey bees (indeed, in any hymenopteran pollinator) have not been defined. We expressed and assayed CYP3 clan midgut P450s and demonstrated that CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, and CYP9Q3 metabolize tau-fluvalinate to a form suitable for further cleavage by the carboxylesterases that also contribute to tau-fluvalinate tolerance. These in vitro assays indicated that all of the three CYP9Q enzymes also detoxify coumaphos. Molecular models demonstrate that coumaphos and tau-fluvalinate fit into the same catalytic pocket, providing a possible explanation for the synergism observed between these two compounds. Induction of CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 transcripts by honey extracts suggested that diet-derived phytochemicals may be natural substrates and heterologous expression of CYP9Q3 confirmed activity against quercetin, a flavonoid ubiquitous in honey. Up-regulation by honey constituents suggests that diet may influence the ability of honey bees to detoxify pesticides. Quantitative RT-PCR assays demonstrated that tau-fluvalinate enhances CYP9Q3 transcripts, whereas the pyrethroid bifenthrin enhances CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q2 transcripts and represses CYP9Q3 transcripts. The independent regulation of these P450s can be useful for monitoring and differentiating between pesticide exposures in-hive and in agricultural fields.",Apidae; Miticide; Transcriptional regulation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961228944

The flowers were fixed at various times after hand-pollination during stages of pollen tube extension, entry of pollen tubes into ovule, double fertilization, and early development of the embryo. Pollen grains initiated germination and penetrated the style 4 hours after pollination (HAP). Pollen tubes grew toward the ovule through the intercellular spaces along the solid style at 8 HAP. During pollen tube extension at 24 HAP, the generative cell divided into two sperm cells. Pollen tubes reached the ovary at 48 HAP, extended directly into the degenerating synergid cell and released the two sperm cells. One of the two sperm cells arrived adjacent to the egg cell at 60 HAP. Four to 5 days after pollination, a zygote was formed.

Figs on male dioecious fig trees (Ficus, Moraceae) are breeding sites for pollinator fig wasps (Hymenoptera, Agaonidae), but figs on female plants are traps that produce only seeds. As the short-lived fig wasps cannot reproduce in female figs, natural selection should favour individuals that avoid them. Several studies have failed to detect such discrimination, a result attributed to inter-sexual mimicry and 'selection to rush' in the wasps, but their experiments failed to explicitly take into account fig age (how long they had been waiting to be pollinated). 2. We compared the relative attraction of male and female figs of known ages of the South East Asian Ficus montana Burm. f. to its pollina tor Liporrhopalum tentacularis Grandi and examined how the reproductive success of the plant and its pollinator change with the age of the figs. 3. Mean retention time for un-pollinated figs on female plants was 16 days whereas in male figs it was 12 days. Female figs remained attractive for up to 2 weeks, although the wasps were less willing to enter older figs. After pollinator entry, receptivity continued for several days, lasting longer in figs entered by a single wasp. Consistent with abortion rates, attractiveness persisted longer in female figs. Older figs produced fewer fig wasp offspring, but similar numbers of seeds. 4. The sexual differences in floral longevity in F. montana may represent part of a previously un-recognised reproductive strategy in some fig trees that allows male plants to 'export' pollinators while also maintaining a resident fig wasp population. © 2011 The Authors.

We investigated the effects of conspecific and heterospecific floral densities on pollination success both of two related, self-compatible, nectar-rewarding orchid species in Ireland, Spiranthesromanzoffiana (rare and listed as endangered) and its congener, S. spiralis (more abundant and not of conservation concern). Floral densities, insect visitation rates, and orchid pollen transport were recorded in multiple quadrats in four populations of both orchid species over their flowering season. We found that conspecific and heterospecific co-flowering plant density affected pollination in both orchid species. For S. romanzoffiana, higher heterospecific density increased pollen removal. For S. spiralis, higher conspecific visitation increased pollen removal and increased heterospecific density decreased pollen deposition. In addition, increased conspecific density increased pollen deposition in both species. This study shows that plants may interact to facilitate or compete for different components of the pollination process, namely; pollinator attraction, pollen removal and deposition. Such interactions have immediate consequences for endangered plant species, as increases in both conspecific and heterospecific coflowering density may ameliorate the negative effects of rarity on pollination, hence overall reproductive success. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bombus; Competition; Facilitation; Pollen export; Spiranthes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960299109

Most of the bees (Hymenoptera) and a butterfly species (Lepidoptera) foraged for nectar, whereas all the flies (Diptera) foraged either for pollen or both nectar and pollen. Eight major pollinators were tested for their pollination efficiency. The nectar-robbing behavior of many species made it difficult to judge the efficiency of an insect on the basis of visitation rate and stay time; therefore, the amounts of pollen deposited and pollen harvested per visit were also measured. The single visit efficiency in terms of the number of seeds per pod revealed that Apis dorsata, A. florea, and Halictus sp. were superior for canola pollination, having Spears' values of 1. 62, 1. 55 and 1. 73, respectively.

Within the genus, diverse types of ant-plant associations exist and it has therefore been a model system for studying mutualistic interactions. Little information existed up to now, however, on its reproductive biology. Our comparative study in the genus Macaranga in Sundaland revealed specific flower characteristics and uncommon brood-site pollination systems: enclosed inflorescence morphologies with narrow entrances strongly restrict the set of flower visitors in many species. Thysanoptera were the most abundant insects in 20 of the 26 investigated Macaranga species and, in three species, heteropteran adults and larvae were dominant. Both insect groups used the flower chambers as breeding sites and fed on nectar-producing trichomes inside the bracteoles. Thrips as well as heteropterans are assumed to contribute to pollination. Different Macaranga sections were associated with different flower visitors, suggesting isolation by different pollinators. Thrips pollination and myrmecophyty often occurred in the same sections. The development of enclosed flowers might have facilitated tight ant-plant interactions and prevent ant-pollinator conflicts. However, the complex ecosystems in which the mutualistic systems evolved are rapidly changed with unknown consequences for these specific interactions. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Brood-site; Flower traits; Flowering phenology; Heteroptera; Mutualism; Myrmecophytes; South-east Asia; Sundaland; Thrips; Thysanoptera,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960428341

Mourera fluviatilis belongs to the family and has a disjunct distribution in the Amazon and northeastern Brazil. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) both autogamy and anemophily act on the pollination system of M. fluviatilis, and (ii) the highest reproductive success is achieved by cross-pollination. Natural populations were monitored in the rivers Pirangi and Ipojuca, northeastern Brazil. Floral visitors are the polylectic bees Apis mellifera, Trigona spinipes (Apidae), Augochlora sp. and Augochloropsis sp. (Halictidae), though only the latter three are effective pollinators. In experiments on the reproductive system and pollination there was a high percentage of fruit formation (>86%), both in treatment and control plants. Although the index of self-incompatibility is 0.86, there was a significant difference in the number of seeds produced among reproductive system treatments, and xenogamy produced more seeds. There was no significant difference in the number of penetrated ovules between control and manual cross-pollination (xenogamy) treatments, 24. h after pollination. However, there were differences among treatments, 48. h after pollination, except for the control and xenogamy treatments. The pollen tubes from cross-pollination treatments usually penetrate the micropyle in shorter time and in higher quantity. We found differences among pollination experiments, except for the control and non-emasculated treatments, and between emasculated treatments. In spite of the ambiguity of floral attributes (pedicel, filaments and anthers colors, sweet odor, reduced perianth, absence of nectar, small and dry pollen grains), wind pollination is less important for this species; what predominates instead are first allogamy mediated by bees and second self-pollination at the end of anthesis. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Allogamy; Anemophily; Aquatic plant; Atlantic Rain Forest; Entomophily; Lotic habitat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960015664

To better understand the ecological and evolutionary implications of multispecies interactions, we explored linkages between soil fungi, pollinators, and floral larcenists in Polemonium viscosum (Polemoniaceae). Methods: Using a fungicide, we experimentally reduced fungal colonization of krummholz and tundra P. viscosum in 2008 - 2009. We monitored floral signals and rewards, interactions with pollinators and larcenists, and seed set for fungicide-treated and control plants. Key results: Fungicide effects varied among traits, between interactions, and with environmental context. Treatment effects were negligible in 2008, but stronger in 2009, especially in the less-fertile krummholz habitat. There, fungicide increased nectar sugar content and damage by larcenist ants, but did not affect pollination. Surprisingly, fungicide also enhanced seed set, suggesting that direct resource costs of soil fungi exceed indirect benefits from reduced larceny. In the tundra, fungicide effects were negligible in both years. However, pooled across treatments, colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in 2009 correlated negatively with the intensity and diversity of floral volatile organic compounds, suggesting integrated above- and belowground signaling pathways. Conclusions: Fungicide effects on floral rewards in P. viscosum link soil fungi to ecological costs of pollinator attraction. Traitspecific linkages to soil fungi should decouple expression of sensitive and buffered floral phenotypes in P. viscosum. Overall, this study demonstrates how multitrophic linkages may lead to shifting selection pressures on interaction traits, restricting the evolution of specialization. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Floral evolution; Fungicide; Mycorrhizae; Nectar larcenists; Polemoniaceae; Polemonium viscosum; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858386512

The dioecious Clusia nemorosa (Clusiaceae) produces floral resin, a specialized reward for resin-collecting bees. It also exhibits floral automimicry with female flowers mimicking male flowers in order to attract pollen-collecting insects. We observed the hourly visitation frequency and behaviour of bee visitors on two rock savanna sites in French Guiana. The major strategy in pollen transfer and the variation in visitation rates among visitor species were examined. We hypothesized that the visitation rate will vary between the floral sexes and degree of this variation will differ between the two-reward systems. We found no evidence for visits being exclusively related to resin collection, which we expected to be the principal strategy in pollen transfer. Deceit pollination appeared to have minor importance and seemed to be locally associated with the site, where demand for pollen was greater. Flower visits that probably facilitated most pollen transfer, combined resin and pollen. The pollinators involved in this system collected pollen from male flowers and resin from female flowers. The fruit set was not particularly low (44. 19%) so offering different rewards by different flower genders has not constrained reproductive success in this system. Pronounced variation in visitation rates between sexes was not related to the pollination mechanisms but to the demand for the two rewards. Overall demand for pollen was greater than demand for resin. Female flowers were visited much less frequently than male flowers. Peak pollen collection occurred in the morning, i. e., as soon as the resource was available, while resin was collected throughout the day. There was a local variability in demand for the two resources because both the visitation rate and the behaviour of foraging bees varied between the two observation sites. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Automimicry; Clusia; Floral reward; Inselberg; Meliponini; Rock savanna,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960329071

Using data from a range of secondary sources, this study assesses the importance of insect pollinated crops at regional and national scales and investigates the capacity of honeybees to provide optimal pollination services to UK agriculture. The findings indicate that insect pollinated crops have become increasingly important in UK crop agriculture and, as of 2007, accounted for 20% of UK cropland and 19% of total farmgate crop value. Analysis of honeybee hive numbers indicates that current UK populations are only capable of supplying 34% of pollination service demands even under favourable assumptions, falling from 70% in 1984. In spite of this decline, insect pollinated crop yields have risen by an average of 54% since 1984, casting doubt on long held beliefs that honeybees provide the majority of pollination services.

This hypothesis was investigated by determining the pollination success, daily duration of flower opening, flower life span, the number of pollen grains and ovules per flower, pollinator visitation rates, and seed output for both color morphs during the flowering season of 2009. Hand-pollination and pollinator-exclusion experiments were also conducted to determine whether the two color morphs differed in their ability to self-pollinate. In general, blue flowers were found to have a trait combination that favors a significantly higher degree of pollinator specificity and cross fertilization, whereas white flowers were characterized as pollinator generalists and self-fertilizing.

This dependence may to be less in the outer tropics where many columnar cactus species (or their populations) show a relatively generalized pollination system with both nocturnal (moths and bats) and diurnal pollinators (bees and hummingbirds) (geographical dichotomy hypothesis). This hypothesis has been mostly tested in the northern tropics; nonetheless, our knowledge of columnar cactus species inhabiting the southern tropics is still scarce. The aim of this project was to evaluate the pollination biology of Oreocereus celsianus, a columnar cactus with restricted distribution in the subtropical Andes, to determine if the pollination system of this cactus tends to be more generalized than specialized because of the geographical position where it occurs. Observations of frequency of visit showed that Patagona gigas (Giant Hummingbird) is the main pollinator of the flowers, visiting them when they are opening (afternoon of the first day). Bees, wasps and moths were occasional visitors of the flowers. None of them seem to act as pollinator. Autogamy, geitonogamy and xenogamy treatments produced high fruit set, showing that O. celsianus has an unusual mixed mating system. The results suggest that this Andean columnar cactus is partially specialized on hummingbirds, with most pollination service performed by a single species, and it has the capacity of selfing ('fail-safe' pollination system). This mixed mating system (both outcrossing and selfing) may be a response to the unpredictable environment of the Prepuna in the subtropical Andes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Andes; Hummingbirds; Nectar robbing; Self-compatible system; Semi-deserts; Southern tropics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960607473

However, if predators use those highly rewarding flowers to locate their prey, pollinators may benefit from changing their foraging preferences to accept less rewarding flowers. Previous studies have shown that some predators, such as crab spiders, indeed hunt preferentially on the most pollinator-attractive flowers. In order to determine whether predation risk can alter pollinator preferences, we conducted laboratory experiments on the foraging behavior of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) when predation risk was associated with a particular reward level (measured here as sugar concentration). Bees foraged in arenas containing a choice of a high-reward and a low-reward artificial flower. On a bee's first foraging trip, it was either lightly squeezed with forceps, to simulate a crab spider attack, or was allowed to forage safely. The foragers' subsequent visits were recorded for between 1 and 4 h without any further simulated attacks. Compared to bees that foraged safely, bees that experienced a simulated attack on a low-reward artificial flower had reduced foraging activity. However, bees attacked on a high-reward artificial flower were more likely to visit low-reward artificial flowers on subsequent foraging trips. Forager body size, which is thought to affect vulnerability to capture by predators, did not have an effect on response to an attack. Predation risk can thus alter pollinator foraging behavior in ways that influence the number and reward level of flowers that are visited. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus impatiens; Bumble bees; Foraging; Non-consumptive effects; Pollination; Predation risk,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960151555

It is restricted to a few populations with a reduced number of individuals living in summit rock cliffs. It is studied and compared to the widespread Aquilegia vulgaris to assess differences in their breeding system and pollination ecology, expected by their differences in flower morphology and by their habitat divergence. Pollinator exclusion experiments showed the capacity of A. paui to reach a full seed set in the absence of pollinators, whereas A. vulgaris notably reduced its reproductive success under these conditions. At the same time, no insect visits were detected in A. paui, whereas A. vulgaris was frequently visited, mainly by bumblebees and flies. Thus, an evolutionary shift toward autogamy in A. paui is discussed in relation to enhanced reproductive assurance. Additionally, we address reproductive isolation mechanisms that nowadays keep A. paui and A. vulgaris separated in spite of their ability to intercross and the existence of contact areas. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Columbine; Ecological differentiation; Endemic species; Pollination; Reproductive assurance; Reproductive isolation; Self-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960577539

We present a phylogenetic comparative analysis of ""Baker's law"", that introduced plants with the ability to reproduce autogamous or asexually may be better able to establish on introduction. We gathered data from both published and unpublished sources on pollen limitation of 141 species, including 26 introduced species and 115 native species. Our analysis compared differences in the proportion of autonomous autogamy, asexual reproduction, and pollen limitation among native, introduced noninvasive, and introduced invasive plant species, and included the phylogenetic novelty of the introduced species to the native species in that community. Introduced species were more likely to be autogamous than native species, consistent with Baker's law. On the other hand, introduced species were less likely to have the ability to reproduce asexually. Further, among species with no autonomous autogamy, pollen limitation was greater for introduced compared to native species. Such a result is consistent with the idea that plants entering a new continent receive lower quality or quantity of services from resident pollinators than species native to that continent. Finally, more phylogenetically novel invasive species had lower pollen limitation than less novel invasive species, potentially because they experience less competition for pollinators. This is the first evidence that enhanced pollination may be one mechanism driving the greater invasiveness of phylogenetically novel introduced species observed in some systems. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Baker's law; Darwin's naturalization hypothesis; Invasive species; Phylogenetic novelty; Pollen limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960298289

However, to date an integrative and quantitative explanation has been lacking. It is evident that species often switch their interactive partners in real-world mutualistic networks such as pollination and seed-dispersal networks. By incorporating an interaction switch into a novel multi-population model, we show that the nested architecture rapidly emerges from an initially random network. The model allowing interaction switches between partner species produced predictions which fit remarkably well with observations from 81 empirical networks. Thus, the nested architecture in mutualistic networks could be an intrinsic physical structure of dynamic networks and the interaction switch is likely a key ecological process that results in nestedness of real-world networks. Identifying the biological processes responsible for network structures is thus crucial for understanding the architecture of ecological networks. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Abundance; Adaptive behaviour; Antagonistic network; Dynamic network; Functional response; Morphological trait; Nestedness; Network size; Pollination; Seed disperser,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960417418

Major uncertainties exist, however, regarding the degree to which the fossil pollen assemblages from caves reflect past environments because of the complex site formation processes and post-depositional bias. Studies within caves from other regions have demonstrated that the understanding of modern pollen taphonomy helps to recognise the record bias improving thus the inferences. The present study therefore aims to understand how modern plant communities are represented within two caves at the Patagonian steppe and to establish the modern pollen taphonomic processes. Cave pollen assemblages provided a good representation of the local vegetation indicating therefore that cave fossil pollen assemblages are a reliable source for inferring the past vegetation. However, the modern taphonomic analysis pointed out that cave pollen assemblages are not homogeneous but show spatial variability due to different factors. Vegetation distribution, physiognomy and pollination type, biotic transport and human disturbance were the major factors affecting the cave pollen assemblages whereas orientation and topographic position seemed not to be significant. Biotic transport caused unexpected deposition patterns while animal and human post-depositional disturbance the homogenization of pollen assemblages. Other factors such as the cave internal topography, morphology and microclimatic circulation might be determinant on floor pollen assemblages so should be further investigated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Caves; Patagonian steppe; Pollen; Taphonomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960956048

We investigated how history, geography, and climate have affected population genetic structure, local adaptation, and the phylogeography of this species. Methods: We examined patterns and levels of diversity in nuclear microsatellites (SSRs) and cpDNA haplotypes in populations from across the species range. We compared these results to population differentiation and genetic clines in phenotypic traits in a common garden. Key results: Genetic diversity was low for both nuclear SSRs and cpDNA. There was a lack of population structure (F ST = 0.090) in the coastal portion of the species range, with estimates of population genetic diversity in microsatellite markers decreasing with latitude from California to British Columbia. A disjunct interior population in Idaho 450 km from the coastal range had the lowest diversity but the highest divergence of all populations studied. Only a single nucleotide polymorphism was discovered after sequencing 5547 base pairs in seven noncoding regions of cpDNA. Both cpDNA haplotypes were widely distributed throughout the species range. Quantitative variation among populations was moderate (0.11 ? Q ST ? 0.63), and weak but significant adaptive clines were found between quantitative traits and population climatic variables (0.09 ? R 2 ? 0.34). Conclusions: Cornus nuttallii likely faced a population bottleneck in a single southern refugium during the Last Glacial Maximum.

To clarify the actual conditions and characteristics of long-range outcrossing rates in particular, the present research conducted over the 3-year period of 2006-2008 involved performing outcrossing experiments using large-scale plots and obtaining data on meteorological observations, outcrossing rates, and pollen observations. These experiments significantly expanded the scale of the test plots from previous work on this subject, with measurements of outcrossing rates at long distances and investigations of the effect of meteorological elements and pollen count. The outcrossing rate was estimated as the percentage of yellow kernels produced among the white kernels due to the pollination of the recipient female flowers of the white-kernel cultivar by the donor flower pollen of the yellow-kernel cultivar. The following was clarified from these results.(1)Precipitation from the date of flowering to the day before the peak pollen dispersion period suppressed the amounts of pollen dispersed during the peak period, and was one of the factors that determined the pattern of pollen dispersal.(2)Outcrossing did not occur in a spatially homogeneous manner, and the distribution produced isolated islands of high outcrossing rate. Even in locations that were several hundred meters from the donor, outcrossing did not occur in a spatially homogeneous manner.(3)The outcrossing rate decreased exponentially as a function of distance from the donor field, but did not reach zero even at points 800m distant, nor did the values become uniform. They continued to decrease in an extremely gradual manner.(4)In the relationship between outcrossing rate and distance from the donor, the higher the mean wind speed, the smaller the reduction of outcrossing rate with distance. In addition, the greater the amount of solar radiation, the larger the reduction of outcrossing rate with distance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Genetically modified crops; Long-range pollen dispersal; Maize; Meteorological elements; Outcrossing rates,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051601550

The selection effect among qualitative and quantitative traits is therefore expected to be strong. Native provenances and clonal seed orchard families were compared in this study. • Materials and methods Forty-one genetic origins of teak, including 26 open-pollinated families from a clonal seed orchard in Ivory Coast, were planted in 1997 in a replicated trial at Taliwas, Sabah, East Malaysia. • Results and discussion The mortality rate and early measurements of height, and diameter at breast height varied substantially between treatments. The largest height (>18 m) and diameter (>21 cm) values recorded after 104 months were mostly from the clonal seed orchard families, while the lower performances were mainly observed for the native provenances. Narrow sense heritabilities, assessed for the clonal seed orchard families only, increased gradually with age, reaching relatively high values, especially for height at 104 months (h2=0.76). There were also some highly significant differences between the 41 genetic origins for six qualitative traits observed from 25 to 104 months. Overall, the clonal seed orchard families were marginally less crooked and grew more vertically than the other sources. • Conclusions These findings provide further evidence of the usefulness of a clonal seed orchard phase in the genetic improvement of teak and the beneficial influence of a wet tropical climate on major economic traits. © INRA and Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.",Clonal seed orchard; Genetic improvement; Heritability; Teak,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80855139418

Furthermore, coupling of an adjuvant like Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin subunit B (LTB) to an antigen can increase its immunogenicity and reduce the costs related to separate co-administration of adjuvants. Our study demonstrates the expression of two pentameric proteins: the modified HPV-16L1 (L1-2xCysM) and LTB as a fusion protein in tobacco chloroplasts. Homoplasmy of the transplastomic plants was confirmed by Southern blotting. Western blot analysis showed that the LTB-L1 fusion protein was properly expressed in the plastids and the recombinant protein was estimated to accumulate up to 2% of total soluble protein. Proper folding and display of conformational epitopes for both LTB and L1 in the fusion protein was confirmed by GM1-ganglioside binding assay and antigen capture ELISA, respectively. However, all transplastomic lines showed chlorosis, male sterility and growth retardation, which persisted in the ensuing four generations studied. Nevertheless, plants reached maturity and produced seeds by pollination with wild-type plants. Taken together, these results pave the way for the possible development of a low-cost adjuvant-coupled vaccine with potentially improved immunogenicity against cervical cancer. © 2011 The Authors.

However, such modularity is infrequent in seed dispersal networks, presumably because research on those networks predominantly includes a single taxonomic animal group (e.g. birds). Herein, for the first time, we examine the pattern of interaction in a network that includes multiple taxonomic groups of seed dispersers, and the mechanisms underlying modularity. We found that the network was nested and modular, with five distinguishable modules. Our examination of the mechanisms underlying such modularity showed that plant and animal trait values were associated with specific modules but phylogenetic effect was limited. Thus, the pattern of interaction in this network is only partially explained by shared evolutionary history. We conclude that the observed modularity emerged by a combination of phylogenetic history and trait convergence of phylogenetically unrelated species, shaped by interactions with particular types of dispersal agents. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Birds; Body mass; Complex networks; Fish; Fruit diameter; Mammals; Nestedness; Phylogenetic analyses; Reptiles,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960429847

These conditions are rather unfavourable for sexual reproduction of flowering plants. Apomixis, asexual reproduction via seed, provides reproductive assurance without the need of pollinators and potentially accelerates seed development. Therefore, apomixis is expected to provide selective advantages in high-alpine biota. Indeed, apomictic species occur frequently in the subalpine to alpine grassland zone of the European Alps, but the mode of reproduction of the subnival to nival flora was largely unknown. Methods: The mode of reproduction in 14 species belonging to seven families was investigated via flow cytometric seed screen. The sampling comprised 12 species typical for nival to subnival plant communities of the European Alps without any previous information on apomixis (Achillea atrata, Androsace alpina, Arabis caerulea, Erigeron uniflorus, Gnaphalium hoppeanum, Leucanthemopsis alpina, Oxyria digyna, Potentilla frigida, Ranunculus alpestris, R. glacialis, R. pygmaeus and Saxifraga bryoides), and two high-alpine species with apomixis reported from other geographical areas (Leontopodium alpinum and Potentilla crantzii). Key Results: Flow cytometric data were clearly interpretable for all 46 population samples, confirming the utility of the method for broad screenings on non-model organisms. Formation of endosperm in all species of Asteraceae was documented. Ratios of endosperm: embryo showed pseudogamous apomixis for Potentilla crantzii (ratio approx. 3), but sexual reproduction for all other species (ratios approx. 1·5). Conclusions: The occurrence of apomixis is not correlated to high altitudes, and cannot be readily explained by selective forces due to environmental conditions. The investigated species have probably other adaptations to high altitudes to maintain reproductive assurance via sexuality. We hypothesize that shifts to apomixis are rather connected to frequencies of polyploidization than to ecological conditions. © 2011 The Author.

A case in point is Satyrium eurycalcaratum, described here as a new species, which has been confused with several other Satyrium spp. with similar long-spurred, white flowers. A phylogenetic analysis, based on molecular data, indicated that S. eurycalcaratum is not closely related to any of the species with which it has been previously confused. A comparative analysis of morphological characters in the seven South African Satyrium spp. with long-spurred, white flowers showed that each of these, including S. eurycalcaratum, is characterized by a unique combination of traits. Despite the similarity in pollination syndrome characters, such as spur length and flower colour, variation in rostellum structure was particularly pronounced and four distinctive forms were present. There was no phylogenetic signal in patterns of interspecific rostellum variation, as some closely related species had different rostella, whereas some distantly related species shared similar rostellum structures. We therefore conclude that the use of rostellum traits in conjunction with phylogenetic evidence can resolve species delimitations among orchid species that share the same pollination syndrome. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Bayesian analysis; Cape floristic region; Flower colour; ITS; Moth pollination; Nectar spur; New species; Rostellum; Satyrium eurycalcaratum; SEM,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960520267

To improve our understanding of threshold and optimum rearing temperatures of M. rotundata, we examined the effect of temperature on postwintering development by using a greater number of temperature treatments than applied in previous studies (19 versus eight or fewer) and analytical tools formulated to model nonlinear relationships between temperature and insect development rates. We also tested the hypothesis that rearing temperature influences adult body lipid content at emergence, which could affect adult survival, establishment and performance as a pollinator, and reproductive success. We found that the Lactin-2 and Briere-2 models provided the best fits to data and gave reasonable estimates of lower (16-18°) and upper (36-39°) developmental thresholds and optimum (33-34°) rearing temperatures for maximizing development rate. Bees successfully emerged over a broad range of temperatures (22- 35°), but variation in development rate among individuals reared at the same temperature was lowest at 31-33°. The optimum rearing temperature to maximize the proportion of body lipids in adults was 27-29°. Our results are discussed in relation to previous findings and speak to the difficulties in designing practical rearing guidelines that simultaneously maximize development rate, survival, and adult condition, while synchronizing adult emergence with alfalfa bloom. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.",alfalfa leafcutting bee; lipids; Megachile rotundata; pollinators; thermal biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051728760

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), for pollination is synchronizing bee emergence and activity with peak crop bloom. Previous studies have demonstrated that the commercial spring incubation of this species can be successfully interrupted by low temperature incubation, thereby slowing development and giving producers flexibility in timing emergence to weather conditions or crop bloom. In this study, we demonstrate that the implementation of a fluctuating thermal regime, during which bees are given a daily one hour pulse of high temperature, markedly increases the ""shelf-life"" of individuals of this species. Although constant temperatures can be used to store bees for up to 1 wk with no decrease in survival, properly staged bees can be stored for up to 6 wk without a significant decrease in percentage of emergence. Hence, we expect fluctuating thermal regime protocols to become a valuable tool for M. rotundata managers, especially when timing nesting activity with peak bloom to maximize effectiveness. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.",alternative pollinator; cold storage; fluctuating thermal regime; fluctuation thermal regime; Megachile rotundata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051708710

The data set used covers a nine-year period (1999-2007) and is unique in the sense that it includes-besides the daily number of respiratory hospital admissions-not just the hourly mean concentrations of CO, PM10, NO, NO2, O3 and SO2 with meteorological variables (temperature, global solar flux, relative humidity, air pressure and wind speed), but two pollen variables (Ambrosia and total pollen excluding Ambrosia) as well. The analysis was performed using three age categories for the pollen season of Ambrosia and the pollen-free season. Meteorological elements and air pollutants are clustered in order to define optimum environmental conditions of high patient numbers. ANOVA was then used to determine whether cluster-related mean patient numbers differ significantly. Furthermore, two novel procedures are applied here: factor analysis including a special transformation and a time-varying multivariate linear regression that makes it possible to determine the rank of importance of the influencing variables in respiratory hospital admissions, and also compute the relative importance of the parameters affecting respiratory disorders. Both techniques revealed that Ambrosia pollen is an important variable that influences hospital admissions (an increase of 10 pollen grains m-3 can imply an increase of around 24% in patient numbers). The role of chemical and meteorological parameters is also significant, but their weights vary according to the seasons and the methods. Clearer results are obtained for the pollination season of Ambrosia. Here, a 10 ?g m-3 increase in O3 implies a patient number response from -17% to +11%. Wind speed is a surprisingly important variable, where a 1 m s-1 rise may result in a hospital admission reduction of up to 42-45%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Air pollution; Cluster analysis; Factor analysis including a special transformation; Respiratory hospital admissions; Time-varying multivariate linear regression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959758268

Thomson, Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, P.O. Box 519, Crested Butte, CO 81224, United States","One possible effect of climate change is the generation of a mismatch in the seasonal timing of interacting organisms, owing to species-specific shifts in phenology. Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause termination than those required for plants. In addition, degreeday requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators, and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten population persistence for most species in our study area. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Climate change; Elevational gradient; Hymenoptera; Phenology; Pollination; Reciprocal transplant experiment; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory; Solitary bees; Trap nests; Trophic mismatch,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051536675

The nine study areas are situated in the patchy cultural landscape of Southern Estonia and were chosen to represent landscape changes along a gradient from closed forest to open vegetation. Two diversity measures - richness and evenness - were used to compare the palynological and floristic data. A total of 307 plant species were recorded in the vegetation representing 127 pollen types. Only 52 pollen types were recorded in the sediment surface samples of which 43 had parent plants in the vegetation. Significantly lower floristic richness was found in closed surroundings than in more open surroundings. Study sites with open vegetation also had significantly higher palynological richness (number of pollen types recorded in surface sediments). The additional pollen types recorded in surface sediments from open vegetation were widespread types mostly of insect-pollinated taxa such as Ranunculus, Rubiaceae, Melampyrum, Filipendula, Potentilla or Vaccinium. The parent plants of these pollen types were frequent in the landscape. This suggests that the main mechanism governing palynological richness in this study was not floristic diversity but rather variance in pollen productivity. Since woodland has a higher pollen production than open areas (grassland and fields) per unit land surface, open areas tend to show a better representation of slightly rarer but widespread herb pollen types. No relationship was found between palynological and floristic diversity of wind-pollinated taxa and tree taxa partly because the pollen source area for these pollen types is much larger than 250. m. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Floristic diversity; Floristic richness; Palynological diversity; Palynological richness; Pollen sample evenness; Vegetation evenness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960970354

A case in point is chalkbrood in the alfalfa leafcutting bee [Megachile rotundata (F.)]. Propagation of this solitary bee is severely hampered by chalkbrood, a larval disease caused by Ascosphaera aggregata (Ascomycota). Alfalfa leafcutting bees nest in existing cavities in wood or hollow reeds and overwinter as larvae. In the early summer, emerging adults frequently must chew through dead, diseased siblings that block their exit, becoming contaminated with chalkbrood spores in the process. When alfalfa leafcutting bees are used as a commercial pollinator, the cocoons are removed from nesting boards to reduce chalkbrood transmission, but the disease is still common. To determine if these removed cocoons (called loose cells) are an important source of disease transmission, they were disinfected with a fungicide before bees were incubated, and released in the field. Chalkbrood prevalence among the progeny of the treated bees was reduced up to 50% in one field trial, but not significantly when tested in an on-farm trial. Thus, substantial disease transmission still occurred when the loose cells were disinfected, and even when clean nesting materials were used. In conclusion, pathogen transmission must still be occurring from another source that has yet to be identified. Another possible source of transmission could arise from bees that emerge midsummer in populations with a high percent of multivoltinism, but dirty nesting boards and feral bees also may be minor sources of transmission. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.",alfalfa; alfalfa leafcutting bees; bees; chalkbrood; disease transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051779633

Field pollination data revealed that 'Sha 01' displayed self-compatibility (SC), whereas 'Kuerlexiangli' showed self-incompatibility upon self-pollination. Reciprocal pollinations between the two varieties showed that 76% of 'Kuerlexiangli' flowers pollinated with 'Sha 01' pollen set fruit, but only 7% of 'Sha 01' flowers set fruit when pollinated with 'Kuerlexiangli' pollen. The pollen performance was monitored with fluorescence microscopy, and it was observed that 'Sha 01' accepted self-pollen but rejected 'Kuerlexiangli' pollen, whereas 'Kuerlexiangli' rejected self-pollen but accepted 'Sha 01' pollen. Taken together, 'Sha 01' showed SC as a pollen-part mutant. Molecular S-genotyping of 'Sha 01', its selfed progeny, and wild-type 'Kuerlexiangli' showed that all contained S22-RNase and S28-RNase alleles, but showed no nucleotide sequence difference or changes in transcription. After flow cytometry and chromosome number analyses, 'Sha 01' was found to be a tetraploid (2n = 68) and 'Kuerlexiangli' a diploid (2n = 34). Thus, the S-genotype for 'Sha 01' was S22S22S28S28 and for 'Kuerlexiangli' was S22S28. Ploidy level of 'Sha 01' selfed progeny were also determined from leaves using flow cytometry; all seedlings were tetraploids. The S-genotyping for the progeny was identified by S-RNase gene relative optical density for both alleles. Closer inspection of 52 progeny showed that they could be classified into three types S22S22S28S28: S22S22S22S28: S22S28S28S28 with the distribution 28:10:14 ? 4:1:1; no individual homozygous for either allele was found.

Hummingbird visitation was recorded at three ornithophilous and eleven non-ornithophilous species. Flower density was roughly constant during the study period, with the density of non-ornithophilous flowers being higher than that of ornithophilous ones. Mean values of nectar volume and concentration were similar between ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous species. Eight hummingbird species were observed at PSP: Amazilia fimbriata, Anthracothorax nigricollis, Chlorostilbon lucidus, Eupetomena macroura, Hylocharis chrysura, Florisuga fusca, Thalurania furcata and an unidentified species. Hummingbird visit frequencies to ornithophilous and non-ornithophilous flowers were similar. However, some non-ornithophilous species received a higher number of visits, which seems to be related to their large number of open flowers per plant per day. The number of feedings bouts of hummingbirds increased with the total number of flowers observed per focal plant. All recorded species of hummingbirds visited non-ornithophilous flowers, predominantly melittophilous and generalised entomophilous flowers. Hummingbird species recorded at PSP may be viewed as generalists, visiting a large number of non-ornithophilous species.

Forty-five-, 60-, and 75-day-old fruits (DOF) were treated with 100 ?l l-1 ethrel for 10 or 20 days. The fruits treated with ethrel tended to be lighter in weight compared to those treated with water (the control). Seed coat coloration in 85 DOF (75 DOF plus 10 days of ethrel treatment [DET]) and 95 DOF (75 DOF plus 20 DET) was clearly promoted by the ethrel treatment. Embryo development was enhanced by ethrel treatments in 55 DOF (10 DET), i. e., the ethrel-treated embryos progressed to the mature cotyledon stage earlier than those in the control. The embryo size (length and width) was significantly larger in 55 DOF treated with ethrel than those of the control. In 55 and 65 DOF (20 DET), the embryo germination rates were higher in the ethrel-treated group than those in the control. The seedlings in the ethrel group grew more vigorously than those in the control. Therefore, we found that the embryo quality was improved by the ethrel treatment in 65-95 DOF. The breeding cycle of papaya could be shortened by embryo culture using embryos qualitatively improved by ethrel treatment, i. e., the period (generally 6-9 months) from pollination to seedling establishment could be shortened by approximately 3 months using these breeding techniques. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Embryo culture; Embryo development; Embryo germination; Ethrel,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960556217

Of these, tetraploid races are the most frequently encountered, with octoploids the next most common, and hexaploids being much less common. In this study, the occurrence of neopolyploid individuals within tetraploid and hexaploid populations of shadscale was examined at natural sites in order to investigate the pathways by which octoploids may be formed and to find a possible explanation for the predominance of octoploids over hexaploids. The frequencies of apparent neopolyploid individuals among adults and the frequencies of their backcrosses were tabulated, as was the occurrence of neopolyploidy among seeds of female plants from some of the same populations. The neopolyploids encountered in these surveys were almost exclusively those expected from unions involving single unreduced gametes. 6x presumed neopolyploid plants were observed in tetraploid populations at a frequency of 0.20%, and 6x seeds were observed at a frequency of 1.91%. Within examined hexaploid populations, 9x adults were not encountered, but 9x seeds were observed at a rate of 0.52%. Evidence was obtained for the operation of some postulated autoploid pathways for generation of octoploids, but these routes did not operate at rates comparable to those for the production of hexaploids. Although the question needs to be studied by genetic methods, the most probable reason for scarcity of hexaploids in nature appears to be that some tetraploid races are diploidized, which would result in irregularities of meiosis in their neohexaploids and a failure to form new races due to infertility and inviability. © 2011.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052765561

Encapsulation technology has recently attracted the interest of researchers in the field of plant propagation because it combines the advantages of zygotic or gamic seeds with those of micropropagation. In this study, we examined the encapsulation of Carrizo citrange uninodal microcuttings (3-4 mm long) and evaluated the influence of the calcium alginate coating, a short time storage at cold temperature, and different sowing substrates on the viability and regrowth of the explants. A secondary aim was to develop an efficient protocol to induce root formation in the microcuttings. The results showed that encapsulation did not negatively affect the viability, providing a satisfactory regrowth, and storage potential for 30 days at low temperature. No differences in viability and regrowth were detected between the two different sowing substrates tested (agar-solidified medium and paper filter). To optimize the production of microcuttings required to perform the encapsulation experiments, in a preliminary experiment we assessed different factors affecting the in vitro shoot regeneration from epicotyl segments (obtained from seeds of Carrizo citrange germinated in vitro), including the influence of in vitro organogenesis, explant orientation, cut surface contact with the medium, treatments with different growth regulators, and distance of the organogenic explants from the cotyledonary node. The highest organogenic response was obtained from segments horizontally cultured (particularly from the basal portion), from segments with the cut surface in contact with the medium and from explants cultured on medium supplemented with 6-benzyladenine. No significant difference in regeneration efficiency was found in response to the distance of the epicotyl portions from the cotyledonary node. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adventitious shoot; Cytokinins; Explant type; Germplasm storage; Micropropagation; Synthetic seed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960563363

Along with other host PR proteins, PR3 chitinase is one protein component participating in genetic resistance of western white pine (Pinus monticola) to the white pine blister rust (WPBR) pathogen (Cronartium ribicola). In the present study, we characterized a novel P. monticola class IV chitinase gene (PmCh4B) and further analyzed its nucleotide variations in the open-pollinated seed families of diverse geographical distribution and variable levels of quantitative resistance to C. ribicola infection. PmCh4B showed high haplotype diversity (Hd = 0.94) and nucleotide diversity (? = 0.00965), similar to those of other conifer genes related to environmental stresses. A low level of intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD) (but most of the levels with statistical significance) was found within a distance of ?800 bp. Based on PmCh4B haplotype frequency, moderate to high levels of population structure were observed among P. monticola seed families currently used in breeding programs for WPBR resistance (average F ST = 0.163, P &lt; 0.001). Association analysis revealed that allelic variants and multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms of PmCh4B were significantly associated with quantitative levels of P. monticola resistance against C. ribicola.

Grazing and mowing differ in their potential effects on plant gene flow and resulting population-genetic structure. After assessing its breeding system, we investigated the effect of land use on the population-genetic structure in the common grassland plant Veronica chamaedrys using 63 study populations on meadows, mown pastures and pastures in three regions in Germany, the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories. We determined plant density and analysed the genetic diversity, differentiation and small-scale genetic structure using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The breeding system of V. chamaedrys turned out as self-incompatible and outcrossing. Its genetic diversity did not differ among land-use types. This may be attributed to large population sizes and the strong dispersal ability of the species, which maintains genetically diverse populations not prone to genetic drift. Genetic differentiation among populations was low (overall FST=0.075) but significant among the three regions. Land use had only weak effects on population differentiation in only one region.

The experiment included 39 open-pollinated pine families that comprised a random subset of the breeding population of P. pinaster in Galicia (NW Spain). We employed a non-parametric survival-time analysis to analyze patterns of survival times during 14 months after inoculation with a local A. ostoyae strain. Results indicate (i) a significant correlation between seed weight and tree susceptibility, with seedlings originating from large seeds being more susceptible, (ii) a positive family mean correlation between secondary root weight and size and median life expectancy, and (iii) genetic variation of tree tolerance to A. ostoyae, with some families surviving significantly longer than others. Less susceptible families could be used in breeding programmes or directly in forest plantations to reduce the losses caused by A. ostoyae. Large within-family variation in tolerance to the disease was also observed, suggesting that non additive genetic variance was also important. Although being infected, 32 out of the 1200 inoculated trees survived the fungus infection. These tolerant genotypes comprise an attractive collection to further investigate genetic, phenotypic and environmental factors affecting pine susceptibility to Armillaria root rot. © 2011 KNPV.",Pine; Root density; Screening; Tree resistance; White root rot,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960454296

Furthermore, prevention of pollen dispersal also answers to concerns regarding transgene flow via pollen from Genetically Modified (GM) crops to traditional crop fields or wild relatives. We induced male sterility by suppressing endogenous general transcription factor genes, TAFs, using anther-specific promoters combined with artificial microRNA (amiRNA) technology (Schwab, 2006). The system was made reversible by the ethanol inducible expression of an amiRNA-insensitive form of the target gene. We provide proof of concept in eggplant, a cultivated crop belonging to the Solanaceae family that includes many important food crops. The transgenic eggplants that we generated are completely male sterile and fertility can be fully restored by short treatments with ethanol, confirming the efficiency but also the reliability of the system in view of open field cultivation. By combining this system with induced parthenocarpy (Rotino, 1997), we provide a novel example of complete transgene containment in eggplant, which enables biological mitigation measures for the benefit of coexistence or biosafety purposes for GM crop cultivation. © 2010 The Authors.

That bees, especially the tropical stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini), also collect plant resins has, however, been barely addressed in scientific studies on resource use in bees. Resins are used for nest construction, nest maintenance and nest defence. Furthermore, some South-East Asian species transfer resin-derived terpenes to their cuticular profiles. The resin requirement of bees is in turn used by certain plant species, which attract bees either for pollination by providing resin in their inflorescences, or for seed dispersal by providing resin in their seed capsules (mellitochory). Mellitochory is found in the eucalypt tree Corymbia torelliana, the resin of which is collected by Australian stingless bees. We investigated how the interaction between C. torelliana and resin-collecting bees affects the chemical ecology of two Australian stingless bee genera by comparing the chemical profiles of eight bee species with resin from C. torelliana fruits. The two bee genera differed significantly in their chemical profiles. Similar to South-East Asian stingless bees, 51% of all compounds on the body surfaces of the five Tetragonula species were most likely derived from plant resins. Up to 32 compounds were identical with compounds from C. torelliana resin, suggesting that Tetragonula species include C. torelliana compounds in their chemical profiles. By contrast, few or none resinous compounds were found on the body surfaces of the three Austroplebeia species sampled. However, one prominent but as yet unknown substance was found in both C. torelliana resin and the chemical profiles of all Tetragonula and four Austroplebeia colonies sampled, suggesting that most colonies (76%) gathered resin from C. torelliana. Hence, C. torelliana resin may be commonly collected by Australian stingless bees and, along with resins from other plant species, shape their chemical ecology. © 2010 The Authors.

All individuals growing within 20 permanent plots of 100 m2 each established in 11 different locations covering the entire strictly protected area of Mount Aenos National Park (Cephalonia) were monitored over a period of 4 years. The cones are formed on the upper part of the previous year's branches, mostly at the upper crown half of the reproductive individuals (over 53 years old). Female flowers are pollinated in spring and cone maturation lasts until the beginning of autumn, when seed dispersal occurs. The annual production of cones per individual varied significantly, revealing masting behavior for this tree. This behavior was also expressed in the number of trees producing cones, as well as the percentage of sound seeds per cone. A significant difference in the mass and the length of the cones between the years of low and high cone production was observed, being higher in the years of massive cone production. Similar germination percentages were observed in full darkness or under ""canopy light"" and ""sun light"", provided that the seeds were previously stratified for 6 weeks. It is concluded that A. cephalonica exhibits plasticity expressed in its reproductive behavior for alternating years of high to low cone production and in its seed germination for an array of habitat light conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Abies cephalonica; Cone morphology; Coniferous forest; Endemic; Reproduction ecology; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960304542

A collection of landraces of a Brassica napus leafy crop called nabicol is kept at 'Misión Biológica de Galicia' (CSIC-Spain) which can be used to search for desirable characteristics or to produce new commercial varieties to release in the market. The assessment of the mating system of nabicol landraces is particularly important to carry on adequate breeding and genetic conservation programs. The objective of this work is to estimate the outcrossing rate in nabicol under controlled pollinator conditions using SSRs. Pairs of flowering plants taken from nabicol landrace MBG-BRS0039 were placed in separated isolation cages and bumble bees (Bombus sp.) were released for facilitating the crosses between plants. A seed sample from each plant in the cross was analyzed by SSRs that were polymorphic in the parental population. We found that the crop is partially allogamous and that there is genetic variation for the outcrossing rate among individuals. Several consequences for the maintenance and genetic improvement of the crop are discussed. The existence of genetic variability for this trait is a valuable tool that will allow us to study the genetic mechanisms underlying the mating system of this crop. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brassica napus; Mating system; Microsatellites; Nabicol landraces; Outcrossing rate; SSRs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959379567

Population genetic diversity was measured by evaluating patterns of variation at six putatively neutral isoenzyme loci (comprising 24 putative alleles) within and among 20 populations of A. retroflexus collected in different habitats: ruderal habitats, cereal fields and hop gardens. Amaranthus retroflexus is a noxious weed of North American origin that infests various crops. Overall, A. retroflexus displayed moderate levels of genetic diversity in comparison with other herbaceous plants. The percentage of polymorphic loci was 50.0%, with mean values of 2.01, 0.142 and 0.227 for the average number of alleles per polymorphic locus (A), observed heterozygosity (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He), respectively. A discrepancy between observed and expected heterozygosity and significant differences from H-W expectation indicate that there is an excess of homozygotes in many populations. As a result, there is strong evidence of inbreeding within populations (FIS=0.382) and significant population differentiation (FST=0.270). Even though the species is partly autogamous, inbreeding does not lead to strong inbreeding depression resulting from self-pollination, as inbreeding has no effect on the success of the species in today's countryside. Moreover, allele frequencies detected in agricultural habitats (i.e., cereal fields and hop gardens) differed from those detected in populations collected from ruderal habitats, which is probably caused by systematic application of herbicides in agricultural ecosystems. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Allozyme; Herbicide; Inbreeding; Invasion; Population genetic structure; Weed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957795431

A main topic of controversy in recent years refers to the unintended presence of transgenic events in locally grown cultivars at main centers of crop diversity. Peru does not yet have biosafety regulations to control or permit the growing of genetically modified crops. Hence, the aim of this research was to undertake a survey in the valley of Barranca, where there were recent claims of authorized transgenic maize grown in farmers fields as well as in samples taken from feed storage and grain or seed trade centers. Results: A total of 162 maize samples (134 from fields, 15 from local markets, eight from the collecting centers of poultry companies, from the local trading center and four samples from seed markets) were included for a qualitative detection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter (P35S) and nopaline synthase terminator (Tnos) sequences, as well as for six transgenic events, namely BT11, NK603, T25, 176, TC1507 and MON810. The 134 maize samples from farmers fields were negative for Cry1Ab delta-endotoxin insecticidal protein and enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) using lateral flow strips. The PCR analysis did not detect any of the six transgenic events in samples from farmers fields, local markets, seed trading shops and the local collecting center. There were four transgenic events (T25, NK603, MON810 and TC1507) in grain samples from the barns of poultry companies. Conclusions: This research could not detect, at the 95% probability level, transgenes in farmers' fields in the valley of Barranca. The four transgenic events in grain samples from barns of poultry companies were not surprising because Peru imports maize, mainly for animal feed, from Argentina and the United States that are known for growing transgenic maize. © 2011 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile.",Biosafety; Corn; Sampling; Transgenes; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960816347

The objectives of this study were to assess the presence and nature of GEI for nine agronomic traits of rapeseed cultivars, and to identify cultivars with favorable levels of stable oil production. Nine rapeseed cultivars, including seven open pollinated and two hybrids, Hyola308 and Hyola401, were grown in ten environments under rain-fed warm areas of Iran. The GEI was significant for all traits and was partitioned into components representing heterogeneity due to environmental index and the remainder of the GEI. Among the all traits with a highly significant heterogeneity, the largest amount of heterogeneity removed from the GEI was for seeds per pod and seed weight. We found GEIs for both oil content and seed yield were largely influenced by differences in correlations among pairs of cultivars (86.8 and 71.4% of the GEI sum of squares, respectively), suggesting that crossover GEIs (i. e., change in genotype rankings among environments) are present. The mean correlation of each cultivar with all other cultivars (r?ii') ranged from 0.53 to 0.83 for oil content and 0.86 to 0.96 for seed yield. A comparison was done of the significance of Sh-?i 2 (stability variance derived from total GEI) and Sh-Si 2 (adjusted stability variance derived from residual GEI) assignable to each genotype for oil content and seed and oil yield. Based on Sh-?i 2, three cultivars were unstable for oil content, whereas six cultivars were unstable for seed and oil yield. The removal of heterogeneity revealed that one unstable cultivar for oil content and three unstable cultivars for oil yield were judged to be stable. All cultivars with (r?ii') ? 0.63 were labeled unstable for oil content, whereas all with (r?ii') ? 0.94 were considered unstable for seed yield. The relationships between (r?ii') and Sh-?i 2 were significant (P &lt; 0.01) for oil content and seed yield. The results of rank correlation coefficients showed significant positive correlations of Yield-Stability statistic (YSi) with oil content and oil yield.

Hoplitis adunca is a monolectic bee collecting pollen only from Echium spp. (Boraginaceae). We aimed to test whether Echium vulgare floral scent plays a major role in the attraction of H. adunca females, and to identify components of E. vulgare scent that may be involved in this specific attraction. We used a combination of behavioral and chemical (GC/GC-MS, PTR-MS) analyses. In order to identify the chemical cues likely to be involved in the specific attraction of H. adunca, we compared the scent of fresh flowers, nectar, pollen, and whole plants of E. vulgare and Anchusa officinalis, another Boraginaceae, which does not attract H. adunca. H. adunca females were attracted to the scent of E. vulgare flowers when offered against a blank or against the scent of A. officinalis flowers. However, H. adunca females were not attracted to the scent of A. officinalis flowers when offered against a blank. The emission spectra of the two plant species differed markedly, as did the emission spectra of various flower components (pollen, nectar and whole flowers) within a species. Pollen presented a low volatile release, but emitted significantly higher amounts of mass 55 (butanal, 1,3-butadiene, or other volatiles of molecular mass 54), and mass 83 (hexanal, hexenols, hexenyl acetate, or other volatiles of molecular mass 82) in E. vulgare than in A. officinalis. Nectar produced a particular emission spectrum with high emission rates of masses 109 and 123. Mass 109 may likely correspond to 1,4-benzoquinone, a volatile specifically measured in E. vulgare in parallel studies to this one. The flower emission spectrum was mainly a combination of the pollen and the nectar scents, although it also contained additional volatile compounds such as those of mass 63 or mass 81. As for terpenes, E. vulgare emitted limonene, longicyclene, junipene, trans-caryophyllene and ?-humulene, that were not detected in A. officinalis, and the most emitted monoterpenes were ?-pinene, junipene and limonene whereas the most emitted terpenoid by A. officinalis was ?-pinene. After identifying these chemical cues, olfactory/behavioural assays with specific volatiles and combinations of volatiles are necessary to understand the chemical interactions of the H. adunca-E. vulgare system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Echium vulgare; Flower; Hoplitis adunca; Nectar; Oligolecty; Pollen; Terpenes; Volatile organic compounds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054939272

Recent modelling studies call for new empirical data to test hypotheses arising from the recent shift from a 'whole-genome reproductive isolation' view to a 'genic' view of species and speciation. Particularly scarce (and thus of particular interest) are molecular genetic data on recently radiated, naturally hybridizing species in strongly structured and species-rich environments. Here, we studied four sympatric plant species (Pitcairnia spp.; Bromeliaceae) adapted to Neotropical inselbergs (isolated outcrops resembling habitat 'islands' in tropical rainforests) using nuclear and plastid DNA. Patterns of plastid DNA haplotype sharing and nuclear genomic admixture suggest the presence of both, incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific gene flow over extended periods of time. Integrity and cohesion of inselberg species of Pitcairnia are maintained despite introgression and in the face of extremely low within-species migration rates (N em &lt; 1 migrant per generation). Cross-evaluation of our genetic data against published pollination experiments indicate that species integrity is maintained by the simultaneous action of multiple prezygotic barriers, including flowering phenology, pollinator isolation and divergent mating systems. Postzygotic Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities appear to contribute to isolation, as suggested by asymmetric introgression rates of single loci. Our results suggest that incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization and introgression form integral aspects of adaptive radiation in Neotropical inselberg 'archipelagos'. Inselbergs with multiple closely related co-occurring species should be of special interest to students of speciation in mountain systems, and to ongoing conservation programmes in the Atlantic Rainforest biodiversity hotspot. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",biodiversity; bromeliad; chloroplast sharing; hybridization; intraspecific gene flow; introgression; microsatellite; population genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960628614

An important factor with great impact on cross-pollination is the plant breeding system, but so far this is little studied within the context of low-input farming systems. This research studied the chances of cross-pollination within and between rice fields in The Gambia. Size and time of flowering were measured for 28 rice fields in one village. The level of mixture was measured in 90 seed lots of rice collected from four villages. Based on the results, we suggest that in general cross-pollination between different rice genotypes occurs more often within fields than between fields. No clear relationship was found between the level of within-field mixture and socio-economic status of farmers. Some comparison was made with millet, which allowed the identification of various factors influencing pollen flow between different genotypes. Effective pollen flow (between genotypes) is a function of a number of factors, such as the rate of cross-pollination of a crop, number of off-types within fields, variety distinctiveness, farmer expert knowledge, length and reliability of the rainy season, growth duration of different varieties, availability of fields, pest pressure and number of varieties grown per field or per farmer. We hypothesize that a low cross-pollination rate is more favourable for the development of new varieties in farmer fields than a high cross-pollination rate. © 2011 NIAB.",crop breeding system; millet; pollen flow; rice; The Gambia; variety development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960109520

Outdoor tomato production is seriously impaired due to increasing infections with evolving late blight (Phytophthora infestans) populations. Within organic agriculture, research is being conducted to develop regionally adapted and open pollinated cultivars of outdoor tomatoes with late blight field resistance. In the present experiment, three crosses, including wild, cocktail, and beefsteak tomatoes, were selected for field resistance against late blight in F 2 at one location per cross. The comparison of positive and negative selection in F 3 revealed the selection of single F 2 plants to be efficient in all three crosses. F 2 selection has proved to be a robust and efficient tool for breeding programs. The correlated response to selection in other traits, including yield, fruit weight, days to maturity, harvest period, and plant height, depended on the cross. It was evident that selection for desired traits combined with field resistance against late blight is promising, even in wide crosses. The most undesired attribute of wild tomatoes is the formation of shoots on leaves and in inflorescences. No correlation was observed between field resistance and shoot formation, allowing the selection of genotypes with improved field resistance and yield, but without morphological disadvantages. © 2011 The Author(s).",Late blight; Organic breeding; Phytophthora; Resistance; Tomato,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959373660

However, there is an apparent lack of knowledge on the genetic structure and diversity of wild sorghum populations within and between various eco-geographical regions. This is a major obstacle to both their effective conservation and potential use in breeding programs. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and structure of wild sorghum populations across a range of eco-geographical conditions in Kenya. Sixty-two wild sorghum populations collected from the 4 main sorghum growing regions in Kenya were genotyped using 18 simple sequence repeat markers. The study showed that wild sorghum is highly variable with the Coast region displaying the highest diversity. Analysis of molecular variance showed a significant variance component within and among wild sorghum populations within regions. The genetic structure of wild sorghum populations indicated that gene flow is not restricted to populations within the same geographic region. A weak regional differentiation was found among populations, reflecting human intervention in shaping wild sorghum genetic structure through seed-mediated gene flow. The sympatric occurrence of wild and cultivated sorghums coupled with extensive seed-mediated gene flow, suggests a potential crop-to-wild gene flow and vice versa across the regions. Wild sorghum displayed a mixed mating system. The wide range of estimated outcrossing rates indicate that some environmental conditions may exist where self-fertilisation is favoured while others cross-pollination is more advantageous. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961131527

We used simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci, both nuclear DNA and chloroplast DNA, to screen populations throughout the species' range for evidence of severe inbreeding and recent genetic bottlenecks due to habitat fragmentation. After genotyping about 40% of the known populations, only one of 24 populations had strong statistical evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck (He &gt; Heq). Both mean nSSR fixation coefficients and genetic diversity did not statistically differ between very small, small, medium, and large lupine population size classes. Within population chloroplast DNA haplotype number was high for an animal pollinated species, ?4. 2 haplotypes/population, and within population haplotype diversity was also relatively evenly distributed. Within population patterns of nSSR and cpSSR genetic diversity suggest that genetic diversity has not been lost over the last century of habitat fragmentation. With genet lifespan thought to exceed 100 years, overlap of several to many generations, and substantial reductions in seed set from inbreeding depression that shifts cohort composition towards those generated by outcrossing events, Kincaid's lupine is likely maintain the currently high levels of within population genetic diversity. The case of Kincaid's lupine provides an example of how the assumptions of severe inbreeding depression with small population size and habitat fragmentation can be inaccurate. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",cpDNA diversity; Fender's blue butterfly; Genetic diversity; Rare plant conservation; Seed transfer; Small population size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960579571

Old World Papaveroideae (Papaver, Meconopsis, Roemeria, Stylomecon) show substantial diversity in gynoecium and capsule morphology. In particular, capsules can have distinct styles (Meconopsis p.p., Stylomecon) or a sessile stigmatic disc (Papaver). Molecular phylogenetic analyses of Old World Papaveroideae had shown that neither taxa with styles nor those with stigmatic discs represent monophyletic lineages. We here investigate whether either styles or stigmatic discs have arisen repeatedly during the diversification of Old World Papaveroideae. Methods: We investigated gynoecium ontogeny in Papaver rhoeas, P. californicum, Meconopsis cambrica, and Stylomecon heterophylla by scanning electron microscopy for the first time. Our observations were interpreted on the background of a wellresolved molecular phylogeny of the taxa investigated. Key results: Papaver rhoeas and P. californicum share the presence of a developmentally complex garland-like stage in gynoecium ontogeny. The styles of M. cambrica and S. heterophylla result from growth in a ring-like zone beneath the carpel tips. This zone is also present in Papaver. In M. cambrica, traces of a garland-like stage can be seen. Style formation and stigma formation begin more or less simultaneously in M. cambrica, but style formation clearly precedes stigma formation in S. heterophylla. Conclusions: The styles present in M. cambrica and S. heterophylla are considered to have arisen in parallel from ancestors with a stigmatic disc. We speculate that style formation may have been a means to reduce selfing. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Gynoecium; Meconopsis; Ontogeny; Papaver; Papaveroideae; Phylogeny; Stylomecon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858081600

Bumble bee abundance increased during summer as spring queens founded colonies that produced workers, followed by males and autumn queens. The number of plant species visited by bumble bees increased to a peak in midsummer, then declined. 3. The number of bumble bees recorded per person-hour peaked later than the number of flowering plant species used by the bees. Few autumn queens were observed. 4. Despite species differences in emergence times of spring queens, there were no apparent phenological differences among species in worker abundances. 5. Because flowering commences later at higher elevation, abundances of workers and males are also shifted later; therefore elevational comparisons must be seasonally adjusted. 6.

We obtained a GMS line developed from a spontaneous mutation in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). Genetic analysis in our previous study revealed that the sterility was controlled by a recessive gene which was named ms-S. For simple and quick screening of individuals showing male sterility, we attempted molecular mapping of the ms-S locus using an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique. From the examination of 4,096 AFLP primer combinations, 63 AFLP markers were found to be linked to the gene and nine of them were successfully converted into sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers. Linkage analysis indicated that these nine markers were closely linked to the ms-S gene and all were located on the same side of the gene. The minimum genetic distance between the ms-S gene and a marker was 3.1 cM. These results provide additional information for map-based cloning of the ms-S gene and will be of great help for lettuce breeding using GMS to produce F1 hybrids. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",AFLP; CAPS marker; Genetic male sterility; Lettuce; SCAR marker,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959373800

Gradual decline in natural pollinators and insufficient proportion of pollinizers have been observed in the apple orchards over the years across the North Western Himalayan region. This situation resulted in considerable pollination problem in the region. The present study was undertaken (during the years 2006-2010) to examine the effect of top working methods and time as well as type of pollinizers on different growth parameters for efficient pollination management. Chip budding performed in fall, late winter and summer gave significantly higher success rate (90.0, 89.8 and 80.9%, respectively). Other methods viz., side rind graft (85.6%) and cleft graft (71.2%) during February-March, and T-bud (71.7%) during July-August also gave better success. The highest shoot numbers (4.1) and length (92.8. cm) were recorded when chip budding was performed during September-October and February-March, respectively. In 4th year, chip budded scion branches of all the pollinizers recorded significantly higher number of spurs/m twig length with a range of 22.8 (December-January) to 24.7 (September-October). Significantly the highest bloom density (22.1) was recorded on chip budded (February-March) branches of pollinizers in 4th year. Fruit set on top worked trees of 'Oregon Spur' was only in the range of 18.0-20.1% in 1st year and reached to the range of 35.6-41.5% in 4th year. Seed numbers/fruit also increased to the range of 7.3-7.9 in 4th year from 2.9 to 4.6 in 1st year. All these factors resulted in better yield efficiency (2.6-3.8) of 'Oregon Spur' in 4th year. 'Manchurian' crab produced significantly higher shoot length of 86.5-87.2. cm and 146.1-149.2. cm in 1st and 4th years, respectively. However, 'Stark Spur' produced the highest number of spurs/m twig length of 28.9 when grafted/chip budded during December-January or February-March, and 27.1 when chip/T-budded during September-October or July-August. Top working with 'Manchurian' crab also resulted in significantly higher fruit set (44.2-45.4%) and yield efficiency (3.6-3.8) on 'Oregon Spur' in 4th year. This was followed by 'Stark Spur' as pollinizer (37.1-38.2% and 2.9-3.1, respectively). Highly significant positive correlation of shoot numbers, spur density and bloom density of pollinizers with fruit set and yield efficiency of 'Oregon Spur' were observed.

The role of pollinators in the evolution of floral traits has been questioned recently by broad community surveys, especially studies concerning variation in pollinator assemblages and visitation frequency, which suggest a diminished role of pollinators in floral evolution. Here, we investigate the relationships between six categories of floral traits of 29 species and 10 pollinator functional groups in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains of China, over three consecutive years. Simpson's diversity index was used to estimate the level of pollinator generalization of each plant species by considering both pollinator groups and their relative visitation frequencies. Multivariate analyses indicated that eight of the ten pollinator groups showed constant preferences for at least two floral traits, leading to a relatively stable level of ecological generalization for most floral traits (two out of three categories), despite the fact that the level of generalization of the entire community varied across years. Shape preferences of butterflies, honeybees and beeflies varied such that open flowers exhibited a lower level of ecological generalization in 2007 than closed flowers, in contrast with the other 2 years. These results suggest that temporally stabilized preferences of diverse pollinators may contribute to the evolution of specialized versus generalized floral traits; however, their role may be moderated by variation in community structure, including both the composition and abundance of plants and pollinators. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Ecological generalization level; Floral traits; Generalization and specialization; Temporal variation; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958734441

Understanding how these antagonists affect plant fitness individually and in combination is an important research focus in ecology and evolution. We examined the individual and combined effects of herbivory, nectar robbing, and pre-dispersal seed predation on male and female estimates of fitness in the host plant Ipomopsis aggregata. By examining the effects of antagonists on plant traits, we were able to tease apart the direct consumptive effects of antagonists versus the indirect effects mediated through changes in traits important to pollination. In a three-way factorial field experiment, we manipulated herbivory, nectar robbing, and seed predation. Herbivory and seed predation reduced some male and female fitness estimates, whereas plants tolerated the effects of robbing. The effects of herbivory, robbing, and seed predation were primarily additive, and we found little evidence for non-additive effects of multiple antagonists on plant reproduction. Herbivory affected plant reproduction through both direct consumptive effects and indirectly through changes in traits important to pollination (i. e., nectar and phenological traits). Conversely, seed predators primarily had direct consumptive effects on plants. Our results suggest that the effects of multiple antagonists on estimates of plant fitness can be additive, and investigating which traits respond to damage can provide insight into how antagonists shape plant performance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Herbivory; Ipomopsis aggregata; Nectar; Nectar robbing; Phenology; Pollen deposition; Pollination; Seed predation; Trait-based approach,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958723778

Here, we test this 'faster-sex' hypothesis in a species in which males in fact grow more slowly than hermaphrodites, the wind-pollinated annual herb Mercurialis annua. We expected greater herbivory in the faster-growing hermaphrodites. In contrast, we found that males, the slower sex, were significantly more heavily eaten by snails than hermaphrodites.

In wild-type plants, cells within the transmitting tract produce a rich extracellular matrix and undergo programmed cell death to facilitate pollen movement. Here, we show that the HAF, BEE1 and BEE3 genes encode closely related bHLH transcription factors that act redundantly to specify reproductive tract tissues. These three genes are expressed in distinct but overlapping patterns within the reproductive tract, and in haf bee1 bee3 triple mutants extracellular matrix formation and cell death fail to occur within the transmitting tract.

Although numerous physical and biochemical pollen-pistil interactions are necessary for in vivo pollen tube growth to occur, studies investigating the influence of heat-induced changes in pistil biochemistry on in vivo pollen tube growth rates are lacking. We hypothesized that high temperature would alter diurnal pistil biochemistry and that pollen tube growth rates would be dependent upon the soluble carbohydrate content of the pistil during pollen tube growth. G. hirsutum seeds were sown on different dates to obtain flowers exposed to contrasting ambient temperatures but at the same developmental stage. Diurnal pistil measurements included carbohydrate balance, glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.8.1.7), soluble protein, superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.1), NADPH oxidase (NOX; EC 1.6.3.1), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and water-soluble calcium. Soluble carbohydrate levels in cotton pistils were as much as 67.5% lower under high temperature conditions (34.6°C maximum air temperature; August 4, 2009) than under cooler conditions (29.9°C maximum air temperature; August 14, 2009). Regression analysis revealed that pollen tube growth rates were highly correlated with the soluble carbohydrate content of the pistil during pollen tube growth (r2=0.932). Higher ambient temperature conditions on August 4 increased GR activity in the pistil only during periods not associated with in vivo pollen tube growth; pistil protein content declined earlier in the day under high temperatures; SOD and NOX were unaffected by either sample date or time of day; pistil ATP and water soluble calcium were unaffected by the warmer temperatures. We conclude that moderate heat stress significantly alters diurnal carbohydrate balance in the pistil and suggest that pollen tube growth rate through the style may be limited by soluble carbohydrate supply in the pistil. © 2011.",Carbohydrates; Gossypium hirsutum; High temperature; Pollen tube growth; Pollen-pistil interaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956357857

Determined to establish a system where transgenic crops can 'coexist' with conventional and organic farming, the EU has begun to erect a system of demarcations and separations designed to minimize the extent of 'gene flow' from genetically modified plants. As the European landscape is regimented through the introduction of isolation distances and buffer zones, bees and other pollinating insects have become vectors of 'genetic pollution', disrupting the project of cohabitation and purification devised by European authorities. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres on parasitism, this paper traces the emergence of bees as an object of regulatory scrutiny and as an interruptor of the 'coexistence' project. Along with bees, however, another uninvited guest arrived unexpectedly on the scene: the beekeeper, who came to see his traditional relationship to bees, crops, and consumers at risk.

Although these species are cultivated for medicinal purposes, they also represent a significant source of pollen and nectar for honey production, so the investigation aimed to estimate their melliferousness and significance for bee pasture. Pollinator observation indicated the visitation of seven species of Hymenoptera, three species of Diptera and two species of day flying Lepidoptera. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most abundant pollinator, and the major elements of attractiveness were flower scent and colour, followed by the shape and size of the corolla and to a lesser extent nectar abundance. Corolla tube length and number of open flowers per whorl were of little significance. According to all analyzed flower characteristics and observation of pollinator behaviour and visits, the most attractive plants were H. officinalis, S. officinalis and L. officinalis, whilst M. officinalis was the least attractive and S. sclarea completely unattractive to all recorded pollinators except for Xylocopa violacea. © 2011 IBRA.",Flower morphology; Honey bee; Lamiaceae; Nectar production; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052155372

Melipona colimana is a stingless bee endemic to temperate areas of western Mexico, where there is much interest in exploiting it for honey production and crop pollination. It is not known, however, if colonies of this species would adapt to hives necessary for commercial exploitation. Twenty four colonies were transferred to trunks and wooden boxes having walls with one of two thicknesses (2.5 and 10.0 cm). The internal and ambient temperature and humidity were monitored for three months during winter, at the end of which, the brood cell numbers, number of adults, and nest weights were assessed. There were differences in temperature (F 1 = 69.32; F 2 = 1769.33; DF = 3, 56; P &lt; 0.05) and humidity (F 1 = 397.15; F 2 = 1028.11; DF = 3, 56; P &lt; 0.05) between environmental data and internal data of nests during day 1 and night 2, respectively. The internal temperature was statistically similar during the day in all three lodgings, but at night the nests in thick wooden boxes had higher temperatures compared with the other two. There was a decrease in the development of the nests and bee populations in all three lodgings, and a lowest development occurred in thin-walled boxes, probably due to thickness reduction in the lodging walls. This bee species appears capable of maintaining control of the internal environment and this ability is enhanced by using greater thickness of the lodging walls as in this study. The use of boxes with thick walls is recommended for better nest development. © 2011 IBRA.",Humidity; Jalisco; Melipona coliman; Meliponiculture; Nest development; Temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052105065

While outcrossing levels have been described in crops such as rape that are wind-pollinated, or both wind- and insect-pollinated, much less is known about pollen dispersal in exclusively insect-pollinated crops. In this paper, we develop a mechanistic model for pollen movement that is based on a description of bee movement through space. Our model is a system of diffusion-based partial differential equations that we use to predict percent transgenic seed at arbitrary distances from a transgenic source under different planting scenarios. We present a two-pronged study, in which the mathematical modelling work is informed by experimental work. The latter was carried out in an apple orchard with a row of 200 transgenic source trees carrying the GUS marker gene. Fruit from neighbouring conventional trees was gathered at distances ranging from 3.5. m to 183. m, and the seeds were extracted and germinated. Percent transgenic seed at each location was determined by testing the seedlings for the presence of the GUS marker gene. We use the experimental data to validate and parameterize the model, and then run model simulations to determine expected percent transgenic seed in various linear landscapes. We find that the percent transgenic seed in neighbouring conventional trees and orchards is a function of the size of each orchard block and the distance between them. The model explicitly shows the effect of overlapping transgenic and nontransgenic pollen distributions in setting seed distributions, and also shows the value of buffer rows in reducing outcrossing levels in neighbouring crops. The model parameters can be adjusted to suit particular crops and locations, and may be useful for determining plausible distributions on transgenic seed plantings needed to allow for an adventitious presence of, for example, 0.9%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Diffusion model; Isolation distance; Mathematical model; Outcrossing; Pollen dispersal; Transgenic crop,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956261143

A total of 20 control-pollinated seed families, many with unrelated parents, were tested. Three cone collections were made between 15 December 2008 and 5 January 2009. Two zygotic embryo explant-preparation techniques were tested; embryos with retained megagametophytes, and excised embryos. Initiation medium was a modified Litvay medium (Glitz). Following initiation, growth of embryogenic tissue was tested on two proliferation media; a modified Litvay medium (Glitz2) and a modified Verhagen and Wann medium (BLG1). Initiation was obtained from both explant-preparation techniques. The best initiation treatment used excised embryos, with 52% of all explants from all collections and all families giving rise to proliferating embryogenic tissue. At the optimum collection time for each of the families, this treatment resulted in a range of 44% - 93% initiation success with a mean of 70% per family. Continued proliferation of initiated cell lines was high with 99% of cell lines initiated from excised embryos continuing to proliferate. After 28 days of growth on the two tested media, Glitz2 and BLG1, the embryogenic mass showed mean increases of 25 and 29 fold, respectively.

Here, we examine the direct effect of genome duplication on the evolution of pollen siring success in tetraploid Chamerion angustifolium. To separate the effects of genome duplication from selection after duplication, we compared pollen siring success of synthesized tetraploids (neotetraploids) with that of naturally occurring tetraploids by applying 2x, 4x (neo or established) or 2x {thorn} 4x pollen to diploid and tetraploid flowers. Seed set increased in diploids and decreased in both types of tetraploids as the proportion of pollen from diploid plants increased. Based on offspring ploidy from mixed-ploidy pollinations, pollen of the maternal ploidy always sired the majority of offspring but was strongest in established tetraploids and weakest in neotetraploids. Pollen from established tetraploids had significantly higher siring rates than neotetraploids when deposited on diploid (4xest 1/4 47.2%, 4xneo 1/4 27.1%) and on tetraploid recipients (4xest 1/4 91.9%, 4xneo 1/4 56.0%). Siring success of established tetraploids exceeded that of neotetraploids despite having similar pollen production per anther and pollen diameter. Our results suggest that, while pollen precedence can arise in association with the duplication event, the strength of polyploid siring success evolves after the duplication event. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Fireweed; Neotetraploid; Pollen precedence; Pollen size; Polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957665565

There are three levels of organization of edge properties, and each of these can affect animals. At the lowest level are the different habitats on each side of an edge, then there is the edge itself, and finally, at the highest level of organization, is the geometry or structure of the edge. This study used computer simulations to (1) find out whether effects of edge shapes on animal behavior can arise as emergent properties solely due to reactions to edges in general, without the animals reacting to the shapes of the edges, and to (2) generate predictions to allow field and experimental studies to test mechanisms of edge shape response. Individual animals were modeled traveling inside a habitat patch that had different kinds of edge shapes (convex, concave and straight). When animals responded edges of patches, this created an emergent property of responding to the shape of the edge. The response was mostly to absolute width of the shapes, and not the narrowness of them. When animals were attracted to edges, then they tended to collect in convexities and disperse from concavities, and the opposite happened when animals avoided edges. Most of the responses occurred within a distance of 40% of the perceptual range from the tip of the shapes. Predictions were produced for directionality at various locations and combinations of treatments, to be used for testing edge behavior mechanisms. These results suggest that edge shapes tend to either concentrate or disperse animals, simply because the animals are either attracted to or avoid edges, with an effect as great as 3 times the normal density. Thus edge shape could affect processes like pollination, seed predation and dispersal and predator abundance. © 2011 Vilis O. Nams.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959780522

Given the slow growth of the average grain yield of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at global and national level, the use of hybrids for production of this economically important crop, is gaining the importance. The most important condition for hybrid seed production in common wheat is cross-pollination that can be achieved by induction of male sterility. In the past, different approaches for induction of male sterility in common wheat have been proposed, for example the use of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS system) transferred from Triticum timopheevi Zhuk. Due to its complexity, the genetic approaches have never been exercised in the practice. Today the chemical hybridizing agents allow development of hybrid varieties that can top the yield of standard inbred varieties for more than twenty percent. Transgenic approaches represent the alternative to the chemical induction of male sterility.

We tested the importance of avoidance learning in a European deceptive orchid, Anacamptis morio, which has been reported to have a highly variable fragrance bouquet among individuals. We used an indirect approach, i.e. we facilitated pollinators' ability to learn to avoid A. morio by adding anisaldehyde to selected inflorescences, a scent compound that is easily perceived by the natural pollinators and produced in large quantities by the closely related, nectar producing Anacamptis coriophora, a species that shares pollinator species with A. morio. In a series of three experiments (in artificial arrays, in natural populations and in bumblebee behavioural observations), we consistently found no difference either of reproductive success of or visitation rates to scent-added versus control inflorescences. We also found that the decrease of reproductive success over time in artificial populations of this deceptive species was not as important as expected. Together, these data suggest that pollinators do not fully learn to avoid deceptive inflorescences, and that pollinator avoidance behaviour alone may explain the lower reproductive success usually found in deceptive orchids. We discuss the possible explanations for this pattern in deceptive orchids, particularly in relation to pollinator cognition and learning abilities. Lastly, in light of our results, the potential for higher average reproductive success in deceptive orchids with high phenotypic variability driven by avoidance learning thus appears to be challenged. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Anisaldehyde; Floral trait polymorphism; Food deception; Pollinator behaviour; Relaxed selection; Scent addition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958839762

Correa which is of considerable socio-economic importance and possess morphogenetic variation and qualities of wider adaptability to different soils. Cytology, phenology, pollination, breeding system and natural regeneration of wild and cultivated trees from India revealed the existence of diploid (2n = 18) and tetraploid trees (2n = 36) in Pachmarhi hills and only diploid trees in Punjab plains and Shiwalik hills. The diploid and tetraploid trees showed normal meiosis and high pollen fertility. Phenological events which included leaf fall, leaf emergence, floral bud break, flowering and fruiting are nearly the same in wild and cultivated trees. Natural pollen transfer in the species was highly efficient. Levels of fruit set following open pollination was quite high and is reduced considerably following hand pollination probably due to some injury caused to stigma during experiments. Inspite of synchronous nature of anther dehiscence and stigmatic receptivity, selfing in a flower was avoided due to herkogamy. Some selfing, however, occurred through geitonogamous mode as bagging of panicles yielded 12. 21 ± 0. 99 to 14. 12 ± 0. 91% fruit set. High pollen ovule ratio (9,250-10,600) indicated toward the obligate outbreeding nature. The species suited to insect and wind mode of pollination. High amount of air borne pollen grains deposited on glycerine smeared glass microscopic slides suggested towards the wind mode of pollination. Though flowers are dull coloured a variety of insects visited the flowers due to sweet fragrance and stamen/pollen as food reward. Among insect pollinators, honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the major and legitimate pollinator while the rest were either minor pollinators or mere visitors. Inspite of high fruit/seed set, natural regeneration through seeds was poor as fallen fruits were destroyed by fungal pathogens and white ants. The species also propagated vegetatively through coppices and root suckers. It lacks agamospermy as bagging of emasculated flowers yielded no fruit. It is inferred that 'bael' which lacks agamospermy reproduced successfully through gamospermy (xenogamy and geitonogamy) and vegetative mode (coppices and root suckers). We also concluded that tetraploid trees growing in the Pachmarhi hills with large sized fruits possessed better potentialities in horticulture if planted through root suckers or coppices. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aegle marmelos; Breeding system; Cytology; Gamospermy; Geitonogamy; Pollination; Vegetative propagation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958013727

Pollinator sharing among species has important implications for Ficus species delimitation and the evolutionary history of the mutualism. Although agaonid wasp pollinators are known to visit more than one host species in monoecious figs, pollinator sharing has yet to be documented in dioecious figs. The present study investigated the frequency of pollinator sharing among sympatric, closely-related dioecious figs in Ficus sections Sycocarpus and Sycidium. Molecular and morphological species identification established the associations between pollinating agaonid wasp species and host fig species. Cytochrome oxidase I was sequenced from 372 Ceratosolen pollinators of Ficus section Sycocarpus and 210 Kradibia pollinators of Ficus section Sycidium. The association between fig species and morphologically distinct clades of pollinator haplotypes was predominantly one-to-one. In Ceratosolen, six of 372 pollinators (1.5%) visited fig species other than the predominant host. No pollinator sharing was detected between the two Sycidium host species, although a rare hybrid shared Kradibia pollinators with both parental species. These findings point to low rates of pollinator sharing among closely-related dioecious fig species in sympatry, and perhaps lower rates than among monoecious figs. Such rare events could be evolutionarily important as mechanisms for gene flow among fig species. Differences in rates of pollinator sharing among fig lineages might explain the conflicting phylogenetic patterns inferred among monoecious figs, dioecious figs, and their respective pollinators. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Agaonid wasps; Ceratosolen; Cytochrome oxidase I; Kradibia; Reproductive isolation; Specificity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959190844

In both cases, floral visitors were excluded. In addition, we quantified nectar availability (30 plants per morph), floral visitation (10-12 plants per morph) and legitimate pollination (30 plants per morph) throughout the day. We explored morph differences in the variables mentioned above using analyses of variance, and the effects of nectar variation on floral visitation and legitimate pollination using regression models. We observed 1205 floral visits, grouped into six hummingbird (94.7%) and three insect species (5.3%), across observations (264 h). Coeligena torquata was the most frequent floral visitor (34%) in both morphs (1.4-1.7 visits per plant h-1). Nectar production and availability, and visitation rate were similar between morphs. Visitation rate and legitimate pollen deposition increased with the nectar production in both morphs, but levels of legitimate pollination were higher on short-styled flowers than long-styled flowers. These results show that short-styled and long-styled flowers reward floral visitors equally, but frequency and foraging behaviour of long-billed pollinators can promote asymmetrical legitimate pollination. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.",cloud forest; disassortative pollination; distyly; hummingbirds; La Mucuy Bird Observatory; nectar production; Palicourea demissa; Venezuela,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959193133

I surveyed bee communities at five equal-aged restored sites, paired with five reference sites (riparian remnants) along the Sacramento River, California, United States. Flower availability and bee visitation patterns were also measured to examine the restoration of pollination function. Restoration of structural vegetation allowed diverse and abundant native bee communities to establish at the restoration sites; however, the composition of these important pollinator communities was distinct from that in the remnant riparian sites. Differences did not arise primarily from differences in the composition of the flowering-plant community; rather there must be other physical characteristics of the restored sites or differences in nesting site availability that led to the different pollinator communities. Because sites were spatially paired, the differences are unlikely to be driven by landscape context. Bee life-history and other biological traits may partially explain the differences between bee communities at restored and remnant sites. Patterns of visitation to native plant species suggest that pollination function is restored along with pollinator abundance and richness; however, function may be less robust in restored habitats. An examination of interaction networks between bees and plant species found at both restored and remnant riparian sites showed less redundancy of pollinators visiting some plants at restored habitats. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International.",Bees; Community composition; Ecological function; Nonmetric multidimensional scaling; Pollination webs; Restoration; Riparian,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959810337

This study aimed to associate pollen and stigma morphology with zoophily in species of the tribe Phaseoleae. Species of the genera Erythrina, Macroptilium and Mucuna with different pollinators were chosen. Pollen grains and stigmas were examined under light microscopy (anatomy), scanning electronic microscopy (surface analyses) and transmission electronic microscopy (ultrastructure). The three genera differ in terms of pollen wall ornamentation, pollen size, pollen aperture, thickness of the pollen wall, amount of pollenkitt, pollen hydration status and dominant reserves within the pollen grain, while species within each genus are very similar in most studied characteristics. Most of these features lack relationships to pollinator type, especially in Erythrina and Mucuna. Pollen reserves are discussed on a broad scale, according to the occurrence of protein in the pollen of invertebrate- or vertebrate-pollinated species. Some pollen characteristics are more associated to semi-dry stigma requirements. This apical, compact, cuticularised and secretory stigma occurs in all species investigated. We conclude that data on pollen and stigma structure should be included together with those on floral morphology and pollinator behaviour for the establishment of functional pollination classes. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Anatomy; Pollen morphology; Pollen reserves; Stigma morphology; Zoophily,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958812268

Although its flowers were visited by over 70 species of insects grouped in 10 morphospecies, only a relatively narrow assemblage of muscoid and syrphid flies, rather constant in both study years, contributed to pollination. These insects did not exhibit any preferences toward plant sexual phases. Based on our results and available literature, we discuss the concept of specialization/generalization of the A. sylvestris pollination system, especially in the context of the ""unspecialized"" floral morphology characteristic for members of the Carrot family. © 2011 The Author(s).",Dichogamy; Diptera; Generalization; Pollinator importance; Specialization; Umbelliferae; Umbels,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959500267

The evolution of sex allocation will depend on the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors governing patterns of investment in female and male function. In wind-pollinated plants, theoretical models predict a positive relation between size and male investment because of the fitness advantages associated with more effective pollen dispersal. Theory also predicts that the timing and allocation to each sex function should depend on available resources. We grew maternal half-sibling families of annual, wind-pollinated, Ambrosia artemisiifolia in sun and shade treatments to investigate these predictions. There was significant genetic variation for female and male flower production in both sun and shade treatments. Size-dependent sex allocation occurred in the direction predicted by theory, with male flower production increasing more rapidly in larger plants. The timing of sex function also varied, with significant genetic variation for dichogamy within environments and plasticity of this trait between environments. Protandry was expressed more commonly in the sun and protogyny in the shade. The occurrence of dynamic sex allocation with changing size and experimental treatment indicates the potential for adaptive responses under different ecological conditions. © 2011 The Author(s).

There are marked differences in nectar properties among the two groups, implying that there has been pollinator-mediated selection on these traits. This raises the possibility that variation in bird assemblages among populations of a plant species could lead to the evolution of intraspecific variation in floral traits. We examined this hypothesis in Kniphofia linearifolia, a common and widespread plant in southern Africa. Although bees are common visitors to flowers of this species, exclusion of birds from inflorescences led to significant reductions in seed set, indicating that the species is primarily bird-pollinated. We showed that bird pollinator assemblages differ markedly between five different populations of K. linearifolia, and that variation in flower morphology and nectar properties between these populations are associated with the dominant guild of bird visitors at each population. We identified two distinct morphotypes, based on corolla length, nectar volume and nectar concentration, which reflect the bird assemblages found in each type. Further work is needed to establish if a natural geographic mosaic of bird assemblages are the ultimate cause of differentiation in floral traits in this species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Bird pollination; Honeybee; Nectar; Pollination morphotypes; Red-hot poker,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959495104

Reproduction in Tibouchina cerastifolia (Naudin) Cogn., T. clinopodifolia (DC.) Cogn. and T. gracilis (Bonpl.) Cogn. was studied in an area of Atlantic rainforest to examine whether synchronopatry induces time partitioning among pollinator species. Eleven bee species comprised the pollinator guild. Among pollinators, there were overlaps in bee species composition and in flower visitation time. Direct competition for pollen in Tibouchina Aubl. at the study site seems to lead to different activity periods among the bee species, in which Bombus pauloensis Friese,1913 was most active earlier, while the other species were active later in the day. Bombus pauloensis, the largest bee species recorded on Tibouchina flowers, was the most important and efficient pollinator. This species harvested pollen before the other species and had the shortest handling time. The plants reproduced sexually by selfing or outcrossing, and hybridization was not avoided by incompatibility reactions at the style.

Plants in early- and late-melting patches are therefore likely to experience very different conditions during their flowering periods. Mertensia fusiformis is an early-flowering perennial that varies conspicuously in style length within and among populations. The hypothesis that style length represents an adaptation to local flowering time was tested. Specifically, it was hypothesized that lower air temperatures and higher frost risk would favour short-styled plants (with stigmas more shielded by corollas) in early-flowering patches, but that the pollen-collecting behaviour of flower visitors in late-flowering patches would favour long-styled plants. • Methods: Floral morphology was measured, temperatures were monitored and pollinators were observed in several matched pairs of early and late populations. To evaluate effects of cold temperatures on plants of different style lengths, experimental pollinations were conducted during mornings (warm) and evenings (cool), and on flowers that either had or had not experienced a prior frost. The effectiveness of different pollinators was quantified as seed set following single visits to plants with relatively short or long styles. • Key Results: Late-flowering populations experienced warmer temperatures than early-flowering populations and a different suite of pollinators. Nectar-foraging bumble-bee queens and male solitary bees predominated in early populations, whereas pollen-collecting female solitary bees were more numerous in later sites. Pollinators differed significantly in their abilities to transfer pollen to stigmas at different heights, in accordance with our prediction. However, temperature and frost sensitivity did not differ between long- and short-styled plants. Although plants in late-flowering patches tended to have longer styles than those in early patches, this difference was not consistent. • Conclusions: Seasonal change in pollinator-mediated selection on style length may help maintain variation in this trait in M. fusiformis, but adaptation to local flowering time is not apparent. The prevalence of short styles in these populations requires further explanation. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Annals of Botany Company.

We used a genome scan approach to detect signals of natural selection in the Black alder (Alnus glutinosa), a widespread wind-pollinated tree. Gene flow through pollen dispersal is believed to be high in this species, and we therefore expected to find a clear response to natural selection. In combination with two different landscape genetic approaches, we determined which environmental variables were most associated with the inferred selection. This analysis was performed on a regional scale (northern Belgium) and on a continental scale (Europe). Because climate-related differences are much more pronounced at the continental scale, we expected to find more selection-sensitive genetic markers across Europe than across northern Belgium. At both spatial scales, a substantial number of genetic loci were considered outliers, with respect to neutral expectations, and were therefore identified as selective. Based on results from our combined approach, four putative selective loci (or 2.5%) were recovered with high statistical support. Although these loci seemed to be associated with different environmental variables, they were mainly temperature-related. Our study demonstrates that the use of complementary methods in landscape genetics allows the discovery of selective loci which otherwise might stay hidden. In combination with a genome scan, the selective loci can be verified and the nature of the selection pressure can be identified. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",AFLP; Alnus glutinosa; environmental variation; genome scan; landscape genetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959637801

If patterns of genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then they may be useful in predicting the likelihood of inbreeding or outbreeding depression but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers. • Methods: The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster of adults (30-50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (&gt;5 km distant); and (d) open pollination. Sets of 17.9 ± 3·3 leaves from each of 15 clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure. • Key Results: Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both inbreeding and outbreeding depression, with 'intermediate' pollen producing consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by &gt;5 km distance (F ST = 0.07 and 0·10). • Conclusions: The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G. mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly related neighbours. Moreover, the performance of open-pollinated seedlings was poor, implying that current mating patterns are suboptimal. © The Author 2011.

Pollinators of three species were observed in the field in Nepal. This information is urgently needed because many orchid species in Nepal are endangered. Whether the exudates produced by extrafloral nectaries played a role in protection against herbivory was also investigated. Methods: Pollinators of C. flaccida, C. nitida, and Otochilus albus were filmed, captured, and identified. Ant surveys and exclusion experiments were carried out. To investigate whether pollinators are needed for fruit set, plants were wrapped in mesh wire bags. Inflorescence stems were examined with microscopy. Fehling's reagent was used to detect sugars in extrafloral exudates. Key Results: Coelogyne flaccida and C. nitida need pollinators to set fruit and are pollinated by wild bees identified as Apis cerana. Otochilus albus was found to be pollinated by Bombus kashmirensis. Extrafloral nectar was found to be exuded by nectary-modified stomata and contained high amounts of sugars. Different species of ants were observed collecting these exudates. A significant difference was found in damage inflicted by flower and leaf-eating beetles between C. nitida plants living in trees with ant nests and those in ant-free trees. Conclusions: Floral syndromes include scented and colored trap flowers without reward to their pollinators. All orchids investigated exude extrafloral nectar by nectary-modified stomata.

Small Puget balsamroot populations may be caused by inadequate pollination via insufficient pollinator services or by low quality pollen. Comparing potential germinants of hand- and naturally-pollinated inflorescences, which takes into account seed set and germination rates, illustrates the extent of pollination limitation on three South Puget Sound prairies on Joint Base Lewis-McChord (7S, Upper Weir, and Johnson). Our results demonstrated that Puget balsamroot is self-incompatible. On all three prairies, hand-pollinated inflorescences produced more potential germinants than naturally-pollinated inflorescences (P < 0.001), indicating that Puget balsamroot is pollen limited. In addition, 7S had a significantly greater number of floral and soil resources than either Johnson or Upper Weir (P < 0.05). However, there were not proportionally more bees found on 7S as compared to Johnson or Upper Weir. Therefore, Puget balsamroot on 7S may be pollen limited because pollinator populations are too small. Determining pollinator population sizes on the south Puget Sound lowland prairies could prove to be useful in determining the relative effects of pollinator limitation and low pollen quality. We suggest that fragmented ecosystems are more susceptible to pollinator limitations than congruent systems because ranges of pollinators no longer adequately overlap to facilitate travel between the ecosystem fragments. © 2011 by the Northwest Scientific Association.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959568545

In such environments, plants growing in dense stands comprising several species and thus exhibiting larger and more diverse flower displays may profit by attracting more visits from scarce alpine pollinators than do plants that grow alone or in patches only composed of conspecifics. To study whether aggregation of plants increases (facilitation) or decreases (competition) the attraction of pollinators, we measured the rate and numbers with which insects entered experimental plots in the Swiss Alps, and their behaviour at flowers in plots that they entered. The plots contained individuals of the blue-flowering cushion plant Eritrichium nanum, either alone or mixed with white- to yellowish-flowering Saxifraga species. Pollinators were generally rare: in 55% of 236 observation periods, no pollinators were observed. Over 95% of the pollinators were Diptera. The average probability of observing any insect at all was higher in plots that contained some Saxifraga flowers, including mixed plots, than in those containing only E. nanum flowers. However, although insects tended to choose Saxifraga as the first flower visited in mixed plots, in all other regards their visitation of Saxifraga and E. nanum flowers in such plots was statistically indistinguishable.

However, the reproductive biology of endemic, and often specialised, plants may require increased attention as climate change accelerates worldwide. Species of Roscoea endemic to the Himalayan region have striking orchid-like flowers with long corolla tubes, suggesting pollination by long-tongued insects. Until now, the reproductive biology of species of Roscoea has been poorly documented. We investigated the floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of R. cautleoides and R. humeana, from Hengduan Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We also tested whether floral longevity increases pollination success. Pollination experiments showed that the two species were self-compatible and depended on insects for fruit production. Over several flowering seasons we did not observe any potential pollinators with long tongues that matched the corolla tube visiting flowers in centres of distribution. The principal pollinators observed were pollen-collecting generalist bees, with low visitation frequencies. In general, members of the ginger family are characterised by short-lived (usually 1day) flowers, but flowers of R. cautleoides and R. humeana last 8 and 6days, respectively. Removing stigmas decreased fruit set in both study populations. Our results suggest that the original pollinators may have been long-tongued insects that are now absent from the Chinese Himalayas because habitats have responded to climate change. However, long-lived and self-compatible flowers, coupled with the presence of generalist pollinators, are traits that have allowed these gingers to reproduce and continue to persist in the alpine habitats. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Biodiversity hotspot; Compensatory floral mechanism; Conservation; Hengduan Mountains; Long-proboscid pollinator; Pollination syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958814635

Results show that an herbicide-susceptible L. rigidum population selected over three generations with below-label doses of glyphosate exhibited not only glyphosate resistance evolution but also a progressive and concomitant shift in sensitivity to the structurally unrelated herbicide paraquat. Thus, reduced paraquat sensitivity was a consequence of recurrent selection with glyphosate at low doses.

To address this question, a cryptically dioecious species, Petasites tricholobus, in which male and female plants each have two floret types that appear pistillate and hermaphroditic, was studied. The aim was to understand the function of sterile hermaphroditic florets in females. In addition, the first examination of functions of sterile female structures in male plants was conducted in the hermaphroditic florets on males of this species. These female structures are exceptionally large in this species despite being sterile. • Methods: Differences in floret morphology between the sex morphs were documented and the possible functions of sterile sex organs investigated using manipulative experiments. Tests were carried out to find out if sterile female structures in male florets attract pollinators and if they aid in pollen dispersal, also to find out if the presence and quantity of sterile hermaphroditic florets in females increase pollinator attraction and reproductive success. To investigate what floret types provide nectar, all types of florets were examined under a scanning electron microscope to search for nectaries. • Key Results: The sterile female structures in male florets did not increase pollinator visits but were essential to secondary pollen presentation, which significantly enhanced pollen dispersal. Sterile pistillate florets on male plants did not contribute to floral display and disappeared in nearly half of the male plants. The sterile hermaphroditic florets on female plants attracted pollinators by producing nectar and enhanced seed production. • Conclusions: The presence of female structures in male florets and hermaphroditic florets on female plants is adaptive despite being sterile, and may be evolutionarily stable. However, the pistillate florets on male plants appear non-adaptive and are presumably in decline. Differential fates of the sterile sex organs in the species are determined by both the historical constraints and the ecological functions. © The Author 2011.

Using controlled pollinations and sequencing of the S-RNase mating system gene, we test the compatibility status of a population of S. peruvianum located near its southern range limit. Pollinations among plants of known genotypes revealed strong self-incompatibility; fruit set following compatible pollinations was significantly higher than following incompatible pollinations for all tested individuals. Sequencing of the S-RNase gene in parents and progeny arrays was also as predicted under self-incompatibility. Molecular variation at the S-RNase locus revealed a diverse set of alleles, and heterozygosity in over 500 genotyped individuals. We used controlled crosses to test the specificity of sequences recovered in this study; in all cases, results were consistent with a unique allelic specificity for each tested sequence, including two alleles sharing 92% amino-acid similarity.

These native pollinators contribute to plant productivity and reproduction. We captured 12 species of bumble bees (437 individuals) at two sites during this study. The three most commonly captured species of Bombus at the first site (Red Mountain in the Targhee-Caribou National Forest) were B. rufocinctus Cresson, B. fervidus and B. melanopygus Nylander. Bombus fervidus dominated the trap catch at the second site (Lave Lake Land and Livestock) followed by B. rufocinctus and B. californicus consanguineus Smith. When numerous species of bumble bees co-occur on a given site, the community must have some mechanism for partitioning the available resources for the coexistence to occur. Along with temporal separation that was demonstrated by monthly differences in the capture of several of the individual species of bumble bees at both study sites, differences in capture of individual species of bumble bees was influenced by trap color. The differences observed among the species of Bombus we captured at the two sites may serve to limit competitive interactions among some of the species. Further, more bumble bees were captured in traps placed in the plots with the lowest percentage of sagebrush in the canopy. The results suggest that sagebrush steppe habitats can harbor a diverse community of native bumble bees and that multiple Bombus species can coexist on these sites. To maintain these diverse bumble bee communities, some portion of the sites should be managed to have little to no sagebrush in the canopy. © Pacific Coast Entomological Society 2011.",Artemesia; biodiversity; Bombus; pollination; species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855518414

Data were analyzed by applying parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The intergenic spacer trnS-G - only rarely used in monocot research - contributed a substantial number of potentially parsimony informative characters. Hypoxidaceae consist of three well-supported major clades, but their interrelationships remain unresolved.

Long-distance dispersal scenarios may also be likely for the current distribution of Hypoxis, which occurs on four continents. In the Curculigo clade, the present distribution of Curculigo s.s. on four continents could support a Gondwanan origin, but the level of divergence is too low for this hypothesis to be likely. The main clades correspond well with some floral characters, habit and palynological data, whereas chromosomal data exhibit plasticity and probably result from polyploidization and subsequent dysploidy and/or aneuploidy. Evolutionary flexibility is also suggested by the number of reported pollination syndromes: melittophily, myophily, sapromyophily, and cantharophily. Based on our phylogenetic results, we suggest cautious nomenclatural reorganization to generate monophyly at the generic level. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Asparagales; Biogeography; Character evolution; Phylogenetics; Pollination syndromes; TrnS-G spacer,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956361337

While landscape context and habitat quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees, there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees' responses to adaptive management across differently structured landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Agri-environment schemes; Bee conservation; Bombus spp.; Forage plants; Habitat quality; Land use; Pollinators; United Kingdom,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960383660

Few studies have examined the entire range of possible isolation barriers from geographic isolation to next generation hybrid viability. Here, we present a detailed analysis of isolation barriers between two flowering plant species of the genus Petunia (Solanaceae). Petunia integrifolia and P. axillaris feature divergent pollination syndromes but can produce fertile hybrids when crossed in the laboratory. Both Petunia species are primarily isolated in space but appear not to hybridize in sympatry. Our experiments demonstrate that pollinator isolation is very high but not strong enough to explain the absence of hybrids in nature. However, pollinator isolation in conjunction with male gametic isolation (i.e., pollen-pistil interaction) can explain the lack of natural hybridization, while postzygotic isolation barriers are low or nonexistent. Our study supports the notion that reproductive isolation in flowering plants is mainly caused by pre- rather than postzygotic isolation mechanisms. © 2011 The Author(s).

Sixth Street, Tucson, AZ 85719, United States","1.Shifts in the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering could affect the resources available to pollinators, and such shifts might become more common as climate change progresses. 2.As mid-summer temperatures have warmed, we found that a montane meadow ecosystem in the southern Rocky Mountains of the United States exhibits a trend toward a bimodal distribution of flower abundance, characterized by a mid-season reduction in total flower number, instead of a broad, unimodal flowering peak lasting most of the summer season. 3.We examined the shapes of community-level flowering curves in this system and found that the typical unimodal peak results from a pattern of complementary peaks in flowering among three distinct meadow types (dry, mesic and wet) within the larger ecosystem. However, high mid-summer temperatures were associated with divergent shifts in the flowering curves of these individual meadow types. Specifically, warmer summers appeared to cause increasing bimodality in mesic habitats, and a longer interval between early and late flowering peaks in wet and dry habitats. 4.Together, these habitat-specific shifts produced a longer mid-season valley in floral abundance across the larger ecosystem in warmer years. Because of these warming-induced changes in flowering patterns, and the significant increase in summer temperatures in our study area, there has been a trend toward non-normality of flowering curves over the period 1974-2009. This trend reflects increasing bimodality in total community-wide flowering. 5.The resulting longer periods of low flowering abundance in the middle of the summer season could negatively affect pollinators that are active throughout the season, and shifts in flowering peaks within habitats might create mismatches between floral resources and demand by pollinators with limited foraging ranges. 6.Synthesis. Early-season climate conditions are getting warmer and drier in the high altitudes of the southern Rocky Mountains. We present evidence that this climate change is disrupting flowering phenology within and among different moisture habitats in a sub-alpine meadow ecosystem, causing a mid-season decline in floral resources that might negatively affect mutualists, especially pollinators. Our findings suggest that climate change can have complex effects on phenology at small spatial scales, depending on patch-level habitat differences. © 2011 The Authors.

Fragmented populations can become highly differentiated due to reduced gene flow and genetic drift. A decline in number of individuals can result in lower reproductive fitness due to inbreeding effects. We investigated genetic variation within and between 11 populations of the rare and endangered plant Silene chlorantha in northeastern Germany to support conservation strategies. Genetic diversity was evaluated using AFLP techniques and the results were correlated to fitness traits. Fitness evaluation in nature and in a common garden approach was conducted. Our analysis revealed population differentiation was high and within population genetic diversity was intermediate. A clear population structure was supported by a Bayesian approach, amova and neighbour-joining analysis. No correlation between genetic and geographic distance was found. Our results indicate that patterns of population differentiation were mainly caused by temporal and/or spatial isolation and genetic drift. The fitness evaluation revealed that pollinator limitation and habitat quality seem, at present, to be more important to reproductive fitness than genetic diversity by itself. Populations of S. chlorantha with low genetic diversity have the potential to increase in individual number if habitat conditions improve.

Gene flow from the outside plays a pivotal role in the fate of these marginal populations. It has been proposed that spatial fragmentation and perceived geographic isolation do not necessarily reflect a loss of genetic connectivity in tree species. However, the spatial limits of long-distance gene flow, as well as its magnitude and impact, are still generally unknown. In the present study, we analyzed long-distance pollen-mediated gene flow into an isolated relict stand consisting of 7 individuals of Quercus robur L. based on a total sample of 177 trees and 9 microsatellite loci. We show that pollen-mediated gene flow across more than 80 km in this wind-pollinated tree species contributed at least 35% of all successful pollinations in the investigated isolated and small oak stand at the eastern limit of the species' distribution. The observed pollen immigration shaped the genetic diversity of acorn progenies in the stand and might explain the comparably high genetic diversity in the persisting adult population. © 2011 The American Genetic Association.

Transgene integration and copy number were assessed by Southern hybridisation. The primary transformants were allowed to self-pollinate and the expected Mendelian ratios were studied in second-generation progeny. Five independent homozygous lines each of HAL I and HAL II, as well as the control, were characterised to study inter-transformant expression variability.

High-altitude plants have single flowers, while meadow-forest plants sometimes have multiple flowers. Plants were grown for 3 years in a garden and supplied with eight times more nutrients than available in natural soils, given to controls. During the experiment, over 90% of all plants with excess nutrients flowered, while in controls, 40% (high-altitude) to 75-78% (meadow-forest) plants flowered.

Adventitious presence may occur in all arable farming, and at any step in the production of seeds or grain, or in processing of harvested product in the food/feed chain. As of today, there are no official thresholds governing the adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional seed lots in Europe. However, it is assumed that GM admixture in seed lots could have a considerable influence on the level of adventitious presence in the non-GM harvested product. The experiments highlighted in this paper aim at the consequences of adventitious presence of GM maize seeds in conventional seed lots. It is shown for varieties belonging to the same maturity group that the final GM rate (% seeds) in the harvest product is nearly same as the initial seed admixture (% seeds). This corresponds to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The variation depends mainly on the flowering coincidence, the site and climatic conditions. In cases where the admixed seeds are of different maturity group, the level of cross-pollination in the harvest product is reduced. Furthermore a comparison between the visual GM seed detection and real-time PCR detection was done. It is evident that the result of the real-time PCR detection method has a more variable uncertainty associated with its results than the visual seed testing method. The accuracy of prediction from % GM seed to % GM DNA depends on the reference material used for calibration curves. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Coexistence; Cross-pollination; Genetically modified (GM) maize; GM seed admixture; Real-time PCR detection (% DNA); Visual GM detection (% seeds),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958766762

The effects of four degrees of inbreeding (selfing, f50%; full- and half-sib matings, f25 and 12.5%; and unrelated outcrosses, f0%) on survival and growth of an island population of Eucalyptus globulus were studied at two sites for over 14 years. For selfs, ID in survival increased over time, reaching a maximum of 49% by age 14 years. However, their inbreeding depression for stem diameter remained relatively stable with age, and ranged from 28 to 36% across years and sites. ID for survival was markedly greater on the more productive site, possibly due to greater and earlier onset of inter-tree competition, but was similar on both sites for the diameter of survivors. The deleterious trait response to increasing inbreeding coefficients was linear for survival and diameter. Non-significant quadratic effects suggested that epistasis did not contribute considerably to the observed ID at the population level. Among- and within-family coefficients of variation for diameter increased with inbreeding degree, and the variance among the outcrossed families was significant only on the more productive site. The performance of self-families for diameter was highly stable between sites. This suggests that, for species with mixed mating systems, environmentally stable inbreeding effects in open-pollinated progenies may tend to mask the additive genotype-by-environment interaction for fitness traits and the adaptive response to the environment. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/11.",additive and non-additive genetic effects; age trends; genotype-by-environment interaction; inbreeding depression; outcrossing; selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959317792

These species are known from small populations in Mexico, northern South America, and the West Indies (Cuba and Haiti), respectively. Phinaea pulchella is one of the few members of the tribe Gloxinieae that occurs naturally in the West Indies and it is the only member of the tribe endemic to that region. It was rediscovered in Cuba in 2008, more than fifty years after it was last documented. Results from molecular data generated from the nrDNA ITS and cpDNA trnL-F regions strongly support that P. pulchella does not group with other Phinaea species and instead shares a recent common ancestor with Diastema vexans in a clade that is sister to Pearcea and Kohleria. The phylogenetic placement of P. pulchella suggests that radial floral symmetry and buzz-pollination is autapmorphic in this taxon. Our results strongly support convergence of radial symmetry and associated characters with buzz-pollination in the following taxa in the tribe Gloxinieae: Niphaea, Phinaea s. s., Phinaea pulchella, and Amalophyllon.

The honey bee larvae were subjected to ingestion of either pure larval diet (control), diluted larval diet (diluted control) or larval diet diluted in a Cry1Ac solution at a concentration compatible with the maximum possible field exposure. Although diluted diet slightly increased larval mortality, Cry1Ac ingestion did not affect survival, developmental time, and neither adult body mass nor size, indicating that GM plants are unlikely to significantly impair the development of honey bee larvae.

The results showed phylogenetic correspondence between closely related Ficus species with either savanna, forest, or riparian habitat categories, were most strongly explained by both climate and environmental variables.

Today they cause severe alterations of ecosystems and displace native biota. Due to their strong demand on carbohydrate-rich resources, they often exploit floral nectar of native Hawaiian plant species with largely unknown consequences for the plants' reproduction. We examined effects of flower-visiting invasive ants on reproduction of the endemic shrub Vaccinium reticulatum (Ericaceae) in Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. Ant densities in flowers were high and floral nectar was excessively exploited, which may lead to a reduced visitation rate of pollinators. However, the ants' presence on flowers strongly reduced flower parasitism by caterpillars of the introduced plume moth Stenoptilodes littoralis and thus decreased the loss of flowers and buds. This is, to our knowledge, the first documented mutualism between invasive ants and an endemic plant species in Hawai'i. Developed fruits of this partly self-incompatible plant, however, bore relatively low proportions of viable seeds, irrespective of the experimentally controlled visitor spectrum of the flowers. This may indicate that ants do not function as pollinators and that effective pollinators (probably Hylaeus bees) are scant or absent. © 2011 by University of Hawai'i Press All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960486829

The recent development and market dominance of hybrid canola cultivars provides an opportunity to reassess the relative competitive ability of canola cultivars with small-grain cereals. Direct-seeded (no-till) experiments were conducted at five western Canada locations from 2006 to 2008 to compare the competitive ability of canola cultivars vs. small-grain cereals. The relative competitive ability of the species and cultivars was determined by assessing monocot and dicot weed biomass at different times throughout the growing season as well as oat (simulated weed) seed production. Under most conditions, but especially under warm and relatively dry environments, barley cultivars had the greatest relative competitive ability. Rye and triticale were also highly competitive species under most environmental conditions. Canada Prairie Spring Red wheat and Canada Western Red Spring wheat cultivars usually were the least competitive cereal crops, but there were exceptions in some environments. Canola hybrids were more competitive than open-pollinated canola cultivars. More importantly, under cool, low growing degree day conditions, canola hybrids were as competitive as barley, especially with dicot weeds. Under most conditions, hybrid canola growers on the Canadian Prairies are well advised to avoid the additional selection pressure inherent with a second in-crop herbicide application. Combining competitive cultivars of any species with optimal agronomic practices that facilitate crop health will enhance cropping system sustainability and allow growers to extend the life of their valuable herbicide tools.",Alternative weed management; combined agronomic practices; cultural weed control; herbicides; integrated weed management; no-till; organic weed control; weed resistance; weed suppression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960178080

However, it has certain disadvantages as a model species compared with Arabidopsis thaliana, the eudicot species most widely used in plant sciences: first, it has a long cultivation time; and second, it requires considerably more space for growth. Here, we introduce a biotron breeding system, which allows rapid and reliable rice cultivation using a well-equipped artificial environmental chamber. This system involves use of regulation of CO 2 levels, removal of tillers and embryo rescue to overcome the disadvantages of rice cultivation. The rice cultivars Nipponbare, Koshihikari, Taichung 65 and Kasalath all showed vigorous growth and sufficient seed production in the biotron breeding system with accelerated flowering time. Nipponbare, which was the earliest among these cultivars, flowered at about 50 d after sowing. The life cycle of these plants could be further shortened using an embryo rescue technique on immature seeds at 7 d after pollination, thereby avoiding the lengthy process of seed maturation. Overall, it was possible to shorten the life cycle of Nipponbare to about 2 months under the controlled conditions. Furthermore, controlled crosses, which can be difficult with conventional cultivation methods, were easy to perform as we could control the exact timing of anther dehiscence. Thus, our biotron breeding system offers a valuable new approach to genetic and breeding studies in rice. © 2011 The Author.",CO 2 regulation; Controlled crosses; Embryo rescue; Generation time; Oryza sativa; Rice biotron breeding system,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960540478

The aim of this study was to explore changes in gender segregation and sex allocation by Pinus halepensis, a Mediterranean lowland pine tree, within tree crowns and between trees differing in their size or crown shape. • Methods: The production of new male and female cones and sex allocation of biomass, nitrogen and phosphorus were studied. The relationship between branch location, its reproductive status and proxies of branch vigour was also studied. • Key Results: Small trees produced only female cones, but, as trees grew, they produced both male and female cones. Female cones were produced mainly in the upper part of the crown, and male cones in its middle and lower parts. Lateral branch density was correlated with the number of male but not female cones; lateral branches were more dense in large than in small trees and even denser in hemispherical trees. Apical branches grew faster, were thicker and their phosphorus concentration was higher than in lateral shoots. Nitrogen concentration was higher in cone-bearing apical branches than in apical vegetative branches and in lateral branches with or without cones. Allocation to male relative to female function increased with tree size as predicted by sex allocation theory. • Conclusions: The adaptive values of sex allocation and gender segregation patterns in P. halepensis, in relation to its unique life history, are demonstrated and discussed. Small trees produce only female cones that have a higher probability of being pollinated than the probability of male cones pollinating; the female-first strategy enhances population spread. Hemispherical old trees are loaded with serotinous cones that supply enough seeds for post-fire germination; thus, allocation to males is more beneficial than to females. © The Author 2011.

However, neither the ontogeny of the hinged valve gap nor acquisition of PY by seeds of Geraniaceae has been studied previously. The aims of the present study were to investigate the physiological events related to acquisition of PY and the ontogeny of the hinged valve gap and seed coat of G. carolinianum. • Methods: Seeds of G. carolinianum were studied from the ovule stage until dispersal. The developmental stages of acquisition of germinability, physiological maturity and PY were determined by seed measurement, germination and imbibition experiments using intact seeds and isolated embryos of both fresh and slow-dried seeds. Ontogeny of the seed coat and water gap was studied using light microscopy. • Key Results: Developing seeds achieved germinability, physiological maturity and PY on days 9, 14 and 20 after pollination (DAP), respectively. The critical moisture content of seeds on acquisition of PY was 11 %. Slow-drying caused the stage of acquisition of PY to shift from 20 to 13 DAP. Greater extent of cell division and differentiation at the micropyle, water gap and chalaza than at the rest of the seed coat resulted in particular anatomical features. Palisade and subpalisade cells of varying forms developed in these sites. A clear demarcation between the water gap and micropyle is not evident due to their close proximity. • Conclusions: Acquisition of PY in seeds of G. carolinianum occurs after physiological maturity and is triggered by maturation drying. The micropyle and water gap cannot be considered as two separate entities, and thus it is more appropriate to consider them together as a 'micropyle-water-gap complex'. © The Author 2011.

In contrast, the annual species of this genus, which are often adapted to disturbed sites, are adichogamous selfers with low P/O ratios and wide distributions. According to the present reconstruction of the evolution of Erodium, recurrent perennial to annual shifts occurred from a time earlier than the establishment of the Mediterranean climate during the Pleistocene. The diversification of the terminal clades containing annuals and perennials is dated to 6.42 Mya, between the onset of the Messinian (Miocene) and the end of the Pliocene. By adapting to several types of breeding systems (mixed-mating and selfing), many species of Erodium were able to meet the challenges of climatic deterioration and the changes in pollinators that took place at the end of the Tertiary. High selfing and an annual lifespan seem to have evolved multiple times together, but reversions may also have occurred.

We used 5 variable nuclear simple sequence repeat nDNA loci to determine the extent of genet rhizome spread, examine the possibility of very small population sizes, and project how Bombus spp. (bumblebee) foraging may impact selfing (through geitonogamy) for a threatened lupine (Lupinus oreganus Heller) that sprawls through nonadventitious rhizomes. Genotyping identified 1 genet (27 × 13 m) that dominated about 30% of a study site, whereas 15 genets spread a maximum average distance of about 5.5 m (range 1.6 -27.1 m) and appeared to be well integrated with intervening genets. We found unexpectedly high genotype diversity, no evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck, and 5 of 6 patches had mean fixation index values that were near Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium expectations. If the median maximum Bombus foraging distance observed in lupine patches (1.2 m) occurred within genotyped populations, a typical foraging flight would have >80% chance of occurring between different genets.

Local regulations specify that 10% of the crop should be a non-GM cultivar as refuge area for biodiversity, and the distance from other non-GM maize crops should be more than 250 m in order to avoid cross-pollination. However, the degree of cross-fertilization between maize crops in Uruguay is unknown. The level of adventitious presence of GM material in non-GM crops is a relevant issue for organic farming, in situ conservation of genetic resources and seed production. In the research reported here, the occurrence and frequency of cross-fertilization between commercial GM and non-GM maize crops in Uruguay was assessed. The methodology comprised field sampling and detection using DAS-ELISA and PCR. Five field-pair cases where GM maize crops were grown near non-GM maize crops were identified. These cases had the potential to cross-fertilize considering the distance between crops and the similarity of the sowing dates. Adventitious presence of GM material in the offspring of non-GM crops was found in three of the five cases. Adventitious presence of event MON810 or Bt11 in non-GM maize, which were distinguished using specific primers, matched the events in the putative sources of transgenic pollen. Percentages of transgenic seedlings in the offspring of the non-GM crops were estimated as 0.56%, 0.83% and 0.13% for three sampling sites with distances of respectively 40, 100 and 330 m from the GM crops. This is a first indication that adventitious presence of transgenes in non-GM maize crops will occur in Uruguay if isolation by distance and/or time is not provided.

The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo haploid induction ability of three temperate inducers crossed to a diverse set of tropical maize source germplasm under tropical conditions. Three experiments were conducted employing inducers as male parents to pollinate 120 source germplasm in three environments in Mexico. Haploid induction rates (HIR) obtained under field conditions were determined with two different haploid identification systems. Highly significant genotypic differences were detected among inducers and source germplasm for HIR but no interactions were observed between the two factors. Mean HIR under tropical conditions were similar to those reported for evaluations under temperate conditions indicating that temperate inducers can be employed for initiation of DH breeding programs in the tropics. Misclassification of diploids as haploids resulted in inflated HIR, particularly in highly variable source germplasm such as landraces or when expression of the identification marker was weak. We conclude that induction of haploidy is not a limiting factor for DH line production in tropical maize, but there is a need for the development of well-adapted tropical inducers. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959588651

Maternal haploid induction depends primarily on the inducer used as a pollinator. However, the source germplasm used as a maternal parent and the environmental conditions for induction may also influence haploid induction and these aspects have not been examined in tropical maize so far. The objectives of our study were to (i) monitor the variation for haploid induction rate (HIR) among diverse source germplasm in tropical maize, (ii) determine the relative importance of general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining abilities for HIR, and (iii) investigate the influence of summer and winter seasons and genotype × season interactions on this trait. Ten inbreds were mated in a half diallel design. The resulting 45 F1 single crosses were pollinated with the haploid inducer hybrid RWS × UH400 during the summer 2008 and winter 2009 seasons in a lowland tropical environment in Mexico. HIR of the single crosses averaged over seasons ranged from 2. 90 to 9.66% with an overall mean of 6.74%. Mean HIR was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher during the winter (7.37%) than summer season (6.11%). Significant (P &lt; 0.01) variation was observed due to GCA effects of parental inbreds of single crosses but not for SCA, GCA × season and SCA × season interactions. Our study underpins that a higher HIR in tropical maize can be obtained by selecting appropriate source germplasm and undertaking pollination under favorable environmental conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Diallel crosses; General combining ability; Haploid induction rate; Maize; Season; Tropical source germplasm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958773433

Well-established methods exist to calculate it from age- or stage-classified demographic data. As an expectation, R0 provides no information on variability; empirical measurements of lifetime reproduction universally show high levels of variability, and often positive skewness among individuals. This is often interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity, and thus of an opportunity for natural selection. However, variability provides evidence of heterogeneity only if it exceeds the level of variability to be expected in a cohort of identical individuals all experiencing the same vital rates. Such comparisons require a way to calculate the statistics of lifetime reproduction from demographic data. Here, a new approach is presented, using the theory of Markov chains with rewards, obtaining all the moments of the distribution of lifetime reproduction. The approach applies to age- or stage-classified models, to constant, periodic, or stochastic environments, and to any kind of reproductive schedule. As examples, I analyze data from six empirical studies, of a variety of animal and plant taxa (nematodes, polychaetes, humans, and several species of perennial plants). © 2011 Hal Caswell.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959635349

Therefore, we assessed the flower visitors of five tree species in a restored area of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, in Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. The specimens were collected using entomological net on flowers of Acacia polyphylla, Aegiphila sellowianna, Croton floribundus, Croton urucurana and Schinus terebinthifolius from October 2007 to September 2008. A total of 139 insect species belonging to five orders were collected. Hymenoptera was the most diverse order collected. From a total of 37 families, Vespidae (15 species), Cabronidae (12), Apidae (10), Halictidae (10), Syrphidae (12), Tachinidae (6) and Hesperidae (7) were the richest ones. Schinus terebinthifolius flowers presented the most abundant and diverse insect visitors (60), suggesting it is an important attractive species to the fauna in restoration programs. Our data suggest that mutualistic interactions between some of these plants and their flower-visiting insects may be in a reinstatement process, and will support the design and monitoring of future restoration efforts. © 2011 Sociedade Entomologica do Brasil.",Insect inventory; Insect-plant interaction; Pollinator; Restoration indicator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053257920

Our objectives were to assess the potential of open-pollinated COPOP1 semidwarf corn for grain and forage production, estimate genetic variances and heritability in COPOP1, and develop COPOP1 subpopulations that exhibit heterosis. In 2005 and 2006, we evaluated COPOP1 with four commercial, nondwarf hybrids at three plant population densities. Grain yield of open-pollinated COPOP1 was about half of the mean yield of the conventional hybrids. However, COPOP1 had lower grain moisture (equivalent to 62 d RM) and better forage quality than the commercial hybrids. In 2007, COPOP1 was evaluated for performance when crossed to two divergent inbred testers, LH227 and LH295. Heritability was significant for grain moisture, plant height, and ear height in testcrosses to both testers but was significant for grain yield only in testcrosses to LH227. In 2009, bulk Cycle 0 (i.e., original COPOP1) and Cycle 1 testcrosses, nine semidwarf hybrids, COPOP1, and three commercial hybrids were evaluated at two plant population densities. Grain yield and most agronomic and forage traits did not improve between Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 in either testcross population. None of the semidwarf hybrids had higher grain yields than COPOP1.

However, at present, very little is known about the diversity and ecology of bacteria occurring in non-domesticated bees like bumblebees, which are of similar importance as honeybees for the pollination of agricultural and wild flowers. To fill this gap in knowledge, we examined six of the most common bumblebee species in Central Europe from three locations in Germany and Switzerland for their bacterial communities. We used a culture-independent molecular approach based on sequencing the 16S rRNA gene from a selection of individuals and examining a larger number of samples by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles. The gut flora was dominated by very few and mostly undescribed groups of bacteria belonging to the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. This core set of bacteria was present in all of the examined bumblebee species. These bacteria are similar to, but distinct from, bacteria previously described from the honeybee gut. Significant differences were observed between the communities of bacteria in the different bumblebee species; the effect of sampling location was less strong. A novel group of Betaproteobacteria additionally shows evidence for host species-specific genotypes. The gut flora of bumblebees therefore is apparently composed of relatively few highly specialized bacteria, indicating a strong interaction and possibly important functions with their hosts. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960597239

However, they do exist in meliponine bees (Apidae, Apinae, Meliponini), commonly known as stingless bees, which represent a group of important pollinators in tropical forests. Worker bees of several Neotropical meliponine species, especially in the genus Scaptotrigona Moure 1942, deposit pheromone paths on substrates between highly profitable resources and their nest. In contrast to past results and claims, we find that these pheromone paths are not an indispensable condition for successful recruitment but rather a means to increase the success of recruiters in persuading their nestmates to forage food at a particular location. Our results are relevant to a speciation theory in scent path-laying meliponine bees, such as Scaptotrigona. In addition, the finding that pheromone path-laying bees are able to recruit to food locations even across barriers such as large bodies of water affects tropical pollination ecology and theories on the evolution of resource communication in insect societies with a flying worker caste. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Communication; Evolution; Flying worker caste; Orientation; Pheromone trail,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959315360

The proteomic profiling of Ga1-S silks pollinated with Ga1-S and ga1 pollen was investigated for isolating genes involved in cross incompatibility in maize. Two near isogenic lines on Ga1-S locus, W22 (GG) and w22 (gg), were used to make reciprocally crosses of GG × GG, gg × GG, and GG × gg. The behaviours of pollen tube growth in the 3 crosses were compared under a fluorescence microscopy, and the proteomic profiles of total silk proteins in W22 (GG) were compared 10 h after pollination by GG or gg pollen. The total silk proteins of GG × GG and GG × gg crosses were extracted using TCA/Acetone method, separated through electrophoresis in 2-dimensional gels, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The results indicated that gg pollen grains germinated well and the pollen tubes were able to enter the GG silk transmitting tract. However, no gg pollen tube reached GG ovule area, which resulted in incompatibility.

Recognition of pollen by pistils expressing cognate specificities at two linked genes leads to rejection of self pollen and pollen from close relatives, i.e., to avoidance of selffertilization and inbred matings, and thus increased outcrossing. These genes generally have many alleles, yet the conditions allowing the evolution of new alleles remain mysterious. Evolutionary changes are clearly necessary in both genes, since any mutation affecting only one of them would result in a nonfunctional self-compatible haplotype. Here, we study diversification at the S-locus (i.e., a stable increase in the total number of SI haplotypes in the population, through the incorporation of new SI haplotypes), both deterministically (by investigating analytically the fate of mutations in an infinite population) and by simulations of finite populations. We show that the conditions allowing diversification are far less stringent in finite populations with recurrent mutations of the pollen and pistil genes, suggesting that diversification is possible in a panmictic population. We find that new SI haplotypes emerge fastest in populations with few SI haplotypes, and we discuss some implications for empirical data on S-alleles. However, allele numbers in our simulations never reach values as high as observed in plants whose SI systems have been studied, and we suggest extensions of our models that may reconcile the theory and data. © 2011 by the Genetics Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960111012

However, quality protein maize (QPM) which is available today contains the opaque-2 gene (o 2o 2) for double tryptophan content in the endosperm along with numerous modifiers for kernel vitreousness. The objectives of this study were: 1) to convert normal inbred lines to QPM inbred lines by the backcross method and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the opaque-2 gene and 2) to estimate the combining ability of QPM inbred lines for yield and some agronomic characters. Crosses were made between normal maize and QPM as female and male parents, respectively. These were backcrossed to the recurrent parent. By the marker phi057, it was shown that all F 1 were heterozygous (O 2o 2) while the BC 1F 1 progenies of Agron20 × Pop65C 6-46 and Agron29 × Pop65C 6-55 had 1:1 ratio of homozygous dominant (O 2O 2) to heterozygous (O 2o 2).

In Collinsia heterophylla, a largely outcrossing species with delayed stigma receptivity, we performed a series of controlled crosses involving several donors to understand how timing of pollen deposition influences siring ability, paternal diversity, and offspring fitness. Methods: Pollen was applied to fully receptive stigmas either as mixtures or consecutively with or without a time lag to mimic cases with early or delayed stigma receptivity. We used a genetic marker to assess offspring paternity. Key results: As expected, siring ability was affected by application order in crosses without a time lag, providing a first-donor advantage for pollen arriving on unreceptive stigmas. However, because pollen donor identity influenced siring ability, delaying stigma receptivity may still favor pollen of high competitive ability. In crosses on fully receptive pistils with a time lag of 24 h, a surprisingly high proportion of seeds (12-47%) were sired by pollen applied last. A novel finding was that pollen applied only once (as a mixture), mimicking delayed stigma receptivity, led to higher paternal diversity within progeny families, which was associated with increased seed production. Conclusions: Our results suggest fitness advantages of enhancing pollen competition by delaying stigma receptivity in C. heterophylla, particularly in relation to increased paternal diversity. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Collinsia heterophylla; Cryptic self-incompatibility; Delayed stigma receptivity; Differential resource allocation; Mate choice; Mixed-mating system; Paternal diversity; Pollen competition; Pollen deposition; Pollen load size,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155168629

At this biodiversity hotspot, forest surface is becoming increasingly fragmented due to unregulated logging, clearing for pastures and replacement by exotic tree plantations. Decrease in patch size, increased isolation and ""edge effects"" can influence the persistence of forest species in remnant fragments. We assessed how these variables affect local density for six forest birds, chosen to include the most important seed dispersers (four species) and bird pollinators (two species, one of which acts also as seed disperser), plus the most common insectivore (Aphrastura spinicauda). Based on cue-count point surveys (8 points per fragment), we estimated bird densities for each species in 22 forest fragments of varying size, shape, isolation and internal-habitat structure (e.g. tree size and epiphyte cover). Bird densities varied with fragment connectivity (three species) and shape (three species), but none of the species was significantly affected by patch size. Satellite image analyses revealed that, from 1985 to 2008, forested area decreased by 8.8% and the remaining forest fragments became 16% smaller, 58-73% more isolated and 11-50% more regular. During that period, bird density estimates for the northern part of Chiloé (covering an area of 1214.75 km2) decreased for one species (elaenia), increased for another two (chucao and hummingbird) and did not vary for three (rayadito, thrust and blackbird). For the first three species, changes in patch features respectively exacerbated, balanced and overcame the effects of forest loss on bird population size (landscape-level abundance). Hence, changes in patch features can modulate the effect of habitat fragmentation on forest birds, suggesting that spatial planning (guided by spatially-explicit models) can be an effective tool to facilitate their conservation. © 2011 Magrach et al.

Coffea (coffee; Rubiaceae) is a genus of old-world tropical understory trees in which the vast majority of diploid species utilize a mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI). The S-RNase GSI system was one of the first SI mechanisms to be biochemically characterized, and likely represents the ancestral Eudicot condition as evidenced by its functional characterization in both asterid (Solanaceae, Plantaginaceae) and rosid (Rosaceae) lineages. The S-RNase GSI mechanism employs the activity of class III RNase T2 proteins to terminate the growth of ""self"" pollen tubes. Here, we investigate the mechanism of Coffea GSI and specifically examine the potential for homology to S-RNase GSI by sequencing class III RNase T2 genes in populations of 14 African and Madagascan Coffea species and the closely related self-compatible species Psilanthus ebracteolatus. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences aligned to a diverse sample of plant RNase T2 genes show that the Coffea genome contains at least three class III RNase T2 genes. Patterns of tissue-specific gene expression identify one of these RNase T2 genes as the putative Coffea S-RNase gene. We show that populations of SI Coffea are remarkably polymorphic for putative S-RNase alleles, and exhibit a persistent pattern of trans-specific polymorphism characteristic of all S-RNase genes previously isolated from GSI Eudicot lineages. We thus conclude that Coffea GSI is most likely homologous to the classic Eudicot S-RNase system, which was retained since the divergence of the Rubiaceae lineage from an ancient SI Eudicot ancestor, nearly 90 million years ago. © 2011 Nowak et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959468400

Fast and synchronous emergence of silks probably is the key to high kernel set but non-destructive methods to follow the temporal grain set were missing. We solved this problem by marking flint kernels on the ears of sweet maize to reflect daily kernel set, as modern sweet maize is quite similar in vigor to field maize in Thailand. The effects of mild pre-anthesis drought stress and of the genotype were examined in two experiments (over two years both). The highest number of kernels resulted from pollination on the first or second day of silking. More than 90% of the kernels per ear were usually set by day four or five. Mild drought stress reduced the number of kernel-bearing positions along the ear as well as the number of kernels per position on each day of pollination in 2007 but there was no significant deviation in the principal grain set curve. As a consequence of mild drought stress, the differences in daily kernel set between the two water regimes were rather small compared to the differences among genotypes, for which genotype-specific deviations from the general pattern of daily kernel set were observed. Most important, a new tool exists now to reliably study variable stress situations, using normal grains on sweet maize ears or yellow grains on white grain ears as visual marker systems.",Drought stress; Flowering dynamics; Kernel set; Sweet maize; Visual markers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959399794

Here we investigated the coconut's domestication history and its population genetic structure as it relates to human dispersal patterns. A sample of 1,322 coconut accessions, representing the geographical and phenotypic diversity of the species, was examined using ten microsatellite loci. Bayesian analyses reveal two highly genetically differentiated subpopulations that correspond to the Pacific and Indo-Atlantic oceanic basins. This pattern suggests independent origins of coconut cultivation in these two world regions, with persistent population structure on a global scale despite long-term human cultivation and dispersal. Pacific coconuts show additional genetic substructure corresponding to phenotypic and geographical subgroups; moreover, the traits that are most clearly associated with selection under human cultivation (dwarf habit, self-pollination, and ""niu vai"" fruit morphology) arose only in the Pacific. Coconuts that show evidence of genetic admixture between the Pacific and Indo-Atlantic groups occur primarily in the southwestern Indian Ocean. This pattern is consistent with human introductions of Pacific coconuts along the ancient Austronesian trade route connecting Madagascar to Southeast Asia. Admixture in coastal east Africa may also reflect later historic Arab trading along the Indian Ocean coastline.

A factorial experiment was conducted with a RCBD which included 3 irrigations factors, 6 genotype factors and 3 replications. Seeds were prepared from controlled pollination of the bagged trees (after emasculation and flower isolation using isolator packets in the previous year).

Leaf and root morphological and physiological traits including; midday relative water content, midday leaf (xylem) water potential, shoot dry weight and growth, total leaf area, leaf size, total leaf dry weight, specific leaf area, leaf greenness (SPAD), stomatal size and density, root and leaf nitrogen content and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured throughout the study. Results showed the six genotypes had different reactions to water stress but all genotypes showed an ability to tolerate the moderate and severe stresses and they showed different degrees of response time to drought stress. Almond seedling leaves could tolerate ?w between -3 and -4MPa in short periods. Water availability did not significantly affect stomatal density and size of young almond plants. The analysis of leaf anatomical traits and water relations showed the different strategies for almond genotypes under water stress conditions. Although almond seedlings even in severe stress kept their leaves, they showed a reduction in size to compensate for the stress effects. All genotypes managed to recover from moderate stress so ?w=-1.2 could be tolerated well by almond seedlings but ?w=-1.8 limited young plant growth. Leaf greenness, leaf size, shoot growth, shoot DW, TLDW and stomatal density were not good markers for drought resistance in almond seedlings. Root DW/LA, lower stomatal size and lower SLA might be related to drought resistance in cultivated almonds. Butte had the least resistance and White showed better performance during water stress while other genotypes were intermediate. Bitter seedlings showed no superiority in comparison with other genotypes under water stress conditions except for better germination and greater root DW which might make them suitable as rootstocks under irrigation conditions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Drought tolerance; Leaf water potential; Morphological markers; Prunus dulcis Mill; Stomatal size and density,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956351411

The species show differences in galling habits and exhibit apterous, winged or dimorphic males. The large gall inducers oviposit early in syconium development and lay few eggs; the small gall inducers lay more eggs soon after pollination; the ostiolar gall-inducers enter the syconium to oviposit and the cleptoparasites oviposit in galls induced by other fig wasps. The systematics of the group remains unclear and only one phylogeny based on limited sampling has been published to date. Here we present an expanded phylogeny for sycophagine fig wasps including about 1.5 times the number of described species. We sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear markers (4.2 kb) on 73 species and 145 individuals and conducted maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. We then used this phylogeny to reconstruct the evolution of Sycophaginae life-history strategies and test if the presence of winged males and small brood size may be correlated. Results: The resulting trees are well resolved and strongly supported. With the exception of Apocrytophagus, which is paraphyletic with respect to Sycophaga, all genera are monophyletic. The Sycophaginae are divided into three clades: (i) Eukoebelea; (ii) Pseudidarnes, Anidarnes and Conidarnes and (iii) Apocryptophagus, Sycophaga and Idarnes. The ancestral states for galling habits and male morphology remain ambiguous and our reconstructions show that the two traits are evolutionary labile. Conclusions: The three main clades could be considered as tribes and we list some morphological characters that define them. The same biologies re-evolved several times independently, which make Sycophaginae an interesting model to test predictions on what factors will canalize the evolution of a particular biology. The ostiolar gall-inducers are the only monophyletic group. In 15 Myr, they evolved several morphological adaptations to enter the syconia that make them strongly divergent from their sister taxa. Sycophaginae appears to be another example where sexual selection on male mating opportunities favored winged males in species with small broods and wingless males in species with large broods. However, some species are exceptional in that they lay few eggs but exhibit apterous males, which we hypothesize could be due to other selective pressures selecting against the re-appearance of winged morphs. © 2011 Cruaud et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959367576

Both genera originated in the Americas, and their diversity dispersion center is in Mexico. Ten species of Peponapis and ten species of Cucurbita (only non-domesticated species) were analyzed considering the similarity of their ecological niche characteristics with respect to climatic conditions of their occurrence areas (abiotic variables) and interactions between species (biotic variables). The similarity of climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) was estimated through cluster analyses. The areas of potential occurrence of the most similar species were obtained through ecological niche modeling and summed with geographic information system tools. Three main clusters were obtained: one with species that shared potential occurrence areas mainly in deserts (P. pruinosa, P. timberlakei, C. digitata, C. palmata, C. foetidissima), another in moist forests (P. limitaris, P. atrata, C. lundelliana, C. o. martinezii) and a third mainly in dry forests (C. a. sororia, C. radicans, C. pedatifolia, P. azteca, P. smithi, P. crassidentata, P. utahensis). Some species with similar ecological niche presented potential shared areas that are also similar to their geographical distribution, like those occurring predominantly on deserts. However, some clustered species presented larger geographical areas, such as P. pruinosa and C. foetidissima suggesting other drivers than climatic conditions to shape their distributions. The domestication of Cucurbita and also the natural history of both genera were considered also as important factors. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Ecological niche modeling; Interspecific interaction; Pollinators; Specialized species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955974330

It has been suggested that this asymmetric -or disassortative- assemblage could play an important role in determining the observed equal susceptibility of specialist and generalist plants under habitat destruction. At the core of the analysis of the phenomenon lies the observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction, could cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with a few generalist pollinators. We present a theoretical framework that supports this thesis. We analyze a dynamical model of a system of mutualistic plants and pollinators, subject to the destruction of their habitat. We analyze and compare two families of interaction topologies, ranging from highly assortative to highly disassortative ones, as well as real pollination networks. We found that several features observed in natural systems are predicted by the mathematical model. First, there is a tendency to increase the asymmetry of the network as a result of the extinctions. Second, an entropy measure of the differential susceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist species show that they tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally, the disappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that specialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an assortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption. © 2011 Abramson et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958830329

In the context of Genetically Modified Organisms, approaches to quantify geneflow in small-scale systems are widely unexplored. We aimed at bridging this gap by contributing to the scientific discussion on the uncertainties of the cultivation of genetically modified (GM) crops in the region. The safety issue is: Would it be possible to withdraw a variety in case that unexpected and undesirable effects occur? e.g. the resistance of pests which make the variety no more useful. Methods: We used a GIS approach to determine the location of maize cultivation sites, field geometries and applied a model for the calculation of geneflow scenarios. Results: The data revealed that the given cropping density provides optimal conditions for transgene spread, potentially limiting the possibility for coexistence between GM and non-GM fields. On average, we found about 60 fields within a nearest distance of 100 m, and cropping density of 56 fields per square kilometer. The resulting cross-pollination rate from the single GM field into the neighbouring conventional fields was estimated to be about 0.12%. Conclusions: GM varieties if introduced could remain in cultivation even if their admission has expired or has been retracted. This would be undesirable and could cause long-term, undesirable stacked combination of transgenes which cannot be tested with respect to eventual combinatory effects. These developments pose major challenges for fielder livelihoods, and conservation of maize genetic resources with potentially negative consequences for the African food export sector. © 2011 Meyer; licensee Springer.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958218674

Despite a requirement for non-GM food, especially for export, there is no system for coexistence of GM and non-GM crop. Gene flow is a major contributor to commingling, and different distances of cross-pollination have been recorded for maize, using a variety of field-trial designs under different environmental conditions, with the furthest distance being 650 m. However, these trials have usually been small plots and not on the scale of commercial farming. There are also no published data regarding the extent of cross-pollination for maize in South Africa, even after a decade of commercialization of GM. Thus, the aim of this study, conducted from 2005 to 2007, was to determine the extent of GM maize cross-pollination under South African conditions in the context of commercial farming practice. Materials and methods: Field trials were planted with a central plot of yellow GM maize (0.0576 ha) surrounded by white non-GM maize (13.76 ha), in two different geographic regions over two seasons with temporal and spatial isolations to surrounding commercial maize planting. Cross-pollination from GM to non-GM maize was determined phenotypically across 16 directional transects. Pollen counts during flowering were compared to weather data as well as percentage cross-pollination. The data were transformed logarithmically, and mean percentage cross-pollination was compared to high cross-pollination. Results and discussion: Although there was a general congruency between wind data, pollen load and crosspollination, it is evident that wind data and pollen load do not solely explain the directional extent of crosspollination and that swirling winds may have contributed to this incongruence. Based on the logarithmic equations of cross-pollination over distance, 45 m is sufficient to minimize cross-pollination to between <1.0% and 0.1%, 145 m for <0.1% to 0.01% and 473 m for <0.01% to 0.001%. However, compared to this, a theoretical isolation distance of 135 m is required to ensure a minimum level of cross-pollination between <1.0% and 0.1%, 503 m for <0.1% to 0.01% and 1.8 km for <0.01% to 0.001% based on high values of cross-pollination. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, the use of mean values of cross-pollination over distance may result in an underestimation of gene flow. Where stringent control of gene flow is required, for example, for non-GM seed production or for GM field trials under contained use, the high values of cross-pollination should be used to determine isolation distance. However, this may not be practical in terms of the isolation distance required. We therefore suggest that temporal and distance isolations be combined, taking into account the GM maize pollen sources within the radius of the most stringent isolation distance required. © 2011 Meyer; licensee Springer.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958206286

Therefore, it is necessary to develop B. juncea lines with canola-quality FAP, carrying reduced erucic acid (&lt;1%) and increased oleic acid (&gt;50%). To improve the FAP, B. juncea accessions were hybridised with spring-type canola (B. napus) varieties grown in Australia. Interspecific crosses between three B. napus cultivars (?) and B. juncea accessions (?) gave crossability of 50-65%. Embryo culturing on Lichter medium overcame post-germination barriers to obtain F1 plants. Culturing of ovules 21 days after pollination was successful and embryos were independent of hormones in the culture medium and directly developed into plants. Seeds of interspecific hybrids had a FAP different from parental values, particularly for oleic and erucic acids. The low oleic acid (13%) in B. juncea increased to 23-26% in hybrids and high erucic acid in B. juncea (41%) declined to 21-23% in hybrids. Linoleic and linolenic acids showed little variation from parental values. FAP of F1 hybrids shifted towards that of canola quality. The F2 seeds had zero erucic acid and high oleic acid similar to or exceeding the canola parent. Successful interspecific hybridisation of B. juncea and B. napus was confirmed by altered FAP and molecular markers. Embryo rescue in interspecific hybrids of B. juncea and B. napus is a simple, powerful biotechnological tool to increase genetic diversity and transcend species barriers to transfer desired genes, between the species. By implementing a crossing strategy, there is a potential to improve the FAP of Sri Lankan mustard towards the canola type. © CSIRO 2011.",canola quality mustard; embryo rescue; erucic acid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958165979

Recently, honey bee populations in the United States, Canada, and Europe have suffered an unexplained increase in annual losses due to a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Epidemiological analysis of CCD is confounded by a relative dearth of bee pathogen field studies. To identify what constitutes an abnormal pathophysiological condition in a honey bee colony, it is critical to have characterized the spectrum of exogenous infectious agents in healthy hives over time. We conducted a prospective study of a large scale migratory bee keeping operation using high-frequency sampling paired with comprehensive molecular detection methods, including a custom microarray, qPCR, and ultra deep sequencing. We established seasonal incidence and abundance of known viruses, Nosema sp., Crithidia mellificae, and bacteria. Ultra deep sequence analysis further identified four novel RNA viruses, two of which were the most abundant observed components of the honey bee microbiome (?1011 viruses per honey bee). Our results demonstrate episodic viral incidence and distinct pathogen patterns between summer and winter time-points.

Dichogamy in a single flower may reduce autogamy but, to avoid geitonogamy, plants must show flowering synchronization among all their flowers (i.e. synchronous dichogamy). It is hypothesized that one species would not simultaneously show synchronous dichogamy and self-incompatibility because they are redundant mechanisms to reduce selfing; however, this has not been accurately assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings: This expectation was tested over two years in two natural populations of the closely related Mediterranean spurges Euphorbia boetica and E. nicaeensis, which completely avoid autogamy by protogyny at the cyathia level. Both spurges showed a high population synchrony (Z<79), and their inflorescences flower synchronously. In E. nicaeensis, there was no overlap among the cyathia in anthesis of successive inflorescence levels and the overlap between sexual phases of cyathia of the same inflorescence level was uncommon (4-16%). In contrast, E. boetica showed a high overlap among consecutive inflorescence levels (74-93%) and between sexual phases of cyathia of the same inflorescence level (48-80%). The flowering pattern of both spurges was consistent in the two populations and over the two successive years. A hand-pollination experiment demonstrated that E. nicaeensis was strictly self-compatible whereas E. boetica was partially self-incompatible. Conclusions/Significance: We propose that the complex pattern of synchronized protogyny in E. nicaeensis prevents geitonogamous crosses and, consequently, avoids selfing and inbreeding depression. In E. boetica, a high probability of geitonogamous crosses may occur but, alternatively, this plant escapes selfing through a self-incompatibility response. We posit that synchronous dichogamy and physiological self-incompatibility do not co-occur in the same species because each process is sufficiently effective in avoiding self-fertilization. © 2011 Narbona et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957968346

Increased inbreeding has important consequences for floral morphology, population genetic structure and genome evolution. The transition to selfing is usually characterized by a marked reduction in flower size and the loss of traits involved in pollinator attraction and the avoidance of self-fertilization. Here, we use short-read sequencing to assemble, de novo, the floral transcriptomes of three genotypes of Eichhornia paniculata, including an outcrosser and two genotypes from independently derived selfers, and a single genotype of the sister species E. paradoxa. By sequencing mRNA from tissues sampled at various stages of flower development, our goal was to sequence and assemble the floral transcriptome and identify differential patterns of gene expression.Results: Our 24 Mbp assembly resulted in ~27,000 contigs that averaged ~900 bp in length. All four genotypes had highly correlated gene expression, but the three E. paniculata genotypes were more correlated with one another than each was to E. paradoxa. Our analysis identified 269 genes associated with floral development, 22 of which were differentially expressed in selfing lineages relative to the outcrosser. Many of the differentially expressed genes affect floral traits commonly altered in selfing plants and these represent a set of potential candidate genes for investigating the evolution of the selfing syndrome.Conclusions: Our study is among the first to demonstrate the use of Illumina short read sequencing for de novo transcriptome assembly in non-model species, and the first to implement this technology for comparing floral transcriptomes in outcrossing and selfing plants. © 2011 Ness et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957930642

In vitro techiques provide a lot of advantages for breeders. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of growth regulators and immature embryo age on embryo germination and rapid generation advancement in different tomato genotypes. For this purpose, four different tomato genotypes were used. Immature embryos were derived from fruits 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36 days after pollination. Fruits were left on the plant to mature as control (conventional breeding cycle). MS, MS + 0.1 mg/l kinetin, MS + 0.1 mg/l IAA and MS + 0.1 mg/l kinetin + 0.1 mg/l IAA were used as growth regulators. Growth regulators and genotypes resulted in nonsignificant effect on germination rate and rapid generation advancement, but embryo age resulted in significant effect. Germination rate from immature embryos ranged between 55.22 and 100%. Twenty eight (28) and thirty two (32) days old embryos gave the best germination rate. Days from pollination to flowering, shortened between 53,36 and 63,96 days in comparison with the conventional breeding cycle.

Bees have been a model system for sociality and group behavior for decades but only recently have molecular techniques been brought to study this fascinating and valuable organism. With the release of the first draft of its genome in 2006, proteomics of bees became feasible and over the past five years we have amassed in excess of 5E+6 MS/MS spectra. The lack of a consolidated platform to organize this massive resource hampers our ability, and that of others, to mine the information to its maximum potential.Results: Here we introduce the Honey Bee PeptideAtlas, a web-based resource for visualizing mass spectrometry data across experiments, providing protein descriptions and Gene Ontology annotations where possible. We anticipate that this will be helpful in planning proteomics experiments, especially in the selection of transitions for selected reaction monitoring. Through a proteogenomics effort, we have used MS/MS data to anchor the annotation of previously undescribed genes and to re-annotate previous gene models in order to improve the current genome annotation.Conclusions: The Honey Bee PeptideAtlas will contribute to the efficiency of bee proteomics and accelerate our understanding of this species.

Identifying historical effects of warming on maize growth is particularly important in Mozambique because national food security is highly dependent on domestic food production, most of which is grown in already warm to hot environments. Warming temperatures speed plant development, shortening the length of growth periods necessary for optimum plant and grain size. This faster phenological development also alters the timing of maximum plant water demand. In hot growing environments, temperature increases during maize pollination threaten to make midseason crop failure the norm. In addition to creating a harsher thermal environment, we find that early season temperature increases have caused the maize reproductive period to start earlier, increasing the risk of heat and water stress. Declines in time to maize maturation suggest that, independent of effects to water availability, yield potential is becoming increasingly limited by warming itself. Regional variations in effects are a function of the timing and magnitude of temperature increases and growing season characteristics. Continuation of current climatic trends could induce substantial yield losses in some locations. Farmers could avoid some losses through simple changes to planting dates and maize varietal types. © Inter-Research 2011.",Climate change; Degree-days; Maize; Mozambique; Phenology; Temperature trends,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957645771

This specialized type of pollination system tends to be lost in members of the family that occur outside the geographic distribution (e.g. Africa) of Neotropical oil-collecting bees. This study focused on the pollination ecology, chemical ecology and reproductive biology of an oil flower species, Pterandra pyroidea (Malpighiaceae) from the Brazilian Cerrado. Populations of this species consist of plants with oil-secreting (glandular) flowers, plants with non-oil-secreting flowers (eglandular) or a mix of both plant types. This study specifically aims to clarify the role of eglandular morphs in this species. Methods Data on pollinators were recorded by in situ observations. Breeding system experiments were conducted by isolating inflorescences and by enzymatic reactions. Floral resources, pollen and floral oils offered by this species were analysed by staining and a combination of various spectroscopic methods. Key Results Eglandular flowers of P. pyroidea do not act as mimics of their oil-producing conspecifics to attract pollinators. Instead, both oil-producing and oil-free flowers depend on pollen-collecting bees for reproduction, and their main pollinators are bumble-bees. Floral oils produced by glandular flowers are less complex than those described in closely related genera. Conclusions Eglandular flowers represent a shift in the pollination system in which oil is being lost and pollen is becoming the main reward of P. pyroidea flowers. Pollination shifts of this kind have hitherto not been demonstrated empirically within Neotropical Malpighiaceae and this species exhibits an unusual transition from a specialized towards a generalized pollination system in an area considered the hotspot of oil-collecting bee diversity in the Neotropics. Transitions of this type provide an opportunity to study ongoing evolutionary mechanisms that promote the persistence of species previously involved in specialized mutualistic relationships. © The Author 2011.

While many publications try to elucidate patterns about the networks, others are primarily concerned with the role of specific species in the network. The core challenge here is to tell specialists from generalists. While field data and observations can be used to directly assess specialisation levels, the indirect way through networks is burdened with problems. Here, I review eight measures to quantify specialisation in pollination networks (degree, node specialisation, betweenness, closeness, strength, pollination support, Shannon's H and discrimination d'), the first four being based on binary, the others on weighted network data. All data and R-code are available as supplement and can be applied beyond pollination networks. The indices convey different concepts of specialisation and hence quantify different aspects. Still, there is some redundancy, with node specialisation and closeness quantifying the same properties, as do degree, betweenness and Shannon's H. Using artificial and real network data, I illustrate the interpretation of the different indices and the importance of using a null model to correct for expectations given the different observed frequencies of interactions. For a well-described network the distributions of specialisation values do not differ from null model expectations for most indices. Finally, I investigate the effect of cattle grazing on the specialisation of an important pollinator in eight replicated pollination networks as an illustration of how to employ the specialisation indices, null models and permutation-based statistics in the analysis of specialisation in pollination networks.",Bipartite network; Degree; Discrimination; Node specialisation index; Pollination service index; Pollinator; Strength; Two-mode network,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867358518

At each site, we measured light availability, pollinator visitation, pollen deposition, and seed set of potted H. macrophyllum in the presence and absence of L. maackii. At both sites, understory light levels were lower in plots containing L. maackii. At the asynchronous site, H. macrophyllum received fewer pollinator visits in the presence of L. maackii, suggesting shade from L. maackii reduced visitation to H. macrophyllum. Despite reduced visitation, H. macrophyllum seed set did not differ between treatments. At the synchronous site, H. macrophyllum received more pollinator visits and produced more seeds per flower in the presence of co-flowering L. maackii compared to plots in which L. maackii was absent, and conspecific pollen deposition was positively associated with seed set. Our results support the hypothesis that co-flowering L. maackii shrubs facilitated pollination of H. macrophyllum, thereby mitigating the negative impacts of shade, leading to increased seed production. Phenological overlap appears to influence pollinator-mediated interactions between invasive and native plants and may alter the direction of impact of L. maackii on native plant pollination. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Biological invasion; Competition; Facilitation; Lonicera maackii; Phenological overlap,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956218777

Attalea phalerata has a solitary stem and produces staminate, pistillate and rarely bisexuals inflorescences that open during the day. Bactris glaucescens has multiple stems and has bisexual flowers with crepuscular/nocturnal anthesis. Both species present bud break and leaf-budding during the year. Attalea phalerata shows continual annual flowering with ripening of fruits during the dry season. For B. glaucescens flowering occurs simultaneously with fruiting for about seven months, and fruit production can be influenced by temperature and level of flooding. The difference in the timing of anthesis of the flowers ensures production of floral resources during both day and night when both species of palms are flowering. The floral structures of both species have morphological characteristics associated with pollination by insects (mainly beetles), such as the presence of odor, stigmatic secretion, heat production, and adhesive substances ("" pollenkitt"" ) in the pollen. In A. phalerata, the main pollinators were Mystrops sp. (Nitidulidae) and Madarini (Curculionidae). Derelomus sp. (Curculionidae) and Paratenetus sp.

We first identified hybrids by means of microsatellite genotyping and assignment tests. Hybrids were rare, both among adults (4 of 190, 2.1%) and among acorns collected from Q. lobata trees (6 of 392, 1.5%). These low rates of hybridization at both early and late life history stages suggest that fertility barriers, rather than natural selection against hybrids, limit hybridization between these two species. However, hybrid adults, although rare, may facilitate gene flow between the two species. Acorns collected from a hybrid tree had both Q. lobata pollen donors (11 of 30, 37%) and Q. douglasii or hybrid pollen donors (19 of 30, 63%). After removing hybrid acorns from the analysis, we used paternity assignment to track pollination patterns within Q. lobata. Of 108 acorns, only 32 (30%) were assigned to candidate pollen donors within 200 m of the maternal tree, indicating that the majority of effective pollen travels more than 200 m. Individual trees had acorn crops with many different sires and an average effective number of pollen donors (Nep) of 219 per tree. Indirect methods using correlated paternity estimated mean pollination distances of ~100 m and mean Nep of 5.2 per tree, values much lower than those derived directly from paternity assignments. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Seven sequential visits from male P. pruinosa maximized squash fruit set and growth. This number of male visits accumulated during the first hour of their foraging and mate searching at flowers soon after sunrise.

In this study, we analyzed the temporal variation in pollen dispersal and breeding structure in the Neotropical tree species Tabebuia aurea (Bignoniaceae) and evaluated pollen dispersal between a population inside the reserve and a patch of isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve, and tested the hypothesis that isolated individuals are sinking for pollen. All adult trees (260) within a population of 40 ha and 9 isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve were sampled, and from these adults, 21 open-pollinated progeny arrays were analyzed in 2 flowering seasons (309 seeds in 2004 and 328 in 2005). Genetic analyses were based on the polymorphism at 10 microsatellite loci. A high proportion of self-pollination found in both flowering seasons indicated a mixed-mating system. The mean pollen dispersal distance differed significantly between the two flowering seasons (307.78 m in 2004 and 396.26 m in 2005). Maximum pollen dispersal was 2608 m, but most pollination events (65%) occurred at distances 300 m. Our results also showed that isolated individuals are sinking for pollen, with high pollen flow between the population inside the reserve and individuals on the edge. These results are most likely due to the large pollinator species, which can potentially fly long distances, and also due to temporal variation in individual fecundity and contribution to pollen dispersal. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Bignoniaceae; breeding structure; cerrado; genetic neighborhood; Pollen dispersal; Tabebuia aurea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956369125

Floral trait distributions of co-flowering species that share pollinators may reflect the impact of pollinator preference and constancy on their assembly within local communities. While pollinator sharing may lead to increased visitation rates for species with similar flowers, the receipt of foreign pollen via interspecific pollinator movements can decrease seed set. We investigated the pattern of community flower colour assembly as perceived by native honeybee pollinators within 24 local assemblages of co-flowering Oxalis species within the Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. To explore the influence of pollinators on trait assembly, we assessed the impact of colour similarity on pollinator choices and the cost of heterospecific pollen receipt. We show that flower colour is significantly clustered within Oxalis communities and that this is not due to historical constraint, as flower colour is evolutionarily labile within Oxalis and communities are randomly structured with respect to phylogeny. Pollinator observations reveal that the likelihood of pollinators switching between co-flowering species is low and increases with flower colour similarity. Interspecific hand pollination significantly reduced seed set in the four Oxalis species we investigated, and all were dependant on pollinators for reproduction. Together these results imply that flower colour similarity carries a potential fitness cost. However, pollinators were highly flower constant, and remained so despite the extreme similarity of flower colour as perceived by honeybees. This suggests that other floral traits facilitate discrimination between similarly coloured species, thereby likely resulting in a low incidence of interspecific pollen transfer (IPT). If colour similarity promotes pollinator attraction at the community level, the observed clustering of flower colour within communities might result from indirect facilitative interactions. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Bee vision; Facilitation; Flower colour; Interspecific pollen transfer; Phylogenetic community structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956046913

Meta-analyses of published networks are a widely used technique. To have the best chance of discovering common properties though, networks should be constructed using a standardized approach. However, this is rarely the case, and pollination networks are constructed using two main methods: transects and timed observations. To investigate the potential for variation in network structure arising from different construction techniques we constructed plant-pollinator networks using two different methods at a single site, repeating our protocol over three field seasons. Transects and timed observation methods differ in the evenness of observation effort allocated among plant species in the observed community. We show that the uneven allocation of observation effort significantly affects the number of unique interactions in the network, and we reveal a strong trend in effects on web asymmetry and evenness of marginal abundance distributions.

Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of this mode of pollination in Erica, the largest plant genus in the Cape flora of South Africa. The localized endemic Erica hanekomii appears to be adapted for pollination by rodents, on account of its low, mat-forming habit with many dull-coloured, pendulous flower heads, large volumes (up to c. 30?L per inflorescence) of sucrose-dominated nectar, hook-shaped styles and late winter flowering phenology. Rodents trapped in the vicinity of E. hanekomii plants had many thousands of Erica tetrads in their droppings. Nocturnal laboratory observation showed that Acomys subspinosus (Cape spiny mouse) is adept at manipulating E. hanekomii inflorescences and lapping nectar without destroying gynoecia. During terrarium experiments, pollen was deposited mainly on the rostrum, but also on the chest area and forelegs of A. subspinosus. No birds or insects were seen to visit E. hanekomii in the field. Whereas natural fruit set was 73%, inflorescences from which rodents, but not insects, were excluded using mesh cages, had fruit set of just 3.3%. Exclusion of all visitors resulted in zero seed production. Broken anther rings (a sign of flower visitation in Erica) were observed in 90.1% of flowers in the field and 92% of flowers exposed to rodents in the laboratory, but in virtually none of the flowers from which rodents were selectively excluded. This first record of a non-flying mammal pollination syndrome in Ericaceae raises interesting new questions about the origins of the rodent pollination system and the selective factors that lead to its evolution. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Acomys subspinosus; Cape flora; Exclusion experiment; Nectar; Pollination success; Small mammal; Sugar composition; Vertebrate pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956139108

To fill this gap, the hypothesis that bee visitation to flowers decreases after pollination through reduced floral volatile emissions in highbush blueberries, Vaccinium corymbosum, was tested. Other sources of variation in floral emissions and the role of floral volatiles in bee attraction were also examined. Methods Pollinator visitation to blueberry flowers was manipulated by bagging all flowers within a bush (pollinator excluded) or leaving them unbagged (open pollinated), and then the effect on floral volatile emissions and future bee visitation were measured. Floral volatiles were also measured from different blueberry cultivars, times of the day and flower parts, and a study was conducted to test the attraction of bees to floral volatiles. Key Results Open-pollinated blueberry flowers had 32 lower volatile emissions than pollinator-excluded flowers. In particular, cinnamyl alcohol, a major component of the floral blend that is emitted exclusively from petals, was emitted in lower quantities from open-pollinated flowers. Although, no differences in cinnamyl alcohol emissions were detected among three blueberry cultivars or at different times of day, some components of the blueberry floral blend were emitted in higher amounts from certain cultivars and at mid-day. Field observations showed that more bees visited bushes with pollinator-excluded flowers. Also, more honey bees were caught in traps baited with a synthetic blueberry floral blend than in unbaited traps. Conclusions Greater volatile emissions may help guide bees to unpollinated flowers, and thus increase plant fitness and bee energetic return when foraging in blueberries. Furthermore, the variation in volatile emissions from blueberry flowers depending on pollination status, plant cultivar and time of day suggests an adaptive role of floral signals in increasing pollination of flowers. © The Author 2011.

Pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between flowers and insect visitors. They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of insect-flower interaction networks. 2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insect-flower interaction network size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland. 3. We found that insect-flower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asymmetrically structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant/animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously documented insect-flower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, suggesting organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited. 4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of insect-flower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks (organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low plant/animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environmental schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can be made for this group. We conclude that organic farming, although not the solution in its present form, can benefit insect biodiversity, insect-flower interaction networks and insect-mediated pollination. © 2011 The Authors.

Deserts are especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant-pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens. © 2010 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Anthropogenic disturbance; Arid; Habitat change; Wild bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957604353

This characteristic allows for the establishment of monovarietal almond orchards with many advantages for the grower. However, there are some uncertainties about the consequences of self-fertilization regarding productivity and fruit quality. In this work, a new methodology was used to clarify the possible effects of self-pollination on these parameters. Four different pollination treatments were applied to six self-compatible almond genotypes by hand-pollinating flowers on five different branches, so that along each branch the four treatments were distributed homogeneously. The pollinated flowers were later identified with wires of a particular colour for each treatment. Fruit set and fruit characteristics (weight in-shell, kernel weight, percentage of kernel, percentage of defective kernels, double kernels and split kernels) were studied. With this methodology, results should only be influenced by the pollinator effect. In general, no significant differences were observed between self-pollination and cross-pollination for the characteristics studied. These findings demonstrate the absence of negative effects of self-pollination on these agronomic traits. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Almond; Fruit set; Kernel weight; Monovarietal orchards; Self-compatibility; Self-fertilization; Weight in-shell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957919206

Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) have historically provided this service, but their recent decline has underscored the need for additional pollinators. The objective of this study was to determine the richness and abundance of native bees in the cranberry-growing area of southern coastal Oregon and compare foraging behaviors of honeybees and native bees. In a 2-year study, we collected over 27 native bee species in traps set out during and after bloom (mid-May to mid-June). During 67 2-min observations, honeybees (68.1%) and three species of bumble bees (Bombus spp.; 31.6%) comprised 99.7% of foragers. The dominant bumble bee was Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski (56.0%). Multivariate regression of temperature and wind speed data indicated that both were significantly predictive of honeybee and bumble bee foragers (P < 0.001). The interquartile range for foraging was 18.3 to 22.2 °C for bumble bees and 21.1 to 26.7°C for honeybees. Over 75% of honeybees were seen foraging above the average observed temperature (19.5°C). Bumble bee pollen loads had a greater dry mass (6.8 ± 12.9 mg) than those of honeybees (2.0 ± 3.6 mg; P < 0.001), and the latter were observed collecting nectar but no pollen more often (during 37.2% of visits) than bumble bees (11.3% of visits). Based on our results, bumble bees in general, and B. vosnesenskii in particular, may be providing significant pollination services for Oregon cranberry farms.

The gradient allows testing for effects of the number of flowering plant species per se.

Nevertheless, conservation efforts as well as commercial breeding programmes require better guidelines on the amount of genetic variation that is needed to maintain viable populations. In this context, we carried out a long-term genetic study on the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris to evaluate the population viability consequences of prolonged breeding from a small number of founder colonies. In particular, it was artificially imposed a genetic bottleneck by setting up a population starting from only two founder colonies, and continued breeding from it for a period of over 10 years in a location outside its natural area of occurrence. We show that despite a great reduction in the number of alleles present at both neutral microsatellite loci and the sex-determining locus relative to its natural source population, and an increased frequency in the production of sterile diploid males, the genetically impoverished population could be successfully bred and maintained for at least 10 years. This shows that in stingless bees, breeding from a small stock of colonies may have less severe consequences than previously suspected. In addition, we provide a simulation model to determine the number of colonies that are needed to maintain a certain number of sex alleles in a population, thereby providing useful guidelines for stingless bee breeding and conservation efforts. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conservation genetics; Diploid male production; Meliponini; Small population; Stingless bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955866750

Average estimates of nucleotide diversity were extremely low in both species (sil = 0.0007 for O. glaberrimasil = 0.0024 for O. barthii). About 70% less diversity was found in O. glaberrima than in its progenitor O. barthii. Coalescent simulation indicated that such dramatic reduction of nucleotide diversity in African rice could be explained mainly by a severe bottleneck during its domestication. The progenitor of African rice maintained also low genetic diversity, which may be attributed to small effective population size in O. barthii. Self-pollinating would be another factor leading to the unusually low diversity in both species. Genealogical analyses showed that all O. glaberrima accessions formed a strongly supported cluster with seven O. barthii individuals that were sampled exclusively from the proposed domestication centers of African rice. Population structure and principal component analyses found that the O. glaberrima group was homogeneous with no obvious genetic subdivision, in contrast to the heterogeneous O. barthii cluster.

Although various morphological flower traits have been identified that reduce excessive pollen losses to bees, the question of whether pollen might also be chemically protected remains largely unexplored. In this study we compared the larval performance of the two very closely related and highly pollen generalist solitary bee species Osmia bicornis and Osmia cornuta on four different pollen diets. Despite their very large pollen diet breadth, the two bee species showed striking differences in their ability to develop on pollen of the same plant species. Osmia bicornis developed well on Ranunculus pollen but failed to do so on Echium pollen, whereas the reverse held true for O. cornuta with the exception of two larvae grown on Ranunculus pollen that developed into dwarfish adults. Both bee species performed well on Sinapis pollen, while neither of the two species managed to develop on Tanacetum pollen. The observed differences in larval survival of these two Osmia species when reared on the same pollen diet as well as their failure to develop on Tanacetum pollen clearly demonstrate that bees require physiological adaptations to cope with the unfavourable chemical properties of certain pollen. Our results show a remarkable analogy of bee-flower relationships with herbivore-plant interactions and possibly indicate that the pollen of certain plant taxa might be chemically protected. © 2011 The Authors.

Interest in pollen-borne gene dispersal has grown with the cultivation of genetically modified plants. To date, both experimental data and models of oilseed rape (OSR) Brassica napus pollen movement at the landscape scale do not clearly differentiate between wind- and insect-mediated dispersal. Estimations of insect-mediated gene dispersal would be valuable for managing potential escapes of transgenes. 2. To quantify the intensity and spatial scale of pollen dispersal by insect pollinators in an agricultural landscape, bait points made of flowering male-sterile OSR that attract OSR pollinators were located at six distances (10-1100m) from the closest OSR fields and feral populations. Flower-visiting insects were caught by net on these male-sterile flowers and were rubbed onto the stigmas of male-sterile OSR plants grown in a pollen-proof greenhouse to do a manual pollination of their flowers. In this way we were able to assess the insects' OSR pollen load and seed production at each of the six distances. 3. A large diversity of insects carried OSR pollen and contributed to seed production, but not pollen beetles Meligethes aeneus. Logistic regression analyses of the seed-set success from the manual pollination demonstrated that seed set significantly increased with the proximity of OSR fields, the size of the pollinating insect, and the main daily temperature. Seed set was not affected by the pollinating insect's order or genus. Seed set, both observed and predicted by the model, was above zero for flowers pollinated with large bees caught at >1100m from the nearest OSR field. 4. Synthesis and applications.Our study provides clear evidence that a large variety of insect species can transfer viable pollen between OSR plants over considerable distances. However, only 39·4% of the insects caught on male-sterile flowers carried OSR pollen. Our results provide valuable data to improve models of pollen dispersal for entomophilous crops at the landscape scale. These models are essential to help land-managers reduce pollen-borne gene dispersal from genetically modified plants to wild and cultivated relatives. © 2010 British Ecological Society.",Apiformes; Bees; Brassica napus; Diptera; Insect diversity; Insect size; Pollen dispersal; Pollen flow; Seed-set success; Syrphidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955946028

Some flowers, although exhibiting morphological traits considered best suited for wind pollen dispersal, experience visits of insects. Data on such visits are often not detailed enough to establish if they are occasional or regular events. If visitors are foraging bees, morphological constraints of anemophilous flowers may affect handling ability and foraging effort. We investigated the foraging behaviour of honey bees on Fraxinus ornus L. and Castanea sativa Miller, two species showing a double pollination strategy (wind + insect), but whose flowers retain clear anemophilous characteristics. We recorded honey bee handling time and routines on the flowers of the two tree species providing a comparison when possible. Interestingly, our results confirm the visits to these plants to be regular events. Moreover, on each of them bees express an appropriate collection strategy, adapted to the different spatial organization of the flowers. Two are the implications discussed: on one side, bees can exploit abundant pollen resources, which could increase colony growth and strength, even if the unsuited flower morphology may limit resource collection.

Phylogenetic relationships within the genus were investigated and the evolution of oil-producing structures related to specialized oil-bee pollination examined. Methods Phylogenetic analyses based on eight molecular markers obtained from 101 Sisyrinchium accessions representing 85 species were conducted in the first extensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus. Total evidence analyses confirmed the monophyly of the genus and retrieved nine major clades weakly connected to the subdivisions previously recognized. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis was used to reconstruct biogeographical patterns, and to trace the evolutionary origin of glandular trichomes present in the flowers of several species. Key Results and Conclusions Glandular trichomes evolved three times independently in the genus. In two cases, these glandular trichomes are oil-secreting, suggesting that the corresponding flowers might be pollinated by oil-bees. Biogeographical patterns indicate expansions from Central America and the northern Andes to the subandean ranges between Chile and Argentina and to the extended area of the Paran river basin. The distribution of oil-flower species across the phylogenetic trees suggests that oil-producing trichomes may have played a key role in the diversification of the genus, a hypothesis that requires future testing. © The Author 2011.

We assessed the influence of landscape composition on bee abundance and species richness in apple (Malm spp.) orchards of northeastern Wisconsin during the spring flowering period. A diverse community of bee species occurs in these apple orchards, dominated by wild bees in the families Andrenidae and Halictidae and the honey bee, Apis mellifera L. Proportion of forest area in the surrounding landscape was a significant positive predictor of wild bee abundance in orchards, with strongest effects at a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) buffer distance of 1,000 m or greater. Forest area also was positively associated with species richness, showing strongest effects at a buffer distance of 2,000 m. Nonagricultural developed land (homes, lawns, etcetera) was significantly negatively associated with species richness at buffer distances >750 m and wild bee abundance in bowl traps at all distances. Other landscape variables statistically associated with species richness or abundance of wild bees included proportion area of pasture (positive) and proportion area of roads (negative). Forest area was not associated with honey bee abundance at any buffer distance. These results provide clear evidence that the landscape surrounding apple orchards, especially the proportion of forest area, affects richness and abundance of wild bees during the spring flowering period and should be a part of sustainable land management strategies in agro-ecosystems of northeastern Wisconsin and other apple growing regions. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.",agro-ecosystem; Andrenidae; apple orchards; landscape ecology; Native bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958727227

However, species with a persistent seed bank may be buffered against genetic loss as seed banks are expected to accumulate the reproductive output of many seasons. For fire-dependent species in decline, prescribed ecological burning may be a means to stimulate germination and recover genetic diversity stored in the seed bank, providing a demographic and genetic rescue effect. Here we investigated the effectiveness of this strategy in a small, isolated and inbred population of the endangered shrub, Acacia pinguifolia. We surveyed genetic diversity and structure of remnant populations of A. pinguifolia and monitored regeneration before and after burning. Germination was stimulated by fire, but seedling numbers 18 months post-fire were low and barely above the number of adults killed by the fire. Genetic diversity was marginally higher in the post-fire seedling cohort than the pre-fire adults (HE = 0. 1 vs. 0.09, respectively). Outcrossing rates of open-pollinated seed from surrounding plants suggested moderately high levels of self-fertilisation (tm = 0. 65) and analysis of fine-scale genetic structure implied pollen and seed dispersal over distances of several metres, suggesting that restricted gene flow and inbreeding may act to limit genetic diversity in the seed bank. We conclude that prescribed burning has not been immediately successful as a recovery strategy for this relictual population of A. pinguifolia, though future monitoring may detect additional recruits. Alternative conservation strategies, including performing inter-population crosses, may be required to restore genetic diversity and ameliorate extinction risks. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Genetic diversity; Mating system; Prescribed burn; Regeneration; Restoration genetics; Seed bank,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955875222

We measured daily nectar production rates 9 years after experimental logging in three treatments: clear cuts (all merchantable trees removed), 50% of trees retained, and unlogged controls. Per-flower nectar production rate was unaffected by logging for C. angusifolium, D. glaucum, and M. paniculata, and lower in unlogged controls than in the 50% logging treatment for V. americana. Overall, we found a surprising robustness of nectar production of these herbaceous plants to the physical and environmental changes following logging.

Allozyme variation of Polylepis pauta from 12 forest populations in three adjacent watersheds in Northeastern Ecuador was investigated to assess whether observed patterns of gene diversity were consistent with a more continuous historical range of the species and to evaluate the populations' potential for restoration. Genetic diversity and polymorphism in P. pauta populations were higher than mean values for most wind pollinated and dispersed temperate and tropical tree species with regional distributions. Genetic differentiation among watersheds was lower than among populations within each watershed. Isolation by distance was not evident and several populations from different watersheds were more genetically similar than populations from the same watershed. Larger forest patches with broader altitudinal ranges had more alleles. Forest patches on steeper slopes and at higher elevations supported populations with less genetic diversity; this might have resulted from the predominance of vegetative reproduction in these landslide prone areas. The amount of genetic diversity maintained by P. pauta, coupled with low genetic differentiation among populations within and among watersheds, is consistent with a more continuous historical range of the species in Northeastern Ecuador and point to the Oyacachi basin as having the highest levels of genetic diversity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Allozyme variation; Forest restoration; Historical range; Isolation by distance; Landscape genetics; Polylepis pauta,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955818963

We combined morphological, cytological, and genetic marker data with pollination experiments to investigate the degree, direction, and spatial pattern of hybridization between the diploid Dactylorhiza incarnata and its tetraploid derivative, D. praetermissa. Methods: To identify hybrids, 169 individuals were genotyped using AFLPs and morphologically characterized. Individuals were clustered on the basis of their AFLP profile using the program Structure. To reduce the dimensionality of the plant-trait matrix, PCA was applied. The origin of suspected hybrid individuals was verified using flow cytometry. An AMOVA and spatial autocorrelation analysis were used to indirectly infer the extent of gene flow. Key results: Only five individuals were regarded as putative hybrids on the basis of the AFLP data; all had been assigned to the D. praetermissa morphotype. Only one had deviating DNA content and was presumably a triploid. High ?ST values between different subpopulations and significant spatial genetic structure were observed, suggesting localized gene flow. Conclusions: Using combined data to study hybridization between D. incarnata and D. praetermissa, very few unequivocal hybrids were observed. We propose several non-mutually exclusive explanations. Localized pollen flow, in combination with different microhabitat preferences, is probably one of the reasons for the low frequency of hybrids. Also, the triploid first-generation hybrids may experience difficulties in successful establishment, as a result of genic incompatibilities. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",AFLP; D. praetermissa; Dactylorhiza incarnata; Gene flow; Genetic analysis; Morphology; Polyploidy; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857713276

Hill plants growing in two habitats differing in exposure to wind and salt spray were examined to see whether reproductive effort and success (as gauged by ovule and seed number, respectively) were influenced by abiotic factors as well as by plant size (as gauged by the height of megastrobili above ground). The data were collected via a split-plot design, with plant height nested in habitat type (exposed vs. protected site). Although mean plant height did not differ between the two sites, statistical analyses using a mixed model indicated that plants growing in the protected site had a greater reproductive effort and were more successful than plants growing in the unprotected site; i.e., plant height nested in habitat type had a significant effect. The numbers of ovules and seeds on the windward and leeward sides of each megastrobilus did not differ. Therefore, anemophily could not be confirmed.

Using a novel approach to studies of visitation behaviour by butterflies, flower colour of four Asteraceae species was phenotypically manipulated to decouple the influence of that trait from others (including morphology and nectar rewards) on visitation by Lycaena heteronea, Speyeria mormonia, Cercyonis oetus, and Phyciodes campestris. Flower visits were recorded to experimental flower arrays in subalpine meadows to measure (i) spontaneous preference by butterflies for particular colours and other traits and (ii) flower constancy (longer than expected strings of visits made to flowers of the same species), a behaviour that can reduce interspecific gene flow in plants. Over three field seasons, 3558 individual flower visits in 1386 foraging bouts were observed for free-flying butterflies. All four butterfly species responded to the phenotypic manipulations of flower colour, although in different ways. Speyeria mormonia and L. heteronea also exhibited preferences based on other flower traits. Lycaena heteronea responded to combinations of traits such that the other traits it preferred depended upon the context of flower colour. None of the butterfly species exhibited flower constancy in any of the arrays employed. The observed preferences show that butterflies, like some other pollinators, are potentially capable of exerting selection on colour and other floral traits. Moreover, these flower preferences can depend on the context of other flower traits. The absence of constancy contrasts with reports of high constancy in many bees. © 2011 The Authors.

Pollen was collected from honey bees from six feral honey bee colonies in southern Texas during two time periods to evaluate diurnal patterns of pollen collection. Overall, the same pollen types tended to be collected throughout the day, however, the percentages differed depending upon the time of day. Honey bees from four of the six colonies collected predominant pollen types (> 45% of a sample). Honey bees from the two colonies which did not collect a predominant pollen type collected two or more secondary pollen types (16-45% of a sample). Lamiaceae was the most prevalent pollen type collected during the early sampling period and an unknown tricolporate grain was the most collected pollen type during the late sampling period. However, honey bees from one colony primarily collected the unknown tricolporate grain during both sampling periods.

We present the first study on the reproductive biology of Stellera chamaejasme, a toxic perennial weed which is abundant in the alpine meadows on the eastern Tibetan Plateau of China since the 1960s. S. chamaejasme has synchronogamy and herkogamous flowers, which last for about 11 days. Flowers can be yellow, white or reddish. Our results suggest that this species is self-incompatible and depends entirely on pollen vectors for seed production. All the pollinators observed were Lepidopteran species; however, the pollinator assemblage was significantly different among populations and likely independent on floral colour. Reproductive success and invasion of the weed might be a complex function of floral traits, breeding system and pollination ecology. Generally, plants with generalized pollination system are more invasive. However, our results suggest that specialized flowers and self-incompatibility in the present case may not prevent invasion of the weed. © 2011.",Floral colour; Floral longevity; Herkogamy; Self-incompatibility; Specialized pollination system; Weed pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955898891

Here we extended the framework of how plant density can affect pollination to examine how it may promote the success of plant intraspecific cheaters. We compared hawkmoth behaviour in two native populations of Petunia axillaris, where we simultaneously offered rewarding and manually depleted P. axillaris. We asked whether pollinator foraging strategies change as a function of plant density and whether such changes may differentially affect nectarless plants. We observed the first choice and number of flowers visited by pollinators and found that in the dense population, pollinators visited more flowers on rewarding plants than on nectar-depleted plants. In the sparse population, such discrimination was absent. As we found no differences in nectar volume between plants of the two populations, the observed differences in plant density may be temporal. We reason that if differences were more permanent, an equivalent of the remote habitat hypothesis prevails: in a sparse population, cheating plants benefit from the absence of inter- and intraspecific competitors because pollinators tend to visit all potential resources. In a denser population, a pollinator's optimal foraging strategy involves more selectivity. This would cause between-plant competition for pollinators in a pollinator-limited context, which applies to most hawkmoth-pollinated systems. We propose that nectar-provisioning of plants can be density-dependant, with cheaters able to persist in low density areas. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cheating; Density; Mutualism; Nectar; Petunia; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957940321

We recorded equilibrium of morph frequencies in the studied population, reflecting the comparable fecundity found in the two morphs. Long-styled flowers produce more pollen grains of smaller size than shortstyled ones: we hypothesize that in thrum flowers, pollen is more easily removed by the insect pollinator Macroglossum stellatarum, resulting in equal pollen amounts carried to both short styles and long styles. This lower pollen transfer efficiency from long-styled to short-styled flowers is also reflected in legitimate pollen-ovule ratio values. Despite results show no evidence of imminent threats to population persistence at study site, the strict dependence on one or very few pollinator species, and ecological traits, may increase extinction risks in the long-term period. © 2011 Società Botanica Italiana.",Distyly; Endemism; Female fitness; Pollen limitation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960660474

Species with polymorphic floral traits are particularly relevant to study the joint evolution of floral traits. We used in this study the tropical orchid Calanthe sylvatica from Réunion Island. Three distinct colour varieties are observed, presenting lilac, white or purple flowers, and named respectively C. sylvatica var. lilacina (hereafter referred as var. lilacina), C. sylvatica var. alba (var. alba) and C. sylvatica var. purpurea (var. purpurea). We investigated the composition of the floral scent produced by these colour varieties using the non-invasive SPME technique in the wild. Scent emissions are dominated by aromatic compounds. Nevertheless, the presence of the terpenoid (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-trine (DMNT) is diagnostic of var. purpurea, with the volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced by some individuals containing up to 60% of DMNT. We evidence specific colour-scent associations in C. sylvatica, with two distinct scent profiles in the three colour varieties: the lilacina-like profile containing no or very little DMNT (<2%) and the purpurea-like profile containing DMNT (>2%). Calanthe sylvatica var. alba individuals group with one or the other scent profile independently of their population of origin. We suggest that white-flowered individuals have evolved at least twice, once from var. lilacina and at least once from var. purpurea after the colonisation of la Réunion. White-flowered individuals may have been favoured by the particular pollinator fauna characterising the island. These flowering varieties of C. sylvatica, which display three colours but two scents profiles prove that colour is not always a good indicator of odour and that colour-scent associations may be complex, depending on pollination ecology of the populations concerned. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Because HLB and ACC weaken trees and compromise cropping, breeding is much less efficient using seed parents that have been exposed to these diseases. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to use unique disease-exposed selections only as pollen parents with pollen applied to disease-free trees. However, there may be a risk of introducing these diseases using such pollen sources. To assess this potential, abundance of the pathogens associated with these diseases was assessed in anthers and flowers using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Because CLas is systemic, levels on mature leaves from the flower source trees were assessed to see if the presence of CLas in flowers was associated with leaf levels. Disease-exposed trees were tested in 10 genotypes from each of three broad genotypic categories, which reflect different levels of susceptibility to the diseases associated with the pathogens studied: Poncirus trifoliata hybrids (most resistant to HLB), Citrus maxima and hybrids(susceptible to both diseases), and C. reticulata and hybrids (considerable resistance toACC). Of the 30 samples of each tissue type analyzed for CLas, 88% of mature leaves,69% of flowers, and 88% of anthers had one or more CLas bacterium per sample. The trifoliate genotypic group had significantly lower levels of CLas than the pummelo and mandarin groups in mature leaf samples, but CLas levels were more similar between groups in anther and flower samples, and the pathogen was present in most of the trifoliate hybrids tested. Mean numbers of CLas detected per nanogram nucleic acid were 100 to 800 times higher in mature leaf samples, most characteristic of HLB symptoms, compared with anther samples. Xcc DNA was detected in 30% of flower samples and 23% of anther samples. No significant differences in Xcc levels were found between tissue type or genotypic group. However, regressions between Xcc levels in flowers and percent of plant pedigree derived from mandarin had a negative correlation and an r2 of 0.159 (P = 0.029). The biology of CLas is consistent with the pathogen being present in anthers from unopened flowers, whereas the ACC pathogen detected inside flowers was likely the result of contamination despite great care in sample collection and handling. Where exceptional diligence to exclude HLB and ACC is appropriate, results suggest that there may be a risk of spreading these pathogens through use of pollen from trees on infected farms.",Breeding; Citrus canker; HLB; Huanglonging,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959501907

However, few studies have addressed the reasons for these differences. The present study compared the compatibility and outcrossing rates between transgenic rice and selected weedy rice biotypes using manual and natural crossing experiments to elucidate the key innate factors causing the different outcrossing rates. Results: Hybrid seed sets from manual crossing between transgenic rice and weedy rice varied from 31.8 to 82.7%, which correlated directly with genetic compatibility. Moreover, the significant differences in the quantity of germinated donor pollens and pollen tubes entering the weedy rice ovule directly contributed to the different seed sets. The natural outcrossing rates varied from 0 to 6.66‰. The duration of flowering overlap was the key factor influencing natural outcrossing. Plant and panicle height also affected outcrossing success. Conclusion: From this study, it is concluded that the likelihood of gene flow between transgenic rice and weedy rice biotypes is primarily determined by floral synchronisation and secondarily influenced by genetic compatibility and some morphological characteristics. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",Compatibility; Floral synchronisation; Morphological characteristics; Outcrossing rate; Transgenic rice; Weedy rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955496952

(Lythraceae) is tristylous, each plant forming one of three floral morphs that differ in reciprocal placement of the stigma and two sets of anthers. Several reproductive traits were compared quantitatively among these morphs. Although mean pollen viability (?93%) and total pollen per mature, indehiscent anther within a staminal level (mean CV = 11%) were constant, the patterns of mean pollen production per anther were complex, being significantly lowest in long stamens (1,490 grains) of the short-styled morph, but highest in intermediate stamens (3,590) of the long-styled morph. Overall, pollen production was greatest (38,200) in long-styled flowers and least (22,000) in short-styled ones. On the contrary, ovule quantities per ovary (mean 107) were similar among floral morphs; thus, pollen-to-ovule ratios spanned 192 (short-styled morph) to 364 (long-styled morph), relatively low values for a strictly xenogamous species. Each morph had a recessed annular nectary of similar dimensions encircling the ovary base, with equal numbers of modified stomata distributed uniformly on the nectary surface. Most stomata were solitary (94%), whereas 5% occurred in pairs and 1% of stomatal units had just one guard cell. During nectar secretion, about 16% of pores were closed plus 28% of pores were fully occluded. Similarly, nectar volumes and solute concentrations, peak rates of nectar secretion (mean 72-79 ?g sugar h-1) at early afternoon, and the nectar's sucrose prevalence [S/(G + F) ?4.3] were not significantly different among morphs. Based on these similarities in nectary structure and nectar-secretion dynamics, traits rarely studied in tristylous species, the preferential visitation of any particular floral morph of L. salicaria during nectar foraging by insects is unlikely. Indeed, lack of discrimination among morphs by potential pollinators may be a key tenet of successful sexual reproduction in tristylous species. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Floral morph; Lythrum; Modified stomata; Nectar secretion; Nectary structure; Pollen production and viability; Pollen-to-ovule ratio; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957658277

Since human activities have both intensive and extensive impacts on the environment, it is critical to understand spatial relationships between conservation priorities for biodiversity and ecosystem services. The manner in which various aspects of biodiversity relate to ecosystem services and the spatial congruence between biodiversity and these services, is, however, unclear. In the present study in the Baiyangdian watershed, China, we investigated spatial characteristics of biodiversity and ecosystem services using correlation, overlap, and principal component, analyses. The spatial correlations between biodiversity and ecosystem services were found to be high. Biodiversity was positively correlated with soil retention, water yield and carbon sequestration and negatively correlated with N/P retention and pollination. Pairwise overlap was found to be the highest between N and P retention, biodiversity and carbon sequestration, and biodiversity and water yield. Other couples indicated moderate or small overlap. Principal component analysis indicated that biodiversity and six ecosystem services could be divided into two groups, which could be managed and conserved separately. It can be concluded that biodiversity priorities co-occur with water yield, soil retention and carbon sequestration, and do not co-occur with N/P retention and pollination. Conservation of a biodiversity hotspot was associated with maintaining 45.02% of a carbon sequestration hotspot, 42.05% of a water yield hotspot, and 23.29% of a soil retention hotspot, indicating that conserving biodiversity will also result in the protection of these services. The bundling of biodiversity and ecosystem services is thus both possible and practical. Our findings provide valuable information on congruence and divergence among conservation hotspots and the protection of ecosystem services. They also indicate that a systematic and comprehensive approach that can have wide-ranging policy implications in terms of optimizing conservation strategies for multiple ecosystem services. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Biodiversity; Congruence; Ecosystem service; Hotspot,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955137363

Five trials were established, consisting of two adjacent blocks, the one sown with the cleistogamous low-erucic acid line and the other with a classically flowering high-erucic acid line, used as source of contaminating pollen, itself artificially contaminated with a 1% mix of cleistogamous plants. Analyses showed that cross-fertilization rates of cleistogamous plants, estimated through erucic acid contents of seeds collected from them, were lower than those generally observed in oilseed rape: it averaged 10.1% on isolated plants within the erucic blocks, reached to the maximum 14% immediately adjacent to the erucic block, then decreased exponentially at higher distances.

We examined apomixis mutants that had lost function in one or both loci to establish their developmental roles during seed formation. In apomicts, sexual reproduction is initiated first. Somatic aposporous initial (AI) cells differentiate near meiotic cells, and the sexual pathway is terminated as AI cells undergo mitotic embryo sac formation. Seed initiation is fertilization-independent. Using a partially penetrant cytotoxic reporter to inhibit meioisis, we showed that developmental events leading to the completion of meiotic tetrad formation are required for AI cell formation. Sexual initiation may therefore stimulate activity of the LOA locus, which was found to be required for AI cell formation and subsequent suppression of the sexual pathway. AI cells undergo nuclear division to form embryo sacs, in which LOP functions gametophytically to stimulate fertilization-independent embryo and endosperm formation. Loss of function in either locus results in partial reversion to sexual reproduction, and loss of function in both loci results in total reversion to sexual reproduction. Therefore, in these apomicts, sexual reproduction is the default reproductive mode upon which apomixis is superimposed. These loci are unlikely to encode genes essential for sexual reproduction, but may function to recruit the sexual machinery at specific time points to enable apomixis. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",apomixis; apospory; embryo; endosperm; fertilization; seed,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957610452

Individuals of the Malagasy endemic Tina striata (Sapindaceae) have both morphologically male (staminate) flowers and hermaphroditic (bisexual) flowers, although many Sapindaceae species have only functionally unisexual flowers. Two populations of T. striata were studied to determine the functional sex expression of flowers and their breeding system. Methods: To determine whether morphologically hermaphroditic flowers have only female function, we compared male flowers and morphologically hermaphroditic flowers for (1) floral size, (2) pollen production and morphology, (3) patterns of anther dehiscence, (4) pollen germination, and (5) floral visitation patterns. Key results: Relative to male flowers, morphologically hermaphroditic flowers had similar pollen grain morphology but smaller androecia and less pollen. Anthers from male flowers dehisced on days 3 and 4 of flowering and then abscised with the male flower. Anthers from hermaphroditic flowers did not dehisce or release pollen and abscised after the fourth day of flowering. Pollen from hermaphroditic flowers was less likely to germinate and produce pollen tubes. Floral visitors were similar for male and hermaphroditic flowers, and no visitation to hermaphroditic flowers was observed after stamen abscission. Conclusions: Morphologically hermaphroditic flowers of T. striata do not have male function and are functionally female; therefore, T. striata has a monoecious breeding system, with possible adaptations to promote outcrossing. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Breeding system; Dioecy; Hermaphroditic; Heterodichogamy; Madagascar; Monoecy; Sapindaceae; Sex expression; Tina striata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856232380

Limitation is usually associated with the quality and the quantity of pollen; still, most studies do not discriminate between the two. We used hand-pollination experiments and observations of floral visitors to determine the mating system and limitations to seed production of the Spanish endangered species Pseudomisopates rivas-martinezii. We tested for agamospermy, autogamy, obligated autogamy, cross-pollination and supplementation. The response variables considered were fruit set, seed set and viable seed set. Previous studies indicated that (i) the species exhibits extensive clonal growth, (ii) plants flower profusely in summer, (iii) seeds showed to be highly unviable, and (iv) no seedlings were observed in the field. We found that P. rivas-martinezii is predominantly self-incompatible, has an unexpected generalized pollination system considering its occluded corolla, and is limited by qualitative rather than quantitative pollen limitation. These results indicate that, in addition to other presumed environmental factors, the low seed viability of this self-incompatible species is due to pollen quality limitation as a result of reduced mate availability. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conservation; Mating system; Pollen limitation; Pollen quality; Pollen quantity; Pseudomisopates rivas-martinezii,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956130534

We used progeny arrays and admixture and pollen dispersal analyses to assess the relative importance of pre-mating reproductive barriers and the local demographic environment as explanations of variation in hybrid frequency in three mapped hybrid zones of Eucalyptus aggregata and E. rubida. A total of 731 open-pollinated progeny from 36 E. aggregata maternal parents were genotyped using six microsatellite markers. Admixture analysis identified substantial variation in hybrid frequency among progeny arrays (0-76.9%). In one hybrid zone, hybrid frequency was related to pre-mating barriers (degree of flowering synchrony) and demographic components of the local mating environment (decreasing population size, closer proximity to E. rubida and hybrid trees). At this site, average pollen dispersal distance was less and almost half (46%) of the hybrid progeny were sired by local E. rubida and hybrid trees. In contrast, at the other two sites, pre-mating and demographic factors were not related to hybrid frequency. Compared to the first hybrid zone where most of the E. rubida (76%) and all hybrids flowered, in the remaining sites fewer E. rubida (22-41%) and hybrid trees (0-50%) flowered and their reproductive success was lower (sired 0-23% of hybrids). As a result, most hybrids were sired by external E. rubida/hybrids located at least 2-3 km away. These results indicate that although pre-mating barriers and local demography can influence patterns of hybridization, their importance can depend upon the scale of pollen dispersal. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",hybrid zones; hybridization; mating patterns; paternity analysis; pollen dispersal; reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956352234

The development of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from expressed sequence tags (EST) provided a useful tool for investigation of its genetic diversity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the genetic diversity of faba bean from China and Europe using EST-SSR markers. 5 031 faba bean ESTs from the NCBI database were downloaded and assembled into 1 148 unigenes. A total of 107 microsatellites in 96 unigenes were identified, indicating that merely 8.36% of sequences contained SSRs. The most abundant SSR within faba bean was tri-nucleotide repeat motif, and among all the tri-nucleotide repeats, the motif AAG/CTT was the most abundant type. Based on these results, 11 EST-SSR markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 29 faba bean cultivars from China and Europe with two to three alleles per locus. The polymorphism information content value ranged from 0.0644 to 0.4278 with an average of 0.2919. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) and phylogenetic clustering based on these 11 EST-SSR markers distinguished these cultivars into different groups. The results indicated that faba bean in China had a narrow genetic basis, and the additional sources of genetic cultivars/accessions should be introduced to enhance the genetic variability.

The mite Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae), an obligated ectoparasite of honeybees, has been in recent times one of the major problems leading not only to economical losses but also to ecological problems related to the role of honeybees as the most important pollinators on Earth. Varroatosis has been treated by methods that include special practices of beekeeping, physical removal, and the use of synthetic acaricides. None of these methods have, however, rendered complete protection, and there is clear evidence for the evolution of resistance to conventional acaricides. Consequently, the need for alternative control means has prompted the onset of several prospecting programs on botanicals with anti-varroa potential. Among these, essential oils appear as good candidates for safer control. In this review, we provide a concise compilation of the information generated in the last years on essential oils with anti-varroa activity. Future developments in this area demand standardization of bioassay protocols (either in the laboratory for primary screening or in hives), a detailed chemical characterization of the essential oils tested, and comprehensive studies on application methods. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Botanical pesticides; Honeybees; Plant extracts; Varroa destructor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958056693

Increment cores were analysed from 375 trees covering 25 open-pollinated families from a 30-year-old provenance-progeny trial in Quebec, Canada. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between different mechanical and fibre anatomy-related wood traits were found to vary with cambial age. Most correlations became stronger in magnitude in rings closer to the bark. An exception is the correlation between microfibril angle (MFA) and the modulus of elasticity where correlations were strongly negative from the pith to the bark. Age-age correlations for different wood traits were found to be high and possible gains from early selection were estimated to be good in ring 8 and older for most traits. MFA was the trait with the strongest potential for selection as early as ring 4, but a detrimental correlation with wood density may represent a drawback of such a juvenile selection approach. Estimates showed that selection concentrated on a few easily measurable traits such as wood density and core length holds promise to obtain superior genetic gains for mechanical properties, but negative impacts would be expected on fibre anatomy traits related to pulp quality. These findings show the need for more carefully planned breeding and selection strategies if one wishes to improve several traits for different end uses. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Cambial age; Genetic correlations; Picea glauca (Moench) Voss; Selection efficiency; Wood properties,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956120837

Six edible oils used in this experiment were canola, corn, olive, peanut, sesame, and soybean. Water and two commercial insecticidal oils (Neemix neem oil and nC21 Sunspray Ultrafine, a horticultural mineral oil) were used as the controls for the experiment. Six parameters evaluated in this experiment were corn earworm [Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)] damage rating, the number of sap beetle [Carpophilus spp. (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae) ] adults and larvae, the number of corn silk fly (or picture-winged fly) (Diptera: Ulidiidae) larvae, common smut [Ustilago maydis (D.C.)

The mineral oil also reduced the number of sap beetle adults, whereas the neem oil applied at postpollination attracted the most sap beetle adults in 2007. Among the six edible oil treatments, the corn and sesame oils applied at postpollination reduced corn earworm damage only in 2007. The application of the peanut oil at postpollination attracted more sap beetle adults in 2006, and more sap beetle larvae in 2007.

Apart from practical problems in emasculation and pollination, the conventional hybridization strategy is hampered due to non-availability of pure lines in cumin. RZ 19 was selected for the present study. Air dried seeds of RZ 19 were subjected to ? rays at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 Kr. M1 generation was raised from the treated seed by dibbling 400 seeds per treatment along with untreated check. No specific morphological mutations were observed in this generation. 50 normal looking plants from each radiation dose and control were advanced to M2. Out of these 50 plants, 25 were self pollinated to produce 'self pollinated' M2 progenies in each radiation dose. Seeds harvested from each of the 125 self pollinated and open pollinated progenies were sown in single row plots in RBD in the ensuing year along with control to raise M 2 generation. The control was repeated after every 40 progenies in each block. Observations were recorded on important morphological traits. The progenies in each generation were screened for all possible mutations. Only albino (two) and chlorine (five) types were seen which did not survive beyond seedling stage. Three plants with white flowers were also observed in contrast to pink flowers in RZ 19. Higher estimates of GCV and PCV, heritability in radiation treatments than in control indicated induction of heritable variation. Linear increase in mean values along with the radiation gradient was observed for most of the characters. 30 Kr and 40 Kr are best doses which induced more mutations per dose, 20 Kr dose was ineffective while 60 Kr induced more of seed sterility. © Agrimedia GmbH &amp; Co.

An alternative breeding strategy called ""Breeding without Breeding"" (BwB) is proposed, which, in principle, relies on the DNA marker-based pedigree reconstruction from wind-pollinated progenies instead of controlled crosses. To test whether the pedigree structure could be established from progenies of clonal trials, we investigated the spatial pattern of local pollen flow and paternity assignment in a clone archive of Norway spruce. The results showed that 42% of the progeny can be assigned to fathers within 30-m distance with high confidence. Effective pollen dispersal decreased rapidly with distance and followed exponential distribution on local scale. The extent of close-neighbor (within 6 m) mating ranged from 0% to 48% among grafts with an average of 13%. Distance explained 25% deviance in mating success, and other factors such as phenology and spatial configuration of the clones should have contributed the rest. The success of parentage assignment in clone archive opens up the possibility to apply BwB in clonal trials of species that are easy to propagate vegetatively. This procedure could substantially shorten the breeding cycle and still give similar gain per year as the conventional breeding. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding strategy; Male reproductive success; Paternity assignment; Pollen dispersal; SSR markers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956128998

However, the evidence observed in different species has indicated the presence of modifier genes outside the S locus affecting the expression of self-compatibility/self-incompatibility. The study of a progeny obtained from the cross of the almond genotypes 'Vivot'× 'Blanquerna' has allowed the construction of a genetic map based on microsatellite markers and the identification for the first time in the Rosaceae family of two additional loci located outside the S locus and affecting the expression of self-compatibility/self-incompatibility. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) was located relatively close to the S locus, on linkage group 6 (G6), whereas the second one was located on G8. These QTLs appear to be involved in conferring self-compatibility to genotypes not possessing the Sf allele. These results are consistent with almond being a self-incompatible species with a genetic background of pseudo-self-compatibility controlled by modifier genes. The effect of the Sf allele and the two QTLs may contribute to explain the wide range of fruit sets observed when self-pollinating different almond genotypes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding; Prunus amygdalus Batsch; QTLs; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956152102

The objectives of this work were to analyze the effects of high expression of the constitutively functional Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Ca2+/H+ exchanger (sCAX1) tonoplast protein in tomato fruit on cellular Ca partitioning and distribution, membrane integrity, and the transcriptional profile of genes potentially involved in BER development. Wild-type and sCAX1-expressing tomato plants were grown in a greenhouse. Wild-type plants did not develop BER, whereas sCAX1-expressing plants reached 100% BER incidence at 15 d after pollination. The sCAX1-expressing fruit pericarp had higher total tissue and water-soluble Ca concentrations, lower apoplastic and cytosolic Ca concentrations, higher membrane leakage, and Ca accumulation in the vacuole of sCAX1-expressing cells. Microarray analysis of healthy sCAX1-expressing fruit tissue indicated down-regulation of genes potentially involved in BER development, such as genes involved in membrane structure and repair and cytoskeleton metabolism, as well as up-regulation of genes that may have limited BER damage expansion, such as genes coding for heat shock proteins, glutathione S-transferases, and peroxidases. The results indicate that the high expression of the sCAX1 gene reduces cytosolic and apoplastic Ca concentrations, affecting plasma membrane structure and leading to BER symptom development in the fruit tissue. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958053978

We evaluated resource availability on meadows of low intensity (low/unfertilised, mown once or twice per year) and meadows of high-intensity land use (high fertilisation, mown twice or thrice) before and after the first mowing in relation to network specialisation, species richness and composition of flower visitors.We studied 40 meadows, simultaneously sampling one meadow of low intensity and one meadow of high-intensity land use. Each survey yielded a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found during 6h in an area of 1000m2.In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species. Species composition of plants and flower visitors differed considerably between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43% in plants and 42% in flower visitors. Complementary specialisation of flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less specialised than beetles and butterflies, and bees had the highest degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows of low-intensity land use were significantly richer in flowering plant, bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plant-flower visitor interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land use. However, later in the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant species richness, being higher on meadows of low-intensity land use.We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from differences in grassland management may alter plant-flower visitor interactions. Moreover, an impoverishment of flower diversity has stronger effects on the diversity and species composition of specialised flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors. © 2011 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Diversity; Fertilisation; Insects; Mowing; Plant-pollinator networks; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957583536

We test with meta-analysis whether the benefits of AEM for species richness and abundance of plants and animals are determined by the surrounding landscape context. Across all studies (109 observations for species richness and 114 observations for abundance), AEM significantly increased species richness and their abundance. More specifically, we test the hypothesis that AEM benefits species richness and abundance (i.e. increases the difference between fields with and without AEM) more in simple than in complex landscapes. In croplands, species richness but not abundance was significantly enhanced in simple but not in complex landscapes. In grasslands, AEM effectively enhanced species richness and abundance regardless of landscape context. Pollinators were significantly enhanced by AEM in simple but not in complex landscapes in both croplands and grasslands. Our results highlight that the onesize- fits-all approach of many agri-environmental programmes is not an efficient way of spending the limited funds available for biodiversity conservation on farmland. Therefore, we conclude that AEM should be adapted to landscape structure and the species groups at which they are targeted. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Agri-environment schemes; Complex landscape; Cropland; Grassland; Organic farming; Simple landscape,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955781789

In this study, we analysed the genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure (SGS) and mating system at the hierarchical levels of fruits and individuals as well as pollen dispersal patterns in a continuous population of Theobroma cacao in Pará State, Brazil. A total of 156 individuals in a 0.56 ha plot were mapped and genotyped for nine microsatellite loci. For the mating system analyses, 50 seeds were collected from nine seed trees by sampling five fruits per tree (10 seeds per fruit). Among the 156 individuals, 127 had unique multilocus genotypes, and the remaining were clones. The population was spatially aggregated; it demonstrated a significant SGS up to 15 m that could be attributed primarily to the presence of clones. However, the short seed dispersal distance also contributed to this pattern. Population matings occurred mainly via outcrossing, but selfing was observed in some seed trees, which indicated the presence of individual variation for self-incompatibility. The matings were also correlated, especially within (r?p(m) = 0.607) rather than among the fruits (r?p(m) = 0.099), which suggested that a small number of pollen donors fertilised each fruit. The paternity analysis suggested a high proportion of pollen migration (61.3%), although within the plot, most of the pollen dispersal encompassed short distances (28 m). The determination of these novel parameters provides the fundamental information required to establish long-term ex situ conservation strategies for this important tropical species. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Cocoa; effective population size; microsatellite loci; paternity analysis; tropical tree,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956370841

Most studies of alien plant-pollinator interactions have focused on the effects of alien plants on native plant reproduction; however, these alien plants may also be important food resources for native bees especially if they dominate the "" floral market"" Dominance of alien species in the diet of bees could occur due to high relative density and abundance of alien plants and flowers, and/or to bee preference for alien plants when they are present. We investigated bees' use of and preference for alien plants using two data sets from distinct regions of North America, central California and southern New Jersey. In each system, we sampled bees and flowering plants in multiple habitat types that differ in level of disturbance and in the relative abundance of alien plant species. Alien plants as a group dominated interactions with bee communities in more disturbed habitats. Importance, however, varied among plant species such that a subset of highly used plant species drove the overall pattern of use within the community. Despite higher use of alien plants in more disturbed sites, alien plants as a group were not more preferred. Rather, bees' use of individual alien plants correlated with plant abundance in the community. Consistent with the interpretation that bees use, but do not prefer, alien plants, we found no effect of alien plant abundance or richness on bee abundance or richness. © 2011 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.",Alien plant; Bees; Exotic plant; Human disturbance; Invasive species; Preference; Resource use,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957582997

During the Mesozoic era, there are at least two episodes, one concentrated in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic interval, and the other beginning in the mid-Cretaceous, about 100 Ma. This second Mesozoic revolution witnessed the origin of 19 important innovations related to competition and predation, as well as the enormous expansion of diversity of angiosperms, fungi, and insects on land and of gastropods and fishes in the sea. The great excess of diversity on land, which dates to this revolution, owes its origins to the vast radiations of plants and their associated pests, dispersers, and pollinators. These radiations, as well as the increased emphasis on rapid locomotion and consumption in the sea, were made possible by a three- to four-fold increase in the photosynthetic capacity of phylogenetically derived eudicot angiosperms beginning about 100 Ma. Higher productivity throughout the biosphere made modes of life that require high inputs of energy and power feasible, and brought about renewed enemy-related escalation. The Mesozoic revolution modernized the global biota and set the stage for additional episodes of escalation during the Cenozoic era. The ultimate cause triggering all these episodes is the tectonic and erosion-related introduction of nutrients, together with warm conditions and increasing levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. © by the Palaeontological Society of Japan.",Cretaceous; escalation; innovation; productivity; tectonics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051737014

The donors (mother/father) had the following characteristics: thousand seed weight (TSW, g) 10.8/3.6; essential oil content of the fruits (%, v/w) 15.5/6.4. The crossing was conducted in the green house by manual emasculation and transfer of the pollen by a brush with subsequent isolation of the pollinated flowers. The F2 seeds were generated by isolated flowering and self-pollination of the F, plants. The populations (P1, P 2, F1, F2) underwent a performance test in a field experiment. The comparison of the frequency distribution of the fruit size and the essential oil content of the investigated populations revealed no multimodal distribution. Hence a quantitative inheritance of both traits can be assumed. Obviously there exist no restrictions to combine both traits due to the absence of a clear correlation between essential oil content and TSW. The parental populations and the F1 generation had no plants with the aspired combination of an oil content of more than 8% and a thousand seed weight minor 4 g.

At one extreme, plants are sexually infertile and reproduction is solely clonal. Infertility can be caused by environmental and/or genetic factors, but the role of each is often unknown. Here we determine variation in sexual reproduction and explore the underlying factors causing sexual infertility in Cyrtanthus breviflorus Harv. We examined open- and cross-pollinated fruit set, ploidy using flow cytometry, pollen viability, pollinator visits to flowers and pollen deposition onto stigmas. One population was sexually infertile; no plants produced fruit. Three populations were sexually fertile; >98% of plants produced fruit. Percent pollen viability differed between infertile (18%) and fertile (97%) populations. The most likely cause of infertility was unequal ploidy. Plants in the infertile population were triploid, whereas those in fertile populations were diploid. Pollination factors were not related to infertility. In infertile and fertile populations, pollen-collecting insects visited flowers frequently, depositing 4-fold more pollen grains onto stigmas than the number of ovules per flower. Our study is the first to demonstrate infertility and triploidy in C. breviflorus. How triploidy became established despite high levels of pollinator activity remains a challenging question. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957441851

Irrigation treatments included complete restoration of water use during the whole growing season (control), water deficit during the vegetative phase (vegetative stressed stage) and water deficit during the reproductive phase (reproductive stressed stage). Soil water content was periodically measured; leaf water and osmotic potential, net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, intercellular CO 2 concentration were also measured on pepper leaves. Flowers were monitored till the end of the crop cycle to calculate fruit setting. Leaf water and osmotic potential changed with time according to the soil water content of stressed treatments. Photosynthesis was lower in vegetative stressed stage and reproductive stressed stage treatments during the water stress periods compared to the well watered control. During the vegetative phase, water stress significantly reduced the number of flowers per plant, decreasing from 30.9 to 10.7 in the control and vegetative stressed stage treatments, respectively. Unlike flowering, setting was not affected by water stress, when it was imposed during both the vegetative and reproductive phases. Total pepper yield gradually decreased going from the fully irrigated treatment to the treatment stressed during the vegetative phase, getting to the lowest value in the treatment stressed during the reproductive phase (5644, 2040 and 875 g m -2, respectively).

Sunflower hybrid S-278 was planted in randomized complete block design with four replications. Each head was divided into three equal circles (outer, middle and central) at maturity, thereafter, oil and fatty acid distribution was separately determined in each circle. Oil and fatty acid accumulated in three circles differed significantly. Outer circle accumulated higher oil content during spring which decreased to the minimum in central circle while, autumn season showed contrasting results in which oil contents progressively increased from outer to central circle. The maximum oleic acid was observed in outer circle which decreased to minimum in central circle during the both spring and autumn seasons, however, linoleic acid consistently increased from outer to central circle during both the seasons. Thus, oleic and linoleic acid depicted inverse relation with circles. Saturated fatty acid (palmatic acid and stearic acid) did not depict any consistent pattern for accumulation in different circles during both the seasons. Overall, spring planted crop exhibited significantly higher values for oil and oleic contents in comparison with autumn planting, which may be attributed to higher temperature, sunshine hours and accumulation of more growing degree days during the spring.© Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2011.",Accumulation; Autumn; Circles; Distribution; Fatty acid; Oil; Spring; Varying environments,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957489394

On the island of Tasmania it has a more-or-less continuous distribution across its range and it dominates much of the wet sclerophyll forest managed for forestry purposes. To understand better the distribution of genetic variation in these native forests we examined nuclear microsatellite diversity in 432 mature individuals from 20 populations of E. obliqua across Tasmania, including populations from each end of three locally steep environmental gradients. In addition, chloroplast microsatellite loci were assessed in 297 individuals across 31 populations. Nuclear microsatellite diversity values in E. obliqua were high (average HE=0.80) and inbreeding coefficients low (average F=0.02) within these populations. The degree of differentiation between populations was very low (F ST=0.015). No significant microsatellite differentiation could be found across three locally steep environmental gradients, even though there is significant genetic differentiation in quantitative traits. This suggests that the observed quantitative variation is maintained by natural selection. Population differentiation based on chloroplast haplotypes was high (G ST=0.69) compared with that based on nuclear microsatellites, suggesting that pollen-mediated gene flow is 150 times the level of seed-mediated gene flow in this animal-pollinated species; hence, pollen is likely to be the main mode of gene flow countering selection along local environmental gradients.

The pollen-ovule ratio (2346:1) revealed that the species is adapted to entomophilous pollination. Pollen viability and stigma receptivity are temporally isolated; stigma is receptive on the third day and pollen viability is highest (75%) on the day of anthesis. Field observations confirmed that the flowers offer both pollen and nectar to the visitors. The visitors include honey bees and butterflies, but the former served as better pollinators. Manual pollinations revealed that the species permits both geitonogamous and xenogamous pollination. The fruit set rate in natural pollination is low (38%), but manual xenogamous pollination enhanced the fruit set up to 65%. Its dependence on specialized habitats, fragmentation of populations, narrow environmental niche, scarcity of pollinators, delayed stigma receptivity and low percentage of seed germination could be the reasons for its limited distribution and endangerment in the Western Ghats.",Critically endangered; Impatiens platyadena; Narrow distribution; Reproductive ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958803277

However there is little knowledge if organic farming also increases ecosystem services like pest control. We assessed 30 triticale fields (15 organic vs. 15 conventional) and recorded vascular plants, pollinators, aphids and their predators. Further, five conventional fields which were treated with insecticides were compared with 10 non-treated conventional fields. Organic fields had five times higher plant species richness and about twenty times higher pollinator species richness compared to conventional fields. Abundance of pollinators was even more than one-hundred times higher on organic fields. In contrast, the abundance of cereal aphids was five times lower in organic fields, while predator abundances were three times higher and predator-prey ratios twenty times higher in organic fields, indicating a significantly higher potential for biological pest control in organic fields. Insecticide treatment in conventional fields had only a short-term effect on aphid densities while later in the season aphid abundances were even higher and predator abundances lower in treated compared to untreated conventional fields. Our data indicate that insecticide treatment kept aphid predators at low abundances throughout the season, thereby significantly reducing top-down control of aphid populations. Plant and pollinator species richness as well as predator abundances and predator-prey ratios were higher at field edges compared to field centres, highlighting the importance of field edges for ecosystem services. In conclusion organic farming increases biodiversity, including important functional groups like plants, pollinators and predators which enhance natural pest control. Preventative insecticide application in conventional fields has only short-term effects on aphid densities but long-term negative effects on biological pest control. Therefore conventional farmers should restrict insecticide applications to situations where thresholds for pest densities are reached. © 2011 Krauss et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956220974

Crop resistance to a given herbicide can be of practical value to control weeds with efficient chemical use. In some crops (for example, wheat, maize, and canola), resistance to imidazolinone herbicides (IMIs) has been introduced through mutation breeding and is extensively used commercially. However, this production system imposes plant-back restrictions on rotational crops because of herbicide residuals in the soil. In the case of barley, a preferred rotational crop after wheat, a period of 9-18 mo is required. Thus, introduction of barley varieties showing resistance to IMIs will provide greater flexibility as a rotational crop. The objective of the research reported was to identify resistance in barley for IMIs through induced mutagenesis. To achieve this objective, a sodium azide-treated M2/M3 population of barley cultivar Bob was screened for resistance against acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS)-inhibiting herbicides. The phenotypic screening allowed identification of a mutant line showing resistance against IMIs. Molecular analysis identified a single-point mutation leading to a serine 653 to asparagine amino acid substitution in the herbicide-binding site of the barley AHAS gene. The transcription pattern of the AHAS gene in the mutant (Ser653Asn) and WT has been analyzed, and greater than fourfold difference in transcript abundance was observed. Phenotypic characteristics of the mutant line are promising and provide the base for the release of IMI-resistant barley cultivar(s).",Crop rotation; Imidazolinone resistance; Improved transcription,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957762533

Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of 2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively. Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e.g. trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B. hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on the insects. Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However, even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e.g. when searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites. © 2011 Hagen et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956153059

We investigated plant-pollinator interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density, pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species. We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense with the landscape metrics "" green area"", representing the total extent of vegetated areas, and "" edge density of green areas"", representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to 200. m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B. pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed considerable variation at scales below 100. m radius. Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T. pratense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently co-occurred with T. pratense. We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green areas. © 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.",Bombus pascuorum; Flower visitors; Landscape scale effects; Local community effects; Plant-plant interactions; Trifolium pratense,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955602340

This species displays one of the larger capitulum within the genus. Under the reproductive assurance hypothesis, and considering its short longevity (monocarpic triennial), an autogamous breeding system and low levels of pollen limitation would be predicted for C. renifolia. In contrast, considering its large floral size, a xenogamous breeding system, and significant levels of pollen limitation could be expected. In addition, the increased pollination probability hypothesis predicts prolonged stigma longevity for high alpine plants. We tested these alternative predictions by performing experimental crossings in the field to establish the breeding system and to measure the magnitude of pollen limitation in two populations of C. renifolia. In addition, we measured the stigma longevity in unpollinated and open pollinated capitula, and pollinator visitation rates in the field. We found low levels of self-compatibility and significant levels of pollen limitation in C. renifolia. Pollinator visitation rates were moderate (0.047-0.079 visits per capitulum per 30 min). Although pollinator visitation rate significantly differed between populations, they were not translated into differences in achene output. Finally, C. renifolia stigma longevity of unpollinated plants was extremely long and significantly higher than that of open pollinated plants (26.3±2.8 days vs. 10.1±2.2, respectively), which gives support to the increased pollination probability hypothesis for high-elevation flowering plants. Our results add to a growing number of studies that show that xenogamous breeding systems and mechanisms to increase pollination opportunities can be selected in high-elevation ecosystems. © 2011 Torres-Díaz et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955800233

The flowers are pollinated by Xylocopa spp bees, and seeds are dispersed by mammals with distinct home range sizes. As a consequence, relative contributions of pollen and seeds to overall gene flow can vary according to different spatial scales. We studied the genetic structure of four natural populations of S. lycocarpum separated by 19 to 128 km, including individuals located along dirt roads that interlink three of the populations. A total of 294 individuals were genotyped with five nuclear and six chloroplast microsatellite markers. Significant spatial genetic structure was found in the total set of individuals; the Sp statistic was 0.0086. Population differentiation based on the six chloroplast microsatellite markers (?pC = 0.042) was small and similar to that based on the five nuclearmicrosatellite markers (?p = 0.054). For this set of populations, pollen and seed flow did not differ significantly from one another (pollen-to-seed flow ratio = 1.22). Capability for long distance seed dispersion and colonization of anthropogenic sites contributes to the ability of S. lycocarpum to maintain genetic diversity.

The first aim of the present study was to assess if these results could be explained by differences in self-fertility, nectar rewards or floral display between the two species. Moreover, in a second step, we examined if the higher visitation rate on S. inaequidens has a negative effect on the reproductive success of J. vulgaris. Methods - Self-fertility was estimated after self- and cross-hand pollinations. Nectar volume, total sugar concentration and sugar composition were analysed on plants cultivated under controlled conditions. In the field, in order to assess the effect of floral display and impact of the invasive on the pollination success of the native, insect behaviour was assessed by comparing visitation rates, number of visitors per 10 min observation and individual censuses. Floral display (density of capitula per unit area) was artificially modified by clipping or grouping inflorescences in both species. Key results - In terms of self-fertility, seed sets were similarly low after self-pollination (11-12%) for both species. S. inaequidens produced lower amounts of nectar with lower sugar concentration compared to J. vulgaris. No influence of floral display was detected on insect visitation rates. The presence of S. inaequidens did not alter pollinator visits and seed set of J. vulgaris. Conclusions - Other traits need to be investigated to explain the different visitation rates and reproductive success between the two species. The higher seed set of S. inaequidens could be due to a higher outcrossing rate, or more frequent pollinator movements between individuals. © 2011 National Botanic Garden of Belgium and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium.",Asteraceae; Floral display; Invasive success; Jacobaea vulgaris; Nectar; Pollinator; Reproductive ecology; Self-fertility; Senecio inaequidens; Senecio jacobaea; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952724168

Pollen walls, however, are not broken down because they consist of sporopollenin and are highly resistant to physical and enzymatic damage. Here we report that certain Microlepidoptera chemically dissolve pollen grains with exudates from their mouthparts. Methodology/Principal Findings: Field observations and experiments in tropical China revealed that two species of Deltophora (Gelechioidea) are the exclusive pollinators of two species of Phyllanthus (Phyllanthaceae) on which their larvae develop and from which the adults take pollen and nectar. DNA sequences placed the moths and plants phylogenetically and confirmed that larvae were those of the pollinating moths; molecular clock dating suggests that the moth clade is younger than the plant clade. Captive moths with pollen on their mouthparts after 2-3 days of starvation no longer carried intact grains, and SEM photographs showed exine fragments on their proboscises. GC-MS revealed cis-?-ocimene as the dominant volatile in leaves and flowers, but GC-MS analyses of proboscis extracts failed to reveal an obvious sporopollenin-dissolving compound. A candidate is ethanolamine, which occurs in insect hemolymphs and is used to dissolve sporopollenin by palynologists.

Petunia provides an attractive model system to study the role of floral characters in reproductive isolation and speciation. The night-active hawkmoth pollinator Manduca sexta relies on olfactory cues provided by Petunia axillaris. In contrast, Petunia exserta, which displays a typical hummingbird pollination syndrome, is devoid of scent. The two species can easily be crossed in the laboratory, which makes it possible to study the genetic basis of the evolution of scent production and the importance of scent for pollinator behavior. Results: In an F2 population derived from an interspecific cross between P. axillaris and P. exserta, we identified two quantitative trait loci (QTL) that define the difference between the two species' ability to produce benzenoid volatiles. One of these loci was identified as the MYB transcription factor ODORANT1. Reciprocal introgressions of scent QTL were used for choice experiments under controlled conditions. These experiments demonstrated that the hawkmoth M. sexta prefers scented plants and that scent determines choice at a short distance. When exposed to conflicting cues of color versus scent, the insects display no preference, indicating that color and scent are equivalent cues. Conclusion: Our results show that scent is an important flower trait that defines plant-pollinator interactions at the level of individual plants. The genetic basis underlying such a major phenotypic difference appears to be relatively simple and may enable rapid loss or gain of scent through hybridization.

Members of this family are widely grown as ornamental plants. The species Dianthus chinensis, Dianthus barbatus, and Dianthus superbus include notable examples of such ornamental varieties. Intra- and inter-specific hybridization is important for the breeding of improved varieties and, therefore, it is desirable to optimize the efficiency of cross-pollination procedures within this family. Here, we conducted intra-specific pollination using four lines of D. chinensis, and inter-specific pollination between D. chinensis, D. barbatus and D. superbus genotypes. For each of these crosses we recorded information of pollen viability, stigma development stage at time of pollination, pollen germination on the stigma surface and pollen tube elongation within the stigma, and final seed set. Pollen viability levels were determined at the start of anther dehiscence, which occurred on day 1 of flower opening. The genotypes D. chinensis var. 'Bz2', D. barbatus var. 'Xb', and D. superbus wild species 'Qm' all displayed good levels of pollen viability (i.e. between 68% and 75%); D. chinensis vars. 'H58III', 'H68I' and 'H6II' showed lower levels of pollen viability (i.e. between 32% and 51%). In each Dianthus line, the stigma organs were observed to undergo morphological changes during the 1-7. d following flower opening. We have characterized these changes as five distinct development stages, namely, 'column' (day 1), 'Y-like' (day 2), 'Y-shaped with slight curve' (days 3-4), 'Y-shaped horn-like' (days 5-6), and 'wilting' (day 7). Pollen was artificially applied to stigma organs at each of these development stages and aniline blue staining was used to follow pollen tube germination on the stigma surface and pollen tube elongation down the length of the stigma. This showed that the 'Y-shaped slightly curved' stigma stage (3-4. d) was optimal for pollination. The 'Y-shaped horn-like' stage (5-6. d) was also receptive to pollination. By contrast, the earlier 'Y-shaped' (2. d) and 'column' (1. d) stages, and also the later 'wilting' (7. d) stage, were far less receptive. Parallel field experiments were conducted in which seed set was measured following the artificial pollination of flowers at different development stages. These data also indicated that the optimal time for pollination was during 3-4. d of flower opening. This conclusion held true for both intra- and inter-specific crosses of the various Dianthus lines. Thus, stigma receptivity in Dianthus does not become optimal until 3-4. d after flower opening. Since anther dehiscence occurs at 1. d (i.e. when stigma are at the unreceptive 'column' stage), this suggests that Dianthus employs a delayed self-fertilization strategy. We also found a significant effect of genotype on pollen tube growth and seed-set values. The highest numbers of seed per flower were achieved when the D. superbus wild species 'Qm' was the female parent in inter-specific crosses. Thus, genotype and stigma development are identified as key factors that determine the success of cross-pollination in Dianthus lines. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Dianthus spp.; Genotype; Intra-/inter-species cross; Pollen tube; Seed set; Stigma morphology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953323673

One goal was to assess immature mortality via treating nectar-pollen provisions and adults with novaluron. Immature M. rotundata mortality in all novaluron provision dosing treatments was significantly higher than the water or blank controls, providing evidence that novaluron is toxic to progeny in nest cells. The mean cumulative frequency showed that more eggs and 1st 2nd instars died compared to older instars. Female M. rotundata nested similarly in field cages during the field cage experiment; however, there was greater immature mortality in cages where females were fed sugar-water + novaluron compared to sugar-water only. Although females provided adequate provisions, there was a low percentage of egg hatch and larval development when females ingested novaluron before mating and nesting. Novaluron was also present in egg provision of bees collecting resources from novaluron-sprayed plants. At least 84% of progeny died when the females were allowed to mate and nest 24 hours after a novaluron application. Novaluron could be contributing to poor bee return in alfalfa grown for seed.

Pollen germination rates (52-87%) were high from April to June (22.2-27.2°C) and October to November (19.4-25.6°C) and pollen tube length was long (208-272 ?m) during the same periods, while the rates were low (5-32%) and the tube length was short (63-134 ?m) from January to March (14.6-18.1°C); moreover, no germinated pollen was found from July to September (28.2-30.5°C). These results of the seasonal fluctuation in pollen germination ability were supported by pollen germination tests performed in an incubation chamber, i.e., pollen germination rates were high (72-80%) between 20 and 25°C, but low (0-56%) below 15°C and above 30°C; however, the pistils of 'Sunrise Solo' and 'Wonder Flare' retained their reproductive function even during the period of low (16.7°C) and high (29.5-30.5°C) temperatures, i.e., fruit and seed yields were improved by pollination using pollen (germination rate: about 35%) collected from plants cultivated in an open field during the high temperature period or pollen preserved at sub-zero temperatures during the low and high temperature periods. These results indicate that fruit and seed production in papaya under low or high temperature conditions is unfavorable for pollen germination, but could be improved by artificial pollination with preserved pollen.

Among these four types, PCNA is the most important cultivar for persimmon breeding due to the stable loss of natural astringency on the tree. The trait of natural astringency loss is recessive in Japanese PCNA cultivars, while that in the Chinese PCNA cultivar, 'Luo tian tian shi', is dominant and the latter locus, termed CPCNA, is different from that in Japanese cultivars. In order to develop a molecular marker for the selection of the CPCNA-type cultivar, we performed amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) in combination with bulked segregant analysis for F1offspring derived from 'Luo tian tian shi', which was used as the maternal parent. A total of 384 primer combinations were tested, and three AFLP markers, namely EACT-MCCC-222 (RO1), EGGC-MCTC-309 (RO2), and EGCC-MCGA-105 (RO3), linked to the CPCNA dominant allele were obtained. Among these markers, EGGC/MCTC-309 (RO2) was converted into a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker. PCR analysis using F1offspring (n = 264) revealed that the relevance ratio of the SCAR marker was 94%. The polymorphism of the RO2 marker, which was strongly linked to the CPCNA dominant allele, was detected in only two Chinese PCNA cultivars, namely 'Luo tian tian shi' and 'Tian bao gai', among the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese cultivars tested. These results indicate that the RO2 marker contributes to marker-assisted selection for breeding programs of new PCNA cultivars having the CPCNA trait.

Blackish hairy spots on the upper surface of foliage may imitate black mold spots, serving as short-term visual lures. Some odor molecules also associated with Cladosporium cultures were isolated in the floral scent.

The full model consists of three nonlinear reaction-diffusion-advection equations defined on a rectangular region. In view of analyzing the full model, we firstly consider the temporal dynamics of three homogeneous cases. The first one is a model for a mutualistic interaction (pollinator-plant), later on a sort of predator-prey (plant-herbivore) interaction model is studied. In both cases, the interaction term is described by a Holling response of type II. Finally, by considering that the plant population is the unique feeding source for the herbivores, a mathematical model for the three interacting populations is considered. By incorporating a constant diffusion term into the equations for the pollinators and herbivores, we numerically study the spatiotemporal dynamics of the first two mentioned models. For the full model, a constant diffusion and advection terms are included in the equation for the pollinators. For the resulting model, we sketch the proof of the existence, positiveness, and boundedness of solution for an initial and boundary values problem. In order to see the separated effect of the diffusion and advection terms on the final population distributions, a set of numerical simulations are included.

Floral mechanisms that ensure autonomous seed set are therefore more likely to occur in species that grow in habitats where pollination is scarce and/or unpredictable. Methods Emasculation and pollen supplementation experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions to investigate the capacity for, and timing of autonomous selfing in three closely related Centaurium species (Centaurium erythraea, C. littorale and C. pulchellum). In addition, observations of flower visitors were combined with emasculation and pollen addition experiments in natural populations to investigate the degree of pollinator limitation and pollination failure and to assess the extent to which autonomous selfing conferred reproductive assurance.ResultsAll three species were capable of autonomous selfing, although this capacity differed significantly between species (index of autonomous selfing 0·55 ± 0·06, 0·68 ± 0·09 and 0·92 ± 0·03 for C. erythraea, C. littorale and C. pulchellum, respectively). The efficiency and timing of autogamous selfing was primarily associated with differences in the degree of herkogamy and dichogamy. The number of floral visitors showed significant interspecific differences, with 1·6 ± 0·6, 5·4 ± 0·6 and 14·5 ± 2·1 floral visitors within a 2 × 2 m2 plot per 20-min observation period, for C. pulchellum, C. littorale and C. erythraea, respectively. Concomitantly, pollinator failure was highest in C. pulchellum and lowest in C. erythraea. Nonetheless, all three study species showed very low levels of pollen limitation (index of pollen limitation 0·14 ± 0·03, 0·11 ± 0·03 and 0·09 ± 0·02 for C. erythraea, C. littorale and C. pulchellum, respectively), indicating that autonomous selfing may guarantee reproductive assurance. Conclusions These findings show that limited availability of pollinators may select for floral traits and plant mating strategies that lead to a system of reproductive assurance via autonomous selfing. © 2011 The Author.",Autonomous selfing; Centaurium erythraea; Centaurium littorale; Centaurium pulchellum; competing selfing; delayed selfing; floral emasculation; pollen-limitation; pollen: ovule ratio; pollinator failure; reproductive assurance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955414218

The flowering displayed by both species was considered continuous and long duration, constantly providing pollen to floral visitors. C. ovalifolia was visited by 17 species of bees and C. ramosa by 16 species, predominantly from the Apidae family (with a similarity index of 74%). The behavior displayed by these visiting bees was of vibrating anthers. The small-sized Euglossa sp. Latreille, 1802 and Florilegus similis Urban, 1970 bees played less of a role as pollinators, since they rarely touched the flower stigma during harvests and were thus considered opportunist visitors or casual pollinators. Centris decolorata Lepetier, 1841 (= C. leprieuri) and Xylocopa subcyanea Perez, 1901 are large bees and were considered efficient pollinators of C. ovalifolia and C. ramosa because of the higher frequency and constancy of their visits, and their favourable behaviour and size for pollen transfer between flowers, which guarantees the survival of these native restinga plant species.",Apidae; Buzz pollination; Centris decolorata; Xylocopa subcyanea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960279239

Although this truism has broad intuitive appeal, a recent body of theory (Cheptou and Massol 2009; Massol and Cheptou 2011) casts doubt on whether adaptation favors both selfing and dispersal when both parameters are free to evolve. In these models, the joint evolution of dispersal and the selfing rate are considered in a metapopulation, with a spatially and temporally variable pollination environment. Under these conditions, adaptation favors one of two strategies: the ""dispersal/outcrosser"" syndrome and the ""no dispersal/selfing"" syndrome. These results appear to contradict the prediction of Baker's Law. These models clarify how variation in the pollination environment per se cannot generate an association between selfing and dispersal. That being said, demographic factors during dispersal episodes are likely to be important in generating patterns consistent with Baker's law. Determining whether Baker's law maintains its predictive utility requires determining whether seed banks, the perennial habit, multiple introductions, or the simultaneous arrival of many founders weaken selection for selfing during the bottleneck associated with a dispersal event.

Plants may experience conflicting selection on floral traits by different pollinators and between genders. Using artificial selection to increase phenotypic variation, we tested for conflicting and nonadditive selection on wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) flowers. To do this, we measured selection by each of the major pollinator taxa through both male and female fitness, and tested for a single-generation response to selection by a subset of these pollinators. We found some evidence for conflicting selection on anther exsertion--sweat bees exerted stabilizing selection and larger bees selected for increased exsertion. Stamen dimorphism was only under selection by honey bees, causing a response to selection in the next generation, and flower size was under similar selection by multiple pollinators. Selection differed significantly between genders for two traits, but there was no evidence for stronger selection through male fitness or for conflicting selection between genders. Our results suggest wild radish flowers can adapt to multiple pollinators, as we found little evidence for conflicting selection and no evidence for nonadditive selection among pollinators. © 2011 The Author(s).

We investigated the temporal (day/night; flower lifetime) and spatial (different flower parts, nectar) pattern of flower scent emission in nocturnally pollinated Dianthus inoxianus, and determined which compounds elicit physiological responses on the antennae of the sphingid pollinator Hyles livornica. The scent of D. inoxianus comprises 68 volatile compounds, but is dominated by aliphatic 2-ketones and sesquiterpenoids, which altogether make up 82% of collected volatiles. Several major and minor compounds elicit electrophysiological responses in the antennae of H. livornica. Total odor emission does not vary along day and night hours, and neither does along the life of the flower. However, the proportion of compounds eliciting physiological responses varies between day and night. All flower parts as well as nectar release volatiles. The scent of isolated flower parts is dominated by fatty acid derivatives, whereas nectar is dominated by benzenoids. Dissection (= damage) of flowers induced a ca. 20-fold increase in the rate of emission of EAD-active volatiles, especially aliphatic 2-ketones. We suggest that aliphatic 2-ketones might contribute to pollinator attraction in D. inoxianus, even though they have been attributed an insect repellent function in other plant species. We also hypothesize that the benzenoids in nectar may act as an honest signal ('nectar guide') for pollinators. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

They have protogynous hermaphroditic flowers, with exception of Uvariopsis species, which are monoecious. Fused petals of Isolona campanulata remain apically spreading and open during anthesis but form a deep basal urceolate tube around the reproductive organs. At anthesis the yellow pendent flowers emit a fruit-like scent and attracted small beetles, the likely pollinators. Piptostigma sp. flowers also emit a fruit-like scent but provide a closed pollination chamber formed by the three inner petals. Small staphylinid beetles attracted during the female stage of anthesis are released from the flowers at the end of the male stage 2-3 days later. Both species have diurnal anthesis, attracting and releasing the flower visitors during daytime. In contrast, Uvariodendron connivens and U. calophyllum have nocturnal anthesis with floral thermogenesis, produce spicy, aromatic and fruity scents and attract large Scarabaeidae beetles, the pollinators, along with many curculionid beetles, which were principally predators of the thick petals. The very large flowers of Monodora tenuifolia have yellowish petals which are spotted with dark red markings. Together with the sweetish, slightly disagreeable scent the flowers attract flies, principally dung flies. The two investigated Uvariopsis species are monoecious with pistillate and staminate flowers being functional at the same time. The violet red flowers of U. bakeriana visually seem to mimic the fruiting body of certain stinkhorn fungi (Phallaceae) although without producing their strong unpleasant carcass stench. Flower-visiting dung flies were rare. Conversely, U. congolana has a strong fungus-like scent, its flowers are presented at litter height and dung flies living in the litter were the flower visitors, albeit sporadic. The 4-5 days lasting anthesis of both Uvariopsis species appears to be an evolutionary consequence of their diffuse pollinator spectra. The studied African Annonaceae therefore have either cantharophilous or myiophilous/sapromyiophilous flowers with, in part, respectively, remarkably long anthesis, thermogenesis, and widely open, large flowers - all attributes unknown or rare in the hitherto better studied Neotropical Annonaceae. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Anthesis; Beetles; Cameroon; Flies; Floral adaptations; Flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955006757

Floral visitation is highly variable, and observational studies are limited in scope due to the considerable time necessary to acquire reliable data. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the analysis of hydrocarbon residues (footprints) deposited by insects during flower visits would allow reconstruction of the visitor community and prediction of seed set for large numbers of plants. In 3 consecutive years, we recorded bumblebee visitation to wild plants of comfrey, Symphytum officinale, and later used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify bumblebee-derived unsaturated hydrocarbons (UHCs) extracted from flowers. We found that the UHCs washed from corollas were most similar to the tarsal UHC profile of the most abundant bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum, in all 3 years. The species composition of the bumblebee communities estimated from UHCs on flowers were also similar to those actually observed. There was a significant positive correlation between the observed number of visits by each of three bumblebee species (contributing 3-68% of flower visits) and the estimated number of visits based on UHC profiles. Furthermore, significant correlations were obtained separately for workers and drones of two of the study species. Seed set of comfrey plants was positively correlated to overall bumblebee visitation and the total amount of UHCs on flowers, suggesting the potential for pollen limitation. We suggest that quantifying cumulative footprint hydrocarbons provides a novel way to assess floral visitation by insects and can be used to predict seed set in pollen-limited plants. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Scent-marks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954420205

Pollinator visitations do not come without cost, so plants usually offer a reward. However, the flowers of some plant species, mostly orchids, lack rewards and deceive animals into visiting their flowers. Deceptive species are thought to have high levels of variation in traits associated with advertisement and pollinator attraction, which have been attributed to genetic drift, or disruptive selection due to pollinator behavior. Rewarding species are assumed to have less variation due to stabilizing selection. We compared variability in floral morphology and fragrance composition between deceptive and rewarding species. Because both suites of traits are often linked with floral advertisement and pollinator attraction, we expected variation to be greater in species with deceptive pollination systems than in those offering rewards. We obtained floral morphology metrics for 20 deceptive species and 41 rewarding species native or naturalized in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Floral fragrances were sampled from eight deceptive species and four rewarding species. We found that the amplitude of variation in floral morphology and fragrance composition covaries significantly. Comparison of coefficients of variation for morphology indicated that, overall, deceptive species show significantly higher variation than rewarding species, and this pattern was also found among just orchids or just nonorchids. There were no statistical differences in morphological variation between orchids and nonorchids within a functional pollination group. Fragrance variation, measured by Jaccard distance, tended to be greater for deceptive species than for rewarding species. Although overlap in measures of variation occurs between the two groups, the data support the hypothesis that populations of deception-pollinated species are more variable than rewarding species in traits associated with pollinator attraction. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Floral fragrances; Floral traits; Flower advertisement; Morphological variation; Orchidaceae; Pollination mechanisms; Pollinator attraction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955934208

Increased pollination can be achieved either through a larger floral display or production of more pollen rewards. In this study, variation in resource allocation to different components for pollinator attraction was studied along an altitudinal gradient in Trollius ranunculoides, an obligate self-incompatible out-crosser of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We compared resource allocation to conspicuous yellow sepals (which mainly provide visual attraction) and degenerate petals (which provide the major nectar reward) between populations at four altitudes. Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of sepals and petals to pollinator attraction and female reproductive success in an experiment with sepal or petal removal at sites at different altitudes. At the level of single flowers, resource allocation increased to sepals but decreased to petals with increasing altitude. Consistent with these results, sepals contributed much more to visitation rate and seed set than petals, as confirmed in the sepal or petal removal experiment. Sepals and petals contributed to female reproductive success by ensuring visitation rate rather than visitation duration. To alleviate increasing pollen limitation with increasing altitude, resource allocation patterns of T. ranunculoides altered to favour development of sepals rather than petals. This strategy may improve pollination and reproductive success through visual attraction (sepal) rather than nectar reward (petal) over a gradient of decreasing pollinator abundance. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Floral display; Nectar reward; Pollen limitation; Visitation duration; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954505973

Currently, it is not well established whether a corresponding pattern holds for dioecious plants: do males of wind-pollinated species exhibit greater reproductive allocation than females? Here, sexual dimorphism is investigated in terms of life history trade-offs in a dioecious population of the wind-pollinated ruderal herb Mercurialis annua. Methods The allocation strategies of males and females grown under different soil nutrient availability and competitive (i.e. no, male or female competitor) regimes were compared. Key Results Male reproductive allocation increased disproportionately with biomass, and was greater than that of females when grown in rich soils. Sexual morphs differentially adjusted their reproductive allocation in response to local environmental conditions. In particular, males reduced their reproductive allocation in poor soils, whereas females increased theirs, especially when competing with another female rather than growing alone. Finally, males displayed smaller above-ground vegetative sizes than females, but neither nutrient availability nor competition had a strong independent effect on relative size disparities between the sexes. Conclusions Selection appears to favour plasticity in reproductive allocation in dioecious M. annua, thereby maintaining a relatively constant size hierarchy between sexual morphs. In common with other dioecious species, there seems to be little divergence in the niches occupied by males and females of M. annua. © 2011 The Author.",competition; Life history trade-offs; Mercurialis annua; reproductive allocation; resource availability; separate sexes; sex allocation; sexual size dimorphism; wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955444038

We asked (1) whether alien and native species differed in the frequency of pollination modes (insect pollination, self-pollination, wind pollination, water pollination), (2) whether the pollination modes affected the invasion success of two groups of aliens, differing in their residence time in Central Europe: archaeophytes (introduced before 1500) and neophytes (introduced more recently), and (3) whether there were differences in the diversity of insect pollinators of native species, and of alien species at different stages of invasion and with different residence time. The analysis was carried out using 2817 species occurring in the Czech Republic (1596 native and 1221 alien, the latter comprising 331 archaeophytes and 890 neophytes). Data were analyzed using generalized linear models. The alien flora introduced to Central Europe contained a higher proportion of insect-pollinated species than did the Central European native flora and linked to a higher diversity of pollinators per species. However, the frequency of pollination modes in the introduced alien flora gradually changed during the process of naturalization, becoming more similar to that of native species, and eventually, the naturalized species that became invasive did not differ in their frequency of pollination modes from native species. The frequency of self-pollination increased from casual through naturalized to invasive alien species. This suggests a remarkable role for pollination mode in successful invasions; indeed, selfpollination tends to support spread of neophytes more than any other mode of pollination. The range of habitats occupied by plants of different invasion status affected the diversity of insect pollinator species. In contrast, regional commonness of plant species only affected the number of pollinator functional groups. In native species and archaeophytes, there was a steeper accumulation of pollinator species with increasing habitat range than in neophytes. This indicates that groups of plants that have been provided with longer time to sample a wider range of habitats than recently arriving alien species have formed more associations with native pollinator species occurring in those habitats. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Alien plant species; Central Europe; Habitat range; Insect pollination; Plant invasion; Residence time; Selfing; Stage of invasion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955506648

Here the reproductive systems of Tibouchina pulchra and T. sellowiana were investigated by controlled pollinations. Their pollinators were identified, and experiments on floral color and fragrance changes were conduced to verify if those changes affect the floral visitation. Both Tibouchina species are self compatible. The flowers lasted three days or more, and the floral color changed from white in the 1st day to pink in the following days. Pollen deposition on stigma induced floral color change. The effectiveness of the pollination is dependent on bees' size; only large bees were regarded as effective pollinators. In experimental tests, the bees in T. pulchra preferred the natural white flowers while the visitors of T. sellowiana were attracted by both natural and mimetic 1st-day flowers (2nd-day flowers with experimentally attached 1st-day flower petals). During the experiments on floral fragrance, the bees visited both natural and mimetic 1st-day flowers (2nd-day flowers with 1st-day flower scents). In both experiments, the bees avoided natural 2nd-day flowers, but seldom visited modified 2nd-day flowers. The attractiveness of T. pulchra and T. sellowiana flowers cannot be attributed exclusively to the color or the fragrance separately, both factors seemingly act together. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Breeding systems; Floral fragrance; Flower biology; Mata Atlântica; Pollen flower; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955018804

These two plant groups are mainly pollinated by oil-gathering bees, which also specialize in pollen collection by buzzing. In the present study, the floral ecology of the rewardless orchid Tolumnia guibertiana (Oncidiinae) was studied for the first time. The orchid was self-incompatible and completely dependent on oil-gathering female bees (Centris poecila) for fruit production. This bee species was also the pollinator of two other yellow-flowered plants in the area: the pollen and oil producing Stigmaphyllon diversifolium (Malpighiaceae) and the polliniferous and buzzing-pollinated Ouratea agrophylla (Ochnaceae). To evaluate whether this system is a case of mimetism, we observed pollinator visits to flowers of the three plant species and compared the floral morphometrics of these flowers. The behavior, preferences and movement patterns of Centris bees among these plants, as well as the morphological data, suggest that, as previously thought, flowers of T. guibertiana mimic the Malpighiaceae S. diversifolium. However, orchid pollination in one of the studied populations appears to depend also on the presence of O. agrophylla. Moreover, at the two studied populations, male and female pollination successes of T. guibertiana were not affected by its own floral display, and did not differ between populations. The results are discussed in relation to the behavior and preferences of Centris bees, as well as the differential presence and influence of each of the two floral models. © 2011 The Authors.

Moreover, ethylene, spermidine, and spermine share a common biosynthetic precursor. The synchronous changes of them and the relationships with kernel set are currently unclear. Here, we stimulated maize (Zea maysL.) apical kernel set and studied their changes at 4, 8, 12, and 16 d after pollination (DAP). The status of the apical kernels changed from abortion to set, showing a pattern similar to that of the middle kernels, with slow decrease in glucose and rapid decline in ethylene production, and a sharp increase in spermidine and spermine after four DAP. Synchronous changes in ethylene and spermidine were also observed. However, the ethylene production decreased slowly in the aborted apical kernels, the glucose and polyamines concentrations were lower. Ethephon application did not block the change from abortion to set for the setting apical kernels. These data indicate that the developmental change may be accompanied by an inhibition of adequate glucose to ethylene synthesis and subsequent promotion of spermidine and spermine synthesis, and adequate carbohydrate supply may play a key role in the developmental process. © 2011 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955402274

Here, we report the defensive behavior strategies used by workers of the Australian stingless bee, Austroplebeia australis Friese, against the small hive beetle. A non-destructive method was used to observe in-hive behavior and interactions between bees and different life stages of small hive beetle (egg, larva, and adult). A number of different individual and group defensive behaviors were recorded. Up to 97% of small hive beetle eggs were destroyed within 90 min of introduction, with a significant increase in temporal rate of destruction between the first and subsequent introductions. A similar result was recorded for 3-day-old small hive beetle larvae, with an increased removal rate from 62.5 to 92.5% between the first and second introductions. Of 32 adult beetles introduced directly into the 4 colonies, 59% were ejected, with the remainder being entombed alive in hives within 6 h. Efficiency of ejection also significantly increased between the first and third introductions. Our observations suggest that A. australis colonies, despite no previous exposure to this exotic parasite, have well developed hive defences that are likely to minimize entry and survival of small hive beetles. © 2010 International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).",Aethina tumida; Austroplebeia australis; Defense strategies; Resin; Stingless bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952707410

We ask whether bee and fly pollinator taxa differ in their dispersal distances and transport of viable pollen in a human-modified system. Location Canterbury and Otago region, South Island, New Zealand. Methods We captured pollen-carrying insects travelling outside of a model mass-flowering agricultural crop, Brassica rapa, using insect flight intercept traps at five distances (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400m) from the pollen source. We examined pollen loads and pollen viability to determine whether pollen transport distance and viability differ among pollinator taxa. Results A total of 5453 insects were collected of which 717 individuals from 26 insect taxa were positively identified as dispersing pollen up to 400m from the source. These taxa consisted of four species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and eight species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Apidae generally carried higher pollen loads and more viable pollen than most fly taxa. Taxa in the fly families Stratiomyidae and Syrphidae, however, carried pollen to 400m, which is further than both bee families. Main conclusions A diverse array of wild and managed flower visitors can transport viable pollen from a pollen source to at least 400m. Knowledge of the differences in transport distances among generalist pollinators in human-modified environments is crucial to understand the potential extent to which (1) pollen transport can facilitate gene flow and (2) unwanted hybridization may occur between crops and related weeds. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Diptera; Dispersal; Distance; Gene flow; Hymenoptera; Mobility; Viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953774086

Bag X01, Scottsville, Pietermaritzburg 3209, South Africa","Background and Aims Although pollination of plants that attract flies by resembling their carrion brood and food sites has been reported in several angiosperm families, there has been very little work done on the level of specificity in carrion mimicry systems and the importance of plant cues in mediating such specialization. Specificity may be expected, as carrion-frequenting flies often exploit different niches, which has been interpreted as avoidance of interspecific competition. Interactions between the orchid Satyrium pumilum and a local assemblage of carrion flies were investigated, and the functional significance of floral traits, especially scent, tested. Pollination success and the incidence of pollinator-mediated self-pollination were measured and these were compared with values for orchids with sexual-and food-deceptive pollination systems. Methods and Key Results Observations of insect visitation to animal carcasses and to flowers showed that the local assemblage of carrion flies was dominated by blow flies (Calliphoridae), house flies (Muscidae) and flesh flies (Sarcophagidae), but flowers of the orchid were pollinated exclusively by flesh flies, with a strong bias towards females that sometimes deposited live larvae on flowers. A trend towards similar partitioning of fly taxa was found in an experiment that tested the effect of large versus small carrion quantities on fly attraction. GC-MS analysis showed that floral scent is dominated by oligosulfides, 2-heptanone, p-cresol and indole, compounds that also dominate carrion scent. Flesh flies did not distinguish between floral and carrion scent in a choice experiment using olfactory cues only, which also showed that scent alone is responsible for fly attraction. Pollination success was relatively high (31·5 of flowers), but tracking of stained pollinia also revealed that a relatively high percentage (46) of pollen deposited on stigmas originates from the same plant. Conclusions Satyrium pumilum selectively attracts flesh flies, probably because its relatively weak scent resembles that of the small carrion on which these flies predominate. In this way, the plants exploit a specific subset of the insect assemblage associated with carrion. Pollination rates and levels of self-pollination were high compared with those in other deceptive orchids and it is therefore unlikely that this mimicry system evolved to promote outcrossing. © 2011 The Author.",Calliphoridae; deception; floral scent; indole; oligosulfides; osmophore; outcrossing; p-cresol; Sarcophagidae; Satyrium pumilum; specialization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955387785

Much of the diversity is due to an exceptionally large contribution of just a few clades that radiated substantially within this region, but little is known about the causes of these radiations. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of plant diversification, using near complete species-level phylogenies of four major Cape clades (more than 470 species): the genus Protea, a tribe of legumes (Podalyrieae) and two speciose genera within the iris family (Babiana and Moraea), representing three of the seven largest plant families in this biodiversity hotspot. Combining these molecular phylogenetic data with ecological and biogeographical information, we tested key hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the radiation of the Cape flora. Our results show that the radiations started throughout the Oligocene and Miocene and that net diversification rates have remained constant through time at globally moderate rates. Furthermore, using sister-species comparisons to assess the impact of different factors on speciation, we identified soil type shifts as the most important cause of speciation in Babiana, Moraea, and Protea, whereas shifts in fire-survival strategy is the most important factor for Podalyrieae. Contrary to previous findings in other groups, such as orchids, pollination syndromes show a high degree of phylogenetic conservatism, including groups with a large number of specialized pollination syndromes like Moraea. We conclude that the combination of complex environmental conditions together with relative climatic stability promoted high speciation and/or low extinction rates as the most likely scenario leading to present-day patterns of hyperdiversity in the Cape. © 2011 The Author(s).",Biodiversity hotspots; Cape Floristic Region; diversification; flowering plants; phylogenetics; speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955373147

The management of plant communities to enhance floral resources is often proposed as a way to sustain pollinator populations. Nectar, the main energetic resource for pollinators, plays a central role in behaviour and composition of pollinator communities. Abiotic and biotic factors are known to influence nectar traits at both the species and community levels, but the impact of plant community composition itself has never been investigated. Below-ground interactions in plant communities can induce changes in plant development through (i) plant-derived litter amendment of the soil and (ii) competition for soil resources between plants. We tested how plant below-ground interactions affect above-ground nectar traits involved in plant attractiveness to pollinators. A short-term pot experiment was carried out with three temperate grassland species Mimulus guttatus, Lamium amplexicaule, and Medicago sativa, showing distinct litter stoichiometry and competitive abilities for soil resources. Litter amendment (none, mono and tri-specific litter) and plant interaction treatments (monocultures, two- and three-species mixtures) were crossed in a factorial design. Litter amendment to the soil led to an increase in total nectar sugar content in L. amplexicaule plants but not in the two other species. We also found that the presence of M. guttatus, a competitive species, reduced the total nectar sugar content in L. amplexicaule through a concomitant decrease in nectar volume per flower and in floral display size, but not in other species. Species-specific responses of nectar traits to variation in soil nitrogen availability were thus observed, suggesting consequences for plant species and community attractiveness to pollinators. However, we did not find evidence that the legume M. sativa affected nectar traits of any neighbouring plants. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that litter inputs and competition between plants for soil resources can alter nectar traits linked to plant attractiveness to pollinators.

In particular, frugivorous bats are important for regeneration processes in open and degraded areas, because they disperse the seeds of pioneer plant species, which are essential for succession. Depending on the type of habitat that is established at the fragment edge, resources and bat movement patterns toward open areas can be affected. The structure and composition of bats was compared between two 'interior-edge-pasture' gradients, in an Andean forest fragment located at the Reserva Natural la Montaña del Ocaso (Quindío, Colombia). The two edge-types considered were forest-edge and bamboo-edge (Guadua angustifolia, Poaceae), both located in the same fragment. Bat abundance was significantly different in the two edge habitats. The forest-edge is a soft edge, in that it allows bat species to move from the interior of the forest to the pasture in front of it. In contrast, the bamboo-edge can be defined as semi-permeable, because it allows less movement of species and individuals from the interior to the pasture. Here we evaluate the possible effects of habitat edge type on bat movement in degraded areas in the main coffee producing region of Colombia. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bamboo-edge; Chiroptera; Forest fragmentation; Forest-edge; Phyllostomidae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954999828

Given the high occurrence of the trait, that it may sometimes be maladaptive is an intriguing possibility and deserves exploration. This paper tests the hypothesis that the fitness value of corolla persistence after anthesis depends on ecological context, specifically the abundance of fruit predators and pollinators. Methods: The study was conducted on Narcissus longispathus, a species in which corolla marcescence is apparently maladaptive because withered corollas provide a shelter for fruit-predatory lepidopteran larvae. By experimentally manipulating corolla persistence, presence of fruit predators, and pollination, I tested whether variation in ecological scenario led to concomitant variation in the sign and magnitude of the effects of corolla marcescence on fecundity. Key Results: Persistent corollas were detrimental to fecundity when plants were exposed to larvae, but not when larvae were excluded. Pollination and herbivory had nonadditive effects on the fecundity consequences of corolla marcescence, the strongest detrimental effects of corolla persistence occurring for the ""exposed to larvae + supplementary pollination"" treatment combination. Conclusions: The hypothesis that ecological context is a major determinant of the fitness value of corolla marcescence was supported. In N. longispathus, corolla marcescence will be a maladaptive trait in situations in which pollinators and fruit predators are simultaneously abundant, but will be a neutral character in the absence of fruit predators, irrespective of pollinator service. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Corolla marcescence; Ecological context; Fruit predation; Narcissus longispathus; Nonadditive effects; Pollen limitation; Trigonophora flammea,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858414737

While pollen production has obvious benefits for plant male fitness, its consequences for plant female fitness, especially in self-incompatible hermaphrodite species, are less certain. Pollen production could either enhance seed production though increased pollinator attraction, or reduce it if ovules are discounted by deposition of self pollen, as can occur in species with late-acting self-incompatibility. To test the effects of pollen reward provision on female fitness, we artificially emasculated flowers in two populations of the succulent Aloe maculata (Asphodelaceae), which has a late-acting self-incompatibility system, over the course of its flowering period. Flowers of this species are visited by sunbirds (for nectar) and native bees (for pollen and nectar). We measured floral visitation rates, floral rejection rates, pollen deposition on stigmas and fruit and seed set in both emasculated and non-emasculated plants. We found that flowers of emasculated plants suffered reduced visitation and increased rejection (arrival without visitation) by bees, but not by sunbirds; had fewer pollen grains deposited on stigmas and showed an overall decrease in fruit set and seed set. Rates of seed abortion were, however, greatly reduced in emasculated flowers. This study shows that pollen rewards can be important for seed set, even in self-incompatible plants, which have been assumed to rely on nectar rewards for pollinator attraction. Seed abortion was, however, increased by pollen production, a result that highlights the complexity of selection on pollen production in hermaphrodite flowers. © 2011 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Aloe; Apis mellifera; Gender conflict; Late-acting self-incompatibility; Ovule discounting; Pollen theft; Sunbirds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954514064

Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism to prevent self-fertilization and inbreeding in higher plants. Although data implicate the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in pollen-pistil interactions and the regulation of pollen tube growth, there has been a lack of studies investigating ROS and NO signaling in pollen tubes in response to defined, physiologically relevant stimuli. We have used live-cell imaging to visualize ROS and NO in growing Papaver rhoeas pollen tubes using chloromethyl- 2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein diacetate and demonstrate that SI induces relatively rapid and transient increases in ROS and NO, with each showing a distinctive ""signature"" within incompatible pollen tubes. Investigating how these signals integrate with the SI responses, we show that Ca2+ increases are upstream of ROS and NO. As ROS/NO scavengers alleviated both the formation of SI-induced actin punctate foci and also the activation of a DEVDase/caspase-3-like activity, this demonstrates that ROS and NO act upstream of these key SI markers and suggests that they signal to these SI events.

Because ants are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis, ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of ant- plant species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant community and local ant activity at sugar baits. As predicted, flowers of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which shared an evolutionary history with ants. We also found that the percentage of plant species with antvisited flowers was much higher in Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100% in habitats dominated by endemic species. We showed experimentally that the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced and few native plants species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents, and to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar. Analysis of floral volatiles, however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent ""syndrome"" attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due to the high chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets. Results from a molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems, reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic flora. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Ant-flower networks; Biological invasions; Floral antagonists; Hawaii; ITS2; Morphological barriers; Nectar thieves; Olfactometer; Plant defense; Repellent floral scents; Resource quality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955518489

Phylogenetic analyses supported the existence of two differentiated clades that did not match currently accepted taxonomic classification. Accordingly, genetic distance did not correlate significantly with morphological distance. No fruits were produced from interspecific crosses, and there were no individuals with intermediate morphology that could indicate current and frequent hybridization events between species. I propose that the discordance between cpDNA data and conventional taxonomy could be explained by parallel evolution, or alternatively, by a very sporadic hybridization. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",cpDNA; Flower morphology; Parallel evolution; Pollination; Reproductive isolation; Speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955938183

This variation in population features could have important consequences for different aspects of plant ecology such as individual reproductive success, population genetic structure or plant-animal interactions. In this study, we analyze if individuals of the evergreen shrub Daphne laureola at disjunt populations in a local border of its distribution area in southern Iberian Peninsula differ in individual size, shoot growth, reproductive output and the pollination environment from central continuous populations within the area. Plants of central continuous populations were larger and produced more flowers and fruits than plants of marginal disjunct populations suggesting more optimal conditions, although they had lower annual shoot growth.

In dimorphic species, environmental factors may influence evolutionary processes governing sex ratio variation and floral traits evolution. Kallstroemia grandiflora is an annual insect-pollinated gynodioecious herb with broad distribution from the Sonoran desert to the semiarid west coast of Mexico. In this study, we explored if female frequency increases in harsh environments and the associated changes in floral morphology in female and hermaphrodite plants. We selected 23 populations along the pacific coast of Mexico where we estimated female frequency and in eight of them we also measured flower size in hermaphrodite and female plants. The average decrease in precipitation was correlated with the increase in female frequency, and a reduction in the flower size of hermaphrodite plants. Our results support the idea that harsh environments may influence female frequency, but also flower size and possibly breeding system evolution.

It is characterised by dark-coloured heartwood, with colour varying from pale straw to red-brown and walnut brown, and pale cream-coloured sapwood. This wide range in heartwood colour is expressed as between- and within-tree variation, and is regarded as a problem in markets where colour consistency is important. To understand the genetic and environmental control of heartwood colour, multiple colour measurements were taken from stem cores from 16 open-pollinated family collections of blackwood planted across three 19-year-old progeny trials. Data was analysed with a mixed model with within-tree variation modelled using a three-node cubic spline. Significant genetic, environmental and genetic-by-environment interactions were detected, not only in the variation in between-tree mean heartwood colour but also in the pattern of within-tree heartwood colour variation. In general, heartwood colour became darker, less yellow and more red towards the sapwood/heartwood boundary. To control the between- and within-tree heartwood colour variation in blackwood plantations, care is needed to not only select genotypes with the desired wood colour and colour variation but also site characteristics that allow expression of that colour. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.",CIELab; cubic-spline; progeny; wood colour variation; wood quality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956361369

Because of this peculiar flowering system, mixed plantings of cultivars of complementary flower type have been traditionally recommended to increase yield. However, the effect of planting complementary avocado cultivars on outcrossing rate and yield is a subject of controversy. In this work, we have studied the outcrossing rate with microsatellite markers under the growing conditions of Southern Spain. Outcrossing rate was determined at harvest on several 'Hass' trees situated in rows at different distances from a 'Fuerte' orchard for two consecutive years (2005 and 2006). Outcrossing rate ranged from 0.31 to 0.74 with an average of 0.47 showing a significant decrease from the first row (in proximity to the pollen source) to the rest of the rows. However, using data of 13 years no significant differences in yield have been recorded with increasing distance to the pollen donor trees. The paternity of abscised fruits was recorded weekly from June to the period of commercial harvest in March the following year. The results obtained indicate that the fruits that dropped during June were mostly derived from self-fertilisation. However, a high proportion of those fruits were derived from flowers fertilised during the last weeks of the 'Hass' blooming season when the cultivar Fuerte presents either few or no flowers. Consequently, most of the late fertilised 'Hass' fruits were derived from self-pollination and those small fruits compete for limited maternal resources with the earlier fertilised fruits derived from cross-pollination. These results suggest that, under our growing conditions, fruit drop in avocado is rather determined by the fertilisation date and not by the embryo genetic composition. © 2011 Association of Applied Biologists.",Avocado; fruit abscission; fruit set; outcrossing; pollination; polliniser; production; selective abortion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954748694

In particular, high selfing rates by hermaphrodites are expected to exclude males from a population. Here, the first estimates are provided of the mating system from two wild hexaploid populations of the androdioecious European wind-pollinated plant M. annua with contrasting male frequencies. Methods Four diploid microsatellite loci were used to genotype 1920 progeny arrays from two populations of M. annua, one with males and one without. Mating-system parameters were estimated using the program MLTR. Key Results Both populations had similar, intermediate outcrossing rates (tm 0·64 and 0·52 for the population with and without males, respectively). The population without males showed a lower level of correlated paternity and biparental inbreeding and higher allelic richness and gene diversity than the population with males. Conclusions The results demonstrate the utility of new diploid microsatellite loci for mating system analysis in a hexaploid plant. It would appear that androdioecious M. annua has a mixed-mating system in the wild, an uncommon finding for wind-pollinated species. This study sets a foundation for future research to assess the relative importance of the sexual system, plant-density variation and stochastic processes for the regulation of male frequencies in M. annua over space and time. © 2011 The Author.",allopolyploid; Androdioecy; Euphorbiaceae; hexaploid; Mercurialis; microsatellites; mixed mating system; outcrossing rate; selfing rate; wind-pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955401305

Here, we use a fine mapping approach to determine the genetic basis of association between cytonuclear male sterility and other floral traits in Mimulus hybrids. Previous work has shown that male sterility in hybrids between Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus nasutus is due to interactions between a mitochondrial gene from M. guttatus and two tightly linked nuclear restorer alleles on Linkage Group 7, and that male sterility is associated with reduced corolla size. In the present study, we generated a set of nearly isogenic lines segregating for the restorer region and male sterility, but with unique flanking introgressions. Male-sterile flowers had significantly smaller corollas, longer styles and greater stigmatic exsertion than fertile flowers. Because these effects were significant regardless of the genotypic composition of introgressions flanking the restorer region, they suggest that these floral differences are a direct byproduct of the genetic incompatibility causing anther abortion. In addition, we found a non-significant but intriguing trend for male-sterile plants to produce more seeds per flower than fertile siblings after supplemental pollination. Such pleiotropic effects may underlie the corolla dimorphism frequently observed in gynodioecious taxa and may affect selection on cytoplasmic male sterility genes when they initially arise. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/11.",CMS; genetic correlation; gynodioecy; sexual dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955091156

The overall magnitude of the resulting net effect of carnivores on plant fitness and the factors responsible for the variations in strength and direction of this effect have not been explored quantitatively to date. 2.We performed a meta-analysis of 67 studies containing 163 estimates of the effects of carnivores on plant fitness and examined the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in carnivore effects. 3.Carnivores significantly increased plant fitness via suppression of herbivores and decreased fitness by consuming pollinators. The overall net effect of carnivores on plant fitness was positive (32% increase), indicating that effects via herbivores were stronger than effects via pollinators. 4.Parasitoids had stronger positive effect on plant fitness than predators. Active hunters increased plant fitness, whereas stationary predators had no significant effect, presumably because they were more prone to disrupt plant-pollinator mutualism. Carnivores with broader habitat domain had negative effects on plant fitness, whereas those with narrow habitat domain had positive effects. 5.Predator effects were positive for plants which offered rewards (e.g. extrafloral nectaries) and negative for plants which lacked any attractors. 6.This study adds new knowledge on the factors that determine the strength of terrestrial trophic cascades and highlights the importance of considering simultaneous contrasting interactions in the same study system. © 2011 The Authors.

Developing caryopses of maize have high levels of cytokinins, but little is known about their spatial and temporal distribution. The localization and quantification of cytokinins was investigated in maize (Zea mays) caryopsis from 0 to 28 d after pollination together with the expression and localization of isopentenyltransferase ZmIPT1 involved in cytokinin biosynthesis and ZmCNGT, the gene putatively involved in N9-glucosylation.MethodsBiochemical, cellular and molecular approaches resolved the overall cytokinin profiles, and several gene expression assays were used for two critical genes to assess cytokinin cell-specific biosynthesis and conversion to the biologically inactive form. Cytokinins were immunolocalized for the first time in maize caryopses.Key ResultsDuring the period 028 d after pollination (DAP): (1) large quantities of cytokinins were detected in the maternal pedicel region relative to the filial tissues during the early stages after fertilization; (2) unpollinated ovules did not accumulate cytokinins; (3) the maternal nucellar region showed little or no cytokinin signal; (4) the highest cytokinin concentrations in filial endosperm and embryo were detected at 12 DAP, predominantly zeatin riboside and zeatin-9-glucoside, respectively; and (5) a strong cytokinin immuno-signal was detected in specific cell types in the pedicel, endosperm and embryo.ConclusionsThe cytokinins of developing maize caryopsis may originate from both local syntheses as well as by transport. High levels of fertilization-dependent cytokinins in the pedicel suggest filial control on metabolism in the maternal tissue; they may also trigger developmental programmed cell death in the pedicel. © 2011 The Author.",Caryopsis; cytokinins; immunolocalization; maize; N9-glucosylation; programmed cell death; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956133735

Preference tests have shown that hummingbirds do not have an innate preference for red colours. In addition, hummingbirds do not depend solely upon red flowers, because white-flowered hummingbird-pollinated plants are also common and temporarily abundant. Here we show that both white and red hummingbird-pollinated flowers differ from beepollinated flowers in their reflection properties for ultraviolet (UV) light. Hummingbird-pollinated red flowers are on average less UV reflective, and white hummingbird-pollinated flowers are more UV reflective than the same coloured bee-pollinated ones. In preference tests with artificial flowers, neotropical orchid bees prefer red UV-reflecting artificial flowers and white UVnonreflecting flowers over red and white flowers with the opposite UV properties. By contrast, hummingbirds showed no preference for any colour in the same tests. Plotting floral colours and test stimuli into the honeybees' perceptual colour space suggests that the less attractive colours are achromatic for bees and therefore more difficult to detect against the background. This underlying colour preference in bees might provide hummingbirds with a private niche that is not attractive to bees. © 2011.

Flowering was temporally discordant among the species, which is interpreted as a kind of adaptation avoiding interspecific overlap and thus competition for pollinators.

The mating system of one species has been determined as requiring transfer of pollen from one plant to another to enable effective pollination and floral conformity in other species suggests similar breeding systems. Previous authors have suggested non-flying mammal pollination for members of the genus based on floral traits and reports of floral consumption; however, this hypothesis does not stand up to scrutiny. Acrotriche floral traits can also be interpreted as indicative of crawling invertebrate pollination. The identification of floral visitors and their potential for pollination has not been conducted previously for any Acrotriche species. To identify potential pollinators, the floral visitors to six different species of Acrotriche were observed throughout an entire 24h period at a range of sites throughout South Australia. Ants were identified as the most common and abundant floral visitors for all Acrotriche species. Ant pollination is considered rare due to the negative effects that ant secretions can have on pollen viability. To determine these effects in relation to Acrotriche, pollen germination experiments were undertaken after contact with the integument of several ant species. Reductions in pollen viability varied between plants and ant species but in all experiments viable pollen remained after ant contact. These results, along with observed behaviour of ant visitors, indicate that ants may contribute to pollination in Acrotriche. © 2011 The Authors.

GT603 was developed through seven generations of self-pollination from the maize population GT-MAS:gk (PI 561859), which was released as a source of resistance to Aspergillus flavus Link:Fr. GT603 was initially selected from early self-pollinated lines under the experimental name GT-P50.

The line GT603 is phenotypically different (darker cob and kernel colors and better agronomic traits) from the related lines GT601 and GT602 although the source of resistance may be the same. In hybrid performance tests in 2005 and 2009, GT603 exhibited better combining ability and heterosis with the StiffStalk Synthetic (SSS) inbred (B73) than with the non-SSS inbred (Mo17) for aflatoxin level and grain yield. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959658233

In this paper, we assess the ability of discrete additions of native wildflowers (70 plants of seven plant species added and subsequently monitored for 2years) to augment species richness of beneficial insects including bees, butterflies and predatory wasps in New York City community gardens. We also evaluate the overall use of native and introduced flowers by these insect groups in the urban garden study sites. 3. Bayesian analyses failed to find a strong influence of the native plant additions on beneficial insect richness, after correcting for prior floral abundance. 4. In addition, butterflies and megachilid (leaf-cutter) bees were found to heavily utilise introduced ornamental and crop flowers in these gardens, even when native flowers were present. 5. Our results suggest that exotic garden plants are utilised by, and important in maintaining richness of, beneficial insects in urbanised landscapes. Furthermore, garden manipulations need to be more substantial than often recommended, if they are to significantly influence the richness of beneficial insects in urban gardens. © 2010 The Authors.

Their expansion and reproduction in the introduced range have been mostly due to vegetative reproduction, but observations of low seedling numbers and hybridization processes exist. Knowledge of factors affecting germination characteristics is essential if the risk of sexual reproduction is to be assessed, and its impact on the ability of the species to spread and adapt to different environments. This study aims to examine the germination success of Fallopia japonica s. l. seeds of different ages, quality, and storage conditions. Irrespective of age and even after natural overwintering in the soil, seeds germinated quite well (48-79%). Ungerminated seeds collected in autumn of 2008 were characterized by a low weight/length ratio (W/L), low nutrient concentrations, and a greenish tepal coloration. These differences may be due to alternative male taxa participating in the pollination process. Spring collected seeds were subject to strong predation by birds. In contrast to the high germination observed under laboratory conditions, seed germination or early establishment in the field was inhibited and only a few seedlings were observed. Although the factors that inhibit the establishment of mature seeds in the field remain unknown, there is a clear risk that sexual reproduction could gain importance in the future as a result of changing environmental conditions or genetic adaptation. Not only would this facilitate expansive dispersal by wind, but it might also increase the potential for further adaptation of the species complex. © 2011 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Germany; Germination ecology; Hybridization; Invasive species; Polygonum cuspidatum; Reynoutria japonica; Riparian ecosystems; Sexual reproduction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955925645

The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains two genes, At2g20340 and At4g28680, encoding pyridoxal 5?-phosphate-dependent AADCs with high homology to the recently identified Petunia hybrida phenylacetaldehyde synthase involved in floral scent production. The At4g28680 gene product was recently biochemically characterized as an l-tyrosine decarboxylase (AtTYDC), whereas the function of the other gene product remains unknown. The biochemical and functional characterization of the At2g20340 gene product revealed that it is an aromatic aldehyde synthase (AtAAS), which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine and 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine to phenylacetaldehyde and dopaldehyde, respectively. AtAAS knock-down and transgenic AtAAS RNA interference (RNAi) lines show significant reduction in phenylacetaldehyde levels and an increase in phenylalanine, indicating that AtAAS is responsible for phenylacetaldehyde formation in planta. In A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0), AtAAS expression was highest in leaves, and was induced by methyl jasmonate treatment and wounding. Pieris rapae larvae feeding on Col-0 leaves resulted in increased phenylacetaldehyde emission, suggesting that the emitted aldehyde has a defensive activity against attacking herbivores. In the ecotypes Sei-0 and Di-G, which emit phenylacetaldehyde as a predominant flower volatile, the highest expression of AtAAS was found in flowers and RNAi AtAAS silencing led to a reduction of phenylacetaldehyde formation in this organ. In contrast to ecotype Col-0, no phenylacetaldehyde accumulation was observed in Sei-0 upon wounding, suggesting that AtAAS and subsequently phenylacetaldehyde contribute to pollinator attraction in this ecotype. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Arabidopsis ecotypes; aromatic l -amino acid decarboxylases; floral volatiles; phenylacetaldehyde; plant defense,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955842400

Weedy forms of sunflower, a species native from America, have been reported in European sunflower fields for a few decades. In order to understand their origin, we analysed the genetic diversity of a sample of weedy populations from France and Spain, and of conventional and ornamental varieties. A crop-specific maternally inherited marker was present in all weeds. At 16 microsatellite loci, the weedy populations shared most of their diversity with the conventional varieties. But they showed a large number of additional alleles absent from the cultivated pool. European weedy populations thus most probably originated from the unintentional pollination of maternal lines in seed production fields by wild plants growing nearby, resulting in the introduction of crop-wild hybrids into the farmers' fields. The wide diversity and the low population structure detected were indicative of a multiplicity of introductions events rather than of field-to-field propagation. Further studies are required to understand the local evolutionary dynamics of a weedy population, and especially the respective roles of crop-to-weed gene flow and selection in the fate of an initial source of crop-wild hybrids. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Crop-wild complexes; Genetic diversity; Invasive species; Sunflower; Weediness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954593782

The objective of this study was to characterize the changes in patterns of fruit growth characters during plant development. In cultivar experiments, a high-resolution wireless vision sensor network has been developed to realize non-contact automatic uninterrupted measurement of the fruit shape micro-change (fruit size, color, and net). Results showed that the fruit swelling process (vertical and horizontal diameters) exhibited a slow-rapid-slow pattern, which could be well described with a logistic curve against growing degree days (GDD); fruit color changes based on the RGB values could be represented by quadratic relationship to cumulative GDD; the fruit net changes over growth progress could be partitioned into three phases according to the time interval. The first phase was from 1 to 30 days after pollination (DAP), in which the vertical stripe appeared at fruit middle part and the horizontal stripe at fruit petiole and hilum part as well; the second phase was from 30 to 40 DAP, the horizontal stripe occurred at fruit middle part and the net was formed; the third phase was the process started from 40 DAP, the netted breadth and thickness were gradually increased. The model was validated with the independent data from the experiment, and the mean RMSE (root mean square error) of fruit were 0.36 and 0.28 cm for vertical and horizontal diameters, 11.9 for fruit color, and 0.45 cm for stripe length and diameter at varied GDD, respectively.

Due to the unreliability of oil content in its seeds and low economic returns planting of jatropha in agriculture was restricted. Investigating the molecular basis of storage lipid accumulation during seed development is an immediate need to understand genetic factors regulating storage lipid biosynthesis in jatropha seeds. In this study, we characterized the seed development and lipid accumulation from female flowers pollinated to mature seeds, and investigated temporal expression profiles of 21 lipid genes involved in different steps of the pathways leading to fatty acid and TAG synthesis within jatropha developing seeds using quantitative real-time PCR technology. Concomitantly, 17 genes increased their expression levels in developing seeds compared to their expression in leaf, but showed various temporal expression patterns and different relative-maximum ratio ranging from 2.8 to 1,919,280-fold in developing seeds. Five gene groups with distinct temporal patterns were identified by clustering analysis of expression data. Two gene groups including 15 genes presented up-regulated expression patterns correlated with storage lipid accumulation in developing seeds. This study provided not only the initial information on promoter activity for each gene, but also a first glimpse of the global patterns of gene expression and regulation, which are critical to understand the molecular basis of lipid biosyntheses, identifying the rate-limiting genes during seed development and to create improved varieties by genetic engineering. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Biodiesel; Fatty acid; Jatropha curcas; Oilseed; Temporal expression pattern; Triacylglycerol,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953290018

Theory predicts a negative correlation between inbreeding depression and selfing rate across species. This prediction has only been examined and validated in vascular plants. Furthermore, selfing rates are often influenced by environmental conditions (e.g., lack of mates or pollinators), and species are predicted to evolve mechanisms to buffer this variation. We extend previous studies of mating-system syndromes in two ways. First, we assembled a new dataset on Basommatophoran snails (17 species, including new data on 12 species). Second, we measured how species responded to variation in mate availability. Specifically, we quantified the waiting time before selfing (i.e., how long the onset of reproduction is delayed in the absence of mates). Selfing rates were negatively correlated with both inbreeding depression and the waiting time. Species with stronger inbreeding depression exhibited longer waiting times. These patterns obtained on Basommatophorans still hold when including eight other hermaphroditic animals. Our results support the hypothesis that selection drives the evolution of mating-system syndromes in animals. The reaction norm of selfing rates to mate availability is a key target of natural selection in this context. © 2011 The Author(s).

In the wider ecology literature, research on the association between plant species distributions and life history traits has mainly focused on a single axis such as GR. However, the internal structure of species ranges is widely recognized as important. In order to determine if identifying different types of rarity leads to alternative conclusions regarding the causes and consequences of rarity, we created a dataset linking the seven types of rarity matrix and to reproductive ecology traits. We found associations between the axes and these traits in a dataset of 101 rare plant species culled from 27 papers. Significant traits included mating system and seed dispersal mechanism. Species with small GR are more likely to have ballistic or wind dispersal than biotically-mediated dispersal (abiotic:biotic ratio 3:1). Habitat specialist species with small GRs are more likely to have outcrossing mating systems compared to habitat specialists of large GR (16:1). These results show that, within rare species, the structure of rarity is important (e. g. habitat specialization is different from small GR) and should be identified when determining basic mechanisms of plant distribution and abundance. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In the present study, we selected 20 sown flower fields that included one of the pollen beetles' host plants Sinapis alba L., each centred in a landscape of varying complexity, to test the influence of the surrounding landscape structure on parasitism rate and herbivory by M. aeneus. Additionally, plant cover of S. alba plants within the sown flower fields and numbers of S. alba flowers were also included in the analyses. Landscapes with high proportions of semi-natural habitats supported higher parasitism rates, and sown flower fields with dense S. alba plant cover hosted more parasitoids and suffered from less herbivory. We conclude that sown flower fields are not only important for pollinators and birds, but also are long-term undisturbed, unploughed, insecticide-free habitats with rich food (nectar/pollen) and host resources for parasitoids, contributing to the build-up and maintenance of large parasitoid populations, which are important biocontrol agents of rape pollen beetles. © 2011 The Authors.

Haploid plants were obtained from 'Hartley', 'Pedro', Z63, and Z67 after pollination using pollen irradiated at 300 and 600 Gy. Plants obtained from pollen irradiated at 50 and 150 Gy were all diploid. Molecular marker analysis using four simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers also showed that all the diploid plants recovered were zygotic and no spontaneous double haploid plants were obtained in this work. Also, the haploid plantlets presented only one allele of their female parents. These profiles confirmed the parthenogenetic origin of the obtained haploid plants.

In the mustard family, single-locus self-incompatibility (SI) enforces outcrossing. In this study, we test whether mutations causing self-compatibility (SC) are linked to the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) in Leavenworthia alabamica, a species where two selfing races (a2 and a4) co-occur with outcrossing populations. We also infer the ecological circumstances associated with origins of selfing using molecular sequence data. Genealogical reconstruction of the Lal2 locus, the putative ortholog of the SRK locus, showed that both selfing races are fixed for one of two different S-linked Lal2 sequences, whereas outcrossing populations harbor many S-alleles. Hybrid crosses demonstrated that S-linked mutations cause SC in each selfing race. These results strongly suggest two origins of selfing in this species, a result supported by population admixture analysis of 16 microsatellite loci and by a population tree built from eight nuclear loci. One selfing race (a4) shows signs of a severe population bottleneck, suggesting that reproductive assurance might have caused the evolution of selfing in this case. In contrast, the population size of race a2 cannot be distinguished from that of outcrossing populations after correcting for differences in selfing rates. Coalescent-based analyses suggest a relatively old origin of selfing in the a4 race (?150 ka ago), whereas selfing evolved recently in the a2 race (?12-48 ka ago). These results imply that S-locus mutations have triggered two recent shifts to selfing in L. alabamica, but that these transitions are not always associated with a severe population bottleneck, suggesting that factors other than reproductive assurance may play a role in its evolution. © 2011 The Author.",automatic selection; population bottlenecks; reproductive assurance; SCR; self-incompatibility; SRK,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952317278

Consequently, even if some one-to-one interactions might appear locally specialized, additional partners may be involved at a wider scale. Here, we investigate the geographical constancy in the specificity level of the specialized lure-and-trap pollination antagonism involving the widespread European Arum maculatum and its associated Psychodid pollinators. Until now, studies concurred in demonstrating that one single insect species, Psychoda phalaenoides, efficiently cross-pollinated plants; researches were, however, performed locally in western Europe. In this study we characterize for the first time the flower visitors' composition at the scale of the distribution range of A. maculatum by intensively collecting plants and insects throughout the European continent. We further correlate local climatic characteristics with the community composition of visiting arthropods. Our results show that flowers are generally visited by P. phalaenoides females, but not over the whole distribution range of the plant. In some regions this fly species is less frequent or even absent and another species, Psycha grisescens, becomes the prevailing visitor. This variability is geographically structured and can be explained by climatic factors: the proportion of P. grisescens increases with higher annual precipitations and lower precipitations in the warmest trimester, two characteristics typical of the Mediterranean zone. Climate thus seems driving the specificity of this interaction, by potentially affecting the phenology of one or both interacting species, or even of volatile and heat production in the plant. This result therefore challenges the specificity of other presumably one-to-one interactions covering wide distribution ranges, and provides an example of the direct effect that the abiotic environment can have on the fate of plant-insect interactions. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955026640

Pollen hoarding (pln) in honeybees is a complex trait associated with a well-characterized suite of linked behavioral and physiological traits. In European honeybee stocks bidirectionally selected for pln, worker (sterile helper) ovary size is pleiotropically affected by quantitative trait loci that were initially identified for their effect on foraging behavior. To gain a better understanding of the genetic architecture of worker ovary size in this model system, we analyzed a series of crosses between the selected strains. The crossing results were heterogeneous and suggested non-additive effects. Three significant and three suggestive quantitative trait loci of relatively large effect sizes were found in two reciprocal backcrosses. These loci are not located in genome regions of known effects on foraging behavior but contain several interesting candidate genes that may specifically affect worker-ovary size. Thus, the genetic architecture of this life history syndrome may be comprised of pleiotropic, central regulators that influence several linked traits and other genetic factors that may be downstream and trait specific. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/11.",Apis mellifera; ovarioles; QTL; social evolution; trait network; worker caste,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955104428

Earlier some attempts have been made to modify these procedures to suit the mating system in self pollinated crops (Patil and Patil 2003 and Patil etal., 2007). This study gives results of reciprocal selection for combining ability followed in cotton. The procedure of this scheme defined in cross pollinated crops starts with two opposite base populations which have inherent variability that is subjected to exploitation through reciprocal selection for combining ability. In self pollinated crops, firstly opposite groups of genetically diverse groups of genotypes have to be identified in first phase of the present study, seven single crosses from private and public sector were involved in development of 21 double crosses and their evaluation. Based on this evaluation best double cross ZCH-21405 X RAHH-198 was identified and the two single crosses involved in it were selected as opposite base material and were advanced to F 4 generation for initiating reciprocal selection for combining ability.These opposite population in a segregating generation can act as base population for initiating reciprocal selection for combining ability. Random 23 F 4 lines of cross 1 (ZCH-21405) were crossed with the cross 2 (RAHH-198) as tester and vice-versa. Evaluation of these 46 derived F 1's was done by comparing them with commercial check hybrids and with bench mark double cross. Nature and magnitude of variability among the derived Ft's for lint yield was taken as a measure of variability for combining ability and the derived F^s which are superior over the bench mark double cross helped in identifying transgressive segregants for combining ability. The elite combiners of opposite group identified based on reciprocal selection for combining ability in this manner have lead to developing some potential crosses. Apart from utilizing opposite crosses as reciprocal testers, these F 5's lines were also assessed for their ability to combine with additional four varietal testers. Some of these F 5's lines were found to be potential combinations confirming general utility of them as good combiner parents involving other testers.",Heterosis breeding; Reciprocal recurrent selection; Transgressive segregants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052990384

The genetics of wheat with blue and white grains or those with purple and white grains have been investigated. However, as far as we know, the genetics of wheat with purple and blue grains has not been reported. We bred new lines of colored-grain wheat by crossing einkorn wheat (Triticum boeoticum, AA) and French rye (French Secale cereale, RR) as male parents (mixed pollination) with a high-quality bread wheat line Y1642 (derived from common wheat and Agropyron elongatum, AABBDD) as the female parent. We selected colored-grain wheat lines in the F6 generation that exhibited different colored grains in the same spike to study the genetic patterns of colored-grain wheat. In addition to normal grain color segregation ratios, we found some unconventional segregation ratios such as 1:37 (blue to white). Furthermore, we found blue and purple grains in the same spike of blue-grain or purple-grain wheat lines. For blue wheat grain the color is due to the blue aleurone layer. The coloration of a purple wheat grain is located in the pericarp and testa. This unique phenomena may be due to the influences of environmental factors as well as genetic factors. Besides, the colored-grain wheat lines used in this work may be genetically unstable. Some unique segregation ratios are also observed in the genetic segregation of grain color.

The requirement of many terrestrial plants to form a symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi may limit the distribution and abundance of plant species. Here, in just the second test of the role of mycorrhiza in host species rarity, we investigate the influence of mycorrhizal specificity, distribution and ecological requirements in the genus Drakaea (Orchidaceae). In situ seed baiting was used to resolve the distribution of mycorrhizal fungi for three common and two co-occurring rare species of Drakaea. Mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from wild adult orchids and protocorms and the ITS nrDNA regions sequenced. An in vitro study tested the range of Drakaea species of which each fungus can support germination. All Drakaea species studied used a narrow monophyletic clade of Tulasnella endophyte for protocorm, seedling and adult plant stages. In situ seed baiting revealed that germination of Drakaea is largely restricted to the same microhabitat as that of the orchid. However, within this habitat Drakaea exhibit comparable germination to other Western Australian orchid genera. Rare and common Drakaea exhibited no difference in germination rates and both germinated in suitable habitat not currently occupied. Synthesis. In contrast to the previous study of the role of mycorrhiza in plant rarity, there was no evidence that mycorrhizal specificity contributed to rarity in Drakaea. However, the formation of mycorrhiza being mostly restricted to a specific microhabitat may limit the abundance of Drakaea in some landscapes. In Drakaea, the highly specific pollination system of sexual deception may contribute to rarity. A trend towards high specificity in orchid mycorrhizal associations in southern Australia is hypothesized to result from the predominance of old landscapes affording the opportunity for specialization on a single or few mycorrhiza(s) best adapted to the landscape conditions. © 2011 The Authors.

Flowers of the loquat cultivar, 'Dawuxing', growing in the field, were emasculated, pollinated by hand with pollen of the cultivar 'Longquan No.5', then sprayed with water to simulate the effect of rain at -8, -4, -2 h before, -0 h (immediately before hand-pollination), +0 h (immediately after hand-pollination), and 2, 4, 8, or 12 h after pollination. A control to which no water treatment was applied was also included in the assay. Meanwhile, additional assays were performed in the laboratory to improve the resolution of the field study by using earlier treatments. Here, treatments were performed by pollinating, immersing, and shaking a branch with flowers in a container of water in the laboratory -120, -60, -30, -0, +0, 30, 60, or 120 min before or after hand-pollination. One additional sample was immersed, shaken, then handpollinated, and immersed and shaken (ISPIS) again. The results showed that the numbers of pollen grains that germinated, and the percentages of fruit set, differed significantly between the -4, -2, -0, or +0 h treatments and the non-water-treated control in the field assays, especially in the case of the -0 h and +0 h treatments in which the stigmas were washed immediately before or after hand-pollination. However, the -8, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h treatments did not show significant differences from the non-treated control.

Setaria magna is an American species, native to North America and introduced in South America. The morphological aspect of this species is similar to S. italica (foxtail millet), suggesting its potential value as a crop. The purpose of this work was to understand the breeding system (self-pollination vs. open pollination) of S. magna; additionally, the floral development was described. The results of the breeding system analysis indicated that S. magna is mainly autogamous and does not appear to have a self-incompatibility mechanism. The floral development observed was similar to that described for other Paniceae; in most of the spikelets only the upper anthecium developed fruit, but a small number of spikelets presented bisexual lower florets. These spikelets produced two caryopses per spikelet. Thus, S. magna can produced two types of dispersal units; a few whitish naked caryopses from the lower anthecium that fall without their lemma and palea at maturity; and a high number of brown caryopses protected by the lemma and palea from the upper anthecium. The presence of a normal embryo sac in the upper anthecium suggests that S. magna would present normal sexual reproduction, although we can not reject the formation of apomitic seeds in the lower anthecium. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Autogamy; Breeding system; Floral development; Paniceae; Setaria magna,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955941679

High leaf transpiration is thought to restrict Ca movement to low-transpiring tomato fruit, which may increase fruit susceptibility to the Ca-deficiency disorder, blossom end rot (BER). The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of reduced leaf transpiration in abscisic acid (ABA)-treated plants on fruit and leaf Ca uptake and BER development. Tomato cultivars Ace 55 (Vf) and AB2 were grown in a greenhouse environment under Ca-deficit conditions and plants were treated weekly after pollination with water (control) or 500 mg l-1 ABA. BER incidence was completely prevented in the ABA-treated plants and reached values of 30-45% in the water-treated controls. ABA-treated plants had higher stem water potential, lower leaf stomatal conductance, and lower whole-plant water loss than water-treated plants. ABA treatment increased total tissue and apoplastic water-soluble Ca concentrations in the fruit, and decreased Ca concentrations in leaves. In ABA-treated plants, fruit had a higher number of Safranin-O-stained xylem vessels at early stages of growth and development. ABA treatment reduced the phloem/xylem ratio of fruit sap uptake.

However, the nature of the mechanisms that export this compound into the apoplast are under debate. Weidentified the protein PM-ANT1 as a candidate transporter able to mediate ATP export. PMANT1 joins the mitochondrial carrier family, lacks an N-terminal amino acid extension required for organelle localization, and locates to the plasma membrane. Recombinant PM-ANT1 transports ATP, and the gene is substantially expressed in mature pollen grains. Artificial microRNA (amiRNA) mutants show reduced silique length and less seeds per silique but increased seed weight associated with unchanged pollen viability. Anthers from amiRNA mutants exhibited a normal early development, but stomium breakage is inhibited, leading to impaired anther dehiscence. This results in reduced self-pollination and thus decreased fertilization efficiency. amiRNA pollen grains showed increased intracellular ATP levels but decreased extracellular ATP levels. The latter effects are in line with transport properties of recombinant PM-ANT1, supporting in planta that functional PM-ANT1 resides in the plasma membrane and concur with the PM-ANT1 expression pattern. We assume that PM-ANT1 contributes to ATP export during pollen maturation. ATP export may serve as an extracellular signal required for anther dehiscence and is a novel factor critical for pollination and autogamy. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

To identify possible weak points that might contribute to its rarity and hamper its conservation, this paper presents data concerning location, habitat, demographic features and reproductive biology of the species. Censuses of three cohorts of seedlings show that the seedling stage is the most critical in the life cycle. The adult plants show a long flowering season with a high degree of synchrony. Despite the low reproductive success of the species, the annual seed production is very high due to the high floral production. The data show that A. nitidiflorus is a facultative xenogamous species, but the presence of pollinators can enhance fruit set. The viability of the species is not limited by the flowering and fruiting process, however the maintenance of the habitat in the early successional stages seems to be the critical point for long-term survival of the species. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",Conservation biology; Endemic species; Fabaceae; Population dynamics; Reproductive success; Spain,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954994049

This diversity in surface characteristics is largely dependent on the composition and structure of their coating cuticular layer. To date, mechanisms of flower organ initiation and identity have been studied extensively, while little is known regarding the regulation of flower organs surface formation, cuticle composition, and its developmental significance. Using a synthetic microRNA approach to simultaneously silence the three SHINE (SHN) clade members, we revealed that these transcription factors act redundantly to shape the surface and morphology of Arabidopsis flowers. It appears that SHNs regulate floral organs' epidermal cell elongation and decoration with nanoridges, particularly in petals. Reduced activity of SHN transcription factors results in floral organs' fusion and earlier abscission that is accompanied by a decrease in cutin load and modified cell wall properties. SHN transcription factors possess target genes within four cutin- and suberin-associated protein families including, CYP86A cytochrome P450s, fatty acyl-CoA reductases, GSDL-motif lipases, and BODYGUARD1-like proteins. The results suggest that alongside controlling cuticular lipids metabolism, SHNs act to modify the epidermis cell wall through altering pectin metabolism and structural proteins. We also provide evidence that surface formation in petals and other floral organs during their growth and elongation or in abscission and dehiscence through SHNs is partially mediated by gibberellin and the DELLA signaling cascade. This study therefore demonstrates the need for a defined composition and structure of the cuticle and cell wall in order to form the archetypal features of floral organs surfaces and control their cell-to-cell separation processes. Furthermore, it will promote future investigation into the relation between the regulation of organ surface patterning and the broader control of flower development and biological functions. © 2011 Shi et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957972716

Our objective was to characterize inheritance and expression of resistance to RWA biotype 2 from three tetraploid wheat landraces (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. dicoccon) during transfer to hexaploid wheat. Resistant tetraploid accessions PI 624903, PI 624904, and PI 624908 were crossed to the susceptible hexaploid cultivars 'Len' and 'Coteau'. Resistant F1 progeny were advanced to the F2:3 by self-pollination and to the BC1F2 and BC2F1 by backcrossing. Leaf rolling and chlorosis were recorded in standard seedling screening tests on F1 and F2:3 individuals while the F2, BC1F1, BC1F2, and BC2F1 were scored as resistant or susceptible. Segregation in the BC1F1 and BC2F1 fit a 1:1 resistant:susceptible ratio, indicative of control by a single dominant gene. Segregation for resistance in the F2 did not fit 3:1, 13:3, or 15:1 ratios for any of the resistant accessions. Expression of resistance in homogeneous resistant F2:3 lines was greater than susceptible checks, similar to the resistant tetraploid accessions, and less than a line carrying the Dn7 resistance gene. Resistance derived from these tetraploid accessions will be useful to broaden the base of RWA resistance available for use in wheat breeding. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov); Host plant resistance; Russian wheat aphid; Triticum aestivum L.; Triticum turgidum L.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953730570

It is proposed to present the new graphical, pictorial presentations especially based on equilateral triangle, bar diagram etc., developed for effective communication of these concepts. Method of reproduction and system of mating will influence the constitution of population released as a variety and in turn the breeding methods followed to develop an improved population such as a homozygous genotype in self pollinated, a heterozygous homogenous population in asexually reproduced crop and an equilibrium population in cross pollinated crops. Consequences of random mating, attainment of equilibrium, constancy of allelic frequency during this process of attaining equilibrium and relationship between allelic and genotypic frequencies (square law) will help in getting a proper perception of the implications of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in breeding cross pollinated crops. Selection as a potent force in altering allelic frequencies can be explained by quoting practical situations and consequences when selection is practiced for a quantitative trait which is influenced by loci showing additive gene action, dominance and even over dominance gene action. This helps the student to link response to selection (improvement in yield) with change in allelic frequency and about how response is difficult at loci showing high degree of dominance in both self and cross pollinated crops. Consequences of allelic frequency differences in sexes leading to a disequilibrium population can be important base to understand explain maximizing heterosis. It gives an idea about the relationship between allelic frequency difference (y) and frequency of heterozygous in Ft (performance of hybrid) and further explains why varietal hybrids are less potential than inbred based hybrids. It convinces about need for maximizing allelic frequency differences between parents (genetic distance) as the principle involved in population improvement schemes supporting hybrid breeding. Consequences of inbreeding, in terms replacement of allozygous genotypes by autozygous genotypes, increase in homozygosity (linking it with inbreeding coefficient) forms the base for explaining consequences of selfing after hybridization. It gives correct understanding of the changing constitution of F 2 and succeeding generations. A comparison of F 2 and F 6 populations helps in distinguishing pedigree, bulk and single seed descent methods of breeding. Some new forms of presentations are developed to depict similarities and differences in consequences, the proportions of alleles of parents in self, limited and full back cross breeding (considering both self and cross pollinated crops) and a correct perception of target genotype based choice of breeding methods. Inheritance pattern of quantitative character, the break up of Genotypic value (A+D+l), linking these with these with combining ability effects become important. The corresponding components of genotypic variance are very helpful in understanding and linking heritable variability and response to selection.

Nosema ceranae is a highly prevalent worldwide pathogen for honey bees that has been related to colony losses. A commercial formulation that contains fumagillin dicyclohexylamine, Fumidil B ®, can control N. ceranae infection. However, the effectiveness of Fumidil B ® is affected by several factors, such as storage, treatment preparation, the quantity consumed by bees etc. Indeed, UV exposure (e.g. sunlight) drastically reduces the initial concentration of fumagillin within a few hours, while temperature affects its degradation. Although laboratory tests suggest that a semisolid mixture of honey and powdered sugar is the best option to apply fumagillin, its application in syrup (250 mL per dosage) is more effective for the treatment of infected colonies. The total amount of syrup containing fumagillin ingested by honey bees is a key factor in its efficacy, and it has been found that medicated patties were not fully consumed in field trials. In honey bee colonies, the dose of 120 mg/honey bee colony at the recommended posology is effective against depopulation and colony death due to N. ceranae after 1 year, without residues being detected in honey, although reinfection could be detected 4 months after treatment ended. © INRA, DIB-AGIB and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., 2011.",Colony depopulation; Dosage; Fumagillin; Honey-sugar patty; Nosema ceranae; Stability; Syrup; Treatment,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054681967

Fibrous thickenings develop in the endothecium when the anther is shed. Simultaneous cytokinesis during microsporogenesis results in a tetrahedral tetrad of microspores. Mature pollen grains are two-celled. The ovary is inferior and trilocular with axial placenta. The ovule is anatropous, bitegminous and crassinucellate. The archesporial cell below the nucellar epidermis undergoes periclinal division producing the primary parietal cell and the primary sporogenous cell. The primary parietal cell participates in the nucellar formation; the primary sporogenous cell differentiates directly as the megasporocyte. Successive cytokinesis in the megasporocyte usually produces the linear tetrad, and the chalazal megaspore of the tetrad develops into a Polygonum-type embryo sac. The fertilization mode is porogamy.

The dominant parameter controlling the pollination stability in rice cultivars at high temperatures was studied. We examined the effects of a high daytime temperature (35.0°C, 37.5°C, 40.0°C) and its duration (1, 3, 5 days) on the percentage of dehisced thecae, the length of dehiscence in the basal part of the theca for pollen dispersal, and pollination stability. The percentage of sufficiently pollinated florets (%SPF) decreased with the increase in daytime temperature and the duration of treatment. At a daytime temperature of 37.5°C, %SPF varied widely among the cultivars and was highly correlated with the length of dehiscence formed at the basal part of the theca (r=0.930, P<0.01, n=6) and the percentage of dehisced thecae (r=0.868, P<0.05, n=6). The factor that better explained the variation in %SPF shifted from the length of the basal dehiscence to the percentage of dehisced thecae with increasing duration of hightemperature treatment.

In tomato, 25 genes for XTH proteins have been identified. We studied the tomato gene SlXTH1, which has highest homology to the cDNA of the XTH first purified from hypocotyls of Vigna angularis. SlXTH1 mRNA was found to accumulate transiently at an early stage of fruit development, and the peak day of accumulation was about 12 days after pollination. The expression profile of SlXTH1 mRNA was roughly associated with that of the reported enzyme activity, suggesting that the SlXTH1 protein may be one of the main determinants of the enzyme activity. We then examined how alteration of expression of the SlXTH1 gene could influence the characteristics of fruits. Several lines of transgenic tomatoes with different levels of SlXTH1 transcript were produced by introducing a SlXTH1 transgene in either the sense or antisense orientation downstream of a constitutive promoter. In these transgenic tomatoes, fruit size was positively correlated with the level of SlXTH1 transcript, which was monitored at its peak stage. This is the first in vivo demonstration that SlXTH1 can control the morphological character of plants through changes in its level of expression. © 2011 The Japanese Society for Plant Cell and Molecular Biology.",Cell enlargement; Cell wall; Fruit size; Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955148164

The evolutionary forces underlying the variety of flower colors can be nearly as diverse as the colors themselves. In addition to pollinator preferences, non-pollinator agents of selection can have a major influence on the evolution of flower color polymorphisms, especially when the pigments in question are also expressed in vegetative tissues. In such cases, identifying the target(s) of selection starts with determining the biochemical and molecular basis for the flower color variation and examining any pleiotropic effects manifested in vegetative tissues. Herein, we describe a widespread purple-white flower color polymorphism in the mustard Parrya nudicaulis spanning Alaska. The frequency of white-flowered individuals increases with increasing growing-season temperature, consistent with the role of anthocyanin pigments in stress tolerance. White petals fail to produce the stress responsive flavonoid intermediates in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP), suggesting an early pathway blockage. Petal cDNA sequences did not reveal blockages in any of the eight enzyme-coding genes in white-flowered individuals, nor any color differentiating SNPs. A qRT-PCR analysis of white petals identified a 24-fold reduction in chalcone synthase (CHS) at the threshold of the ABP, but no change in CHS expression in leaves and sepals. This arctic species has avoided the deleterious effects associated with the loss of flavonoid intermediates in vegetative tissues by decoupling CHS expression in petals and leaves, yet the correlation of flower color and climate suggests that the loss of flavonoids in the petals alone may affect the tolerance of white-flowered individuals to colder environments. © 2011 Dick et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954523513

Although these species are cultivated for medicinal purposes, they also represent a significant source of pollen and nectar for honey production, so the investigation aimed to estimate their melliferousness and significance for bee pasture. Pollinator observation indicated the visitation of seven species of Hymenoptera, three species of Diptera and two species of day flying Lepidoptera. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) was the most abundant pollinator, and the major elements of attractiveness were flower scent and colour, followed by the shape and size of the corolla and to a lesser extent nectar abundance. Corolla tube length and number of open flowers per whorl were of little significance. According to all analyzed flower characteristics and observation of pollinator behaviour and visits, the most attractive plants were H. officinalis, S. officinalis and L. officinalis, whilst M. officinalis was the least attractive and S. sclarea completely unattractive to all recorded pollinators except for Xylocopa violacea. © 2011 IBRA.",Flower morphology; Honey bee; Lamiaceae; Nectar production; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956142899

Three 20 week trials were therefore conducted, each using a different hive of Austroplebeia australis Friese and Trigona carbonaria Smith placed in separate glasshouses containing Capsicum annuum L. A third glasshouse contained C. annuum but no bees. In the third week of each trial, the numbers of pollen grains present on stigmatic surfaces and pollen tubes growing along styles were determined. Changes in brood volume were assessed by x-ray computerised tomography at weeks 1, 10 and 20. Additionally, the hives were weighed at these times. At the end of each trial, fruit diameter and length and their fresh and dry weights were measured as were seed fresh and dry weights. Bee behaviour was recorded in the third trial. T. carbonaria foraged less sporadically on C. annuum flowers than did A. australis, and pollination by both bee species showed their potential to increase fruit yield and quality. The effects of pollination by either species were, however, not consistent among the three trials. Hive weights and brood volumes for all colonies increased, so it is considered that both species thrived whilst being able to pollinate the plants. Both species therefore have the potential to improve fruit yield and quality within the greenhouse environment. It was noted that A. australis caused damage to the styles in each trial. This may be attributed to the foraging strategies employed by this species and further work is needed to determine optimum bee to flower stocking rates. © 2011 IBRA.",Austroplebeia; Capsicum; Greenhouse; Pollination; Stingless bee; Trigona,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956080141

Several genes conferring resistance to rust have been identified in sunflower, but few of them have been genetically mapped and linked to molecular markers. The rust resistance gene R4 in the germplasm line HA-R3 was derived from an Argentinean open-pollinated variety and is still one of most effective genes. The objectives of this study were to determine the chromosome location of the R4 gene and the allelic relationship of R4 with the Radv rust resistance gene. A total of 63 DNA markers previously mapped to linkage group (LG) 13 were used to screen for polymorphisms between two parental lines HA 89 and HA-R3. A genetic map of LG 13 was constructed with 21 markers, resulting in a total map length of 93.8 cM and an average distance of 4.5 cM between markers. Two markers, ZVG61 and ORS581, flanked the R4 gene at 2.1 and 0.8 cM, respectively, and were located on the lower end of LG 13 within a large NBS-LRR cluster identified previously. The PCR pattern generated by primer pair ZVG61 was unique in the HA-R3 line, compared to lines HA-R1, HA-R4, and HA-R5, which carry other R4 alleles. A SCAR marker linked to the rust resistance gene Radv mapped to LG 13 at 13.9 cM from the R4 locus, indicating that Radv is not an allele of the R4 locus. The markers tightly linked to the R4 gene will facilitate gene pyramiding for rust resistance breeding of sunflower. © Springer-Verlag 2011.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961210542

We addressed this question by studying a rare dioecious species of Rubiaceae in Brazil. The flowers of Randia itatiaiae are gender-heteromorphic and hypocrateriform with greenish corolla tubes ?2cm long, and exhale a strong sweet scent during the entire period of anthesis, which starts at sunset for female flowers. Sucrose was the dominant or co-dominant nectar sugar for both genders. In spite of these typical sphingophilous-phalaenophilous traits, the flowers last for 6 days, and nectar was available in both diurnal and nocturnal assessments. Moreover, the flowering of R. itatiaiae did not overlap the phenodynamics of the Sphingidae community. Accordingly, two functional groups of Lepidoptera Hesperiidae during the day and Sphingidae and Noctuidae at night visited the flowers. Visits by either group resulted in equivalent fruit set and seed number per fruit, although the frequency of visits to flowers was higher during the day than at night. Diurnal and nocturnal lepidopterans may exert similar pressures on floral morphology, in addition to divergent pressures on other characters, such as the temporal dynamics of anthesis and nectar production. The pollination system of R. itatiaiae is specialised at the coarse scale, because its floral morphology precludes pollination by animals other than lepidopterans; however, its floral phenotype also represents a generalist compromise between the conflicting pressures exerted by diurnal and nocturnal groups of lepidopterans. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953302412

Flowers bear circum-floral nectaries (CFNs) that are attractive to ants, and seed dispersal is both barochorous and anemochorous. Although, in this study, live individuals never sheltered ant colonies, dried-out hollow stems - that can remain standing for 2 years - did. Workers from species nesting in dried-out stems as well as from ground-nesting species exploited the CFNs of live C. alatus individuals in the same patches during the daytime, but were absent at night (when bat pollination occurs) on 60.5% of the plants. By visiting the CFNs, the ants indirectly protect the flowers - but not the plant foliage - from herbivorous insects. We show that this protection is provided mostly by species nesting in dried-out stems, predominantly Pseudomyrmex gracilis. That dried-out stems remain standing for years and are regularly replaced results in an opportunistic, but stable association where colonies are sheltered by one generation of dead C. alatus while the live individuals nearby, belonging to the next generation, provide them with nectar; in turn, the ants protect their flowers from herbivores. We suggest that the investment in wood by C. alatus individuals permitting still-standing, dried-out stems to shelter ant colonies constitutes an extended phenotype because foraging workers protect the flowers of live individuals in the same patch. Also, through this process these dried-out stems indirectly favor the reproduction (and so the fitness) of the next generation including both their own offspring and that of their siblings, all adding up to a potential case of inclusive fitness in plants. © 2011 Dejean et al.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953328342

Recent work on mutualism suggested that plant species sharing pollinators provide mutual facilitation when exhibit synchronized reproduction. The facilitation on reproduction may enhance species persistence and coexistence. Theoretical ecologists paid little attention to such indirect mutualistic systems by far. We propose a new model for a two-species system using difference equations. The model focuses on adult plants and assumes no resource competition between these well-established individuals. Our formulas include demographic parameters, such as mortality and recruitment rates, and functions of reproductive facilitation. Both recruitment and facilitation effects reach saturation levels when flower production is at high levels. We conduct mathematical analyses to assess conditions of coexistence. We establish demographical conditions permitting species coexistence. Our analyses suggest a ""rescue"" effect from a ""superior"" species to a ""weaker"" species under strong recruitment enhancement effect when the later is not self-sustainable. The facilitation on rare species may help to overcome Allee effect. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Indirect mutualism; Recruitment enhancement; Species coexistence; Synchrony,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251631284

It exhibits a dramatic phase change from distinctive juvenile to adult leaves, but the timing of this transition varies markedly. We examined the genetic variation in the timing of heteroblastic transition using five large open-pollinated progeny trials established in north-western Tasmania. We used univariate and multi-variate mixed models to analyse data on the presence/absence of adult or intermediate foliage at age 2 years from a total of 14860 trees across five trials, as well as height to heteroblastic phase change from one trial. Up to 566 families and 15 geographic subraces of E. globulus were represented in the trials. The timing of the heteroblastic transition was genetically variable and under strong genetic control at the subrace and within-subrace level, with single-trial narrow-sense heritability estimates for the binary trait averaging 0.50 (range 0.440.65). The degree of quantitative trait differentiation in the timing of heteroblastic transition among subraces, as measured by QST, exceeded the published level of neutral molecular marker (FST) differentiation in all cases, arguing that diversifying selection has contributed to shaping broad-scale patterns of genetic differentiation. Most inter-trial genetic correlations were close to one at the subrace and additive genetic levels, indicating that the genetic variation in this important developmental change is expressed in a stable manner and that genotype-by-environment interaction is minimal across the environments studied. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953314676

However, more and more studies have revealed that the ""one-to-one"" rule has been broken. Co-pollinators have been reported, but we do not yet know how they evolve. They may evolve from insect speciation induced or facilitated by Wolbachia which can manipulate host reproduction and induce reproductive isolation. In addition, Wolbachia can affect host mitochondrial DNA evolution, because of the linkage between Wolbachia and associated mitochondrial haplotypes, and thus confound host phylogeny based on mtDNA. Previous research has shown that fig wasps have the highest incidence of Wolbachia infection in all insect taxa, and Wolbachia may have great influence on fig wasp biology. Therefore, we look forward to understanding the influence of Wolbachia on mitochondrial DNA evolution and speciation in fig wasps. Results: We surveyed 76 pollinator wasp specimens from nine Ficus microcarpa trees each growing at a different location in Hainan and Fujian Provinces, China. We found that all wasps were morphologically identified as Eupristina verticillata, but diverged into three clades with 4.22-5.28% mtDNA divergence and 2.29-20.72% nuclear gene divergence. We also found very strong concordance between E. verticillata clades and Wolbachia infection status, and the predicted effects of Wolbachia on both mtDNA diversity and evolution by decreasing mitochondrial haplotypes. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the pollinating wasp E. verticillata on F. microcarpa has diverged into three cryptic species, and Wolbachia may have a role in this divergence. The results also indicate that Wolbachia strains infecting E. verticillata have likely resulted in selective sweeps on host mitochondrial DNA. © 2011 Sun et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953242644

There is a lack of immune genes in social insects (e.g. honeybees) when compared to Diptera. Potentially, this might be compensated by an advanced system of social immunity (synergistic action of several individuals). The bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, is a primitively eusocial species with an annual life cycle and colonies headed by a single queen. We used this key pollinator to study the temporal dynamics of immune system gene expression in response to wounding and bacterial challenge. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) (abaecin, defensin 1, hymenoptaecin) were strongly up-regulated by wounding and bacterial challenge, the latter showing a higher impact on the gene expression level. Sterile wounding down-regulated TEP A, an effector gene of the JAK/STAT pathway, and bacterial infection influenced genes of the Imd (relish) and JNK pathway (basket). Relish was up-regulated within the first hour after bacterial challenge, but decreased strongly afterwards. AMP expression following wounding and bacterial challenge correlates with the expression pattern of relish whereas correlated expression with dorsal was absent. Although expression of AMPs was high, continuous bacterial growth was observed throughout the experiment. Here we demonstrate for the first time the temporal dynamics of immune system gene expression in a social insect. Wounding and bacterial challenge affected the innate immune system significantly. Induction of AMP expression due to wounding might comprise a pre-adaptation to accompanying bacterial infections. Compared with solitary species this social insect exhibits reduced immune system efficiency, as bacterial growth could not be inhibited. A negative feedback loop regulating the Imd-pathway is suggested. AMPs, the end product of the Imd-pathway, inhibited the up-regulation of the transcription factor relish, which is necessary for effector gene expression. © 2011 Erler et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953232009

We investigated this prospect among Neozeleboria wasp pollinators of Chiloglottis orchids, drawing on evidence from molecular phylogenetic analysis at three genes (CO1, rhodopsin and wingless), population genetic and statistical parsimony analysis at CO1, orchid associations and their semiochemicals, and geographic ranges.

The outcomes of these multispecies interactions are often difficult to predict and are rarely studied. In addition to their theoretical importance, multispecies interactions are also important for management situations. Where multiple agents are used to control invasive species, interactions between agents may either enhance or reduce the impacts on the target species, or may simply have additive effects. In this study, conducted in a Mediterranean-type woodland in Australia, we examined how the interaction between an invasive legume, Cytisus scoparius (Leguminosae), its pollinator, Apis mellifera and a seed predator, Bruchidius villosus (Bruchidae), are modified by a native hemiparasitic vine, Cassytha pubescens (Loranthaceae). The parasite had a direct negative effect on C. scoparius, reducing flowering by 50% and consequently fruit and seed production. Despite having fewer flowers, infected plants had the same proportion of 'tripped' flowers, an indirect measure of pollinator visitation, as uninfected plants; although fruit formed on infected plants it was more likely to abort prematurely. Seed predation by B. villosus was lower on parasite-infected C. scoparius plants than in uninfected plants. Although Ca. pubescens had an antagonistic effect on B. villosus, in consort, the two agents reduced overall seed production by an average of 62%. The acquired parasite Ca. pubescens was more effective in reducing reproductive output than the introduced seed predator, B. villosus, and shows potential as a biocontrol agent for C. scoparius. We documented a subadditive effect of two biological enemies on the invasive species, where the acquired parasite had a stronger effect than the introduced seed predator. © 2010 The Authors.

The production of genetically high-quality seeds at CSOs, which assumes a high degree of genetic diversity, can only be guaranteed if 20 to 60 clones of different genotypes contribute to pollination (transferring of pollen from stamen to stigma). However, for a successful fertilization, which would guarantee the desired quality and quantity of seeds, phenological synchronization of the clone flowering within CSOs is also important. The beginning of pedunculate oak bud burst is under significant genetic con-trol, which opens up the possibility to make the right selection of plus trees, with the goal of achieving a permanent phenological synchronization of flowering and flushing of clones with which the CSOs have been established. However, the effect of poor weather, such as heavy rainfall, too high or too low relative humidity of air, low temperatures, frosts, hail, etc., can sometimes disrupt favorable phenological synchronization of clones, also lowering the quality and quantity of seeds produced. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the phenological synchronization of clone flowering within CSOs, (ii) to look into the possible effect of weather on the duration of receptivity of female flowers and pollen shedding, (iii) to determine the degree of correspondence between particular phenophases of flushing and flowering.The study has been conducted at the experimental field founded in the spring of 2008 within Rasadnik Brestje (Forest Administration Zagreb, Forest Office Dugo Selo). The experimental field has been founded by planting ramet in accordance with the experimental design of randomized section system with repetitions (sections). Each clone is represented with one ramet in each section. Ramets originate from the clones of pedunculate oak, from which clonal seed orchards were founded in the regions under respective Forest Administrations (FAs) Vinkovci (VK), Na{ice (NA) and Bjelovar (BJ). Phenological observations of flushing and flowering were performed simultaneously, twice a week, until the leaves were fully developed on all clones, i.e. until all male flowers ceased to shed pollen or until all female flowers ceased to be receptive. The phenology of flushing was monitored in accordance with the methodology which distinguishes 7 phenophases in the flushing of pedunculate oak, while the phenology of flowering was monitored according to the methodology developed on the example of cork oak (Quercus suber L.). In this study, during the phenological monitoring of flowering, special attention was given to phenophases of male flower development, which describe the beginning and the end of pollen shedding, i.e. to phenophases of female flowers, which describe the beginning and the end of their receptivity. Microclimatic conditions during flowering (from April 7 to May 23) in 2010 were measured via automatic meteorological station set up at the experimental field. From a total of 145 clones, 103 were flowering at the experimental field in 2010, 8 of which only with male flowers, 31 only with female flowers, and 63 with both male and female flowers. Protogyny was established for the clones flowering with both male and female flowers, except for the clone VK 43 where protandry was established. The receptivity of female flowers of protogynous clones occurred on average 7 days before the male flowers began shedding pollen, while the VK 43 clone started releasing pollen a day before female flowers started to be receptive. Generally speaking for all the clones represented at the experimental field and flowering in 2010, pollen shedding started on April 15, and ended on May 22. The receptivity of female flowers started on April 13, and ended on May 13. From the moment the first clone started shedding pollen untill shedding stopped, 37 days have elapsed, while the receptive period of female flowers lasted 30 days. The receptive period of female flowers for the clones in the region of FA BJ and VK started on April 14, while this period started on April 13 for the clones in the region of FA NA. The end of the receptive period for BJ clones was recorded on May 13, for NA clones on April 20, and for VK clones on May 11. The receptive period of BJ female flowers lasted for 29 days, of NA for 9 days, and of VK for 28 days. There were two »crirical» periods (the first from April 19 to 22, and the other on May 3) during which a sudden termination of receptivity in female flowers was recorded in a great number of clones. During the first period with a more pronounced effect, the termination of receptivity occurred in almost all of the clones within all three CSOs where flowers started to be receptive before April 22. The average duration of the receptive period of female flowers in all of the clones that stopped being receptive in this period amounted to 4.2 days. In the second and less pronounced period, there was a termination of receptivity of female flowers in a half of VK clones, whose receptivity mostly began after April 22. The average duration of the receptive period of female flowers, where clones stopped being receptive after May 3, amounted to 9.2 days. Considering the duration of the receptive period of female flowers, statistically significant difference has been determined among the clones whose receptivity of female flowers ended before April 22 and the clones whose female flowers stopped being receptive after April 22. The above-mentioned critical periods occurred in both cases after a sudden drop in the relative humidity of air, which was recorded on April 19 and 29, and low values of minimum air temperatures, which were recorded on April 19, 28 and 29. Shortly before or during the occurrence of »crirical» periods, precipitation was also recorded. The shedding of pollen started on April 19 for the clones in the region of FA BJ and NA, while the clones in the region of FA VK started shedding pollen on April 15. BJ clones stopped shedding pollen on May 20, NA clones on May 3, and VK clones on May 13. Pollen shedding lasted 31 days in BJ clones, 14 days in NA clones, and 28 days in VK clones. Similarly to the receptivity of female flowers, two »crirical« periods, when a significant number of clones stopped shedding pollen, can also be noted (the first from April 27 to 29, and the second on May 10). During the first period, most of the NA clones stopped shedding pollen. During the second period, a sudden halt in shedding pollen was recorded in almost all VK clones that started shedding pollen after May 3. The duration of pollen shedding does not differ with respect to »crirical« periods when cessation of shedding occurred, and it amounts to 5.6 days for all the clones, on average. The abovementioned »crirical« periods, in both cases connected with shedding of pollen, occurred during a period with high temperatures and low relative humidity of air, without precipitation. Phenological synchronization of flowering is the result of bud-burst synchronization in clones within CSOs and weather conditions, at the moment of receptivity of female flowers and shedding of pollen. In that respect, a combination of phenological synchronization of flowering and unfavorable weather conditions, which caused the sudden termination and short receptive period of female flowers, was most drastically reflected through the clones from CSO NA. Only a smaller number of clones from CSO NA could have participated in mutual pollination in 2010, while in CSOs VK and BJ most of the clones had this opportunity thanks to the unsynchronized bud burst, which had in turn enabled a number of clones to avoid unfavorable weather conditions. Based on the comparison between an average number of days that clones needed to enter each of the studied phenophases of flushing and flowering, it has been determined that the onset of the receptive period of female flowers occurred almost at the same time with phenophase of flushing L4 (first leaves are developed still mostly in the bud), the onset of pollen shedding, and the termination of receptive period of female flowers at the same time with phenophase L6 (the leaves are formed but still longitudinally curved), while the flushing phenophase L7 (the leaves are fully formed and smooth) coincided with the termination of receptivity of female flowers. The results showed that the phenological synchronization of flowering in 2010 was significantly affected by unfavorable weather conditions, which shortened the duration of the receptive period of female flowers to a greater degree, while they had no significant effect on the duration of pollen shedding period. Such course of events most severely affected the clones originating from CSO NA, which had started the period of receptivity of female flowers and pollen shedding of male flowers approximately at the same time, in contrast to the clones originating from CSOs Vinkovci and Bjelovar, which started their receptive periods of female flowers and pollen shedding periods of male flowers at different times.",Clonal seed orchard; Meteorological data; Pedunculate oak; Pollination; Protogyny; Receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054965304

Floral visitation is highly variable and observational studies are limited in scope due to the considerable time needed to acquire reliable data. Our study investigates whether the analysis of hydrocarbon residues (footprints) deposited by insects during flower visits allows the reconstruction of the visitor community and the prediction of seed set for large numbers of plants. In three consecutive years we recorded bumblebee visitation to wild plants of comfrey, Symphytum officinale, and later used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify bumblebee-derived unsaturated hydrocarbons (UHCs) extracted from flowers. The UHCs washed from corollae were most similar to the tarsal UHC profile of the most abundant bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum, in all 3 years. The species compositions of the bumblebee communities estimated from UHCs on flowers were also similar to those actually observed. There was a significant positive correlation between the observed number of visits by each of three bumblebee species (contributing 3-68% of the flower visits) and the estimated number of visits based on UHC profiles. Furthermore, significant correlations were obtained separately for workers and drones of two species. Seed set of comfrey plants was positively correlated with overall bumblebee visitation and the total amount of UHCs on flowers, suggesting the potential for pollen limitation. We suggest that quantifying cumulative footprint hydrocarbons provides a novel way to assess floral visitation by insects, and that this method can be used to predict seed set in pollen-limited plants. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Bombus; Cuticular hydrocarbons; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Scent marks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952699148

Its hermaphrodite flowers show a long and narrow floral tube and introrse anthers form a cone around the apex of the style head where the pollen is deposited. The stigmatic head has three functional regions, in a complex pollination mechanism favoring cross-pollination. In the pollinator censuses conducted in the primary forest population we registered Eulaema bombiformis. In the disturbed area Euglossa sp. was responsible for visits on T. undulata flowers. Eulaema bombiformis was not absent in the disturbed area, but preferred to forage on pollen and nectar-rich flowers of two neighboring flowering species. In the primary forest, T. undulata was the only flowering treelet at the end of the dry season. Significant differences were not observed regarding the frequency of visits and relative abundance among the diurnal flower visitors at both sites. In the per-visit effectiveness experiment among flower visitors, we observed one fruit produced after E. bombiformis' visits.

As a result of this disturbance, introduced honeybees are now the dominant visitors to flowers instead of endemic bees on these islands. On the other hand, satellite islands not invaded by alien anoles have retained the native flower visitors. The effects of pollinator change on plant reproduction were surveyed on these contrasting island groups. The total visitation rates and the number of interacting visitor groups on main islands were 63% and 30% lower than that on satellite islands, respectively. On the main islands, the honeybees preferred to visit alien flowers, whereas the dominant endemic bees on satellite islands tended to visit native flowers more frequently than alien flowers. These results suggest that alien anoles destroy the endemic pollination system and caused shift to alien mutualism. On the main islands, the natural fruit set of alien plants was significantly higher than that of native plants. In addition, the natural fruit set was positively correlated with the visitation rate of honeybees. Pollen limitation was observed in 53.3% of endemic species but only 16.7% of alienspecies.

In the 1950's natural oak stands in Croatia were evaluated in terms of wood productivity and quality. The results and additional ecological studies delineated three seed zones and seven seed regions (NN 107/08). Over the past decades, the periodicity of seed crops has not been regular, which has limited natural regeneration and artificial planting in partial naturally regenerated stands. In order to increase genetic quality and reduce seed periodicity, it was decided to establish clonal seed orchards (Vidakovi} 1996). Plus trees have been selected in three seed regions, based on ten evaluated traits, and three clonal seed orchards have been established in the areas of Forest Municipality Vinkovci, Na{ice and ^azma. Potential for genetic gain by selected plus trees can be evaluated by progeny trials in common environmental conditions and because of long lifespan of forest trees, it is crucial to evaluate it as early as possible. Considering biological and ecological characteristics of pedunculate oak, evolutionary factors shaping the genetic structure of its populations and existing research on its genetic variability in Croatia (Peri? et al. 2000, Bogdan et al. 2004, 2008, Kajba et al. 2006, Kati?i? et al. 2010), it can be assumed that most of its genetic variability lies on the intrapopulation, namely individual level. Such a pattern of variability points to considerable possibilities of genetic improvement by individual selection. The aim of this research is to estimate the trends of genetic parameters, heritability and genetic gains for height and diamete r growth of pedunculate oak in some Croatian provenance regions. Research area, material and measurements Three open pollinated progeny trials of pedunculate oak plus trees have been established, representing three seed regions: Progeny trial Vukojeva?ki Šikar (TP1), age 2+18 years, established with 21 OP families of selected plus trees from the seed region »srednja Podravina«, control plants from three local populations and one minus tree family. Progeny trial ?azma (TP2), age 2+7 years, established with 25 OP families of plus trees from the seed region »Donja Posavina« and control plants from local populations. Progeny trial Kunjevci (TP3), age 2+7 years, established with 24 OP families of plus trees from the seed region »Gornja Posavina i Pokuplje« and control plants from local populations. The experimental design in TP1 is completely randomized, with five repetitions and in TP2 and TP3 randomized complete block design is applied, with five blocks. In all the trials, families are planted in groups of six, with 2×2 spacing. In TP1 height was measured at the age of 2+3, 2+5, 2+7, 2+8, 2+9, 2+11, 2+15 and 2+18 (H5, H7, H9, H10, H11, H13, H17 and H20). Diameter at breast height was measured at the age of 2+9, 2+11, and circumference at breast height at the age of 2+15 and 2+18 (D11, D13, C17 and C20). In other two trials heights were measured at the age of 2+3, 2+4 and 2+7 (H5, H6 i H9). Mean values of selected families and control heights for all three trials and for circumference in TP1 were calculated for each year of measurements, as well as standard deviations, standard errors and coefficients of variation. Variance analysis was done by GLM procedure using linear models (1) for TP1 and (2) for TP2 and TP3. Additive and environmental variance components and additive coefficient of variation were calculated using REML method of MIXED procedure in SAS for Windows 8.0, using Equation (3), (4), (5) and (6). Narrow-sense heritabilities were calculated on the basis of individual tree values (h 2 i) and family means (h 2 F) using equation (7), (8) for TP1 and (9), (10) for TP2 and TP3. The realized gain from the test and expected genetic gains by two possible methods of height selection were calculated by three methods, including the following: Realized gain (R) was calculated as the difference between means of selected plus tree progenies and means of unselected control plants, (Equation 11) Expected genetic gain by individual within provenance mass selection of first generation plus trees at the same age as those represented in the studied trial, (Equation 12) Expected genetic gain by backward selection among first generation plus trees. (Equation 13) Results At the age of 2+18, the average survival in TP1 was 82%. In TP2 and TP3 at the age of 2+9, survival rates were 80% and 94%, respectively. Survival rates per individual families are shown in Fig. 1 (TP1), 4 (TP2) and 6 (TP3). Mean height of selected OP families in TP1 was 8.52 m, and average of control plants was 8.45 m (Fig. 2, Table 2). In TP2, OP families had the average height of 306.8 cm, while control plants reached higher average 310.4 m (Fig. 5, Table 2). In TP3, control plants with the average height of 122.0 m were significantly lower than the selected OP families, whose mean height was 187.6 cm. (Fig. 7, Table 2). Variance analysis results are shown in Table 1. Variance component caused by family effect for height was statistically significant in trials TP1 and TP3, and non significant in TP2. Variance component from family × block interaction was significant in both trials with RCB design and had the highest values in TP2. Fixed block effect was only significant in TP3. Additive variance component had high values throughout most of the researched period in TP1 and TP3, while in TP2 they were low. The opposite stands for environmental variance component. Variance analysis for the trait of circumference in TP1 also showed high values for environmental variance component. Mean height, diameter and circumference values for selected OP families and control plants, as well as estimated genetic parameters for those traits are shown in Table 2 Discussion In TP1 and TP3, the family effect for height was statistically significant for the entire period, showing decreasing trend in TP1 and rising in TP3 (Table 1). The family effect was never significant in TP2, pointing to narrowed individual variability of plus trees in that seed region. The results suggest significant individual genetic variability in two out of three seed regions. Some authors report correlation between flushing phenology and height growth (Baliuckas and Pliura 2003, Peri} et al. 2000). Based on that assumption it could be speculated that high additive variability for heights in TP1 and TP2 results from significant individual variabilities for flushing traits in selected plus trees and ecotypical differentiation of their original populations. However, similar research in TP1 showed no correlation between flushing phenology and height growth (Bogdan et al. 2009). Presumably, late frosts in this trial did not cause better competitiveness of the later-flushing plants and trial management in the early years removed competition from weeds, which would put the early-flushers forward. If we keep the assumption of height-flushing phenology correlation, then the results in TP2 point to greater uniformity in flushing of selected plus trees from the corresponding seed region and lack of ecotypic differentiation of its populations. However, high values of environmental variance components and family × block interactions suggest strong environmental influences in that particular trial, which could have led to underestimation of additive variance. High values of additive coefficients of variation in TP1 and TP3 suggest wide genetic variability of selected plus trees and good adaptability of their progeny to changing environmental conditions. Heritabilities High estimated heritabilities in TP1, until the age of 13, result from high component of family effect (Table 1 and 2). Average survival was, in the first years, slightly lower than in TP1, suggesting stronger competition with weeds and negative effect of rodents. Low estimated heritability values for height in TP2 reflect the low family effect variance component, probably caused by negative environmental influences. Genetic gains from selection In all the trials the estimated expected genetic gains by backward selection among first generation plus trees after open-pollinated progeny testing (G2) showed the highest values (Table 2). Realized gains were not very high during the entire period in TP1, showing the decreasing trend in recent years. In TP3 realized gain is improving, due to higher heritabilities and greater differences between selected and control families. Opposite to that, low heritabilities, non significant family variance component and small differences between selected and control families resulted in little, even negative realized gains in TP2.",Genetic parameters; Genetic variability; Open-pollinated plus trees progeny trial; Quercus robur; Selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054893412

This study aims to assess wind pollination over scales closer to the maximum observed physical pollen transport distances. The origin of effective pollen immigrants into a strongly isolated Iberian Pinus sylvestris remnant was investigated using paternally inherited microsatellite markers and maximum-likelihood estimation combined with Monte Carlo assessment of parameter uncertainty. The results revealed significant effective pollen flow (up to 4.4%) from a large population located 100km away, suggesting that the well-known mesoscale airborne transport of viable pine pollen can result in successful pollination over larger scales than previously reported for wind-pollinated tree species. This study supports the view that the gap between documented potential and effective wind pollen dispersal scales might not accurately reflect biological reality. Expanding the expected range of effective wind pollination has an impact on the assessment of a wide range of ecological and evolutionary processes, including reproductive assurance on fragmentation or colonization, metapopulation connectivity and interactions with local adaptation in heterogeneous habitats. © 2010 The Author.

This paper presents a complete list of all currently accepted New World Salvia species and their classification according to their pollination syndromes, focusing particularly on bird-pollinated species. The concept of pollination syndromes is used and complemented by field investigations, morphometric measurements, and experiments to reconstruct the process of pollen transfer and to confirm the fitting or exclusion of a given pollinator group. Within the 602 New World Salvia species, 58% are identified to be melittophilous (bee pollinated) and 31% to be ornithophilous (bird pollinated). Salvia whitehousei Alziar is assumed to be psychophilous (butterfly pollinated/long-tongued fly pollinated). About 11% of the species show characters of two or more syndromes and eight species are not assignable to any group. Bird-pollinated Salvia species occur from North America southward to Chile and Argentina. They usually grow as shrubs or perennial herbs (97%) and have red flowers (at least 49%) of an average size of 34 mm (7-130 mm).

We found that a member of the New World warblers, Geothlypis trichas, efficiently carried out pollination of S. reginae in southern California, thereby supplementing its typical diet of insects with the energy-rich nectar of S. reginae. Only occasionally, seeds were found in plantings not visited by these birds. The pollinator service provided by the warbler increases seed production in an area outside of South Africa.

On each female tree six spathes were chosen and were pollinated with pollens collected from one of the selected male parent. Out of six, three spathes were pollinated once and other three were pollinated twice (second pollination was done two days after first pollination). Data were collected for physico-chemical characteristics of the fruit including fruit drop, fruit weight, flesh weight, seed weight, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), TSS: TA ratio, sugars, level of ascorbic acid and total phenols. The results indicated that pollen source significantly affected the fruit drop percentage as minimum fruit drop was observed from the tree pollinated with M-3. Physical properties of the fruit like fruit weight, flesh weight and seed weight were significantly improved with pollination from M-1 compared to other male trees. After harvest chemical quality parameters like TSS and TSS: TA ratio, ascorbic acid contents, and reducing sugars were highest in fruit pollinated with M-3 and M-2 respectively. Whereas lowest level of TA was recorded in fruits pollinated with M-3. Pollen source and number of pollinations did not significantly affect the level of total phenols in the date palm fruit. Total and non-reducing sugars were significantly higher in the fruit pollinated twice. In conclusion, the pollen source had significant impact on the physicochemical properties of date palm cv.

Sixteen families responded for 70% of all species. Compared to Raunkiaer's spectrum, phanerophytes were over- and therophytes were under-represented. Phanerophytes were the predominant life-form in forest islands, while hemicryptophytes were outstanding in open areas. Entomophily was the dominant pollination syndrome in both habitats. Zoochory was dominant in forest islands and ranked last in open areas, where anemochory and autochory prevailed.

Peabody Dr, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","The primary mission of germplasm collections is to preserve genetic diversity, but germplasm is preserved so that it can be used. Historically, the standard practice is that all germplasm accessions should be maintained as collected, so that even self-pollinated accessions are maintained as heterogeneous seed lots. In theory, this seems like an ideal strategy for preserving genetic diversity, but in practice, it is simply not workable. Heterogeneous accessions are in constant risk of change and loss. It is possible to mitigate the risk factors, but they can only be lessened and not eliminated. Maintaining pure-lined accessions for self-pollinated species not only eliminates the problems associated with genetic drift and natural selection, but also enhances the accuracy of the evaluations and fosters effective germplasm utilization. Neither the current potential to characterize entire germplasm collections with tens of thousands of DNA markers nor the future potential of whole genome sequencing to completely characterize the diversity of all accessions in collections can be fully realized for self-pollinated species unless accessions are homogeneous and homozygous. In this manuscript, the case is made for pure-lining self-pollinated germplasm accessions using the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection, which has maintained pure-lined accessions for over 50 years, as an example. There is also an analysis of the extensive seed distribution from this collection to indicate the value of a diverse collection of genotypes. © 2011 NIAB.",germplasm management; germplasm utilization; Glycine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855712228

To determine the importance of reproductive success and pollination biology for an invasive thistle, Cirsium vulgare, we compared it in its invaded range to five, co-occurring native Cirsium species that range from rare to common. Native study species include C. fontinale var. fontinale, C. andrewsii, C. brevistylum, C. occidentale, and C. quercetorum. We compared all species' reproductive success, insect visitation rate and composition, autonomous self-pollination, and level of pollen limitation in multiple populations. Species differed in their reproductive success; the invasive C. vulgare produced more flower heads per plant than most native species. C. vulgare attracted more visitors than its congeners. In addition, reproductive success and insect visitation significantly varied between populations within species, mainly due to aphid infestation in one population of C. occidentale. Unlike the rare species (C. fontinale and andrewsii), C. vulgare did not require a pollinator for high-levels of seed production. The remaining native species set fewer seeds than C. vulgare without a pollinator. However, differences in insect visitation and autonomous self-pollination did not lead to differences in pollen limitation across species or between populations. This result suggests that factors other than pollination biology determine the difference in reproductive success of these species. However, high levels of autonomous self-pollination and generalist insect visitation may allow the invasive C. vulgare to easily establish new populations from low numbers of propagules. Our study provides one contrast that should build towards a larger comparative analysis to examine general patterns in the relationship between reproductive success, pollination biology, rare and invasive species, and our ability to predict biological invasions in introduced species. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Asteraceae; Bombus vosnesenskii; Cirsium; Comparative method; Invasive; Pollen limitation; Rare,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952628316

The reproductive biology of Abolboda pulchella and A. poarchon was studied to determine the main pollination system of these species, providing the first experimental data on reproduction in the Xyridaceae. Methods: A field study was conducted, including observations on the morphology and biology of the flowers, insect visits and pollinator behaviour. Experimental pollination treatments were performed to assess agamospermy, spontaneous self-pollination and self-compatibility. Pollination success was determined by pollen tube growth, and reproductive success was assessed by fruit- and seed-set. Key Results: Abolboda pulchella and A. poarchon were pollinated by Apidae, Megachilidae and Halictidae bees. The floral resources were pollen and nectar that was produced by stylar appendages, an uncommom nectary type for monocotyledons. The species were self-compatible, and pollen tube growth from self-pollen was similar to that of cross-pollen. However, herkogamy prevented spontaneous selfing, rendering the plants dependent on the pollinators activity. There was no production of seeds by agamospermy. Conclusions: Melittophily is the main pollination system of these two Abolboda species. Nectar production was first recorded here for Xyridaceae, and along with self-compatibility, herkogamy and bee pollination, is an informative characteristic that can be used in future phylogenetic analyses of the family as well as Poales. © The Author 2011.",Abolboda poarchon; Abolboda pulchella; bee pollination; herkogamy; nectar; Poales; reproduction; self-compatibility; stylar appendages; Xyridaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953174929

Platanthera praeclara is pollinated by several species of hawkmoths (Sphingidae) in Canada. There is minimal overlap between the flight period of hawkmoth pollinators and the flowering period of the Canadian orchid population, with orchids normally flowering at the end of the hawkmoth flight period. This study was designed to determine if orchids produce more nectar and higher concentrations of sugars in the nectar at the beginning of the flowering period coinciding with maximal pollinator flight times. As pollinators are nocturnally active, we also determined if orchids produce more nectar or nectar with increased concentrations of sugars during the night versus the daytime. Nectar sugar concentration and the amount of nectar per flower were highest at the beginning of the flowering period, and significantly decreased as the season progressed. Nectar volume increased in the evening and during the night but sugar concentration remained relatively unchanged. We examined nectar volume and sugar concentration by flower position, as the majority of the flowers encountered by pollinators in the first few days of the bloom period were lower-positioned flowers due to the sequential flowering nature of the orchid. Within the inflorescence, lower-positioned flowers had higher sugar concentrations in comparison to higher-positioned flowers at the start of the flowering period, but sugar concentrations converged as the season progressed.

In Australia, stingless bees are important pollinators that use cerumen for nest construction and possibly for colony's health. While extensive research attests to the therapeutic properties of honeybee (Apis mellifera) propolis, the biological and medicinal properties of Australian stingless bee cerumen are largely unknown. In this study, the chemical and biological properties of polar extracts of cerumen from Tetragonula carbonaria in South East Queensland, Australia were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses and in vitro 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) cell-free assays. Extracts were tested against comparative (commercial tincture of A. mellifera propolis) and positive controls (Trolox and gallic acid). Distinct GC-MS fingerprints of a mixed diterpenic profile typical of native bee cerumen were obtained with pimaric acid (6.31±0.97%, w/w), isopimaric acid (12.23±3.03%, w/w), and gallic acid (5.79±0.81%, w/w) tentatively identified as useful chemical markers. Characteristic flavonoids and prenylated phenolics found in honeybee propolis were absent. Cerumen extracts from T. carbonaria inhibited activity of 5-LOX, an enzyme known to catalyse production of proinflammatory mediators (IC50 19.97±2.67 ?g/ml, mean±SEM, n=4). Extracts had similar potency to Trolox (IC50 12.78±1.82 ?g/ml), but were less potent than honeybee propolis (IC50 5.90±0.62 ?g/ml) or gallic acid (IC50 5.62±0.35 ?g/ml, P&lt;0.001). These findings warrant further investigation of the ecological and medicinal properties of this stingless bee cerumen, which may herald a commercial potential for the Australian beekeeping industry. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",5-Lipoxygenase; Diterpenic acids; GC-MS; Honeypots; Propolis; Resins,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954423401

The effect of water limitation and its timing on development of yield components were studied in detail at spike and spikelet level in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). An experiment with three watering treatments (control watering, CONT; drought prior to pollination, DR1 and terminal drought, DR2) was set up in a large greenhouse (20×30m). In addition to watering treatments, two NPK fertilizer application rates (0 and 120kg Nha-1) were used to investigate the fertilizer effect. The drought effect exceeded the effect of fertilizer application for grain number and single grain weight (SGW). DR1 reduced the number of grains, whereas DR2 reduced both SGW and the number of grains. Resuming the watering at pollination (DR1) restored photosynthesis and enhanced grain filling, resulting in almost similar SGW in DR1 and CONT plants. Spikelets in the upper mid-section of the spike dominated yield formation in all treatments. This was particularly emphasised in DR1 plants as 58% of the grain yield was produced in spikelets 3-5, whereas in DR2 and CONT plants it was 39% and 36%, respectively. Hence, drought prior pollination strongly reduced yielding capacity (=grain number) in apical and basal spikelets. DR1 and DR2 reduced substantially grain yield and grain N yield resulting in low nitrogen use efficiency. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Barley; Drought; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Yield; Yield component,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952412091

In this study, we investigated correlations between the phenology of hawkmoths, flowering phenology of Inga Mill. species (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae-Ingeae) and rainfall in one of the largest remnants of Atlantic forest in northeastern Brazil (Coimbra forest with ca. 3500 ha). We carried out monthly hawkmoth inventories and phenological observations of the five most abundant Inga species in Coimbra forest from October 2005 to August 2007. Altogether 39 hawkmoth individuals were collected with light trap or butterfly net, which were ascribed to nine genera and 14 species. With the present study Pachygonidia caliginosa Boisduval (Bombycoidea-Sphingidae-Dilophonotina) is registered for the second time in Brazil, since the species had been previously collected only in the Amazon. The tribe Dilophonotina was the most represented with five species. Animals with short proboscises (14.7-35.0 mm) represented over 69.7% of the sample. Most individuals were collected during the months of low rainfall, the same period of the highest flower abundance of five Inga species. The flowering of Inga vera, I. striata and I. ingoides was positively correlated with hawkmoth abundance. The synchrony of the activity period of these animals in adult phase with certain nectar sources, and the relationship between morphological parameters of hawkmoths and Inga flowers suggest a narrow pollination mutualistic relationship at the study site. Considering the hotspot status of the Atlantic forest due to high fragmentation and habitat loss, as well as the previous local extinction of hawkmoth species in smaller fragments of the studied landscape, our results are relevant for restoration plans not only for the Brazilian Atlantic forest, but for neotropical forests in general, where Inga is native. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Conservation biology; Flowering phenology; Northeastern Brazil; Pollination; Rain forest; Restoration ecology; Sphingophily,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952755942

Understanding human exposures to aeroallergens requires accurate estimates of the spatial distribution of airborne pollen levels as well as of various air pollutants at different times. However, currently there are no established methods for estimating allergenic pollen emissions and concentrations over large geographic areas such as the United States. A mechanistic modeling system for describing pollen emissions and transport over extensive domains has been developed by adapting components of existing regional scale air quality models and vegetation databases. First, components of the Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (BEIS) were adapted to predict pollen emission patterns. Subsequently, the transport module of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system was modified to incorporate description of pollen transport. The combined model, CMAQ-pollen, allows for simultaneous prediction of multiple air pollutants and pollen levels in a single model simulation, and uses consistent assumptions related to the transport of multiple chemicals and pollen species. Application case studies for evaluating the combined modeling system included the simulation of birch and ragweed pollen levels for the year 2002, during their corresponding peak pollination periods (April for birch and September for ragweed). The model simulations were driven by previously evaluated meteorological model outputs and emissions inventories for the eastern United States for the simulation period. A semi-quantitative evaluation of CMAQ-pollen was performed using tree and ragweed pollen counts in Newark, NJ for the same time periods. The peak birch pollen concentrations were predicted to occur within two days of the peak measurements, while the temporal patterns closely followed the measured profiles of overall tree pollen. For the case of ragweed pollen, the model was able to capture the patterns observed during September 2002, but did not predict an early peak; this can be associated with a wider species pollination window and inadequate spatial information in current land cover databases. An additional sensitivity simulation was performed to comparatively evaluate the dispersion patterns predicted by CMAQ-pollen with those predicted by the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, which is used extensively in aerobiological studies. The CMAQ estimated concentration plumes matched the equivalent pollen scenario modeled with HYSPLIT. The novel pollen modeling approach presented here allows simultaneous estimation of multiple airborne allergens and other air pollutants, and is being developed as a central component of an integrated population exposure modeling system, the Modeling Environment for Total Risk studies (MENTOR) for multiple, co-occurring contaminants that include aeroallergens and irritants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Bioaerosols; Birch allergy; Mesoscale model; Pollen dispersion; Pollen emission; Ragweed allergy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953037011

The use of male sterile bait plants in field trials to demonstrate the rate of gene flow is questionable due to lack of pollination competition. However, little direct evidence has been published. A field experiment of male sterile and male fertile sorghum pollen recipient bait plants was conducted to evaluate pollen competition between wild and cultivated sorghums and the effects of pollen competition on gene flow assessment. Pollen competition between wild and cultivated sorghums was estimated from two-component pollen mixtures of wild and cultivated sorghum (1:1 ratio) applied to wild, cultivated and male-sterile maternal bait plants. Paternity was determined in the progeny using two diagnostic Simple Sequence Repeat markers. The study found that self pollen has higher seed-siring success. Maternal genotype influences the siring ability of the pollen donor components which significantly deviated from the 1:1 pollen loads. The study showed that published estimates of gene flow derived from studies using male-sterile bait plants seriously overestimate gene flow and that pollen competition may be a significant factor influencing outcrossing rates. The results suggest that the predominant direction of gene flow is from cultivated to wild sorghum, potentially leading to introgression of crop genes into wild sorghum. Pollen competition should be taken into account in gene flow estimation, since presence of self-pollen can account for over half of seed produced irrespective of maternal genotype. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Outcross pollen; Pollen competition; Pollen-mediated gene flow; Pollination; Self pollen; Sorghum bicolor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952195832

Flies transfer fungal gametes among stromata and thereby serve to cross-fertilize fungi. Hence, the interaction is analogous to insect pollination in angiosperms. While most Epichloë species are not interfertile, Epichloë typhina and Epichloë clarkii can hybridize. We investigated whether Botanophila flies play a role in the reproductive isolation of the two Epichloë species at a field site in southwestern Switzerland. We estimated the density of stromata and collected fly larvae and stromata occurring on plants. While most ascospores collected from both species indicated intraspecific mating, 9.3% of fungal fruiting bodies contained spores of hybrid origin. Two species of Botanophila larvae occurred on stromata and both preferred E. typhina. Yet, both fly species laid eggs on both fungal species. While preferences by Botanophila flies should influence reproductive isolation between the fungi, other mechanisms are likely more important.

In the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, where honeybees are indigenous, managed hives potentially elevate the abundance of honeybees far above natural levels, but impacts on other floral resource-dependent species have not been studied. Here we use experimental manipulation of honeybee density to test whether honeybee farming affects nectar-feeding birds. We selected the common sugarbush (Protea repens), utilized by both birds and bees, and analysed the time (before/after) by treatment (control/experiment) interaction to explore changes in bee abundance, nectar availability and bird abundance at three sites. Hive addition increased honeybee abundance in inflorescences of P. repens above expected levels. Despite experimental increase in honeybee numbers, there is no reduction in nectar sugar availability relative to the control areas. Where honeybee density was highest, sugarxpected levels. Despite experimental increase in honeybee numbers, there is no reduction in nectar sugar availability relative to the control areas. Where honeybee density was highest, sugarbird (Promerops cafer) numbers declined relative to expected, but sunbirds (Nectarinidae) were not affected at any of the sites.

However, there have been few empirical studies on the relationship between mixed mating and reproductive assurance in perennial plants. In the herbaceous perennial, Kosteletzkya virginica, delayed selfing induced from context-dependent style curvature offers reproductive assurance, and adverse weather conditions significantly reduce pollinator visitation rates. In this study, our goals were (i) to experimentally evaluate pollinator failure rate, reproductive assurance, selfing rate and the relationships between them, and (ii) to measure inbreeding depression across multiple growth seasons. Results indicate that both population selfing rates and reproductive assurance are significantly and positively correlated with field estimates of pollinator failure rates, and there is a strong relationship between selfing rates and reproductive assurance. Inbreeding depression across multiple growth seasons ranged from 0.621 to 0.665, and there were no significant differences among different seasons. Our data demonstrates that a mixed mating system is beneficial because frequent pollinator failure has allowed reproductive assurance to evolve through delayed selfing which minimizes the risk of seed discounting and is still advantageous despite high inbreeding depression. © 2010 SAAB.",Adult inbreeding depression; Kosteletzkya virginica; Pollinator failure rate; Reproductive assurance; Selfing rate,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955467984

Individuals in the plantation MU produced more flowers per inflorescence than those in other MUs, but there were no statistical differences in mean fruit set among MUs. The only difference in mean visitation rates was between the plantation (65.83 ± 38.49) and the slope sites (11.5 ± 12.8). We observed visits by 19 insect species, including bees (31.6%), butterflies (31.6%), wasps (26.3%) and flies (10.5%). A clustering analysis based on the number of visits showed that a) the plantation site is most different from the other MUs, b) the pasture and the site at the base of the slope are similar to the slope site, and c) the higher frequency of visits of pollinators in the plantation MU was responsible for these differences. Of the 19 species of insects visiting the flowers, 12 were considered pollinators. The pollinator similarity analysis indicated a clear separation between areas and suggested that human activity has resulted in the replacement of native pollinators by exotic species. However, these changes apparently have not affected the pre-emergent reproductive success of S. tuberosa. Our results show that plant reproductive biology in semi-arid ecosystems may be modified by human action and that changes in floral production and pollinator guilds are the most conspicuous effects. However, the traditional management performed by local people may not affect the reproductive success of plant species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Anthropogenic disturbance; Dry forests; Ethnobotany; Native resources; Pollination,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-78951477698

This study explored possible ecological functions of the lever-like stamens and the floral design in Salvia cyclostegia. Methods: Flower construction was experimentally manipulated by removing either the lower lever arms or the upper fertile thecae of the two stamens from a flower. The two types of manipulated individuals were intermixed with the control ones and randomly distributed in the population. Key Results: Removing the sterile lower lever arms significantly reduced handling time per flower of the main pollinator, Bombus personatus. Interestingly, this manipulation did not increase the number of flowers probed per plant visit, but instead reduced it, i.e. shortened the visit sequence of the bumble-bees. Both loss of staminal lever function by removing lower lever arms and exclusion of self pollen by removing upper fertile thecae significantly reduced seed set per flower and seed set per plant. Both the manipulations interacted significantly with inflorescence size for the effect on female reproductive output. Conclusions: Though the intact flowers demand a long handling time for pollinators, the reversible staminal lever is of advantage by promoting dispersal of pollen and thus the male function. The particular floral design in S. cyclostegia contributes to the floral constancy of B. personatus bumble-bees, with the lower lever arms acting as an optical cue for foraging cognition. © The Author 2011.",Adaptation; Bombus personatus; experimental flower manipulation; floral constancy; floral design; foraging behaviour; geitonogamy; Salvia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953231184

We studied the reproductive ecology of Ariocarpus fissuratus at Cuatrocinegas region, Mexico, in order to explore if reproductive traits influence population viability. The size of perianth, pistils and stamens, floral behavior and controlled pollination treatments were assessed to determine Cruden's outcrossing index (OCI), the outcrossing rate and the mating system. The breeding system was estimated with pollen/ovule ratios (P/O) and outcrossing rate was estimated by comparing progeny from self- and outcross-pollination treatments. Frequency and behavior of floral visitors was determined, and nectar production recorded. Ariocarpus fissuratus blooms synchronously during three weeks in autumn. Flowers display herkogamy and homogamy, and OCI and P/O ratio suggest xenogamy. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the effect of pollination treatment on fruit set and number of viable seeds yielded per fruit. Fruit set was significantly higher in the outcrossing treatment than in the selfing treatments. The mating system indicates that A. fissuratus is mainly an outcrosser, showing a partial self-incompatibility with low fruit set for hand self-pollination. Floral visitors are native solitary and introduced bees, and beetles cause high levels of florivory damage. Reproductive ecology suggests that the need for pollinators, presence of exotic pollinators, partial self-incompatibility and florivory negatively affect sexual reproduction and thus the persistence of this endangered species. © Torrey Botanical Club.",Bee pollination; endemic species; floral morphology; florivory; fruit set; melittophily; outcrossing; pollination ecology; self incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051865403

Inverse modeling (IM) of seed dispersal, a simple statistical technique for parameterizing dispersal kernels, has been widely used since 1992; surprisingly, however, this approach has never been verified in the field. Methods: We released from 20 nearby trees the winged seeds of a liana species, Entada polystachya, near the coast in a tropical, dry forest in Jalisco, Mexico. Key results: With a two-parameter log-normal function, we found that IM predicted both the shape and scale parameters well as long as we used the entire data set. When, however, we subsampled (thus simulating the use of transects for seedlings or an array of seed traps), the estimates of the scale and shape parameters were often more than double the real values. The problem was due to the marked anisotropy (directional bias; in this case, in the direction of the diurnal sea breeze) of the individual dispersal curves. When we randomized the direction of dispersal of individual seeds from the trees (keeping dispersal distances unchanged), predictions of parameter values were excellent. Conclusions: Inverse modeling must include directional parameters when dealing with areas where strong anisotropy is to be expected, e.g., for wind dispersal of seeds near coasts or pollination by any vector where a plant species is limited to a strongly linear habitat such as river banks. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Anemochory; Anisotropy; Inverse modeling; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955231851

The weed is an agricultural pest infesting winter wheat fields and causing economic loss. Common ancestry between the two species enables interspecific hybridization, thus providing a mechanism for gene flow to occur. This can facilitate the accumulation of novel genes, which could increase the wild species' competitiveness with wheat and its ability to invade novel habitats. Interest in the development of transgenic wheat cultivars has increased the concern for interspecific gene flow. Gene introgression requires recurrent backcrossing to the weedy species after the initial hybridization event. Field experiments were conducted at two locations in Colorado in 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, with jointed goatgrass acting as the sole source of viable pollen for fertilization of transplanted hybrid plants. Backcrossing rates were determined by conducting germination studies on spikes collected from a total of 206 hybrid plants. Pollination by jointed goatgrass led to the production of 463 BC1 plants from seed produced on these 206 hybrid plants. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals estimate the rate of backcrossing at 0.028 to 0.306% and 0.077 to 0.604%, with medians of 0.062 and 0.152%, respectively, at the two locations. The results demonstrate that backcrossing to jointed goatgrass can occur, despite low rates of hybrid fertility. Subsequent backcrossing would make it likely that a wheat gene conferring a selective advantage will introgress into the weedy population. For the U.S. Great Plains, it is possible that transgenic wheat cultivars will be released in the future and determining proper management of these cultivars is necessary to minimize hybridization and advantageous gene introgression into weedy relatives. © 2011 Weed Science Society of America.",Biotechnology; crop-weed complex; gene flow; genetically modified; interspecific hybridization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954525944

A positive influence on their divergence is ascribed to their unique explosive pollination mechanism which has been proposed to be a key innovation. To test this hypothesis phylogenies of the two major African clades (Sarcophrynium and the Marantochloa clade) were established based on data from nuclear (ITS, 5S) and chloroplast (trnL/trnL-F) DNA for an almost complete taxon sample. The phylogeny was used to parsimoniously reconstruct morphological and ecological traits and gographic distribution patterns. The resulting molecular relationships of the genera are congruent with the existing family phylogeny. As in previous studies the species Ataenidia conferta is nested within Marantochloa so that a new circumscription of Marantochloa is proposed leading to the new name Marantochloa conferta . Hybridization events, adaptation to different pollinators, and Pleistocene climatic fluctuations are hypothesized evolutionary factors fostering speciation in the African clades. The explosive pollination mechanism might have played an important role in optimizing the mating system but did certainly not force speciation directly through mechanisms of reproductive isolation. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.",character reconstruction; explosive pollination mechanism; hybridization; key innovation; plant pollinator interaction; Pleistocene refugia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959535181

Here, we queried the whole transcriptome of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) in order to identify genes with specific reproductive functions. We used the Affymetrix ATH1 whole genome array to profile wild-type unpollinated pistils and unfertilized ovules. By comparing the expression profile of pistils at 0.5, 3.5, and 8.0 h after pollination and applying a number of statistical and bioinformatics criteria, we found 1,373 genes differentially regulated during pollen-pistil interactions. Robust clustering analysis grouped these genes in 16 time-course clusters representing distinct patterns of regulation. Coregulation within each cluster suggests the presence of distinct genetic pathways, which might be under the control of specific transcriptional regulators. A total of 78% of the regulated genes were expressed initially in unpollinated pistil and/or ovules, 15% were initially detected in the pollen data sets as enriched or preferentially expressed, and 7% were induced upon pollination. Among those, we found a particular enrichment for unknown transcripts predicted to encode secreted proteins or representing signaling and cell wall-related proteins, which may function by remodeling the extracellular matrix or as extracellular signaling molecules. A strict regulatory control in various metabolic pathways suggests that fine-tuning of the biochemical and physiological cellular environment is crucial for reproductive success.

Improvement of drought tolerance is an important area of research for groundnut breeding programmes. Therefore, for the identification of candidate QTLs for drought tolerance, a comprehensive and refined genetic map containing 191 SSR loci based on a single mapping population (TAG 24 × ICGV 86031), segregating for drought and surrogate traits was developed. Genotyping data and phenotyping data collected for more than ten drought related traits in 2-3 seasons were analyzed in detail for identification of main effect QTLs (M-QTLs) and epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) using QTL Cartographer, QTLNetwork and Genotype Matrix Mapping (GMM) programmes. A total of 105 M-QTLs with 3.48-33.36% phenotypic variation explained (PVE) were identified using QTL Cartographer, while only 65 M-QTLs with 1.3-15.01% PVE were identified using QTLNetwork. A total of 53 M-QTLs were such which were identified using both programmes. On the other hand, GMM identified 186 (8.54-44.72% PVE) and 63 (7.11-21.13% PVE), three and two loci interactions, whereas only 8 E-QTL interactions with 1.7-8.34% PVE were identified through QTLNetwork. Interestingly a number of co-localized QTLs controlling 2-9 traits were also identified. The identification of few major, many minor M-QTLs and QTL × QTL interactions during the present study confirmed the complex and quantitative nature of drought tolerance in groundnut. This study suggests deployment of modern approaches like marker-assisted recurrent selection or genomic selection instead of marker-assisted backcrossing approach for breeding for drought tolerance in groundnut. © 2010 The Author(s).",Drought tolerance; Epistatic QTLs; Genetic map; Main-effect QTLs; Molecular breeding; Molecular markers; Peanut,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953722218

It is known that workers rapidly learn a flower colour when rewarded with artificial nectar (sucrose solution). However, some previous studies report that the degree of constancy after training is unaffected by reward quantity and quality when bees are tested in an array of artificial flowers of two easily distinguished colours, such as blue and yellow. One possible reason for this surprising result is that large reward volumes were compared. This is likely to mask the abilities of foragers to make adaptive decisions under more realistic conditions. To test this possibility, we offered untrained honey bee workers ecologically relevant rewards (0.5, 1 or 2? l of 0.5 or 1?mol?l-1 sucrose solution) on one or two consecutive yellow or blue artificial flowers and then recorded which flowers the bees subsequently landed on in an array of 40 empty flowers. The results showed that an increase in all three factors (volume, concentration and number of rewards) significantly increased constancy (proportion of visits to flowers of the trained colour) and persistence (number of flowers visited) during the foraging bout. Constancy for the least rewarding situation was 75.9% compared with 98.6% for the most rewarding situation. These results clearly show that honey bee workers do become more constant to blue or yellow with increasing nectar rewards, provided that the rewards used are ecologically realistic. As the most rewarding conditions led to nearly 100% constancy, further reward increases during training would not have been able to further increase constancy. This explains why previous studies comparing large rewards found no effect of reward on constancy. © 2011.

Despite extensive research, the meiotic pathways in such hybrids remain largely unknown. In this study, the effect of the genotypes of disomic wheat-rye substitution lines on the regulation of meiosis in ABDR amphihaploids was analysed by comparing microsporogenesis and seed set under self pollination in hybrids of normal bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and wheats with single chromosome substitutions 1R(1A), 1Rv(1A), 2R(2D)1, 2R(2D)2, 2R(2D)3, 5R(5D), 5R(5A), 6R(6A) with rye (Secale cereale L.). Three types of meiotic pathways were identified in the hybrids: reductional, equational, and equational+reductional. During the reductional type division, chromosomes randomly moved toward the poles at Anaphase I (AI) and separated sister chromatids at AII. Meiosis ended with tetrad formation, and the resulting plants were sterile ((2R(2D)1 × R, 2R(2D)2 × R). In the equational type division, the chromosomes aligned along the equator at Metaphase I and at AI separated into chromatids that moved toward the poles. This meiotic pathway led to dyad formation and partial fertility (especially in hybrids of 1Rv(1A) and 6R(6A)). In the equational+reductional pathway, some chromosomes divided in an equational manner while others were segregated reductionally within the same microsporocyte and this led to formation of tetrads with groups of uncoiled chromosomes. Comparison of the frequencies of each of the three meiotic pathways in different hybrid combinations suggests differences in contributions of individual chromosomes to the control of the entire meiotic process. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Meiotic pathways in amphihaploids; Secale cereale; Triticum aestivum; Univalent division; Unreduced gametes; Wheat-rye amphihaploids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952185712

Box 1240, Melfort, SK S0E 1A, Canada","A field experiment was conducted from 2000 to 2007 on three-year old alfalfa stand near Star City in northeastern Saskatchewan to determine the influence of balanced application of sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), or potassium (K) fertilizers on forage dry matter yield (DMY) and seed yield, protein concentration (PC) in forage, concentration and uptake of total nitrogen (N), P, K, S, and boron (B) in forage and seed, and residual soil extractable P, exchangeable K and sulfate-S. Appropriate application of S, P, or K fertilizer nutrients was required to obtain optimum yield, PC, and nutrient concentration and uptake, especially when alfalfa was grown for hay production. Yield response to fertilization was much more frequent and much higher when alfalfa was managed as hay compared to when managed for seed production. The results suggest the importance of proper fertilization in increasing longevity of alfalfa stands. Under both hay and seed plots, there was only a small increase in residual sulfate-S from S fertilization, but significant accumulation of extractable P mainly in the 0-15 soil layer from P application. There was relatively higher concentration of exchangeable K in soil in the seed plots than in hay plots. In hay plots, concentrations of residual exchangeable K in soil were negatively related to DMY, especially in 2007. The findings suggest that when a soil is testing low (or deficient) in a nutrient and alfalfa growth is reduced, then alfalfa producers should consider applying fertilizers to supply adequate amounts of nutrients that are lacking in the soil, especially for optimum forage production. However, it is still difficult to predict accurately if a profitable alfalfa seed yield response to fertilization would occur, particularly when soils are testing marginal in some nutrient levels and yields are negatively affected by abnormal weather conditions (drought soil moisture conditions reducing plant growth, wet, cloudy and cool weather conditions decreasing pollination activity and late summer and/or early autumn frost damage to seed formation) that often occur in the growing season in this region. © Crown Copyright.",Alfalfa; Balanced fertilization; Forage yield; Phosphorus; Potassium; Seed yield; Sulfur,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951567016

Allamanda blanchetii is a shrubby species, endemic of the Caatinga, flowering from February to July, with peak in March-April. The fruiting followed the flowering and continued until September. The tubular flowers are pink, their strong herkogamy preventing self pollination. The pollen grains are deposited in the upper side of the style head (non-receptive region), still in the pre anthesis phase (dehiscent anther), characterizing a secondary pollen presentation. The flowers produce an average of 36.6 ?L of nectar, that is the only resource to the floral visitors. Allamanda blanchetii is self incompatible and the results suggest a late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism. The floral attributes are compatible with the melittophilous and psychophilous syndromes. In fact, the observed pollinators were the bee Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, as main pollinator, and four species of butterflies, which act as secondary pollinators.

The distribution range and number of populations are thought to have been reduced to the present refugial populations during the Quaternary climatic oscillations. Because of its showy flowers, this plant has faced illegal removal from its natural habitats for horticultural use and has been designated a critically endangered species (class IA). In this study, we analyzed the genetic structure of the relict populations of T. ishiiana in order to contribute to the conservation strategies of the prefectural government. Our analyses of nine nuclear microsatellite loci detected high genetic diversity (HE = 0.704 and HO = 0.541) for the two populations. The two populations were slightly differentiated (RST = 0.032), accompanied by faint substructure across the populations (K = 3). In addition, each population exhibited spatial genetic structuring. The relatively low inbreeding coefficient for both populations together (FIS = 0.233) and each population separately (FIS = 0.217-0.246) may be attributable to crossing among descendants within a population along with occasional gene flow between the populations. These results suggested that the extant populations have not experienced a severe bottleneck. The two extant populations were genetically differentiated at a very low level, accompanied by occasional pollen flow via pollinators and/or seed dispersal by gravity in the mountainous environment. Occasional gene exchange between the populations has allowed T. ishiiana to harbor high genetic diversity despite being a relic plant confined to two small refugial populations. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Convallariaceae; Gene flow; Microsatellite; Refugia; Tricyrtis ishiiana,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952708656

Survival data showed that P. tubiflorus is a short-lived perennial (approximately 50% survival after 3 years) with substantial variation in the percentage of individuals that flower in a given year.

However, high survival and robust reproduction output of transplants at one site indicated that there are additional suitable sites near the parent population and suggested that these sites remain unoccupied due to limited seed dispersal. While it is unlikely that pollinator limitation is the cause of low reproduction, further study is needed on the pollination syndrome of the Iowa populations of this and other Penstemon species. Future studies should investigate the possibility that the species is limited by site-specific factors that inhibit germination and the survival of small seedlings. © 2011.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955980968

Twenty-six of total 225 SRAP primer combinations showed polymorphisms. Analysis of 84 kenaf varieties by using the 26 polymorphic primer combinations had identified a total of 329 reproducible bands. Among them, 248 bands (75.4%) were polymorphic. The number of polymorphic fragments produced by an individual primer combination ranged from 5 to 15, with an average of 9.54 bands. DNA fragment size ranged from 300 bp to 1500 bp. Cluster analysis of the SRAP fingerprints clearly separated the 84 varieties into three distinct groups: cultivar, wild, and intermediate types. The cultivars were further delineated into four subgroups. High genetic similarity was found among varieties from the same geographic region, resulting from the fact that kenaf is a plant dominated by cross-pollination.

Butterflies are another important insect order and a valued ecological resource in pollination. The current study conducted acute toxicity tests with naled, permethrin, and dichlorvos on fifth larval instar (caterpillars) and adults of different native Florida, USA, butterfly species to determine median lethal doses (24-h LD50), because limited acute toxicity data are available with this major insect group. Thorax- and wing-only applications of each insecticide were conducted. Based on LD50s, thorax and wing application exposures were acutely toxic to both caterpillars and adults. Permethrin was the most acutely toxic insecticide after thorax exposure to fifth instars and adult butterflies. However, no generalization on acute toxicity (sensitivity) of the insecticides could be concluded based on exposures to fifth instars versus adult butterflies or on thorax versus wing exposures of adult butterflies. A comparison of LD50s of the butterflies from this study (caterpillars and adults) with honeybee LD50s for the adult mosquito insecticides on a ?g/organism or ?g/g basis indicates that several butterfly species are more sensitive to these insecticides than are honeybees. A comparison of species sensitivity distributions for all three insecticides shows that permethrin had the lowest 10th percentile. Using a hazard quotient approach indicates that both permethrin and naled applications in the field may present potential acute hazards to butterflies, whereas no acute hazard of dichlorvos is apparent in butterflies. Butterflies should be considered as potential test organisms when nontarget insect testing of pesticides is suggested under FIFRA. © 2010 SETAC © 2011 SETAC.",Adult mosquito insecticides; Butterflies; Dichlorvos; Naled; Permethrin,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952292939

Don planted in New Zealand and Australia were analysed at age 9 years from planting. The trials included selections from three mainland California natural populations-Año Nuevo, Monterey and Cambria. Monterey and Cambria performed better than Año Nuevo at two New Zealand sites, but Monterey and Año Nuevo were almost identical in growth, whereas Cambria grew less vigorously at the Australian site. We detected significant provenance differences for diameter at breast height (DBH) growth and stem straightness across countries (p &lt; 0.001). Estimated heritability for DBH ranged from 0.19 to 0.26 within sites, while heritability estimates for stem straightness and branching frequency ranged from 0.10 to 0.24. Estimated type B genetic correlations for DBH were always higher between the two trials in New Zealand trials than between pairs of trials in New Zealand and the Australian site. The genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) for DBH was around 8-10% compared to ca. 5% for the current breeding population. These results suggested that there is appreciable genetic variation in the native populations, and infusion of these materials would increase the genetic variation in current breeding populations. Ten unrelated parents ranked above control seedlots from the older open-pollinated seed orchard stock for DBH growth and would be potential candidates for infusion. The promising performance of the Cambria material is an important result because the genetic base of the present Australian and New Zealand plantations is principally derived from Año Nuevo and Monterey. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Breeding population; Genotype × environment interaction; Infusion; Provenance; Radiata pine,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952987425

Moreover, we have recently shown that plants can perceive cis-jasmone and that it acts as a signaling molecule in A. thaliana, inducing a discrete and distinctive suite of genes, of which a large subset is putatively involved in metabolism and defense responses.6 Cytochrome P450s feature prominently in these functional subsets and of these the highest fold change upon cis-jasmone treatment occurred with the cytochrome CYP81D11 (At3g28740)6. Hence this gene was chosen for a more thorough analysis of the potential biological relevance of the cis-jasmone induced defense response. Although the precise function of CYP81D11 remains to be determined, we could previously demonstrate its involvement in the indirect defense response in Arabidopsis, as plants exposed to cis-jasmone ceased to be attractive to the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi when this P450 was inactivated by T-DNA insertion mutagenesis.6 Here we report additional experiments which give further support to a role of CYP81D11 in the direct or indirect defense response of A. thaliana. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Cis-jasmone; Cytochrome P450; Indirect defense; Tritrophic interactions; Volatile signaling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955632250

This observation provides strong evidence for Baker's Rule (1967) in that self-incompatibility can impede these taxa of colonizing and establishing on islands. The woody liana Hugonia serrata Lam. (Linaceae) is an extremely rare plant species endemic to the Mascarene Islands of La Réunion and Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean. Previous research has documented the existence of tristyly in this species, thereby raising the number of known tristylous families to six. However, data were based on a very small sampling size and currently no data on the self-incompatibility system of the species are available. In this study, we investigated in detail the breeding system of H. serrata. Calculation of reciprocity and precision indices based on measurements of reproductive organs in a much larger sample size confirmed tristyly in this species. This style-stamen polymorphism was accompanied by several ancillary polymorphisms in stigma size, stigma color, anther size and pollen size. The rigidity of the heteromorphic incompatibility system was tested using experimental hand-pollinations. Significantly fewer pollen tubes arrived at the ovary after self- and illegitimate pollination (7%) than after legitimate pollination (12%). Seed set after self-pollination (3.6%) was also much lower than after legitimate pollination (66.7%). Comparison of seed set after legitimate pollination with natural seed set showed evidence for outcross pollen limitation. Our results indicate that despite severe pollen limitation and limited mate availability the heteromorphic incompatibility system in H. serrata is still strict after colonization of La Réunion Island. Because H. serrata is extremely long-lived, these results suggest that establishment of heterostylous species on islands may have been favored by their long life span. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Baker's Law; Heteromorphic incompatibility system; Hugonia serrata; La Réunion Island; Pollen limitation; Tristyly,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952991610

We sought to clarify the processes of degradation of nucellar cell components and their transport to the pollen tube during PCD in response to pollen tube penetration of such nucelli. Stimulated by pollination, synthesis of large amounts of starch grains occurred in cells in a wide region of the nucellus, but as the pollen tube penetrated the nucellus, starch grains were degraded in amyloplasts of nucellar cells. In cells undergoing PCD, electron-dense vacuoles with high membrane contrast appeared, assumed a variety of autophagic structures, expanded, and ultimately collapsed and disappeared. Vesicles and electron-dense amorphous materials were released inside the thickened walls of cells undergoing PCD, and those vesicles and materials reaching the pollen tube after passing through the extracellular matrix were taken into the tube by endocytosis. These results show that in PCD of nucellar cells, intracellular materials are degraded in amyloplasts and vacuoles, and some of the degraded material is supplied to the pollen tube by vesicular transport to support tube growth. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Gymnosperm; Nucellus; Pinus densiflora; Pollen tube; Programmed cell death,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953166763

Anther dehiscence correlated with increase in vapour pressure deficit in the morning.

Recent laboratory-level studies have revealed that herbicides at lower-than-recommended rates can result in rapid herbicide resistance evolution in rigid ryegrass populations. However, crop-field-level studies have until now been lacking. In this study, we examined the impact of low rates of diclofop on the evolution of herbicide resistance in a herbicide-susceptible rigid ryegrass population grown either in a field wheat crop or in potted plants maintained in the field. Subsequent dose-response profiles indicated rapid evolution of diclofop resistance in the selected rigid ryegrass lines from both the crop-field and field pot studies. In addition, there was moderate level of resistance in the selected lines against other tested herbicides to which the population has never been exposed. This resistance evolution was possible because low rates of diclofop allowed substantial rigid ryegrass survivors due to the potential in this cross-pollinated species to accumulate all minor herbicide resistance traits present in the population.

The local insect composition may be as important as the local floral composition for bumblebees' foraging behaviour. However, little is known about how the local abundance of insects affects the foraging patterns of individuals. 2. Using field observations, we studied the relationships between the local density of previous and simultaneous foragers and the local foraging behaviour of Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lucorum/B. terrestris and Bombus lapidarius while pollinating Centaurea jacea. 3. The number of bumblebees foraging in the plots was positively related to the number of new individuals arriving at these plots. The number of inflorescences contacted and the duration of visits were negatively related to the number of simultaneous foragers, but only in B. lucorum/B. terrestris. The effects of previous foragers on the behaviour of other bumblebees were species-specific and variable in their direction. Such contrasting effects can be explained in terms of bumblebee species' abundances and functional similarity. In some cases, the effect of previous foragers increased with Centaurea density. 4. The local abundance of previous and simultaneous foragers affected the foraging behaviour of particular bumblebee individuals in complex ways. Future studies on local foraging behaviour might benefit from including the abundance of co-foragers. © 2011 The Authors.

We have developed a culture model that enabled investigation of the relationship between embryogenesis and the expression of various ZmSERK genes at different developmental stages and following treatment with hormones. The results indicate that auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) enhanced transcription activity of ZmSERK and promoted somatic embryogenesis. The cytokinin 6-benzyladenine (BA) inhibited embryogenesis and reduced the expression of ZmSERK1 and ZmSERK2, but it significantly increased the expression of ZmSERK3. The application of 2, 4-D and BA promoted the transcription of ZmSERK3 and inhibited that of ZmSERK1 and ZmSERK2, suggesting a fine regulation of embryogenesis by ZmSERK. The immature embryo at 12 and 15 days after pollination (DAP) showed the highest competence for embryogenesis and displayed the strongest ZmSERK gene expression, respectively. Based on these observations, we conclude that the expression profiles of ZmSERKs are closely related to hormone signaling and the developmental stages of the embryo during embryogenesis. ZmSERK1 and ZmSERK2 appear to play an important role in maintaining embryogenesis, while ZmSERK3 appears to have a dual role in embryogenesis by modulating its expression level. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cytokinin; Developmental stage; SERK; Somatic embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952698288

The studies to date have focused on the most modern samples only, and therefore the full potential of bat guano as an archive for fossil pollen analysis remains unknown. In this paper we report the results of pollen analysis on an 88-cm vertical profile of fossil bat guano from Round Spring Cavern, Missouri. Four AMS radiocarbon dates were in sequence and showed that the guano pile was active between 8155 and approximately 550 cal. yr BP. Pollen is well preserved throughout the profile, with most samples containing less than 10% indeterminable pollen. Wind-pollinated taxa are better represented than insect-pollinated taxa, and pollen concentrations range from 842 to 371660grainscm-3. As expected, the dominant vegetation types represented by the pollen assemblage are oak and pine, in accordance with the region's oak-hickory-pine forest. However, there are discrepancies between the guano pollen record and the results of a lake pollen study conducted in southern Missouri. We propose several possible factors that may be influencing the guano pollen record and provide direction for further investigation into the palaeoecological potential of bat guano. © 2010 The Authors.

Plants of the unpigmented line EK-A1 that had been self-pollinated for three generations (S3) were crossed with plants of the wild-type line EK-12 using hand emasculation and pollination. F1 plants showed an intermediate phenotype, characterised by a greenish stem compared with a yellow stem in EK-A1 plants and bluish-violet stem in EK-12 plants. F2 plants segregated in a 1:2:1 (bluish-violet: greenish: yellow) ratio, suggesting that plant pigmentation in O. cumana is controlled by a partially dominant allele at a single locus. Monogenic inheritance was confirmed in the F3 plant generation, which also revealed that the lack of pigmentation has no effect on O. cumana parasitism. This study demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of using hybridisation techniques for developing segregating populations in this species. Because of its simple mode of inheritance, the unpigmented plant trait may have a particular use as a morphological marker in basic and applied studies on O. cumana. © 2010 The Authors.

Our experiment assessed the impact of five different site preparation treatments on the composition, diversity, ecological traits (life-form, pollination mode, leaf morphology, seed dispersal mode), indicator values (shade tolerance, nutrients demand) of the understory vegetation in a mature thinned Pinus halepensis stand in southern France. The treatments-chopping, chopping followed by scarification in one or two directions, prescribed burning, control-were replicated four times and applied on a total of 40 plots. Vegetation relevés were performed on each plot in the first, second and fourth year following treatment applications. Plant diversity, measured by the species richness or Shannon's index, increased in the non-control treatment plots in the first year but then decreased through time. Vegetation composition differed between treatments, with the chopping treatment exhibiting composition and ecological trait values more comparable to those of control plots than the other treatments. The burning and scarification treatments led to higher abundance of therophytes, plants with malacophyllous leaves and insect-pollinated plants, and shade-intolerant and nutrient-demanding species. However, these changes were transient in time, the shade-intolerant species remained abundant but the ruderal species decreased while the ligneous species increased indicating a gradual return to a forest vegetation composition. For the Mediterranean area, most of the findings were similar to those in temperate forests subjected to the same site preparation treatments. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Functional traits; Mediterranean forest; Pinus halepensis; Plant diversity; Sustainable management,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952814436

Morphological data exhibited the most significant differences in invasive C. aff. acinaciformis that forms a new phenotypic variant. Unexpected chromosomal restructuring has been highlighted for both taxa in Provence, with in particular a clear decrease in asymmetry, an increase in the intraspecific variability, and an interspecific convergence of karyotypes.

Many Shorea species share common pollinators, and earlier studies suggested occurrence of interspecific hybridization and introgression. Here, we show morphological and molecular evidence of hybridization between Shorea species. In the census of all the trees of Shorea curtisii, Shorea leprosula, and Shorea parvifolia (&gt;30 cm dbh) within the 164-ha area of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve in Singapore, we found 21 morphologically recognizable hybrid individuals. All of the putative hybrids could be distinguished obviously from the parental species on the basis of vegetative characters. Population genetic analysis of DNA sequences of two nuclear (GapC and PgiC) and chloroplast (trnL-trnF) regions demonstrated that each of the three species had several species-specific mutations. The nuclear sequences of the putative hybrids were heterozygote at all the species-specific sites between two parental species. Hybrid between S. curtisii and S. leprosula was found most, while S. curtisii × S. parvifolia and S. leprosula × S. parvifolia hybrids were also found. Almost no shared polymorphism between populations of the parental species suggests rarity of introgression.

In the present study, 96 genotypes comprising 92 accessions of the US peanut minicore collection, a component line of the tetraploid variety Florunner, diploid progenitors A. duranensis (AA) and A. ipaënsis (BB), and synthetic amphidiploid accession TxAG-6 were investigated with 392 simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker bands amplified using 32 highly-polymorphic SSR primer pairs. Both distance- and model-based (Bayesian) cluster analysis revealed the presence of structured diversity. In general, the wild-species accessions and the synthetic amphidiploid grouped separately from most minicore accessions except for COC155, and were eliminated from most subsequent analyses. UPGMA analysis divided the population into four subgroups, two major subgroups representing subspecies fastigiata and hypogaea, a third group containing individuals from each subspecies or possibly of mixed ancestry, and a fourth group, either consisting of COC155 alone if wild species were excluded, or of COC155, the diploid species, and the synthetic amphidiploid. Model-based clustering identified four subgroups- one each for fastigiata and hypogaea subspecies, a third consisting of individuals of both subspecies or of mixed ancestry predominantly from Africa or Asia, and a fourth group, consisting of individuals predominantly of var fastigiata,peruviana, and aequatoriana accessions from South America, including COC155. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed statistically-significant (P &lt; 0.0001) genetic variance of 16.87% among subgroups. A total of 4.85% of SSR marker pairs revealed significant LD (at r2 ? 0.1). Of the syntenic marker pairs separated by distances &lt; 10 cM, 11-20 cM, 21-50 cM, and &gt; 50 cM, 19.33, 5.19, 6.25 and 5.29% of marker pairs were found in strong LD (P ? 0.01), in accord with LD extending to great distances in self pollinated crops. A threshold value of r2 0.035 was found to distinguish mean r2 values of linkage distance groups statistically from the mean r2 values of unlinked markers; LD was found to extend to 10 cM over the entire minicore collection by this criterion. However, there were large differences in r2 values among marker pairs even among tightly-linked markers. The implications of these findings with regard to the possibility of using association mapping for detection of genome-wide SSR marker-phenotype association are discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Germplasm; Linkage disequilibrium; Peanut; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955133415

In this study, (1) we examined the potential effects of long-term selection and the capacity to respond to future changes in selective pressures in three populations of cork oak (Quercus suber L.). For this purpose, we evaluated the response to dry conditions of 45 open-pollinated trees originating from populations in Morocco, Portugal, and Spain. Growth, leaf size, specific leaf area (SLA), carbon isotope discrimination (?13C), leaf nitrogen content (Nmass), and total chlorophyll content (Chlmass) were measured in 9-year-old plants. (2) We also investigated the relationships between functional traits and aboveground growth by regression models. Plants presenting larger and more sclerophyllous leaves (low SLA and high leaf thickness) exhibited higher growths, with results suggesting that these traits are subjected to divergent selection in this species. Heritability estimates were moderately high for ?13C (0.43 ± 0.25-0.83 ± 0.31) and stem diameter (0.40 ± 0.15-0.71 ± 0.28) for the tree populations. For the rest of the traits (except for annual growth), heritability values varied among populations, particularly for height, leaf size, leaf thickness, and Nmass. Our results suggest that natural selection has led to local adaptations and has also affected the genetic variance intrapopulation in these cork oak populations, although studies with a higher number of populations should be carried out across different years. Additionally, the absence of significant genetic correlations and the fact that correlated traits did not undergo opposing selection provided little evidence for constraints on evolution caused by genetic correlations. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Adaptation; Cork oak; Genetic correlation; Heritability; Selection; Water use efficiency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952987945

In order to discover the mechanism of low seed production, two cytological experiments were carried out to investigate ovule numbers per floret and ovule fertility among nine different alfalfa varieties. Results showed that there was significant difference in ovule numbers per floret among the nine alfalfa varieties (P<0.05), and the number of ovules per floret ranged from 7 to 13. The highest ovule number was Huangyangzhen while the lowest one was Ladak. Results also showed that there was significant difference in ovule fertility among different alfalfa varieties (P<0.05), and the average percentage of ovule sterility was 34.90%. The highest percentage of ovule sterility was observed in Russia with 49.07%, while the lowest percentage sterility was 25.20% in Zhungeer. Alfalfa seed set under artificial-pollination showed a significantly linear correlation with ovules per floret (P<0.05) but no significant correlation under self-pollination treatments. The results showed that the fertile ovules per pistil accounted for 51-75% with total ovules per pistil, but the percentages of actual seed yields with potential seed yields of the nine varieties were only 2.49-6.06%, which suggested that ovule sterility maybe just one of the limiting factors for alfalfa seed production. Our results indicated that female fertility of alfalfa was remained in the nature reproductive ability, which was probably due to the breeding selection program of alfalfa that was mainly focused on yield or quality, but seldom on seed production.",Fertility; Floret; Medicago sativa L.; Seed production; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955961152

For this purpose, observations were made on the effect of drought stress, applied in a controlled environment from the 5th to the 9th day after pollination, on the kernel morphology, starch content and grain yield of the drought-sensitive Cappelle Desprez and drought-tolerant Plainsman V winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties. As a consequence of water withdrawal, there was a decrease in the size of the embryos and the number of A-type starch granules deposited in the endosperm, while the development of aleurone cells and the degradation of the cell layers surrounding the ovule were significantly accelerated in both genotypes. In addition, the number of B-type starch granules per cell was significantly reduced. Drought stress affected the rate of grain filling shortened the grain-filling and ripening period and severely reduced the yield. With respect to the recovery of vegetative tissues, seed set and yield, the drought-tolerant Plainsman V responded significantly better to drought stress than Cappelle Desprez. The reduction in the size of the mature embryos was significantly greater in the sensitive genotype. Compared to Plainsman V, the endosperm cells of Cappelle Desprez accumulated significantly fewer B-type starch granules. In stressed kernels of the tolerant genotype, the accumulation of protein bodies occurred significantly earlier than in the sensitive variety. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Drought stress; Embryo; Endosperm; Protein bodies; Starch granules; Wheat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952702296

Is establishment success determined by the regional pool, environmental filters or historical events? Location: Highway roadcuts and embankments in central Spain (40°29'N, 03°34'W). Methods: Species composition was recorded annually in 45 plots distributed on steep slopes with newly exposed surfaces (roadcuts) or newly built topsoiled substrates (embankments), for 4 years following hydroseeding with standard or native seed mixture. Frequency of appearance and local colonization and extinction rates of individual species were clustered in establishment success groups. We examined the correspondence between descriptive plant traits and species performance on both roadslope types. Results: Roadslope species richness showed a sustained increase over time, although at consistently lower levels and rates on the more productive embankments. Sixty per cent of the colonization events involved species from the surrounding vegetation. Hydroseeded species persisted through time, but did not modify community composition or dynamics. A higher establishment success rate was found in wind-pollinated species with large seeds and in exotic species. Those species growing on embankments showed an equal or higher establishment success rate on roadcuts and, conversely, species from roadcuts exhibited an equal or lower success rate on embankments. Conclusions: At the initial stages of community assemblage on unproductive newly created areas, species richness was shaped by the regional species pool. Communities on less harsh topsoiled embankments were subjected, however, to the filtering effect of competitive exclusion. In a reclamation context, efforts to increase site productivity may have detrimental consequences for in situ conservation of local diversity. © 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.",Competitive exclusion; Dispersal; Ecological restoration; Embankment; Hydroseeding; Mediterranean; Plant traits; Regional species pool; Roadcut; Stress-productivity gradient; Topsoil,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952140390

Due to global climate changes and limitations of agricultural irrigation water, varieties with drought tolerance are taken into consideration in order to avoid yield losses due to drought. In this study, drought tolerance of 76 S1 lines (full-sib families) that had been extracted from a genetically broad base multigerm sugar beet open pollinated population, were examined. Test crosses were made between the lines as pollinators and a cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) single cross. The consequent hybrids along with checks were evaluated during 2007 and 23 more tolerant hybrids during 2008, in two adjacent experiments under drought stress and non-stress conditions. Drought tolerance indices calculated based on sugar yield, such as mean productivity (MP), geometric mean productivity (GMP) and stress tolerance index (STI) were used to assess hybrids responses to drought. The results showed significant genetic differences for root yield and sugar yield under both conditions. Drought tolerance indices displayed significant genetic variability for sugar yield among the hybrids. Many hybrids were drought tolerant as compared with the original base population as indicated by their high STI. The estimates of heritability for sugar yield in stress and non-stress conditions were much close to each other (0.31 and 0.34, respectively). Whereas, for root yield the heritability estimate in stress condition (0.46) was relatively higher than that in non-stress condition (0.34). Significant differences were observed among the selected hybrids for root yield and sugar yield, indicating genotypic variability for pollinator lines derived from the population. There were no significant differences for sugar content. For increasing the drought tolerance potential in a breeding population and developing drought-tolerant varieties by male parent, the drought-tolerant lines could be used. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Drought tolerance; Heritability; Line; Sugar beet; Variability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952195178

We investigated the responses of two spiders to phytochemical cues that they potentially experience while hunting on leaves or flowers, and how these cues could influence their decisions where to forage. We compared the behavior of two sit-and-wait predators, Pisaura mirabilis and Misumena vatia, which hunt predominantly in the vegetation or on flowers, respectively. In choice tests, P. mirabilis frequently preferred leaves and leaf extracts to flowers and floral extracts and avoided substrates treated with the common floral scents ?-caryophyllene and nerolidol (sesquiterpenes) in natural concentrations. In contrast, M. vatia did not show any preferences for any of the substrates and treatments offered. The lack of responses by M. vatia contrasts with earlier studies on another crab spider species (Thomisus spectabilis) that used phytochemical cues as a guide to rewarding flowers.

Thus, this research was carried out to evaluate the production and quality of tomato cultivars under organic management, in this region. The treatments consisted of four open pollination tomato cultivars (Chadwick Cherry, Pitanga vermelha, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Kada) and five hybrid cultivars (Marguerita, Nicolas, Ellen, Magestade and Dominador). The experimental design was of randomized blocks with three replications. The experiment was carried out using organic fertilization in the initial preparation of the area, compost and rock phosphate and sprays with Bordeaux mixture, neem oil and fertilizer. The marketable yield varied from 12.3 t ha -1 to 23.9 t ha -1. The hybrid Marguerita presented higher marketable production (23.9 t ha -1). The cultivars Chadwick Cherry and Pitanga Vermelha reached similar production as most cultivars and larger proportions of marketable and giant fruits, and therefore, better market quality. All the cultivars presented low potassium and manganese levels in foliar tissue suggesting an evaluation after various organic manuring cycles and better nutrition conditions are necessary to permit the comparison of the performance of cultivars in this system.",Green manure; Lycopersicon esculentum; Organic cropping,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961034093

K. Koch] cultivars. The present study examines efficacy of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG; formulated as ReTain.; Valent BioSciences, Libertyville, IL), a natural ethylene inhibitor, for increasing nutmeat yield in a commercial 'Desirable' pecan orchard over a 2-year period. The 30-ha experiment consisted of two treatments (nontreated versus ReTain) in the first year, an ""off"" year in the orchard's alternate bearing cycle. The second year's study, an ""on"" year, consisted of four treatments (i.e., ""08 nontreated + 09 nontreated,"" ""08ReTain + 09 nontreated,"" ""08 nontreated + 09 ReTain,"" and ""08ReTain + 09 ReTain""). AVG, as ReTain [132 mg.L-1 a.i. (11.7 oz/acre)], was applied as two post-pollination canopy sprays (937 L.ha-1) 2 weeks apart in both years. During the ""off"" year, ReTain increased nut yield parameters with ReTain increasing kernel yield by 36% (704 kg.ha-1 versus 516 kg.ha-1) over that of nontreated trees. In the subsequent ""on"" crop year, the trees exhibiting a ReTainassociated previous year yield increase of ?36% exhibited a reduction in yield of ?25%, thus largely negating the previous season's yield increase over a 2-year alternate bearing cycle. Additionally, ReTain-treated trees during the ""on"" year failed to exhibit an increase in yield parameters over that of the nontreated control. As a result of a lag effect on subsequent year yield parameters, ReTain offers potential as a crop-load management tool for 'Desirable' orchards in ""off"" years such as a year of relatively high nutmeat price followed by a year of relatively low price. There appears to be no positive effect on yield when used in a heavy crop-load ""on"" year of an alternate bearing cycle. Thus, ReTain might have benefit for stabilizing alternate bearing in 'Desirable' pecan orchards. Kernel quality (defined as percentage of nut weight as kernel) of individual nuts from ""on"" year trees was not as sensitive to units of yield increase as for individual nuts of ""off"" year trees, thus implying that the rate of assimilate partitioning to individual reproductive structures in ""off""-year trees is not as great as that in ""on""-year trees.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955365951

To evaluate wheat response to yellow rust, 64 doubled haploid lines, two resistant control cultivars (parsi, sivand, morvarid) and a susceptible control cultivar (bolani), were tested as seedling in greenhouse conditions. Resistance was measured by infection type (I.T), latent period (L.P), postule size (P.S), postule density (P.D). In this study was used from 1 race of yellow rust: 6E150A+. Analysis of variance showed significant differences among of these genotypes, for all traits. Cluster analysis on the basis of four traits classified all the lines into two major groups; resistant lines and susceptible lines.

We experimentally examined the ecological mechanism driving the decline of this geophyte. Ten plot-pairs were established, half we fenced as grazing exclosures and half were grazed by beef cattle. Grazing clearly reduced herbaceous biomass, increased relative solar photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) at ground level, but had almost no effect on soil properties. Grazing did not affect the number of flowers and young fruits produced by A. coronaria, nor the percentage fruit-set at the plot scale, indicating no effect on flowering, pollination, or on resource allocation to reproduction. Five years after grazing exclusion, Anemone seedling and adult plant densities were higher in grazed than in ungrazed plots. We propose a model explaining our results that can be applied also to other similar ecosystems: excluding grazing increased biomass and height of the herbaceous community and reduced relative PAR at ground level. Consequently, seedling, adult plant and flowering Anemone plant densities were lower in ungrazed plots.

These effects can be exacerbated where range-edge populations are fragmented. The main aim of the present study was to assess the levels of genetic diversity in remnant populations of Hypopitys monotropa (syn. Monotropa hypopitys; yellow birds nest) at the edge of the species European range in Northern Ireland, since these remnant populations are small and highly fragmented. Methods: Every plant found through surveys of 21 extant populations was genotyped for eight microsatellite loci to estimate levels and patterns of genetic diversity and clonality. Key Results: Levels of genetic diversity were relatively high in the populations studied, and the incidence of clonal reproduction was generally low, with a mean of only 14·45% of clonal individuals. Clones were small and highly spatially structured. Levels of inbreeding, however, were high. Conclusions: The observed low levels of clonality suggest that the majority of genets in the populations of H. monotropa studied are fertile and that reproduction is predominantly sexual. As the species is highly self-compatible, it is likely that the high levels of inbreeding observed in the populations in the present study are the result of self-pollination, particularly given the small numbers of individuals in most of the patches. Given this extent of inbreeding, further genetic monitoring would be advisable to ensure that genetic diversity is maintained. © The Author 2011.",Clonality; conservation; distribution range; fragmentation; Hypopitys monotropa; inbreeding; Monotropoideae; Pyrolaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951673179

In the present work, the causes of poor natural fruit-set in Crateva adansonii DC. were investigated. Floral biology, the role of wind and insects in pollination and the breeding system of the species were studied in two natural populations for three consecutive seasons (200608). The flowers exhibited traits conducive to a mixture of wind and insect pollination (ambophily). Although a variety of insects visited the flowers, they were ineffective in pollinating. Nevertheless, active foraging by the honeybees (Apis dorsata, A. mellifera and A. cerana indica) facilitated enhanced pollen dispersal in the air and resulted in indirect pollination by wind. Airborne pollen grains pollinated the plants only up to 10m. Fruit-set from open pollination was comparable to wind-pollinated flowers. Supplemental pollination treatments established the occurrence of strong self-incompatibility (SI) (index of SI?0.14). Spontaneous autogamy was prevented by pronounced herkogamy. Low natural fecundity in C. adansonii is due to pollination failure, pollen limitation (pollen limitation index?0.98) and the sparse distribution of the conspecifics; partial SI may partly ensure reproductive assurance through geitonogamy. In the absence of a pollinator wind appears to act as a secondary mode of pollination. © 2011 CSIRO.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953117040

Flowers' gender nectar production rates and their vertical distribution were recorded in two populations (northern and central Israel) over 3 years. Female-phase flowers produced significantly more nectar than male-phase flowers and were more abundant at the inflorescences' base. Thus, nectar availability gradually decreases along inflorescences. Female-biased nectar production can benefit plants by increasing pollinator visits to female-phase flowers, enhancing pollination success when pollen is scarce. In congruence with this hypothesis, the following observations suggest that pollen in S. hierosolymitana may be in short supply: (1) freshly dehisced anthers contained 40% of sterile pollen; (2) pollen counts on female-phase stigmas were low (mean±s.e. 11.6±1.56); and (3) counts of germinated pollen tubes at the pistils' base were even lower (5.02±0.54). The nectar gradient along the inflorescence may also be adaptively beneficial in other aspects. Foraging insects that follow this gradient are expected to move from female-phase flowers near the inflorescences' base, to male-phase flowers closer to the top.

This study aimed to identify when self-incompatibility occurs in A. sellowiana flowers submitted to self-pollinations. Pollinations were made using nine known self-incompatible accessions in several treatments including manual cross-pollination, manual self-pollination, no pollination and natural pollination. Flowers were pollinated and pistils collected at times ranging from 1 to 30 days after pollination (DAP). In both cross- and self-pollinations the fertilisation occurred from 18 DAP and the zygote was visualised at 24 and 26 DAP, respectively. The abscission of the self-pollinated flowers increased from 26 DAP onwards, when significant differences (P<0.05) were found for the percentage of abscission among self-pollinated and cross-pollinated flowers. At 30 DAP, 72% of self-pollinated flowers were abscised. The size of ovules and ovaries of self-pollinated flowers showed no significant difference from those of non-pollinated flowers throughout 30 DAP, while those from cross-pollinated flowers were significantly larger (P<0.05) than the other treatments from 22 and 24 DAP, respectively. After 40 DAP, there was no fruit development in self-pollination and non-pollination treatments. Our study brings greater clarity to the mechanism of self-incompatibility in A. sellowiana, indicating late-acting self-incompatibility occurring through the rejection/abscission of self-pollinated flowers precisely after syngamy and zygote formation. © CSIRO 2011.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953082801

The present work examined the direct and indirect impacts caused by nectarrobbing on the reproductive success of Sparattosperma leucanthum. Different manipulations of the flowers were tested to determine if fruit production was influenced by the perforations made in the floral tissues (direct damage), and if there were changes in visitation frequencies or in the behaviors of effective pollinators (indirect damage). Perforations made by nectar robbers did not lower the reproductive success of the plant species studied. The bee Trigona spinipes was the most frequent visitor and caused the largest perforations in the calyx and corolla of S. leucanthum. Additionally, we noted the occurrence of pollen theft by this same bee in flowers that had been protected against nectar-robbing. These results suggest that if S. leucanthum had developed a mechanism of resistance to robbery by T. spinipes it would probably have experienced even lower pollination levels as a result of reductions in the quantities of pollen available for transfer by effective pollinators. We were not able to evaluate if nectar depletion through robbery modified the behavior of the effective pollinators (bumblebees of the genus Bombus).",Bees; Effective pollinator; Floral damage; Resource larceny; Trigona spinipes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952943445

Molecular population genetics studies of polyploid organisms have been difficult because of problems in sequencing multiple-copy nuclear genes using Sanger sequencing. This paper describes a method for sequencing a barcoded mixture of targeted gene regions using next-generation sequencing methods to overcome these problems.Results: Using 64 3-bp barcodes, we successfully sequenced three chloroplast and two nuclear gene regions (each of which contained two gene copies with up to two alleles per individual) in a total of 60 individuals across 11 species of Australian Poa grasses. This method had high replicability, a low sequencing error rate (after appropriate quality control) and a low rate of missing data. Eighty-eight percent of the 320 gene/individual combinations produced sequence reads, and >80% of individuals produced sufficient reads to detect all four possible nuclear alleles of the homeologous nuclear loci with 95% probability.We applied this method to a group of sympatric Australian alpine Poa species, which we discovered to share an allopolyploid ancestor with a group of American Poa species. All markers revealed extensive allele sharing among the Australian species and so we recommend that the current taxonomy be re-examined. We also detected hypermutation in the trnH-psbA marker, suggesting it should not be used as a land plant barcode region. Some markers indicated differentiation between Tasmanian and mainland samples. Significant positive spatial genetic structure was detected at <100 km with chloroplast but not nuclear markers, which may be a result of restricted seed flow and long-distance pollen flow in this wind-pollinated group.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that 454 sequencing of barcoded amplicon mixtures can be used to reliably sample all alleles of homeologous loci in polyploid species and successfully investigate phylogenetic relationships among species, as well as to investigate phylogeographic hypotheses. This next-generation sequencing method is more affordable than and at least as reliable as bacterial cloning. It could be applied to any experiment involving sequencing of amplicon mixtures. © 2011 Griffin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953122203

Extrafloral nectaries are nectar-secreting glands not directly related with pollination and which attract diverse nectarivorous arthropods but most especially ants. During two years we investigated if the extrafloral nectaries of Laguncularia racemosa were morphologically variable and if the production of nectar was seasonal. Branches with five pairs of leaves of L. racemosa each were collected out in the mangrove of River Guaratuba (Bertioga, SP, Brazil; 23°45?12?S; 45°53?45?W) in five samplings from May 2008 to April 2010. Samples received only diffuse light and were analyzed 24 h after collection, when the presence or not of liquid in all five pairs of leaves per branch was recorded. The extrafloral nectaries near apical leaves produced nectar more frequently compared to other leaf pairs. There was a sharp decrease in the frequency of extrafloral nectar production from autumn to summer. The visitation of ants was recorded and could explain the observed seasonality of nectar production by Extrafloral nectaries because the fall is the period of flight dispersal of several herbivorous insects. This work demonstrated clearly that Extrafloral nectaries in L. racemosa are functional nectar-secreting structures that are able to attract nectarivorous insects such as ants and flies. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Extrafloral nectar; Laguncularia racemosa; Seasonality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952642148

This study aims to increase our understanding of the individual species traits that contribute to the generation of FSGS in the Dipteropcarpaceae, which is an ecologically and economically important family of tropical trees that dominate lowland forests in Southeast Asia. We examined FSGS in three co-occurring dipterocarp species at a single site in Borneo. Shorea xanthophylla, Parashorea tomentella and Dipterocarpus grandiflorus share limited seed dispersal but differ markedly in flower size, pollinator body size and pollen dispersal. Here we explore the role of pollen dispersal limitation in shaping FSGS in these three species. Using six microsatellite loci, we explore patterns of FSGS and landscape genetic structure and compare these across species. Significant FSGS was observed in S. xanthophylla and P. tomentella, both of which are known to have relatively limited pollen dispersal, but no clear signal of FSGS was observed in D. grandiflorus. Significantly greater FSGS was observed in P. tomentella (Sp= 0.012) than S. xanthophylla (Sp= 0.007) despite greater pollen dispersal in P. tomentella. Bayesian clustering analysis revealed significant structure in P. tomentella at the scale of the forest reserve (4000. ha). We discuss the alternative explanations for the observed patterns of FSGS emphasising the complexity of the mechanisms that can generate FSGS in long-lived trees. The extent of species-specific pollen dispersal is one factor that can contribute to differences in FSGS across species, but is not the only determinant. The observed patterns of FSGS and landscape scale genetic structure in S. xanthophylla and P. tomentella illustrate the potential of gap regeneration to counter act pollen dispersal and contribute to increased aggregation of related individuals (FSGS). © 2010 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.",Dipterocarpaceae; Flower size; Microsatellites; Pollen dispersal; Pollinator size; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952619575

Plant-insect interactions in particular might become disrupted due to species-specific responses of plants and insects towards these changes. We investigated how environmental change affects flower visitation and pollination with a field study simulating pollinator habitat loss (distance to semi-natural habitat), phenological shift (anticipated flowering) and environmentally induced growth (enhanced flower height). We established 16 habitat islands of potted plants of Sinapis arvensis L., recorded all flower visitors (mainly bees, flies and pollen beetles) and quantified the seed set. Experimentally elevated flowers were less often visited by flies, while visitation by bees was not affected. Further, plants distant from calcareous grassland were less often visited by bees but visitation by flies did not decrease. Anticipated flowering reduced the number of both pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles and increased the reproductive success (seeds per plant) of S. arvensis, showing that the loss of mutualists was compensated by an escape from antagonists. During the natural flowering period more seeds were produced close to grasslands, especially by plants of natural height, presumably due to the higher bee visitation rate. However, seed production appeared to be relatively tolerant to multiple environmental changes due to complementary patterns among the different flower visitor guilds. Our results suggest complex interactions of environmental change with responses of mutualists and antagonists, making general predictions difficult. © 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.",Bees; Flies; Functional complementarity; Global change; Herbivory; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952617662

In addition, the mating relations of the species are determined by its capacity for clonal reproduction in combination with its self-incompatibility system and by insect pollination. Common paternity analyses basically take the spatial distances between mates into account, but fail to incorporate structural factors in addition to distance such as the patchiness of individuals. We determined mating relations via mating preferences (proportion of matings realized within a group divided by the proportion of potential matings within that group) in various sizes and forms of clusters. The results did not support the common view that mating frequencies more or less steadily decline with increasing spatial distance between mating partners. In fact, mating took place preferentially among members of intermediate sized clusters. However, preference patterns varied distinctly among individual seed trees depending on the shape of neighboring tree clusters and (possibly) attractiveness to pollinators. Distinct preferences for stand-external pollen parents were observed for seed trees located at the border of the higher density area of the stand with stand-external matings generally exceeding stand-internal matings. © 2011 Perspectives in Plant Ecology, Evolution and Systematics.",Mating preferences; Paternity analysis; Spatial distribution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952631353

Because reproductive success could be influenced by the photosynthetic activity of major source leaves, we hypothesized that increased temperatures under field conditions would limit fertilization by inhibiting diurnal pollen tube growth through the style and decreasing subtending leaf photosynthesis. To address this hypothesis, G. hirsutum seeds were sown on different dates to obtain flowers exposed to contrasting ambient temperatures while at the same developmental stage (node 8 above the cotyledons). Collection and measurement were conducted at 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, and 18:00h on August 4 (34.6°C maximum air temperature) and 14, 2009 (29.9°C maximum air temperature). Microclimate measurements included photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity, and air temperature. Pistil measurements included pistil surface temperature, pollen germination, pollen tube growth through the style, fertilization efficiency, fertilized ovule number, and total number of ovules per ovary. Subtending leaf measurements included leaf temperature, photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance. Under high temperatures the first measurable pollen tube growth through the style was observed earlier in the day (12:00h) than under cooler conditions (15:00h). Also, high temperature resulted in slower pollen tube growth through the style (2.05mmh-1) relative to cooler conditions (3.35mmh-1), but there were no differences in fertilization efficiency, number of fertilized ovules, or ovule number. There was no effect of sampling date on diurnal photosynthetic patterns, where the maximum photosynthetic rate was observed at 12:00h on both dates. It is concluded that, of the measured physiological and reproductive processes, pollen tube growth rate showed the greatest sensitivity to high temperature under field conditions. © 2010.",Fertilization; Gossypium hirsutum; Heat stress; Pollen germination; Pollen tube growth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251595858

Degree distributions have been studied in a range of ecological networks, including both mutualistic bipartite networks of plants and pollinators or seed dispersers and antagonistic bipartite networks of plants and their consumers. The shape of a degree distribution, for example whether it follows an exponential or power-law form, is typically taken to be indicative of the processes structuring the network. The skewed degree distributions of bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic networks are usually assumed to show that ecological or co-evolutionary processes constrain the relative numbers of specialists and generalists in the network. I show that a simple null model based on the principle of maximum entropy cannot be rejected as a model for the degree distributions in most of the 115 bipartite ecological networks tested here. The model requires knowledge of the number of nodes and links in the network, but needs no other ecological information. The model cannot be rejected for 159 (69%) of the 230 degree distributions of the 115 networks tested. It performed equally well on the plant and animal degree distributions, and cannot be rejected for 81 (70%) of the 115 plant distributions and 78 (68%) of the animal distributions. There are consistent differences between the degree distributions of mutualistic and antagonistic networks, suggesting that different processes are constraining these two classes of networks. Fit to the MaxEnt null model is consistently poor among the largest mutualistic networks. Potential ecological and methodological explanations for deviations from the model suggest that spatial and temporal heterogeneity are important drivers of the structure of these large networks. © 2011 Richard J.

Unfortunately, what we know about seed dispersal networks is based only on bird-fruit interactions. Therefore, we aimed at filling part of this gap by investigating bat-fruit networks. It is known from population studies that: (i) some bat species depend more on fruits than others, and (ii) that some specialized frugivorous bats prefer particular plant genera. We tested whether those preferences affected the structure and robustness of the whole network and the functional roles of species. Nine bat-fruit datasets from the literature were analyzed and all networks showed lower complementary specialization (H2? = 0.37±0.10, mean ± SD) and similar nestedness (NODF = 0.56±0.12) than pollination networks. All networks were modular (M = 0.32±0.07), and had on average four cohesive subgroups (modules) of tightly connected bats and plants. The composition of those modules followed the genus-genus associations observed at population level (Artibeus-Ficus, Carollia-Piper, and Sturnira-Solanum), although a few of those plant genera were dispersed also by other bats. Bat-fruit networks showed high robustness to simulated cumulative removals of both bats (R = 0.55±0.10) and plants (R = 0.68±0.09). Primary frugivores interacted with a larger proportion of the plants available and also occupied more central positions; furthermore, their extinction caused larger changes in network structure. We conclude that bat-fruit networks are highly cohesive and robust mutualistic systems, in which redundancy is high within modules, although modules are complementary to each other. Dietary specialization seems to be an important structuring factor that affects the topology, the guild structure and functional roles in bat-fruit networks. © 2011 Mello et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952259807

Unobserved links are either missing or forbidden. Missing links exist, but require more sampling or alternative ways of detection to be verified. Forbidden links remain unobservable, irrespective of sampling effort. They are caused by linkage constraints. We studied one Arctic pollination network and two Mediterranean seed-dispersal networks. In the first, for example, we recorded flower-visit links for one full season, arranged data in an interaction matrix and got a connectance C of 15 per cent. Interaction accumulation curves documented our sampling of interactions through observation of visits to be robust. Then, we included data on pollen from the body surface of flower visitors as an additional link 'currency'. This resulted in 98 new links, missing from the visitation data. Thus, the combined visit-pollen matrix got an increased C of 20 per cent. For the three networks, C ranged from 20 to 52 per cent, and thus the percentage of unobserved links (100 - C) was 48 to 80 per cent; these were assumed forbidden because of linkage constraints and not missing because of under-sampling. Phenological uncoupling (i.e. non-overlapping phenophases between interacting mutualists) is one kind of constraint, and it explained 22 to 28 per cent of all possible, but unobserved links. Increasing phenophase overlap between species increased link probability, but extensive overlaps were required to achieve a high probability. Other kinds of constraint, such as size mismatch and accessibility limitations, are briefly addressed.

Here we present the first evidence that a slipper orchid, Cypripedium flavum, is pollinated by both bees and flies, i. e., bumblebees and blowflies. Artificial pollination experiments demonstrated that the flowers of C. flavum are self-compatible, but need pollen vectors for successful reproduction. Field observations detected 25 insects visiting the flowers, and 14 of these insects entered into the labellum of the flowers, but only female bumblebees, Bombus hypnorum, B. remotus, and the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria exited of the labellum with pollen smears of C. flavum. The floral functional morphology of C. flavum appears to be more suited to bumblebees than to blowflies. The bumblebees are more efficient pollinators of the orchid, but blowflies are more frequent visitors, so they pollinated more flowers despite being less efficient. © 2010 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Cypripedium; Floral syndrome; Pollination ecotype; Slipper orchid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952768172

However, little information is available on the presence and effects of PFOS in the terrestrial compartment. Therefore, we investigated in this project the risks for effects, bioaccumulation and potential mechanisms of activity of PFOS in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) that is an important worldwide pollinator in the terrestrial compartment of wildflowers and cultivated crops. The exposure to PFOS occurred orally via the drinking of treated sugar water in a wide range from 1 ?g/l up to 10 mg/l, containing environmentally relevant as well as high concentrations, and this was done with use of microcolonies of B. terrestris in the laboratory. A chronic toxicity assay demonstrated high bumblebee worker mortality (up to 100%) with an LC 50 of 1.01 mg/l (R 2 = 0.98). In addition, PFOS posed strong detrimental reproductive effects, and these concerted with a dramatic reduction in ovarian size. HPLC-MS demonstrated a bioaccumulation factor of 27.9 for PFOS in bumblebee workers fed with sugar water containing 100 ?g/l PFOS during 5 weeks (2184 ± 365 ng/g BW). Finally, potential mechanisms of activity were investigated to explain the significant impact of PFOS on survival and reproduction capacity of B. terrestris. Exposure of bumblebee workers to PFOS resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial electron transport activity (p = 0.035) and lipid amounts (p = 0.019), while the respective p-values were 0.58 and 0.12 for protein and glucose amounts. Hence, addition of PFOS to ecdysteroid responsive Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells resulted in a strong antagonistic action on the EcR-b.act.luc reporter construct, demonstrating that PFOS may exert its effects partially through an endocrine disrupting action via the insect molting hormone or ecdysteroid receptor. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Antagonistic activity; Bumblebee; Electron transport; Energy content; PFOS; Reproduction; Survival,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951676659

Clerodendrum molle, a widespread member of the Galápagos flora was submitted to pollination experiments, visitor observations, nectar sampling, pollen transfer studies, pollen-ovule ratio studies, and pollen measurements. Flowers set fruit and seed via open pollination, autonomous autogamy, facilitated autogamy, facilitated cross-pollination, diurnal pollination, and nocturnal pollination. Results indicate no significant difference in fruit set. Cross-pollinated flowers showed a significant increase in seed set over all treatments except facilitated autogamy. Nocturnal and diurnal fruit and seed set did not differ significantly. Nocturnal visitors included ants, spiders, hawk moths, and roaches whereas diurnal visitors included carpenter bees and ants. Galápagos members of C. molle exhibit incomplete protandry and set fruit via autonomous autogamy as a result of natural selection in an environment with few faithful pollinators. Overall low fruit and seed set are likely because of a combination of pollen and resource limitation, the latter exacerbated by nectar robbing. Studies of island angiosperms are crucial for complete understanding of the population dynamics of indigenous plants, which can assist conservation officials in protecting these species. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Clerodendrum molle; Galápagos Islands; Incomplete protandry; Nectar robbing; Nocturnal versus diurnal pollination; Pollen limitation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952041229

Although techniques to analyze plant-pollinator networks began to emerge a decade ago, the characterization of spatiotemporal variation of interactions is still in its infancy. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of spatial and temporal variation in plant-pollinator interactions is important for both basic and applied questions in community structure and function, the evolution of floral traits, and the development of optimal conservation strategies. Here we review observational, theoretical, and experimental studies of temporal and spatial variation in plant-pollinator interaction networks to establish a foundation for future studies to incorporate perspectives in spatiotemporal variation. Such perspectives are crucial given the rapid environmental changes associated with habitat loss, climate change, and biological invasions, which we discuss in this context. The inherent plasticity of plant-pollinator interactions and network structure suggests that many species should be able to persist by responding to environmental changes quickly, even though the identity of their mutualistic partners may change. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Community composition; Community dynamics; Connectance; Mutualism; Phenology; Pollination; Specialization-generalization continuum; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952771475

Floral morphology, especially spur length and rostellum structure, differs markedly among plants with different pollinators, while nectar volume, concentration, and sugar composition are fairly uniform across species.

Fig-pollinating wasps often have to fly long distances from their natal syconia to a receptive syconium and then must enter the narrow ostiole of the syconium to reproduce. Large wasps are expected to have a greater chance of reaching a receptive syconium. In this study, we tested this hypothesis and then examined whether the ostiole selectively prevented larger pollinators from entering the syconial cavity. In Xishuangbanna, China, Ceratosolen solmsi marchali Mayr (Hymenoptera: Agaonidae) pollinates the dioecious syconia of Ficus hispida L. (Moraceae). The body size of newly emerged wasps and wasps arriving at receptive syconia were compared. Wasps arriving at receptive syconia were significantly larger than newly emerged wasps. We also compared the size of wasps trapped in the ostiole with those in the cavity. Wasps trapped in the ostiole were significantly larger than those in the syconial cavity. Thus, in the case of F. hispida, large wasps were more likely to reach receptive syconia, but the ostiole limited maximum fig wasp size. This indicates that the ostiole, as a selective filter to pollinators, stabilizes pollinator size. Hence, it helps to maintain stability in the fig-fig pollinator mutualism. © 2011 The Authors.

Nevertheless, unequivocal evidence for a decline in pollination over time has remained elusive because it was not possible to determine historical pollination rates. Here we demonstrate a widely applicable method for reconstructing historical pollination rates, thus allowing comparison with contemporary rates from the same sites. We focused on the relationship between the oil-collecting bee Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae) and the guild of oil-secreting orchid species (Coryciinae) that depends on it for pollination. The guild is distributed across the highly transformed and fragmented lowlands of the Cape Region of South Africa. We show that rehydrated herbarium specimens of Pterygodium catholicum, the most abundant member of the guild, contain a record of past pollinator activity in the form of pollinarium removal rates. Analysis of a pollination time series showed a recent decline in pollination on Signal Hill, a small urban conservation area. The same herbaria contain historical species occurrence data. We analyzed this data and found that there has been a contemporaneous shift in orchid guild composition in urban areas due to the local extirpation of the non-clonal species, consistent with their greater dependence on seeds and pollination for population persistence. © 2011 The Authors.

We examined effects of invasive baby's breath (Gypsophila paniculata) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on floral visitors to federally threatened Pitcher's thistle (Cirsium pitcheri) in Lake Michigan dunes. In sweep net surveys, abundances of pollinator taxa were five times higher in invaded than in naturally invaderfree sites. However, plot-level G. paniculata removal treatments increased pollinator visits to C. pitcheri relative to invaded plots and restored visitation to levels found in naturally uninvaded plots. Invader removal also increased native plant species richness, which was positively correlated with pollinator visitation to C. pitcheri, suggesting an indirect effect on pollinators mediated through invader-altered plant composition. In temporary floral arrays, the rate of pollinator visitation to C. pitcheri was not affected by neighbor plant species identity. However, compared with native Monarda punctata, invasive C. maculosa attracted more total pollinators to the array but reduced the proportion of total visits that were to C. pitcheri and increased pollinator movements between plant species. While both G. paniculata and C. maculosa appear to act as magnet species by attracting more pollinators at the plot level, these invaders have the potential to reduce reproduction of C. pitcheri by decreasing pollinator visits and increasing interspecific pollen transfer. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",Cirsium pitcheri; Conservation; Gypsophila paniculata; Invasive; Pollination competition; Restoration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952730517

Many of these herbs are clonal, patchily distributed, and produce large floral displays of nectar-rich 1-d flowers to attract hummingbird pollinators that may transport pollen over long distances. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of clonality, cross-proximity, and patchy distribution on the reproduction of the hummingbird-pollinated Amazonian herb Heliconia metallica. We experimentally pollinated flowers within populations with self-pollen and with pollen of different diversity, crossed flowers between populations, and added supplemental pollen to ramets growing solitarily or in conspecific patches. Only flowers pollinated early in the morning produced seeds. Selfed flowers produced seeds, but seed number and mass were strongly reduced, suggesting partial sterility and inbreeding depression after selfing. Because of pollen competition, flowers produced more seeds after crosses with several than with single donor plants. Crosses between populations mostly resulted in lower seed production than those within populations, suggesting outbreeding depression. Ramets in patches produced fewer seeds than solitary ramets and were more pollen-limited, possibly due to geitonogamy and biparental inbreeding in patches. We conclude that high rates of geitonogamy due to clonality and pollen limitation due to the short receptivity of flowers and patchy distribution constrain the reproduction of this clonal herb. Even in unfragmented rain forests with highly mobile pollinators, outbreeding depression may be a widespread phenomenon in plant reproduction.

These processes can fundamentally disrupt the interactions between plants and pollinators and decrease reproductive success. This concerns especially self-incompatible, non-clonal species that depend on pollination for successful reproduction. In two rare and endangered heathland plant species, Genista anglica and G. pilosa, we examined pollination and reproduction in relation to population size. Eight populations of G. anglica and ten populations of G. pilosa were surveyed in the vicinity of Bremen, NW-Germany. We counted the visits of pollinators (honeybees, bumblebees, and other insects) and determined the reproductive output of the observed shoots. Contrary to our expectation to find increased pollinator visitation rates in larger populations of both Genista species, the number of flower-visiting insects was unrelated to the number of flowering shoots. Increasing shoot length had a positive and increasing temperature a negative impact on the number of visiting honeybees and bumblebees. Despite the general absence of population size effects on pollinator numbers, the number of fruits and seeds in G. anglica increased with increasing population size. Fruit and seed set in G. pilosa were negatively related to the number of 'other insects'. Our field observations showed that larger populations of both Genista species flowered earlier than smaller populations and much earlier than reported in the literature. Flowering in large populations therefore tends to coincide less well with pollinator abundance, and this may cause a disruption of the temporal coincidence between flowering phenology and pollinator activity. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",Dry heathland; Habitat fragmentation; Pollinator activity; Population size; Reproductive output,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951772652

Main St., Houston, TX 77005, United States","Non-pollinating consumers of floral resources, especially ants, can disrupt pollination and plant reproductive processes. As an alternative food resource to flowers, extrafloral nectar (EFN) may distract and satiate ants from flowers, thereby reducing their antagonistic effects on plants. Yet, EFN may actually attract and increase ant density on plants, thus increasing the disruption of pollination and/or their defense of plants. In this study, we tested the effects of ants and EFN on pollinating seed-consuming interactions between senita cacti and senita moths in the Sonoran Desert. Prior study of senita showed that EFN can distract ants from flowers, but consequences for plant-pollinator interactions remain unstudied. In our current study, ant exclusion had no effect on pollination or oviposition when moths were abundant (>85% flower visitation). Yet, in an ant by EFN factorial experiment under lower moth abundance (<40% visitation), there was a significant effect of ant exclusion (but not EFN or an ant × EFN) on pollination and oviposition. In contrast with our predictions, ant presence increased rather than decreased pollination (and oviposition) by moths, indicating a beneficial effect of ants on plant reproduction. While ant density on plants showed a saturating response to continuous experimental variation in EFN, in support of ant satiation and distraction, the probability of pollination and oviposition increased and saturated with ant density, again showing a beneficial effect of ants on plant reproduction. Ants showed no significant effect on fruit set, fruit survival, or fruit production of oviposited flowers in the ant exclusion experiment. Ants did not affect the survival of moth larvae, but there was a marginally significant effect of ants in reducing wasp parasitism of moths. We suggest that EFN may not only distract ants from disrupting plant-pollinator interactions, but they may also enhance plant-pollinator interactions by increasing pollination and reducing wasp parasitism. Though often considered dichotomous hypotheses, ant distraction and plant defense may be synergistic, though the mechanism(s) for such positive ant effects on plant-pollinator interactions needs further study. © 2011 The Authors.

However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67% to 96% but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78% in temperate-zone communities to 94% in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5% of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems. © 2011 The Authors.

We measured the effects of the spatial organization of the flowers and various parameters of visibility and height above the ground in relation to the spatial organization of the seed capsules (which retrospectively measures the activity of the pollinators). The spatial presentation of the flowers of E. crista-galli explained only 5% of the distribution of the seed capsules. For N. barkeri, with compound flowers, the spatial presentation, considering individual flowers or inflorescences, explained 12% and 45% of the distribution of the seed capsules, respectively, and all other interactions between the variables were insignificant. Both the deceptive and reward strategies resulted in the production of large numbers of seeds despite a low pollination percentage (1-5%). Notylia barkeri produced 11.8 (2005-6) and 53.7 (2007-8) times more seeds in total than E. crista-galli. Furthermore, unlike E. crista-galli, N. barkeri responded to loss of individuals after high winds with an increased production of flowers per plant.

This is the case for plant-ant and plant-pollinator mutualistic associations. In exchange for protection from herbivores provided by the resident ants, plants supply various kinds of resources or nests to the ants. Most ant-myrmecophyte mutualisms are horizontally transmitted, and therefore, partners share an interest in growth but not in reproduction. This lack of alignment in fitness interests between plants and ants drives a conflict between them: ants can attack pollinators that cross-fertilize the host plants. Using a mathematical model, we define a threshold in ant aggressiveness determining pollinator survival or elimination on the host plant. In our model we observed that, all else being equal, facultative interactions result in pollinator extinction for lower levels of ant aggressiveness than obligatory interactions. We propose that the capacity to discriminate pollinators from herbivores should not often evolve in ants, and when it does it will be when the plants exhibit limited dispersal in an environment that is not seed saturated so that each seed produced can effectively generate a new offspring or if ants acquire an extra benefit from pollination (e.g. if ants eat fruit). We suggest specific mutualism examples where these hypotheses can be tested empirically. © 2010 The Authors.

The present paper compares the structural organization of the floral nectary in a range of Aeridinae species, including both entomophilous and ornithophilous taxa.MethodsNectary spurs of Ascocentrum ampullaceum (Roxb.) Schltr. var. aurantiacum Pradhan, A. curvifolium (Lindl.) Schltr., A. garayi Christenson, Papilionanthe vandarum (Rchb.f.) Garay, Schoenorchis gemmata (Lindl.) J.J. Sm., Sedirea japonica (Rchb.f.) Garay & H.R. Sweet and Stereochilus dalatensis (Guillaumin) Garay were examined by means of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.Key Results and ConclusionsThe diverse anatomy of the nectary is described for a range of Aeridinae species. All species of Ascocentrum investigated displayed features characteristic of ornithophilous taxa. They have weakly zygomorphic, scentless, red or orange flowers, display diurnal anthesis, possess cryptic anther caps and produce nectar that is secluded in a relatively massive nectary spur. Unicellular, secretory hairs line the lumen at the middle part of the spur. Generally, however, with the exception of Papilionanthe vandarum, the nectary spurs of all entomophilous species studied here (Schoenorchis gemmata, Sedirea japonica, Stereochilus dalatensis) lack secretory trichomes. Moreover, collenchymatous secretory tissue, present only in the nectary spur of Asiatic Ascocentrum species, closely resembles that found in nectaries of certain Neotropical species that are hummingbird-pollinated and assigned to subtribes Maxillariinae Benth., Laeliinae Benth. and Oncidiinae Benth. This similarity in anatomical organization of the nectary, regardless of geographical distribution and phylogeny, indicates convergence. © The Author 2010.

Although mast seeding is easy to conceptualize, it has been quantified using a number of different metrics that reflect different features of pulsed reproduction. We quantified spatio-temporal patterns of mast seeding across 36 populations of a high-elevation tree, Pinus albicaulis, for which perceived declines in cone production are a conservation concern. We tested for trends in mean cone production through space and time, and documented patterns of mast seeding using six different metrics: coefficient of variation, lag-1 autocorrelation, synchrony, average cone production by individual trees, and the frequency of high cone crops on absolute and relative scales. Overall, we did not detect increasing or decreasing trends in cone production during our study period. Average cone production tended to increase from north-east to south-west. Population-level cone production tended to alternate between high and low years, but overall the coefficient of variation was low for a mast seeding species. Metrics of mast seeding were not concordant across populations. The first principal component describing mast metrics separated populations with frequent high cone crops from those with high coefficients of variation. However, the second principle component was at least somewhat correlated with all metrics of masting, suggesting some ability to separate 'masting' from 'non-masting' populations. In P. albicaulis, spatial variation in mast seeding could reflect differences in site productivity, differences in the importance of satiating generalist seed consumers versus attracting specialist seed dispersers, or recent invasion by an introduced pathogen. Synthesis. Our research reinforces the conclusion that populations form a continuum of strategies between 'masting' versus 'non-masting' extremes. However, because different features of masting do not covary in space, understanding where populations fall along this continuum will depend on the features that are most important for mast seeding in a particular context. © 2011 The Authors.

In the spring time, many clues can be seen in the hive, which sometimes demonstrate the proximity to swarming, such as the presence of more or less mature queen cells. In spite of this the actual date and time of swarming cannot be predicted accurately, as we still need to better understand this important physiological event. Here we show that, by means of a simple transducer secured to the outside wall of a hive, a set of statistically independent instantaneous vibration signals of honey bees can be identified and monitored in time using a fully automated and non-invasive method. The amplitudes of the independent signals form a multi-dimensional time-varying vector which was logged continuously for eight months. We found that combined with specifically tailored weighting factors, this vector provides a signature highly specific to the swarming process and its build up in time, thereby shedding new light on it and allowing its prediction several days in advance. The output of our monitoring method could be used to provide other signatures highly specific to other physiological processes in honey bees, and applied to better understand health issues recently encountered by pollinators. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Honey bee; PCA; Swarming; Vibrations,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955116818

The genus Leavenworthia has been the focus of research on this question for half of a century, with particular attention paid to the evolution of self-compatibility from self-incompatibility. In this review, we discuss the last 50 years of research concerning this evolutionary transition in Leavenworthia. Selfing appears to have evolved independently at minimum three times within this genus of eight species. Work on the ecological basis of mating system evolution in Leavenworthia has clarified that selection among individuals is likely a major force behind the recurrent evolution of selfing. Although inadequate pollination is appreciated as a factor favoring selfing, definitive ecological mechanisms that act to favor selfing are still not known and future work on the efficacy of pollinating bees and the effects of climate change is needed. Recent research has likely identified the SRK ortholog at the S-locus controlling self-incompatibility in Leavenworthia alabamica. Analyses of S-locus variation have revealed substantial S-allele diversity in outcrossing populations, with the recurrent fixation of mutations at the S-locus permitting the parallel evolution of selfing in this species. Although we appreciate some of the factors that may explain the evolution of selfing in this group, there is less known about the mechanisms underlying the widespread maintenance of outcrossing at the population and species levels. Studies in Leavenworthia have revealed that genetic diversity is lost over the long-term within selfing populations and leads to elevated population subdivision, but work is needed to determine why these genetic consequences of selfing cause lineages to become evolutionary dead ends. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Genetic diversity; Mating systems; Pollination; Selection; Self-fertilization; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952312816

This study is the first to examine the morphology of an extremely long butterfly proboscis and to describe how it is used to obtain nectar from flowers with very deep corolla tubes. The proboscis of Eurybia lycisca (Riodinidae) is approximately twice as long as the body. It has a maximal length of 45.6 mm (mean length 36.5 mm ± 4.1 S.D., N = 20) and is extremely thin, measuring only about 0.26 mm at its maximum diameter. The proboscis has a unique arrangement of short sensilla at the tip, and its musculature arrangement is derived. The flower handling times on the preferred nectar plant, Calathea crotalifera (Marantaceae), were exceptionally long (mean 54.5 sec ± 28.5 S.D., N = 26). When feeding on the deep flowers remarkably few proboscis movements occur. The relationship between Eurybia lycisca and its preferred nectar plant and larval host plant, Calathea crotalifera, is not mutualistic since the butterfly exploits the flowers without contributing to their pollination. We hypothesize that the extraordinarily long proboscis of Eurybia lycisca is an adaptation for capitalizing on the pre-existing mutualistic interaction of the host plant with its pollinating long-tongued nectar feeding insects. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Calathea crotalifera; Evolution; Flower-visiting behavior; Insects; Marantaceae; Mouthparts; Nectar feeding,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952537165

In particular, the size of visitors, relative to flower size, may have severe implications for plant fitness, as it can affect the mechanics of the pollination process. Ononis masquillierii, a rare endemic legume in northern Italy, is visited by numerous bee species of different families and sizes. To evaluate the effect of bee guilds on seed set, we compared the relative efficiency of four size classes of bees visiting flowers in eight plant populations occurring in the Apennines. Size classes were assorted by body weight. Reproductive success was positively related to plant population size and affected by the visitation frequency of the bee size guilds: higher visitation rates by larger bees (medium-large Andrenidae and large Apidae) increased seed set, whereas high visitation rates by smaller bees (small Halictidae and small-medium Megachilidae) reduced seed set. We conclude that the influence of bee size on seed set is related to the pollen foraging techniques of the different bee guilds. Larger bees paying short visits to flowers remove one 'batch' of pollen and transfer it to another flower. In contrast, smaller bees enter the flower entirely and activate the pump-like pollen dispensing mechanism several times, resulting in a higher degree of selfing. These behaviours may result in differential seed sets as the flowers are self-incompatible, i.e. seed set may be reduced after visitation by smaller bees. Such variations in pollinator quality among populations coupled with the ephemeral nature of the habitat of O. masquillierii may represent a risk for its persistence. Our results show that such a risk can be confronted only through the conservation of large plant populations and of large bees capable of flying long-distances. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.",Foraging techniques; Plant rarity; Pollinator size; Reproductive success; Seed set; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751496883

Plants co-suppressed for GA20ox1 (referred to as CO-6 plants) showed vegetative defects typical of GA deficiency such as darker and mis-shaped leaves and dwarfism. CO-6 plants flowered as the controls, although their flowers had subtle defects in the pedicel and in organ insertion. Analysis of male development revealed defects before, during and after meiosis, and a final pollen viability of 22%. The development of female organs and gametes appeared normal. Pollination experiments indicated that the pollen produced by CO-6 plants was able to fertilize control ovaries, but the analysis of the progeny showed that the construct was not transmitted. Ovaries of CO-6 plants showed high fruit set and normal fruit development when pollinated with control pollen. However these fruits were completely seedless due to a stenospermocarpic behaviour that was evidenced by callose layering in the endothelium between 7 and 15 days after pollination. We conclude that GA20ox1 in tomato exerts specific developmental roles that are not redundantly shared with other members of this gene family. For reproductive male development, silencing of this gene is detrimental for pollen production and either gametophytically lethal or severely hampering seed germination. In the pistil, the co-suppression construct does not affect the progamic phase, nor fruit set and growth, but it interferes with seed development after fertilization leading to seed abortion. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Fruit development; Gibberellins; Ovule abortion; Parthenocarpy; Pollen development; Solanum lycopersicum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651505394

Highly structured daily activity patterns are a feature of the biology of many flower visitors, particularly provisioning female bees, which often visit different floral sources at different times. Such temporal structure implies that presence/absence and relative abundance of specific flower-visitor interactions (links) in interaction networks may be highly sensitive to the daily timing of data collection. Further, relative timing of interactions is central to their possible role in competition or facilitation of seed set among coflowering plants sharing pollinators. To date, however, no study has examined the network impacts of daily temporal variation in visitor activity at a community scale. Here we use temporally structured sampling to examine the consequences of daily activity patterns upon network properties using fully quantified flower-visitor interaction data for a Kenyan savanna habitat. Interactions were sampled at four sequential three-hour time intervals between 06:00 and 18:00, across multiple seasonal time points for two sampling sites. In all data sets the richness and relative abundance of links depended critically on when during the day visitation was observed. Permutation-based null modeling revealed significant temporal structure across daily time intervals at three of the four seasonal time points, driven primarily by patterns in bee activity. This sensitivity of network structure shows the need to consider daily time in network sampling design, both to maximize the probability of sampling links relevant to plant reproductive success and to facilitate appropriate interpretation of interspecific relationships. Our data also suggest that daily structuring at a community level could reduce indirect competitive interactions when coflowering plants share pollinators, as is commonly observed during flowering in highly seasonal habitats. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.",Africa; Competition; Ecological networks; Fcilitation; Kenya; Mutualism; Pollination; Savanna; Temporal structure; Visitation webs,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955531139

To date, however, its consequences have mainly been studied in an ecological context, while little is known about its effects on evolutionary processes. In this study we examined whether habitat fragmentation affects selection on plant phenotypic traits via changes in plant-pollinator interactions, using the self-incompatible perennial herb Phyteuma spicatum. Specifically, we hypothesized that limited pollination service in small or low-density populations leads to increased selection for traits that attract pollinators. We recorded mean seed production per capsule and per plant as a measure of pollination intensity and assessed selection gradients (i.e., trait-fitness relationships) in 16 natural populations of varying size and density over 2 years. Mean seed production was not related to population size or density, except for a marginal significant effect of density on the mean number of seeds per capsule in 1 year. Linear selection for flowering time and synchrony was consistent across populations; relative fitness was higher in earlier flowering plants and in plants flowering synchronously with others. Selection on inflorescence size, however, varied among populations, and linear selection gradients for inflorescence size were negatively related to plant population size and density in 1 year. Selection for increased inflorescence size decreased with increasing population size and density. Contrary to our expectation this appeared not to be related to changes in pollination intensity (mean seed production was not related to population size or density in this year), but was rather likely linked to differences in some other component of the abiotic or biotic environment. In summary, our results show that habitat fragmentation may influence selection on plant phenotypic traits, thereby highlighting potential evolutionary consequences of human-induced environmental change. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Floral display size; Flowering phenology; Phenotypic selection; Phyteuma spicatum; Pollination; Seed production,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951952830

The Orchidaceae of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region use a diversity of pollination strategies and sites of mycorrhizal infection, and occupy a diversity of habitats. We combined a biogeographic analysis with analysis of factors associated with rarity to establish: (1) the landscape features correlated with taxon turnover and speciation, and (2) the possible role in taxon rarity of geographic region, pollination strategy, edaphic habitat and site of mycorrhizal infection. Location Southwest Australian Floristic Region. Methods The distributions of 407 orchid taxa (species and subspecies) were mapped at the quarter-degree scale using 13,267 collections in the Western Australian Herbarium. This database was used to map taxon richness, for a biogeographic analysis and to quantify rarity of taxa. Using herbarium records, rarity was expressed as mean abundance, mean distribution and incidence of rarity based on abundance and distribution for each genus. We tested for differences in rarity of species between pollination strategies, edaphic habitats and sites of mycorrhizal infection. Results Taxon richness was highest in the High Rainfall Province. Biogeographic provincial boundaries for orchids were aligned with rainfall, while district boundaries tended to follow geological formations. When rarity was defined as either low abundance or small distribution, the greatest number of rare taxa occurred in areas of high taxon richness and naturally fragmented edaphic environments. For both abundance and distributional extent, sexual deception had a significantly higher incidence of rarity than food-rewarding taxa. There was no significant difference in rarity with site of mycorrhizal infection. Main conclusions While large-scale edaphic and climatic variation are correlated with orchid taxon turnover and speciation in a similar fashion to the flora in general, the processes responsible for patterns of diversity may differ. Fragmented edaphic environments appear to be associated with a higher incidence of rare species due to limited dispersal/colonization opportunities or radiations of taxa in allopatry. The high incidence of rarity in sexually deceptive taxa could be due to either low fruit set or the risk of specializing on a single pollinator species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biogeographic provinces; Conservation; Endemism; Mycorrhiza; Orchidaceae; Pollination; Rarity; Western Australia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551559492

One such procedure is grafting, in which individuals are propagated for commercial sale by joining a clone of a desired cultivar (the scion) with rootstock obtained from a different individual. If the rootstock can sprout and flower, it can potentially cross-pollinate the scion, leading to fruit production in a self-incompatible species. The effect of grafting on invasion success was examined in the Callery pear, Pyrus calleryana, one of the most popular landscaping trees in the United States. Using nine microsatellite markers, scion and rootstock were genotyped for 57 cultivated trees to characterize rootstock genotypes and the rootstock gene pool. Invasive populations were then sampled to determine if rootstock genotypes have contributed to their formation. In no case were scion and rootstock genotypes identical for any given cultivated tree and rootstock genotypes were genetically variable, although some cloned rootstock genotypes were detected. Rootstock genotypes were also observed in invasive populations, with up to 17% of wild individuals having at least one rootstock parent. These results indicate that rootstock can contribute to the formation of invasive populations of the Callery pear through cross-pollination with other available genotypes. Future investigations of woody ornamentals propagated by grafting should consider this horticultural practice as a potential contributor to invasiveness. Furthermore, plant breeders are encouraged to assess the ability of rootstock to sprout as well as its cross-compatibility with the scion or other cultivar genotypes growing nearby. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Callery pear; Cultivars; Microsatellites; Pyrus calleryana; Rootstock; Self incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751528250

However, because suitable pollinators and/or mates may be absent in the new range, it is not clear how they achieve high seed production. According to Baker's Law, species capable of uniparental reproduction are more likely to establish after long-distance dispersal than species that rely on suitable mates and pollinators. To test whether self-compatible species, and particularly species capable of autonomous seed set, are more likely to establish and spread, we experimentally assessed the breeding systems of 12 species of Asteraceae that are invasive in China. Among these 12 species of Asteraceae, the percentages of self-compatible species (66.7%) and species capable of autonomous seed set (83.3%), which included self-fertilizing and apomictic species, were significantly larger than expected from the percentages of such species in global data sets of Asteraceae (36.8% and 46.0%, respectively). Furthermore, the number of Chinese provinces in which the invasive alien species occur was significantly positively correlated with the proportion seed set on bagged capitula (i. e. with the degree of autonomous seed set). Among 36 species of Asteraceae that are invasive in China and for which we found breeding-system data in the literature, we also found a higher than expected percentage of self-compatible species (65.7%), and that these self-compatible species are more widespread in China than self-incompatible species. These results support the predictions of Baker's Law that self-compatible species, and particularly those capable of autonomous seed production, are more likely to establish and spread in a new range. Therefore, breeding systems of plants should be included as one of the key elements in risk assessment protocols for plant invasiveness. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Agamospermy; Apomixis; Asteraceae; Autonomous seed production; Baker's rule; Breeding system; Invasiveness; Self-compatiblity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851514567

This interest was exhibited in three different ways: (1) the female parasite landed near the host bee's nest entrance and waited for the host bee to exit her nest cell before entering; (2) the female parasite entered briefly, re-emerged and re-entered with abdomen first; and (3) the female parasite entered the host bee nest as in (2), but did not exit and re-enter due to larger nest holes, where she could presumably turn around in any direction to lay the egg. We also found that female parasites would briefly hover in front of vials that contained pollen, but would land nearby when the vial contained nectar. Additionally, eggs of the female parasite were inserted horizontally in the wall of the host bee cell, primarily in the upper half.

Indeed, the specific competencies for coastal practitioners are identified here and these further illustrate the need for professional recognition of the role, responsibilities, and therefore the requirement for an appropriately qualified ""Coastal Manager"" professional, one that is seen not merely as a nicety but rather a necessity-a core enabler in any future innovative and integrative management approach. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cross-professional competencies; Cross-professional pollination; Integrated coastal land management (ICZM); Inter-disciplinary linkages; Ireland; Spatial data management (SDM),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861471225

Leptonycteris curasoae curasoae and Glossophaga longirostris elongata (Chiroptera: Glossophaginae) visit flowers of Stenocereus (syn. Ritterocereus) griseus and Subpilocereus (syn. Cereus) repandus on the same nights; these visits may promote interference competition between cactus species. I studied the effect of heterospecific (mixed) pollen loads on fruit and seed set, fruit and seed size and mass, germinated seeds at 5 weeks, and seedling survival at 7 months in relation to hand pollination with intraspecific pollen and natural pollination. Hand pollination seemed to limit pollen loads available for pollination. Under these conditions, natural pollination tended to produce the most fruits and seeds, and the largest fruits (but lightest seeds); mixed pollination was the least effective treatment (fruit set was significantly greater for St. griseus in natural than mixed pollination; fruit volume was greater in natural than mixed pollination for S. repandus, and seed number and fruit mass were larger in intraspecific than in mixed pollination). Aspects of natural pollination, possibly repeated visits, compensated for the negative impact of interspecific pollen loads under pollen limitation, with positive impacts on the carrying capacity of cacti for frugivores. Seed mass from natural pollination was negatively correlated with seed number only for St. griseus. Germination success was not correlated with seed mass, but seedling survival at 7 months was for S. repandus. The two species do not seem to compete through pollen interference when pollinator visits are relatively frequent. © 2010 The Ecological Society of Japan.",Bat pollination; Carrying capacity; Coexistence in mutualism; Heterospecific pollen; Pollinator sharing; Seed germination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952765249

We studied their reproductive biology to estimate which traits facilitate invasiveness. Flower morphology was examined, insect observations were made, and hand pollination treatments were performed. Floral biology differed among species. Impatiens glandulifera and I. noli-tangere presented large quantities of sucrosedominant nectar, contrary to Impatiens parviflora. The latter had high autonomous selfing ability (81.4% fruit set) linked to complete self-compatibility. No inbreeding depression was detected for this species. The second alien, I. glandulifera, showed lower autonomous selfing (9.3% fruit set), with high self-compatibility and low inbreeding depression (? = 0:11). No evidence of autonomous selfing was found for the native, which presented the lowest self-compatibility and the highest inbreeding depression (? = 0:42). However, all species can be considered self-compatible. Impatiens glandulifera flowers were visited by insects up to 250 times during their life span, whereas I. noli-tangere and I. parviflora flowers received fewer than seven visits. Both exotics present traits facilitating reproductive success. Impatiens parviflora exhibits autonomous self-pollination, whereas the other species possess attractive traits with respect to insect pollination. On the other hand, the native, unable to self-pollinate, is poorly attractive to pollinators. The high fecundity of the aliens seems to contribute to their invasiveness. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",Autonomous self-pollination; Balsams; Bumblebees; Invasive species; Pollination; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952726469

In spite of such virtues, global area under its cultivation has decreased because of ban on its cultivation in many countries. The ban is imposed due to its association with neurolathyrism, a non-reversible neurological disorder in humans and animals due to presence of neurotoxin, ?-N-oxalyl-l-?,?-diaminopropionic acid (?-ODAP) in its seedlings and seeds. The traditional varieties of grass pea contain 0.5-2.5% ?-ODAP. Exploitable genetic variability for ?-ODAP has been observed for development of low ODAP varieties, which along with improved agronomic and detoxification practices can help reduce the risk of lathyrism. Collaborative efforts between ICARDA and NARS have resulted in development of improved varieties such as Wasie in Ethiopia, Ratan, Prateek and Mahateora in India, and BARI Khesari-1 and BARI Khesari-2 in Bangladesh with&lt;0.10% ?-ODAP. Soil application of 15-20kgha-1 zinc sulphate, early planting, and soaking seeds in water have shown significant effects on ?-ODAP.

This results in lower leaf transpiration efficiency (TE), the ratio of photosynthesis to transpiration, than potentially achievable for a given rate of photosynthesis. In some other crops, breeding has indirectly resulted in a large increase in stomatal conductance (gs), which would decrease TE. I tested whether this occurred in sweet corn by comparing five open-pollinated varieties released before 1903 with four standard hybrid varieties released in the mid-1900s and four varieties released after 1990. Leaf gas exchange of each variety was measured under ambient midday field conditions on eight sunny days over two seasons in Beltsville, MD. Although there were significant differences among varieties in gs, A, Ci, and TE, no effect of era was significant for any variable except A. Of the four modern varieties tested, two had the highest gs and two had the lowest gs of any of the varieties compared, with high gs associated with low TE. These four varieties were further compared in a third year and were found to differ consistently in leaf TE but not in A. It is concluded that breeding over the last century has not increased gs or decreased leaf TE in sweet corn but that there is significant variation in TE among modern sweet corn varieties. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952479985

Seedlings of Northern California black walnut (NCB) (J. hindsii) and Paradox hybrid (PH) (typically J. hindsii · J. regia)were used as standards.

Negligible disease occurred in flooded control soil without the pathogens. In 9-year graft compatibility trials in an orchard, NCB and PH rootstocks supported relatively good survival and growth of all tested scion cultivars ('Chandler', 'Hartley', 'Serr', 'Tulare', and 'Vina'; final scion survival 80% to 100%, mean scion circumference increase 292 to 541 mm), whereas results with WN were mixed.

Orientalis cv. Olympicus exhibits a unique pattern of flower senescence, involving re-greening of creamy white petaloid sepals at the later stages. The greenish sepals become photosynthetically competent immediately after pollination and persist until the seeds are set. After the seed set, the entire (green) flower abscises from the plant. Flower development of Helleborus orientalis cv. Olympicus growing in the open was divided into six stages (I-VI) from tight bud stage to the senescent stage. The average life span of an individual flower after it is fully open is about 6 days. Membrane permeability of sepal tissues estimated as electrical conductivity of leachates increased during senescence. The content of sugars and soluble proteins in the sepal tissues increased during flower opening and declined thereafter during senescence. The protease activity increased as the flower progressed towards senescence. From the present study, it becomes evident that decline in the sugar status and elevation in specific protease activity leading to degradation of proteins are the important factors regulating development and senescence in H. orientalis flowers. Although the tissue content of soluble proteins registered an overall quantitative decrease but SDS-PAGE of protein extract from sepal tissues suggested a decrease in the expression of high molecular weight proteins and an increase in low molecular weight proteins during flower development and senescence. At this stage it is not known whether the polypeptides that increased during senescence play an important role in the senescence of Helleborus orientalis flowers. The increase in these polypeptides during flower senescence is of particular interest because they may be linked to flower longevity. Understanding the nature of these proteins can provide new insights into the pathways that execute senescence and the post-transcriptional regulation of senescence in this flower system. © 2011 Prof. H.S.

Among the 85 populations screened from 1998 to 2008 for resistance to ACCase-inhibitors and graminicide sulfonylureas, 17 resulted as being resistant to at least one ACCase inhibitor while none of the populations showed resistance to sulfonylureas. ACCase resistance in hood canary-grass seems to be spreading rather slowly in Italy. Out of the 17 populations, seven were characterised through outdoor dose-response pot experiments to investigate resistance levels and cross-resistance patterns to ACCase-inhibitors and multiple resistance to other mode of action. Molecular bases of resistance to the recently introduced DEN herbicide pinoxaden were also investigated. Six populations were confirmed to be ACCase-resistant with various cross-resistance patterns. Two populations were resistant to all tested ACCase herbicides, with pinoxaden resistance indexes (RI) based on survival ranging from 22 to 50. The two populations have been molecularly characterised for resistance to pinoxaden. A single point-mutation in the ACCase gene was identified in each population, causing the amino-acid substitutions of Ile1781Val and Asp2078Gly in 0478L and 0025, respectively. The results suggest that resistance of P. paradoxa to pinoxaden is due to an altered target site and different mutations cause different resistance levels.

We aimed to characterize the 55. kDa allergen of Bahia grass pollen (BaGP) and ascertain its clinical importance. BaGP extract was separated by 2D-PAGE and immunoblotted with serum IgE of a grass pollen-allergic patient. The amino-terminal protein sequence of the predominant allergen isoform at 55. kDa had similarity with the group 13 allergens of Timothy grass and maize pollen, Phl p 13 and Zea m 13. Four sequences obtained by rapid amplification of the allergen cDNA ends represented multiple isoforms of Pas n 13. The predicted full length cDNA for Pas n 13 encoded a 423 amino acid glycoprotein including a signal peptide of 28 residues and with a predicted pI of 7.0. Tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides of 2D gel spots identified peptides specific to the deduced amino acid sequence for each of the four Pas n 13 cDNA, representing 47% of the predicted mature protein sequence of Pas n 13. There was 80.6% and 72.6% amino acid identity with Zea m 13 and Phl p 13, respectively. Reactivity with a Phl p 13-specific monoclonal antibody AF6 supported designation of this allergen as Pas n 13. The allergen was purified from BaGP extract by ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction and size exclusion chromatography. Purified Pas n 13 reacted with serum IgE of 34 of 71 (48%) grass pollen-allergic patients and specifically inhibited IgE reactivity with the 55. kDa band of BaGP for two grass pollen-allergic donors. Four isoforms of Pas n 13 from pI 6.3-7.8 had IgE-reactivity with grass pollen allergic sera. The allergenic activity of purified Pas n 13 was demonstrated by activation of basophils from whole blood of three grass pollen-allergic donors tested but not control donors. Pas n 13 is thus a clinically relevant pollen allergen of the subtropical Bahia grass likely to be important in eliciting seasonal allergic rhinitis and asthma in grass pollen-allergic patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Bahia grass pollen; Grass pollen allergens; Group 13 pollen allergen; IgE; Pas n 13; Polygalacturonase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951550116

The orchid genus Epipactis is widely represented in the Italian peninsula by widespread species and several endemic, localized taxa, including selfing and outcrossing taxa. Here the phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships in a group of closely related taxa in Epipactis are investigated with the aim of understanding the role of this refugial area for cladogenesis and speciation in herbaceous species, such as terrestrial orchids. MethodsRibosomal DNA (rDNA) was employed to assess phylogenetic relationships, and plastid sequence variation in the rbcLaccD spacer was used to reveal phylogeographic patterns among plastid haplotypes using a parsimony network.Key ResultsLow genetic variation and shared ribotypes were detected in rDNA, whereas high levels of sequence variation and a strong phylogeographic structure were found in the examined plastid region. The parsimony plastid haplotype network identified two main haplotype groups, one including E. atrorubens/microphylla/ muelleri/leptochila and the other including all accessions of E. helleborine and several localized and endemic taxa, with a combination of widespread and rare haplotypes detected across the Italian peninsula. A greater genetic divergence separated the Italian and other European accessions of E. helleborine. ConclusionsPhylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns support a working hypothesis in which the Italian peninsula has only recently been colonized by Epipactis, probably during the most recent phase of the Quaternary age and, nevertheless, it acted as a remarkable centre of diversification for this orchid lineage. Changes in pollination strategy and recurrent shifts in mating system (from allogamy to autogamy) could have represented the mechanism promoting this rapid diversification and the observed high taxonomic complexity detected in the E. helleborine species complex. © The Author 2010.

Assessment begins with identifying organisms that make up biological communities and understanding evolutionary histories. Scientific advancements in molecular sequencing can help clarify and provide support for identifications. Massively parallel DNA sequencing technologies are being used to sequence complete genomes of model organisms; however, this resource has not been fully used for species identifications. Animal researchers commonly use one mitochondrial region, and groups of plant scientists have proposed numerous combinations of two or three chloroplast markers as genomic identifiers. Yet, nearly as many studies have reported that the proposed regions are uninformative in some plant groups and at various taxonomic levels. Methods: We propose a combination of whole (or nearly whole) chloroplast genomes, mitochondrial genes, and nuclear repeat regions for both species identifications and phylogenetic analyses, obtained from a simple total DNA extraction and one run on massively parallel DNA sequencing machines. Key results: We have recovered both coding and noncoding sequences from multiple genetic sources, providing genomic information for comparisons within and between multiple taxonomic levels. Conclusions: In combination with morphological and other data, this abundance of genomic information will have a broad range of applications, including not only helping conservation biologists understand ecosystem biodiversity, but also understanding the evolutionary histories of organisms, mending damaged landscapes, and investigating interactions of plants with pollinators and pests. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Citizen science; DNA barcoding; Genome; Genome survey sequencing; Handheld field device; Mitochondria; Nextgeneration sequencing; Nuclear ribosomal DNA; Plastome; Whole genome shotgun,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952766189

We aimed to quantify morphological and genetic differentiation among remnant populations of the iconic coco-de-mer palm Lodoicea maldivica. We hypothesized that limited gene flow among widely spaced populations would result in high genetic variation and large phenotypic differences among populations. Location Islands of Praslin and Curieuse (CU), Seychelles, Indian Ocean. Methods We conducted an extensive population survey and recorded morphological parameters for 447 Lodoicea in the main populations at Vallée de Mai (VM) and Fond Ferdinand (FF) on Praslin, and on CU. We collected leaf material from 180 trees in these populations for DNA genotyping using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Results A total of 16,766 Lodoicea trees were recorded in the three populations (72.6% of Lodoicea on both islands). Lodoicea trees at VM and FF showed similar morphology, but differed in most parameters from those at CU, which were shorter, grew more slowly and produced fewer seeds. Mean overall genetic diversity was 0.337, and percentage of polymorphic loci was 91.1. Genetic diversity of the CU population was lower than that at VM and FF. There was weak genetic differentiation between CU and Praslin populations, but 99% of all genetic diversity was within populations. Main conclusions Trees on CU differed in growth and morphology from those of the two Praslin populations. These phenotypic differences, however, were not mirrored in the genetic structure of the populations. All populations were relatively genetically diverse with remarkably little differentiation among populations. This suggests that the capacity of Lodoicea to dominate across a range of habitats may be because of high phenotypic plasticity. High genetic connectivity may be maintained through long-distance wind pollination. Given the uncertainty about the extent of underlying adaptive variation, we recommend that restoration projects avoid transferring seeds between island populations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",AFLP; Genetic diversity; Indian Ocean; Limited seed dispersal; Palm conservation; Seychelles Islands,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951629919

Periodic regeneration, performed on limited plots with small number of individuals, increases the risk of genetic drift and genetic diversity changes. In this study, six accessions of white flowered, dry seed pea varieties (Pisum sativum L. subsp. sativum var. sativum): Bohatýr, Klatovský zelený, Hanák, Moravský hrotovický krajový, Raman and Viktoria-75 and four accessions of colour flowered, fodder pea (P. sativum subsp. sativum var. arvense (L.) Poiret: Arvika, ?eský banán, Moravská krajová and Niké, representing Czechoslovak varieties and landraces, bred over the last 40-80 years, were analyzed using ten microsatellite locus specific markers. Each accession was represented by 20 individual seeds of two temporally different samples, spanning the period of 20 or 40 years. Together with intra-accession variation (except of cv. Hanák), evidence of genetic changes, e. g. differences in allele frequencies as well as genetic composition of sample, was detected in six out of ten accessions (Arvika, Bohatýr, ?eský banán, Moravský hrotovický krajový, Moravská krajová and Raman). Evidence of genetic erosion was found in three accessions (?eský banán, Moravský hrotovický krajový and Raman), while in another three (Arvika, Bohatýr and Moravská krajová) the level of diversity was found to have increased. Moreover in three samples of Bohatýr (2004) and Klatovský zelený (1963 and 2004), low levels of heterozygosity was detected. These results demonstrate that in pea, a self-pollinating and highly homozygous plant, the danger of the loss of genetic integrity exists.

Because of variation in pollen grain size among plant species, estimates of the contribution of different species to pollen loads, based on pollen counts only, differed from those adjusted for pollen grain size. The overall size of pollen loads, as well as the contribution of alfalfa declined seasonally, while that for mustards (with smaller individual grain sizes) increased. The type of pollen carried by females did not vary with body size, but we found a significant relationship between female size and the size of the largest loads.

However, explanations for the synchronous death of parent plants are elusive. The roles of synchronous seeding and post-reproductive mortality were investigated in a perennial monocarpic herb (Isoglossa woodii) in coastal dune forest in South Africa.MethodsPre-dispersal seed predation and seed production were assessed by measuring fruit and seed set of inflorescences sprayed with insecticide or water and with no spray treatments. Seed predation was measured at different densities of I. woodii plants by monitoring removal rates of seed from the forest floor. The influence of adult plants on establishment of I. woodii seedlings was assessed by monitoring growth and survivorship of seedlings in caged and uncaged 1 × 1 m plots in understorey gaps and thickets.Key ResultsFruit and seed set were similar between spray treatments. An I. woodii stem produced 767·8 ± 160·8 seeds (mean ± s.e.) on dune crests and 1359·0 ± 234·4 seeds on the foredune. Seed rain was greater on the foredune than in other topographic locations. Seed predation rates were 32 and 54 on dune crests and in dune slacks, respectively, and decreased with seed abundance, number of inflorescences per stem and plant height. Seedling recruitment was greater beneath synchronously dying adult plants than in natural understorey gaps (no I. woodii). However, seedling growth rate beneath I. woodii mid-way through its life-cycle was less than in gaps, although survivorship was similar.ConclusionsThe selective advantage of masting in I. woodii derives from satiation of both pre- and post-dispersal seed predators. In addition, post-seeding mortality of adult plants facilitates seedling establishment. Satiation of seed predators and the benefits of seedling establishment are strong drivers of the evolution of synchronous monocarpy in I. woodii. © The Author 2011.

Over a 1-year period, we examined genetic effects on mean and maximum mid-day canopy conductance (Gs, Gsmax) and transpiration (E, max-E) within a juvenile loblolly pine plantation composed of 'genotypes' (e.g. different genetic entries) from each of the three different genetic groups (clones, full-sibs, open-pollinated). We also compared reference canopy conductance (Gs-ref or Gs at a vapour pressure deficit (D) = 1 kPa), maximum E (Emax) in response to D, stomatal sensitivity to D, specific hydraulic conductivity (ks), and cavitation resistance among genotypes. Based on genetic and physiological principles, we hypothesized that (1) within genotypes, physiological uniformity will increase as inherent genetic diversity decreases and (2) genotypes with greater ks and higher canopy-level gas-exchange rates will be more sensitive to increases in D, and more susceptible to loss of ks. In our results, high- and low-genetic diversity genotypes showed no differences in E and Gs uniformity over time. However, E and max-E were significantly different among genotypes, and genotypes showed significant seasonal variability in Gs and Gsmax. Additionally, there were significant differences in Emax, Gs-ref, Gs sensitivity to D, and the pressure at which 50% loss of ks occurs (P50) among individual genotypes. We found no relationship between mean hydraulic conductivity parameters and overall Gs-ref or Gs sensitivity. However, the genotype full embolism point (P88) and loss of ks rate (LCrate) both showed a significant positive relationship with genotype Gs-ref during the spring, indicating that genotypes with higher Gs were less resistant to cavitation. Overall, genetic effects on canopy-level gas-exchange and cavitation resistance were significant, implying that physiological differences among genotypes might affect stand water use, carbon gain, drought tolerance, and hydrologic processes. Contrary to our expectations, uniformity in physiological process rates did not increase as inherent genetic diversity decreased, suggesting that clonal genotypes exhibit high physiological plasticity under plantation conditions.

In addition, to avoid inbreeding, the androecium and gynoecium are united in a single structure termed the gynostemium. Identification of C-class MADS-box genes regulating reproductive organ development could help determine the level of homology with the current ABC model of floral organ identity in orchids. In this study, we isolated and characterized two C-class AGAMOUS-like genes, denoted CeMADS1 and CeMADS2, from Cymbidium ensifolium. These two genes showed distinct spatial and temporal expression profiles, which suggests their functional diversification during gynostemium development. Furthermore, the expression of CeMADS1 but not CeMADS2 was eliminated in the multitepal mutant whose gynostemium is replaced by a newly emerged flower, and this ecotopic flower continues to produce sepals and petals centripetally. Protein interaction relationships among CeMADS1, CeMADS2 and E-class PeMADS8 proteins were assessed by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Both CeMADS1 and CeMADS2 formed homodimers and heterodimers with each other and the E-class PeMADS protein. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CeMADS1 or CeMADS2 showed limited growth of primary inflorescence. Thus, CeMADS1 may have a pivotal C function in reproductive organ development in C. ensifolium. © 2011 The Author.",C-class MADS-box gene; Cymbidium ensifolium; Gynostemium; multitepal mutant; Orchid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952357094

We investigated quantitative genetics of floral biomass allocation in females and hermaphrodites of gynodioecious Schiedea adamantis (Caryophyllaceae). The G-matrices within females (Gf), within hermaphrodites (Gm), and between sexes (B) were compared to those for the closely related S. salicaria, which exhibits a lower frequency of females and less-pronounced sexual dimorphism. Additive genetic variation was detected in all measured traits in S. adamantis, with narrow-sense heritability from 0.34-1.0. Female allocation and floral size traits covaried more tightly than did those traits with allocation to stamens. Between-sex genetic correlations were all &lt;1, indicating sex-specific expression of genes. Common principal-components analysis detected differences between Gf and Gm, suggesting potential for further independent evolution of the sexes. The two species of Schiedea differed in Gm and especially so in Gf, with S. adamantis showing greater genetic variation in capsule mass and tighter genetic covariation between female allocation traits and flower size in females.

We tested whether improved water and nutrient availability facilitate reproduction of dominant steppe species, and studied the effects of increased moisture and fertilization on seed production of the steppe grass Stipa krylovii. Effects of water availability on seed production and seed viability were investigated in a large-scale study on three sites with decreasing precipitation in Mongolia, over three to five consecutive years. In dry southern Mongolia, we additionally conducted an in situ irrigation and fertilization experiment to clarify the role of environmentally induced effects on seed production. Seed viability of S. krylovii was negatively correlated with annual precipitation over five years at the driest study site. The relation between annual precipitation and seed viability in the large-scale study was not as clear, however, in the two moister regions there was a trend of lower seed viability. Experimental irrigation also significantly decreased seed viability and seed mass. Seed production per hectare was not affected by irrigation, while fertilization resulted in a more than fivefold increase in both seed weight and number of viable seeds. The underlying mechanisms for these unexpected results were not investigated. However, a switch from cleistogamous pollination under dry conditions to less effective cross-pollination in moist years may be an explanation. Our data indicate that plant reproduction may show complex and unexpected reactions, and that nutrient limitation must be considered in global change scenarios even for dry regions. In Trockengebieten ist die Primärproduktion vor allem durch Wasserverfügbarkeit limitiert, es gibt jedoch auch Hinweise auf eine Ko-Limitierung durch Nährstoffe. Wir haben getestet, ob sich Wasser- und Nährstoffverfügbarkeit auf die Reproduktion eines dominanten Steppengrases auswirken. Dazu untersuchten wir die Auswirkung unterschiedlicher Bewässerung und Düngung auf die Samenproduktion und-qualität der Federgrasart Stipa krylovii. Den Effekt der Wasserverfügbarkeit testeten wir in einem großräumigen Vergleich abnehmender Niederschläge in der Mongolei; die Messungen liefen über drei bis fünf aufeinanderfolgende Jahre. Darüber hinaus führten wir in der südlichen Mongolei, im trockensten der drei Untersuchungsgebiete, ein in situ Experiment mit Beregnung und Düngung durch, um die Rolle von umweltinduzierten Effekten auf die Samenproduktion zu analysieren. Die Samenlebensfähigkeit im trockensten Untersuchungsgebiet korrelierte signifikant negativ mit dem jährlichen Niederschlag. Das Verhältnis zwischen jährlichem Niederschlag und Samenlebensfähigkeit in der großräumigen Studie verhielt sich weniger eindeutig; die Lebensfähigkeit in den feuchteren Regionen war jedoch tendenziell niedriger. Experimentelle Bewässerung reduzierte sowohl die Samenlebensfähigkeit als auch das Samengewicht. Die Gesamtproduktion von Samen pro Hektar wurde durch die Bewässerung nicht beeinflusst; Düngung hingegen führte zu einer mehr als fünffachen Zunahme von Gesamt-Samengewicht und Anzahl lebensfähiger Samen. Die Ursachen für diese unerwarteten Ergebnisse wurden von uns nicht untersucht, jedoch könnte ein Wechsel von kleistogamer Bestäubung bei trockenen Bedingungen zu weniger effektiver Fremdbestäubung in feuchteren Jahren unsere Ergebnisse erklären.

They are a predominant component of pollen and are potent allergens with a high frequency of serum IgE reactivity in grass pollen-allergic patients. Bahia grass is distinct from temperate grasses and has a prolonged pollination period and wide distribution in warmer climates. Here we describe the purification of the group 1 pollen allergen, Pas n 1, from Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum), an important subtropical aeroallergen source. Methods: Pas n 1 was purified from an aqueous Bahia grass pollen extract by ammonium sulphate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction and size exclusion chromatography, and assessed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting and ELISA. Results: Pas n 1 was purified to a single 29-kDa protein band containing two dominant isoforms detected by an allergen-specific monoclonal antibody and serum IgE of a Bahia grass pollen-allergic donor. The frequency of serum IgE reactivity with purified Pas n 1 in 51 Bahia grass pollen-allergic patients was 90.6%. Serum IgE reactivity with purified Pas n 1 was highly correlated with serum IgE reactivity with Bahia grass pollen extract and recombinant Pas n 1 (r = 0.821 and 0.913, respectively). Conclusions: Pas n 1 is a major allergen reactive at high frequency with serum IgE of Bahia grass pollen-allergic patients. Purified natural Pas n 1 has utility for improved specific diagnosis and immunotherapy for Bahia grass pollen allergy. Copyright © 2010 S.

Addressing this question poses a significant problem, however, because a male's ability to win fertilizations ultimately depends on the competitive ability of rival males. Attempts to partition genetic variance in sperm competitiveness, as estimated from measures of fertilization success, must therefore account for stochastic effects due to the random sampling of rival sperm competitors. In this contribution, we suggest a practical solution to this problem. We advocate the use of simple cross-classified breeding designs for partitioning sources of genetic variance in sperm competitiveness and fertilization success and show how these designs can be used to avoid stochastic effects due to the random sampling of rival sperm competitors. We illustrate the utility of these approaches by simulating various scenarios for estimating genetic parameters in sperm competiveness, and show that the probability of detecting additive genetic variance in this trait is restored when stochastic effects due to the random sampling of rival sperm competitors are controlled.

The establishment of systems to evaluate the effectiveness of the management of these areas are crucial to validate their importance for conservation and guide the managers towards their conservation goals. Aculeate Hymenoptera, specifically Apiformes and Spheciformes, gather exceptional characteristics as bioindicators and are essential to ecosystem sustainability by including key pollinators (Apiformes), contribute for the maintenance of the equilibrium between arthropod populations (Spheciformes), and also reflect the patterns of other taxa. Apiformes and Spheciformes communities were sampled with Malaise traps in eight different habitats initially identified by habitat type (mainly vegetation). These communities were evaluated to determine if the habitats could be differentiated based on their Apiformes and Spheciformes generic communities. Apiformes and Spheciformes diversity provided limited differentiation between habitats but was able to differentiate the most disturbed habitat from the most pristine. In general, Apiformes and Spheciformes communities were different among the eight habitats. It was also possible to establish a relation between some genera and a specific habitat type. Several genera of Apiformes and Spheciformes showed a preference for the riparian galery (RLR) and a mixed woodland (COZ), providing a general idea of the ideal conditions for the development of these groups.

The sampling included 28 grouped trees (referred to as the population) and six isolated trees in pastureland along a highway in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. From the population, we sampled 137 seeds from 12 seed-trees, and from the isolated trees, we sampled 34 seeds from two seed-trees. The results showed that pollen was dispersed over long distances (reaching 7353m) and therefore the spatially isolated trees were not reproductively isolated. The pollen immigration rate in the population was also high (31%). Isolated trees presented a higher selfing rate (s=26%) than trees in the population (s=12%), suggesting that the spatial isolation of the trees increased selfing. However, selfing was responsible for only 30 percent of the inbreeding in offspring and mating among relatives was 70 percent. In the population, excluding selfing, ca 72 percent of the pollen was dispersed over distances <1000m (average: 860m). For the two isolated seed-trees, excluding selfing, the average pollen dispersal distance was 5229m. The results demonstrate that although pollen can be dispersed over long distances for H. stigonocarpa isolated trees, a high percentage of pollen comes from the same tree (selfing) and mating was correlated. Consequently, seeds must be collected from a large number of seed-trees for conservation purposes. © 2010 The Author(s).

The development of breeding activity has made the genetic base narrower by inbreeding. In order to solve this problem can use a new genetic resource that is the rubber germplasm IRRDB 1981 population. The genetic relationship between these populations is important to choose parents to avoid closely related genotypes in hand pollination. Therefore RAPD analysis was carried out using four selected primers i.e. OPH-03, OPH-05, OPH-18 and OPN-06. The result showed that Wickham and IRRDB 1981 population were separated into two different big groups with genetic similarity value of 0.64, and those big groups were separated further into many small sub groups with some genetic similarity level. The genetic similarity matrix showed that Wickham and IRRDB 1981 population has a range of genetic similarity 0.37– 0.98. The highest genetic similarity was found between RRIM 600 and PN 621, while the lowest was between BPM 1 and RRIC 100. Value in this matrix showed the genetic diversity between each clone. Based on this result, rubber genotypes of Wickham population could be crossed with genotypes of IRRDB 1981 population by choosing genotypes that have low genetic similarity. © 2011 Institut Pertanian Bogor",germplasm analysis; hevea brassiliensis; molecular markers; parents selection,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931057842

An F1 half-sib family analysis of Magnolia virginiana generated from controlled pollinations was implemented to identify potential juvenile selection strategies for two mature ideotypes: a compact and rounded shrub form (to 2.5 m tall and wide) and a single-stemmed, small tree form (to 4mtall), both with abundant flowering. The 2-year test was conducted in a container nursery. Fourteen traits were measured in 2007 and 2008, including height at three intervals (July, August, and September), mean branch length and branch count, early and late flower production, collar sprout formation, stem diameter, and branch angle. There were significant differences between F1 half-sib families (P ? 0.0001) for all traits. Phenotypic and genetic correlations and narrow sense heritability were estimated for these traits. Phenotypic and genetic correlations showed favorable associations among branch count, caliper, and early flower production. These traits were used to form a selection index for a shrub ideotype. Also, there were positive phenotypic and genetic correlations between height and late flower production, which were both negatively correlated with collar sprout formation. These traits were used to form a selection index for the single-stemmed, small tree ideotype. Narrow sense heritabilities were high for most traits in 2007 but were lower in 2008. Results suggest that selection of phenotypes ranking highest for the traits of interest may yield the desired ideotypes.

However, recent findings suggest that spider crypsis plays a minor role in predator detection and some studies even showed that pollinators can become attracted to flowers harbouring Australian crab spider when the UV contrast between spider and flower increases. Here we studied the response of Apis mellifera honeybees to the presence of white or yellow Thomisus spectabilis Australian crab spiders sitting on Bidens alba inflorescences and also the response of honeybees to crab spiders that we made easily detectable painting blue their forelimbs or abdomen. To account for the visual systems of crab spider's prey, we measured the reflectance properties of the spiders and inflorescences used for the experiments. We found that honeybees did not respond to the degree of matching between spiders and inflorescences (either chromatic or achromatic contrast): They responded similarly to white and yellow spiders, to control and painted spiders. However spider UV reflection, spider size and spider movement determined honeybee behaviour: The probability that honeybees landed on spider-harbouring inflorescences was greatest when the spiders were large and had high UV reflectance or when spiders were small and reflected little UV, and honeybees were more likely to reject inflorescences if spiders moved as the bee approached the inflorescence. Our study suggests that only the large, but not the small Australian crab spiders deceive their preys by reflecting UV light, and highlights the importance of other cues that elicited an anti-predator response in honeybees. © 2011 Llandres, Rodríguez-Gironés.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951894372

Sensors report either volumetric water content (? v, m 3 m -3) or soil water potential, with ? v sensors being more common. To obtain yield and quality goals, irrigations are scheduled to keep soil water in the root zone above a management allowed deficiency (MAD) level, which is specified as a percentage of the plant available water and which may change over the cropping season and with soil type and water quality. For example, representative values for maize grown in a silty clay loam and irrigated with good quality water may be (during pollination): MAD = 40%; field capacity = 0.33 m 3 m -3; wilting point = 0.18 m 3 m -3; and water content range of the MAD = 0.33-0.27 = 0.06 m 3 m -3. In a sandy soil, the water content range of the MAD would be much smaller, e.g., 0.03 to 0.04 m 3 m -3. An important question then is: are available soil water sensors accurate enough in the field to be reliable for irrigation scheduling using MAD? We evaluated the accuracy of several down-hole access tube type electromagnetic (EM) sensors (and the neutron probe) and several EM sensors that can be buried or inserted into the soil. All sensors required soil-specific calibration, with the possible exception of conventional time domain reflecto-metry (TDR with waveform reduction). The EM sensors based on capacitance measurements were found to be least accurate, most affected by soil bulk electrical conductivity and temperature, and generally ineffective for irrigation scheduling by MAD. The neutron moisture meter and gravimetric sampling were accurate enough to use with MAD. Some insertion type EM sensors showed promise for MAD-based irrigation scheduling. The capacitance sensors suffer from a fundamental problem in that their EM fields do not uniformly permeate the soil, instead preferentially following paths of greater bulk electrical conductivity. Because of differing arrangements of conductive pathways at each sampling location, the capacitance sensors exhibited a variability that did not reflect the actual field variability in water content.",Capacitance; Electromagnetic; Neutron; Sensor; Soil water content,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053292654

We examined the influence of the time of water stress on floral development and quality by withholding water supply during successive periods from winter dormancy until flowering and initial fruit set. The experiments were carried out with three-year-old 'Picual' olive trees growing in a soil peat mixture in 50-L pots, in which control periods were irrigated to replace evapotranspirative loss and soil water content was monitored continuously. Inflorescences and flowers were evaluated at different levels of morphogenetic organization, including inflorescence, ovary and ovule development, and final fruit number and weight determined. Stress during winter dormancy produced no lasting effect and the plants recovered rapidly in response to rewatering. Water deficit during inflorescence development reduced many different flowering parameters, including inflorescence number, flower number, imperfect flower number and percentage, and ovule development, whereas prior to bloom it produced mild or no effects. When water deficit occurred during flowering and initial fruit set, the petals of many flowers dried closed and abscised as a unit, exposing a senescent stigma which was no longer receptive to pollination. Fruit production closely followed flowering parameters, with fruit number low either when flower number was reduced or fertilization inhibited.

Recent work identified a novel class of cullin-containing ubiquitin ligases (E3s) composed of CUL4, DDB1, and one WD40 protein, believed to act as a substrate receptor. Strikingly, CUL4-based E3 ligases (CRL4s) have important functions at the chromatin level, including responses to DNA damage in metazoans and plants and, in fission yeast, in heterochromatin silencing. Among putative CRL4 receptors we identified MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA1 (MSI1), which belongs to an evolutionary conserved protein family. MSI1-like proteins contribute to different protein complexes, including the epigenetic regulatory Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Here, we provide evidence that Arabidopsis MSI1 physically interacts with DDB1A and is part of a multimeric protein complex including CUL4. CUL4 and DDB1 loss-of-function lead to embryo lethality. Interestingly, as in fis class mutants, cul4 mutants exhibit autonomous endosperm initiation and loss of parental imprinting of MEDEA, a target gene of the Arabidopsis PRC2 complex. In addition, after pollination both MEDEA transcript and protein accumulate in a cul4 mutant background. Overall, our work provides the first evidence of a physical and functional link between a CRL4 E3 ligase and a PRC2 complex, thus indicating a novel role of ubiquitylation in the repression of gene expression. © 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.",Arabidopsis; CUL4; parental imprinting; Polycomb repressive complex 2; seed development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951809027

The progressive introgression of transgenes into wild or weedy populations thus appears inevitable, and we are now faced with the challenge of determining the possible evolutionary effects of these transgenes. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the impact of interspecific hybridization between transgenic plants and weedy relatives on the evolution of the weedy phenotype. Methodology/Principal Findings: Experimental populations of weedy birdseed rape (Brassica rapa) and transgenic rapeseed (B. napus) were grown under glasshouse conditions. Hybridization opportunities with transgenic plants and phenotypic traits (including phenological, morphological and reproductive traits) were measured for each weedy individual. We show that weedy individuals that flowered later and for longer periods were more likely to receive transgenic pollen from crops and weed×crop hybrids. Because stem diameter is correlated with flowering time, plants with wider stems were also more likely to be pollinated by transgenic plants. We also show that the weedy plants with the highest probability of hybridization had the lowest fecundity. Conclusion/Significance: Our results suggest that weeds flowering late and for long periods are less fit because they have a higher probability of hybridizing with crops or weed×crop hybrids. This may result in counter-selection against this subset of weed phenotypes, and a shorter earlier flowering period. It is noteworthy that this potential evolution in flowering time does not depend on the presence of the transgene in the crop. Evolution in flowering time may even be counter-balanced by positive selection acting on the transgene if the latter was positively associated with maternal genes promoting late flowering and long flowering periods. Unfortunately, we could not verify this association in the present experiment. © 2011 Vacher et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751499599

The ecological consequences of this trade-off for tropical trees remain poorly resolved, despite their potential importance for tropical forest conservation. We investigated the flower size number trade-off and its implications for fecundity in a sample of tree species from the Dipterocarpaceae on Borneo. Methodology/Principal Findings: We combined experimental exclusion of pollinators in 11 species, with direct and indirect estimates of contemporary pollen dispersal in two study species and published estimates of pollen dispersal in a further three species to explore the relationship between flower size, pollinator size and mean pollen dispersal distance. Maximum flower production was two orders of magnitude greater in small-flowered than large-flowered species of Dipterocarpaceae. In contrast, fruit production was unrelated to flower size and did not differ significantly among species. Small-flowered species had both smaller-sized pollinators and lower mean pollination success than large-flowered species. Average pollen dispersal distances were lower and frequency of mating between related individuals was higher in a smaller-flowered species than a larger-flowered confamilial. Our synthesis of pollen dispersal estimates across five species of dipterocarp suggests that pollen dispersal scales positively with flower size. Conclusions and Their Significance: Trade-offs embedded in the relationship between flower size and pollination success contribute to a reduction in the variance of fecundity among species. It is therefore plausible that these processes could delay competitive exclusion and contribute to maintenance of species coexistence in this ecologically and economically important family of tropical trees. These results have practical implications for tree species conservation and restoration. Seed collection from small-flowered species may be especially vulnerable to cryptic genetic erosion. Our findings also highlight the potential for differential vulnerability of tropical tree species to the deleterious consequences of forest fragmentation. © 2011 Kettle et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551635092

The showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers of the model species Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae) are highly specialized for bee pollination. In A. majus, CYCLOIDEA (CYC), DICHOTOMA (DICH), RADIALIS (RAD), and DIVARICATA (DIV) specify the development of floral bilateral symmetry. However, it is unclear to what extent evolution of these genes has resulted in flower morphological divergence among closely related members of Plantaginaceae differing in pollination syndrome. We compared floral symmetry genes from insect-pollinated Digitalis purpurea, which has bilaterally symmetrical flowers, with those from closely related Aragoa abietina and wind-pollinated Plantago major, both of which have radially symmetrical flowers. We demonstrate that Plantago, but not Aragoa, species have lost a dorsally expressed CYC-like gene and downstream targets RAD and DIV. Furthermore, the single P. major CYC-like gene is expressed across all regions of the flower, similar to expression of its ortholog in closely related Veronica serpyllifolia. We propose that changes in the expression of duplicated CYC-like genes led to the evolution of radial flower symmetry in Aragoa/Plantago, and that further disintegration of the symmetry gene pathway resulted in the wind-pollination syndrome of Plantago.

Recently, complex network theory has been applied to ecological entities, like food webs or mutualistic plantanimal interactions. Unfortunately, we still lack an accurate view of the relationship between the architecture and functioning of ecological networks. In this study we explore this link by building individual-based pollination networks from eight Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae) populations. In these individual-based networks, each individual plant in a population was considered a node, and was connected by means of undirected links to conspecifics sharing pollinators. The architecture of these unipartite networks was described by means of nestedness, connectivity and transitivity. Network functioning was estimated by quantifying the performance of the population described by each network as the number of per-capita juvenile plants produced per population. We found a consistent relationship between the topology of the networks and their functioning, since variation across populations in the average per-capita production of juvenile plants was positively and significantly related with network nestedness, connectivity and clustering. Subtle changes in the composition of diverse pollinator assemblages can drive major consequences for plant population performance and local persistence through modifications in the structure of the inter-plant pollination networks. © 2011 Gómez et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551536430

The global trade in commercial bumble bee (Bombus spp.) colonies provides pollination services for both glasshouse and open-field crops. For example, in the United Kingdom, commercial colonies of nonnative subspecies of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. imported from mainland Europe are widely used for the pollination of raspberries, Rubus idaeus L. The extent to which these commercial colonies supplement the services provided by wild pollinators has not been formally quantified and the impact of commercial bumble bees on native bees visiting the crop is unknown. Here, the impacts of allowing commercially available bumble bee colonies to forage on raspberry canes are assessed in terms of the yield of marketable fruit produced and the pollinator communities found foraging on raspberry flowers. No differences were found in the abundance, diversity, or composition of social bee species observed visiting raspberry flowers when commercial bumble bees were deployed compared with when they were absent. However, weight of marketable raspberries produced increased when commercial bees were present, indicating that wild pollinator services alone are inadequate for attaining maximum yields. The findings of the study suggests that proportional yield increases associated with deployment of commercial colonies may be small, but that nevertheless, investment in commercial colonies for raspberry pollination could produce very significant increases in net profit for the grower. Given potential environmental risks associated with the importation of nonnative bumble bees, the development of alternative solutions to the pollination deficit in raspberry crops in the United Kingdom may be beneficial. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.",agriculture; Bombus terrestris; pollination limitation; Rubus idaeus; Scotland,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952179795

Sexually deceptive orchids are adapted to attract specific male insects that are fooled into attempting to mate with orchid flowers and inadvertently acting as pollinators. This review summarises current knowledge, explores new hypotheses in the literature, and introduces some new approaches to understanding sexual deception from the perspective of the duped pollinator. Four main topics are addressed: (1) global patterns in sexual deception, (2) pollinator identities, mating systems and behaviours, (3) pollinator perception of orchid deceptive signals, and (4) the evolutionary implications of pollinator responses to orchid deception, including potential costs imposed on pollinators by orchids. A global list of known and putative sexually deceptive orchids and their pollinators is provided and methods for incorporating pollinator perspectives into sexual deception research are provided and reviewed. At present, almost all known sexually deceptive orchid taxa are from Australia or Europe. A few sexually deceptive species and genera are reported for New Zealand and South Africa. In Central and Southern America, Asia, and the Pacific many more species are likely to be identified in the future. Despite the great diversity of sexually deceptive orchid genera in Australia, pollination rates reported in the literature are similar between Australian and European species. The typical pollinator of a sexually deceptive orchid is a male insect of a species that is polygynous, monandrous, haplodiploid, and solitary rather than social. Insect behaviours involved in the pollination of sexually deceptive orchids include pre-copulatory gripping of flowers, brief entrapment, mating, and very rarely, ejaculation. Pollinator behaviour varies within and among pollinator species. Deception involving orchid mimicry of insect scent signals is becoming well understood for some species, but visual and tactile signals such as colour, shape, and texture remain neglected. Experimental manipulations that test for function, multi-signal interactions, and pollinator perception of these signals are required. Furthermore, other forms of deception such as exploitation of pollinator sensory biases or mating preferences merit more comprehensive investigation. Application of molecular techniques adapted from model plants and animals is likely to deliver new insights into orchid signalling, and pollinator perception and behaviour. There is little current evidence that sexual deception drives any species-level selection on pollinators. Pollinators do learn to avoid deceptive orchids and their locations, but this is not necessarily a response specific to orchids. Even in systems where evidence suggests that orchids do interfere with pollinator mating opportunities, considerable further research is required to determine whether this is sufficient to impose selection on pollinators or generate antagonistic coevolution or an arms race between orchids and their pollinators. Botanists, taxonomists and chemical ecologists have made remarkable progress in the study of deceptive orchid pollination.

It is well established that many animal-pollinated plants suffer lower seed set than they are capable of, likely because of competition for pollinators. Previously, competition for pollinator services has been shown to be most intense in communities with the greatest plant diversity. In spite of the fact that community evolutionary relations have a demonstrated impact on many ecological processes, their role in competition for pollinator services has rarely been examined. Methods: In this study, we explore relations among several aspects of the surrounding plant community, including species richness, phylodiversity, evolutionary distance from a focal species, and pollen limitation in an annual insect-pollinated plant. Key results: We did not fi nd a signifi cant effect of species richness on competition for pollination. However, consistent with a greater role for facilitation than competition, we found that a focal species occurring in communities composed of species of close relatives, especially other members of the Asteraceae, was less pollen limited than when it occurred in communities composed of more distant relatives. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that community phylodiversity is an important correlate of pollen limitation in this system and that it has greater explanatory power than species richness alone. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Competition; Ecosystem services; Facilitation; Phylogenetic community structure; Pollen limitation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851494290

Interactions with other organisms on one side of the soil surface may have impacts that extend across this boundary. Although our understanding of plant-herbivore interactions is derived largely from studies of leaf herbivory, belowground root herbivores may affect plant fitness directly or by altering interactions with other organisms, such as pollinators. In this study, we investigated the effects of leaf herbivory, root herbivory, and pollination on plant growth, subsequent leaf herbivory, flower production, pollinator attraction, and reproduction in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). We manipulated leaf and root herbivory with striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) adults and larvae, respectively, and manipulated pollination with supplemental pollen. Both enhanced leaf and root herbivory reduced plant growth, and leaf herbivory reduced subsequent leaf damage. Plants with enhanced root herbivory produced 35% fewer female flowers, while leaf herbivory had no effect on flower production. While leaf herbivory reduced the time that honey bees spent probing flowers by 29%, probing times on root-damaged plants were over twice as long as those on control plants. Root herbivory increased pollen limitation for seed production in spite of increased honey bee preference for plants with root damage. Leaf damage and hand-pollination treatments had no effect on fruit production, but plants with enhanced root damage produced 38% fewer fruits that were 25% lighter than those on control plants. Despite the positive effect of belowground damage on honey bee visitation, root herbivory had a stronger negative effect on plant reproduction than leaf herbivory. These results demonstrate that the often-overlooked effects of belowground herbivores may have profound effects on plant performance. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Acalymma vittatum; Cucumis sativus; Indirect effects; Pollinator visitation; Root herbivory,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651426670

This may, however, conflict with a general tendency for size-related traits to covary. Previous studies have addressed this fundamental conflict by analysing natural variation across samples of structures, but here we compare the effects of experimentally induced environmental differences on variation in serially homologous pollination and vegetative traits. 2.We examined the effects of experimental variation in nutrient availability and total daily irradiance on two pairs of serially homologous traits in two populations of Dalechampia scandens: (i) The length of the floral bract blade and the length of the leaf blade, and (ii) the length of stipules associated with bracts and leaves. The first pair contrasts a floral trait that is likely to experience canalizing selection (bract blade) with a homologous vegetative trait that does not experience canalizing selection (leaf blade). The second contrasts homologous floral and vegetative traits that are likely to experience similar selective pressures. We also examined variational properties of two blossom traits that interact directly with pollinators: the area of the resin gland and the length of the styles. 3.Variation in the bract blades was decoupled from variation in the vegetative traits and followed the variational patterns of the two blossom traits that are functional in pollination. Stipules associated with bracts and leaves were affected similarly by the experimental treatments in a pattern characteristic of vegetative traits. 4.These results are consistent with the Berg hypothesis of decoupling and canalization of specialized floral structures and support the idea that the variability can evolve in response to selection on variation. © 2010 The Authors.

In this study, we examine the role of pollinators and breeding system on the evolution of floral traits by comparing the patterns of floral phenotypic variances and covariances in 20 Ipomoea species that differ in their level of pollination specialization and pollinator dependence incorporating phylogenetic relatedness. Plants with specialized pollination (i.e., those pollinated by one functional group or by few morphospecies) displayed less phenotypic variation and greater floral integration than generalist plants. Self-compatible species also displayed greater floral integration than self-incompatible species. Floral traits involved in pollen placement and pick up showed less variation and greater integration than floral traits involved in pollinator attraction. Analytical models indicate that both breeding system and the number of morphospecies had significant effects on floral integration patterns although only differences in the former were significant after accounting for phylogeny. These results suggest that specialist/self-compatible plants experience more consistent selection on floral traits than generalist/self-incompatible plants. Furthermore, pollinators and breeding system promote integration of floral traits involved in pollen placement and pick up rather than integration of the whole flower. © 2010 The Author(s).

Although increasing evidence exists of pollinator-mediated selection acting on female reproductive success, there is still limited understanding of pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits via male reproductive success. Here we quantify potential selection by the ruby-throated hummingbird, Archilochus colubris, on four floral traits of hermaphroditic Silene exerted through male floral function. Methods: In single trait manipulative experiments we quantified hummingbird visitation preference and/or fluorescent dye (a pollen analog) donation as a function of number of flowers displayed (inflorescence size), height of the floral display (infl orescence height), floral color, and corolla tube length. Key results: Hummingbirds preferred to visit larger floral displays and floral displays at greater height, likely representing a general pollinator preference for larger, more visible signals and/or greater rewards. In addition, hummingbirds preferred to visit red flowers, and male function was greater in flowers manipulated to have longer corolla tubes. Conclusions: Selection pressures exerted by hummingbirds on S. virginica floral and infl orescence design through male reproductive success are consistent with the contemporary expression of floral traits of S. virginica relative to related Silene species with different pollinators, and they are consistent with the hummingbird syndrome of traits expressed by S. virginica. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Male fitness; Male reproductive success; Pollination syndromes; Selection; Silene virginica; Trait manipulation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851491152

Competition for pollination may lower plant reproductive success by reducing the number of pollinator probes or by decreasing the quality of pollen transport to or from a focal species. Pair-wise interactions between plants sharing pollinators have been well documented. However, relatively few studies have examined interactions for pollination among three or more plant species, and little is known about how the outcomes and mechanisms of competition for pollination may vary with competitor species composition. To better understand how the dynamics of competition for pollination may be influenced by changes in the number of competitors, we manipulated the presence of two competitors, Lythrum salicaria and Lobelia siphilitica, and quantified reproductive success for a third species, Mimulus ringens. Patterns of pollinator preference and interspecific transitions in mixed-species arrays were significantly influenced by the species composition of competitor plants present. Both pair-wise and three-species competition treatments led to a similar ~ 40% reduction in Mimulus ringens seed set. However, the patterns of pollinator foraging we observed suggest that the relative importance of different mechanisms of competition for pollination may vary with the identity and number of competitors present. This variation in mechanisms of competition for pollination may be especially important in diverse plant communities where many species interact through shared pollinators. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751622163

Because floral VOCs are cues for both pollinators and floral antagonists, variation in emission may have major consequences for costs and benefits in plant-pollinator interactions. In Polemonium viscosum, the emission rate for the floral VOC 2-phenylethanol (2PE) spans more than two orders of magnitude. We investigated the ecological and evolutionary impacts of this immense phenotypic variation. The emission rate of 2PE varies independently of nectar rewards and thus is uninformative of profitability. Emission is elevated in flowers that are morphologically vulnerable to ant larcenists, suggesting that chemical deterrence may compensate for weak physical barriers. In nature, plants emitting more 2PE than their neighbors escape ant damage. Flower-damaging ants die when exposed to 2PE in the laboratory, and they avoid high 2PE emitters in the field. High 2PE also reduces bumblebee visitation and pollination, suggesting an ecological cost of defense in pollinator service.

In conclusion, repellency of 2PE is highly sensitive to dosage, giving it a key role in shaping ecological interactions between skypilot plants and their floral visitors. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",Conditional ecological trade-off; Floral fragrance; Floral larceny; Multimodal signaling; Pollination; VOC,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751475040

However, spider UV reflection seems to vary broadly within and between individuals and species, and we are still lacking any comparative studies of prey and/or predator behaviour towards spider colour variation.Here we looked at the natural variation in the coloration of two species of Australian crab spiders, Thomisus spectabilis and Diaea evanida, collected from the field. Furthermore, we examined how two species of native bees responded to variation in colour contrast generated by spiders sitting in flowers compared with vacant flowers. We used data from a bee choice experiment with D. evanida spiders and Trigona carbonaria bees and also published data on T. spectabilis spiders and Austroplebeia australis bees.In the field both spider species were always achromatically (from a distance) undetectable but chromatically (at closer range) detectable for bees. Experimentally, we showed species-specific differences in bee behaviour towards particular spider colour variation: T. carbonaria bees did not show any preference for any colour contrasts generated by D. evanida spiders but A. australis bees were more likely to reject flowers with more contrasting T. spectabilis spiders.Our study suggests that some of the spider colour variation that we encounter in the field may be partly explained by the spider's ability to adjust the reflectance properties of its colour relative to the behaviour of the species of prey available. © 2010 The Authors.

Yet, it has been theoretically shown that random fluctuations in pollination conditions select for the opposite association of traits. In nature, however, various ecological factors may deviate from random variations, and thus create temporal correlation in pollination conditions. Here, we develop a model to assess the effects of pollination condition autocorrelation on the joint evolution of dispersal and self-fertilization. Basically, two syndromes are found: dispersing outcrossers and nondispersing (partial) selfers. Importantly, (1) selfers are never associated with dispersal, whereas complete outcrossers are, and (2) the disperser/outcrosser syndrome is favored (resp. disfavored) by negative (resp. positive) autocorrelation in pollination conditions. Our results suggest that observed dispersal/mating system syndromes may depend heavily on the regime of pollination condition fluctuations. We also point out potential negative evolutionary effects of anthropic management of the environment on outcrossing species. © 2010 The Author(s).

In animal-pollinated species, wide variation in ovule number per flower occurs, and this contrasts with wind-pollinated plants, where most species possess uniovulate flowers. This pattern is usually explained as an adaptive response to low pollen receipt in wind-pollinated species. Here, we develop a phenotypic model for the evolution of ovule number per flower that incorporates the aerodynamics of pollen capture and a fixed resource pool for provisioning of flowers, ovules, and seeds. Our results challenge the prevailing explanation for the association between uniovulate flowers and wind pollination. We demonstrate that when flowers are small and inexpensive, as they are in wind-pollinated species, ovule number should be minimized and lower than the average number of pollen tubes per style, even under stochastic pollination and fertilization regimes. The model predicts that plants benefit from producing many small inexpensive flowers, even though some flowers capture too few pollen grains to fertilize their ovules. Wind-pollinated plants with numerous flowers distributed throughout the inflorescence, each with a single ovule or a few ovules, sample more of the airstream, and this should maximize pollen capture and seed production. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",Flower size; Ovule number; Pollen limitation; Pollen-capture efficiency; Resource allocation; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751520904

In order for gynodioecy to evolve from hermaphroditism, the carriers of a male-sterility mutation (i.e., females) must overcome two major hurdles: females must attract pollinators without offering pollen as a reward, and they must produce enough seeds to compensate for the loss of reproduction through the paternal route. We investigated the relative performance of female and hermaphroditic plants in a greenhouse study of Mimulus guttatus originating from a largely hermaphroditic population. Females had larger floral displays than did hermaphrodites, with 5% wider corollas and 34% more flowers open at one time. They also produced 22% more flowers over a lifetime and 25% more ovules per ovary than hermaphrodites, giving females 1.53 times more maternal reproductive potential. In a related experiment, bumblebees visited female plants just as frequently as hermaphroditic plants, even though the females offered no pollen reward. Although the relative advantages enjoyed by females may be insufficient to overcome the obstacles for the evolution of stable gynodioecy, they might be strong enough to explain the maintenance of genetic variation for male-sterility alleles often observed in natural populations of M. guttatus. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

It is believed that greater reciprocity between morphs will promote more efficient transfer of pollen. Additionally, efficient pollination will act as a selective force in achieving greater reciprocity between floral morphs. In this study we test whether variation in reciprocity of sexual organs between morphs is related to the efficiency of pollinators in transferring pollen between them. To do this, we first describe the pollinator's array in several populations of species of the genus formerly known as Lithodora, which have different types of stylar polymorphism and degrees of reciprocity, and determine their abundance, plant visitation rate, number of flowers visited per plant and handling time in the population. We estimate the efficiency of the pollinator arrays by use of an approximation based on qualitative (location of pollen loads on different areas of insect bodies) and quantitative (plant visitation rate) measurements. Our results show a correlation between the degree of reciprocity and the efficiency of pollinators associated with the populations. These observations suggest that pollinators are a possible selective force driving the evolution of heterostyly. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Darwin; Disassortative mating; Heterostyly; Stylar polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951511306

The study assessed two sunflower cultivars (P64A52 and GK-70), three growth stages (R1, R3 and R5) and five defoliation levels (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%). Significant differences among cultivars were observed for all characters except for days to maturity, with hybrid cultivar having greater sensitivity. Growth stages significantly affected days to maturity, seed filling percentage, the ratio of dehulled/hulled seed weight, and seed yield. When compared to cultivar and growth stages, the effect of defoliation applications was more pronounced. All agronomic characters were adversely influenced by increased levels of defoliation. Hundred percent defoliation reduced oil content by 26.3% and seed yield by 89% compared to the non-defoliated plots. Low levels of defoliation during the early reproductive growth stages (R1 and R3) did not result in a significant reduction in yield.

We examined the potential for insects, lizards, and mammals to act as pollinators. Observations and experiments on breeding system, phenology, floral scent, flower visitors, and lizard feeding were undertaken in southern Australia. Acrotriche serrulata sets little fruit by autonomous selfing but readily sets fruit after facilitated geitonogamy and xenogamy. Flower anthesis is diurnal and nocturnal. The nectar profile includes acetaldehyde, ethanol, and ethyl acetate. The nocturnal mammals Trichosurus vulpecula and the introduced Rattus rattus were the only visitors observed to actively forage on the flowers. In contrast, the skinks Egernia whitii, Niveoscincus ocellatus, and Niveoscincus metallicus routinely passed flowers full of nectar and foraged only on those presented during feeding observations. Insects visited the flowers but did not behave as pollinators. Acrotriche serrulata is likely to be pollinated by nocturnal mammals attracted to its flowers by scent. Effective pollinators appear to be rare over some of its range.

Among them, gall-inducing Sycophaginae (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea) may share a common history with Ficus and their mutualistic pollinators (Agaonidae). We investigate here, for the first time, the phylogeny and biogeographical history of Sycophaginae and compare the timing of radiation and dispersion of major clades with available data on Ficus and fig pollinators. Reconstructing the history of their host colonization and association over space and time is central to understanding how fig wasp communities were assembled.Location World-wide.Methods Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were conducted on 4267 bp of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to produce a phylogeny of all genera of Sycophaginae. Two relaxed clock methods with or without rate autocorrelation were used for date estimation. Analyses of ancestral area were also conducted to investigate the geographical origin of the Sycophaginae.Results The phylogeny is well resolved and supported. Our data suggest a post-Gondwanan origin for the Sycophaginae (50-40 Ma) and two independent out-of-Australia dispersal events to continental Asia. Given palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic records, the following scenario appears the most likely. The ancestor of Idarnes+Apocryptophagus migrated to Greater India through the Ninetyeast Ridge (40-30 Ma). The ancestor of Anidarnes+Conidarnes dispersed later via Sundaland (25-20 Ma). Idarnes and Anidarnes subsequently reached the New World via the North Atlantic land bridges during the Late Oligocene Warming Event. Apocryptophagus reached Africa c. 20 Ma via the Arabic corridors and returned to Australasia following the expansion of Sundaland tropical forests (20-10 Ma).Main conclusions Sycophaginae probably invaded the fig microcosm in Australia c. 50-40 Ma after the origin of their host plant. Once associated with figs, they dispersed out of Australia and radiated together with their host fig and associated pollinator through the tropics. We recorded a good coincidence of timing between dispersal events of Sycophaginae and continental connections. Furthermore, fruit pigeons that disperse figs probably spread out of Australasia through the Indian Ocean via the Ninetyeast Ridge c. 38 Ma. Therefore, our study highlights the potential for combining molecular phylogenetics with multiple methods of dating of interacting groups to reconstruct the historical biogeography of plant-herbivore associations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biogeography; Dispersal; Divergence times; Ficus; Fig wasps; Gall-inducing insects; Ninetyeast Ridge; Phylogeny,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751542813

The differences of fruit set in five olive cultivars after tested pollination treatments appeared at the time of initial fruit set. Increased final fruit set under cross-pollinations was observed when compared with self-pollination for all olive cultivars in all experimental orchards. In the Mravince orchard, a positive response to cross-pollination was consistent, and fruit set increased under cross-pollination in all cultivars and years with the exception of 'Levantinka' in which no significant differences were noticed between self-pollination treatment and cross-pollination treatments in 2005. Variable self-fertility behavior from season to season was found for tested cultivars. A self-incompatibility index (ISI) higher than 0.1 was recorded for 'Levantinka' in all experimental years and, therefore, classified it as a partially self-incompatible cultivar. Self-incompatibility response was observed for 'Lastovka'. The positive response to crosspollination over self-pollination only in some experimental years classified 'Drobnica', 'Leccino', and 'Oblica' as partially self-incompatible. Results obtained from this study indicated that pollination efficiency is strictly combination-specific. The Italian cultivar, Leccino, was a successful pollen acceptor and pollenizer of most Croatian cultivars. Reciprocal high success in cross-pollination was recorded for 'Levantinka' and 'Oblica'. In the Mravince orchard, 'Lastovka', 'Leccino', and 'Oblica' were efficient pollenizers of 'Levantinka' where the simultaneous flowering period was in accordance with their crosscompatibility. 'Levantinka' was a good pollenizer for 'Lastovka' in the Mravince orchard, and both cultivars entered into the flowering period earlier than other studied cultivars, which was not the case in the other two orchards. The variations in flowering timing among orchards were a consequence of differences in environmental conditions. According to the high fruit sets recorded in 'Oblica' after pollination with 'Leccino' or 'Levantinka', an increase in tree productivity of the acceptor cultivar is expected in the presence of selected pollenizers in all olive-growing regions.",Cross-compatibility; Flowering period; Olea europaea; Self-incompatibility index; Selfincompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951613314

They are regarded as mechanisms to avoid selfing, to promote outcrossing and, particularly in self-incompatible plants, to reduce sexual interference. However, little is known about the extent to which these mechanisms reduce sexual interference, and whether this reduction impacts fitness. 2.We studied patterns of dichogamy and herkogamy, their influence on sexual interference, and the fitness outcome in self-incompatible Passiflora incarnata. We manipulated flowers to be adichogamous or unisexual to evaluate fruit production under increased and decreased sexual interference. 3.Incomplete protandry guaranteed that almost half of the pollen could be successfully exported without interfering with the stigmas, indicating dichogamy may facilitate male pollination success. We found no difference in pollen deposition between natural and emasculated flowers, suggesting that herkogamy does not decrease self pollination. Increased herkogamy resulted in reduced pollen deposition and lower probability of setting fruits, however, a higher seed number. No difference in female fitness was detected under experimentally increased or decreased sexual interference. 4.Taken together, our results suggest that dichogamy is mostly driven by the advantage to male fitness and herkogamy is chiefly determined by female fitness. The lack of difference in female fitness under varied levels of sexual interference indicates that male function is more likely to play a role in shaping floral traits that reduce sexual interference. © 2010 The Authors.

Although bees are the most important pollinators, they are endangered by intensive agricultural practices. The present study investigated the effects of farmland management and environmental factors at local and landscape scales on bees in Central Hungary.2Bees were sampled in winter cereal fields that varied in the amount of applied fertilizer and insecticide use. Measurements included total, small and large bee species richness and abundance; stability of total species richness and abundance (coefficient of variation, CV); the nitrogen content of fertilizers; the number of insecticide applications; within-field location; species richness and abundance of insect-pollinated plants; and the percentage of semi-natural areas in a 500-m radius circle around the fields under study.3Increasing the amount of fertilizer decreased total and small bee abundance and increased the CV of total bee abundance. Insecticide use had a significant negative effect on total and small bee species richness and on large bee abundance. The percentage of semi-natural habitats in a 500 m radius did not influence bee species richness and abundance.4The results obtained confirms that the intensification of farmland management poses a threat to bee diversity, and thus may reduce pollination services. Recently-introduced agri-environment schemes are one potential approach for managing agricultural land use: reduced amounts of fertilizer and a cessation of insecticide application might lead to high bee species richness and abundance and ensure the pollination of wild plants and flowering crops. © 2010 The Authors.

While both groups are specialised in their feeding apparatuses, hummingbirds are moreover famous for their adaptations to sustained hovering flight. Recently, an example of a pollination system of the invasive plant Nicotiana glauca has been used to show that less adapted sunbirds also are frequently able to hover. Nevertheless, the question has remained why plants adapted to bird hovering pollination do not occur outside the New World. In this paper we show that the long-peduncle Cameroonian Impatiens sakeriana is not capable of autonomous selfing and can be pollinated only by two often hovering sunbirds, the Cameroon sunbird Cyanomitra oritis and the northern double-collared sunbird Cinnyris reichenowi. Our study revealed that this plant is highly specialised for pollination by C. oritis. Cinnyris reichenowi hovers less frequently and often thieves nectar by piercing the flower spur when perching.

To detect a possible epistatic effect and a spatial scale at which it operates, we created artificial crosses between plants spanning a range of fixed distances from 1 to 400 m in three populations of wild barley. The self-pollinated and crossed progeny (F1) and two generations of segregated progeny (F2 and F3) were tested in experimentally simulated population environments for relative performance (RP). The measured fitness traits included number of seeds, total seed weight and seed germination. For any of these traits, there was no association between RP of F1, F2 and F3 plants and either pairwise kinship coefficients or crossing distance. In contrast, in all three populations, we found lower seed viability of outcrossed as compared with self-pollinated genotypes in the first generation of segregation. However, in the F3 generation this outbreeding effect disappeared in the two populations and greatly decreased in the third population. For seed production, heterosis in F1 and outbreeding depression in F2 were observed only in the population with unusually high number of heterozygotes. Our findings support the view that in selfing species a spatial mosaic of various locally abundant genotypes represents not randomly fixed combinations of alleles but the co-adapted gene complexes that were sieved by selection, while heterozygotes are characteristic for the transient phase of this process, when segregation and purging of maladaptive genotypes have not yet occurred. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Coadaptation; epistasis; fitness; heterosis; self-pollination; wild barley,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751646178

In early-divergent angiosperms, a widespread system is dichogamy, in which female and male structures do not mature simultaneously, thus encouraging cross pollination. While this system is common in early-divergent angiosperms, it is less widespread in more recently evolved clades. An evaluation of the consequences of this system on outbreeding may provide clues on this change, but this subject has been little explored. Methods: In this work, we characterized the cycle and anatomy of the flower and studied the influence of temperature and humidity on stigmatic receptivity in Annona cherimola, a member of an early-divergent angiosperm clade with protogynous dichogamy. Key results: Paternity analysis reveals a high proportion of seeds resulting from self-fertilization, indicating that self-pollination can occur in spite of the dichogamous system. Stigmatic receptivity is environmentally modulated-shortened by high temperatures and prolonged by high humidity. Conclusions: Although spatial and temporal sexual separation in this system seems to effectively decrease selfing, the system is modulated by environmental conditions and may allow high levels of selfing that can guarantee reproductive assurance. © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Annona cherimola; Annonaceae; Cherimoya; Dichogamy; Environmental modulation; Stigmatic receptivity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851494704

The yellow flowers bear a central cone of staminodes that encloses the fertile stamens and four free carpels. The self-incompatible species depends on pollinators to set fruits. In 25 temporary water bodies in five Brazilian states, Protodiscelis palpalis bees (Colletidae, Paracolletinae) were the unique effective pollinators of H. martii and, in 18 of these, the sole flower visitors. Females of this narrowly oligolectic species show adapted behaviour to access the pollen chamber in the flower centre. Females removed more than 80% of the 480 000 pollen grains in only 2h from the flowers but maintained a high visitation frequency almost until flower senescence. In this highly specialized plant-pollinator system, on average, 1.6% of the pollen grains reached the stigmatic surface and 9.6% remained uncollectible in the flowers. In the absence of P. palpalis, flowers set almost no seeds, indicating reproductive dependence on the oligolectic species.

However, both continue to be identified as two distinct species and are enumerated in the threatened species list. The goal of this study was to compare the reproductive biology of sympatric populations of these two morphs so as to identify morphological characters and mechanisms of reproductive isolation that could help to clarify species boundaries. Individuals of E. edulis and E. espiritosantensis show differences in size and duration of the peduncular bract, and differ in regard to inflorescence and immature fruit coloration. With an overlapping flowering period, but with distinctly different flowering peaks, the two taxa share the main visitors, viz. different Apidae and some Vespidae. Fruit and viable seeds are produced after self-, cross- and inter-specific cross-pollination in both morphs. Seed germination is significantly higher in E. edulis than in E. espiritosantensis. Differences in morphological and reproductive features suggest that these sympatric populations of two Euterpe morphs are to a reasonable degree reproductively isolated, which supports the recognition of E. espiritosantensis as a distinct species from E. edulis. The potential for hybridization does not reject the hypothesis of species distinctness, but points to a potential case of sympatric speciation that merits further investigations. Given that natural populations of Euterpe are nowadays fragmented and reduced in area of occurrence, retaining the high conservation status for E. espiritosantensis will help to safeguard this taxonomic entity under considerable threat. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",Atlantic Forest; Conservation; Hybridization; Reproductive biology; Reproductive isolation; Sympatry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551497856

However, the mechanisms by which these aboveand belowground mutualisms affect plant speciation and coexistence remain obscure. We provide evidence that shifts in pollination traits are important for both speciation and coexistence in a diverse group of orchids, whereas shifts in fungal partner are important for coexistence but not for speciation. Phylogenetic analyses show that recently diverged orchid species tend either to use different pollinator species or to place pollen on different body parts of the same species, consistent with the role of pollination-mode shifts in speciation. Field experiments provide support for the hypothesis that colonization of new geographical areas requires adaptation to new pollinator species, whereas co-occurring orchid species share pollinator species by placing pollen on different body parts. In contrast to pollinators, fungal partners are conserved between closely related orchid species, and orchids recruit the same fungal species even when transplanted to different areas.

Genetic rescue, that is, controlled input of diversity from distant populations, may restore evolutionary potential, whereas outbreeding depression might counteract the positive effect of this strategy. We carried out self-pollination and crosses within and between populations in an experimental subdivided population of a selfing species, Triticum aestivum L., to estimate the magnitude of these two phenomena. Surprisingly, for a self-fertilizing species, we found significant inbreeding depression within each population for four of the six traits studied, indicating that mildly deleterious mutations were still segregating in these populations. The progeny of within- and between-population crosses was very similar, indicating low between-population heterosis and little outbreeding depression. We conclude that relatively large population effective sizes prevented fixation of a high genetic load and that local adaptation was limited in these recently diverged populations. The kinship coefficient estimated between the parents using 20 neutral markers was a poor predictor of the progeny phenotypic values, indicating that there was a weak link between neutral diversity and genes controlling fitness-related traits. These results show that when assessing the viability of natural populations and the need for genetic rescue, the use of neutral markers should be complemented with information about the presence of local adaptation in the subdivided population. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",genetic load; genetic rescue; heterosis; Inbreeding depression; local adaptation; outbreeding depression,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751641232

However, little is still known about the evolution of floral traits, a critical piece of evidence for the understanding of the processes that may have driven flower evolution. We studied the pattern of evolution of quantitative floral traits in a group of Neotropical lianas (Bignonieae, Bignoniaceae) and used a time-calibrated phylogeny as basis to: (1) test for phylogenetic signal in 16 continuous floral traits; (2) evaluate the rate of evolution in those traits; and (3) reconstruct the ancestral state of the individual traits. Variation in floral traits among extant species of Bignonieae was highly explained by their phylogenetic history. However, opposite signals were found in floral traits associated with the attraction of pollinators (calyx and corolla) and pollen transfer (androecium and gynoecium), suggesting a differential role of selection in different floral whorls. Phylogenetic independent contrasts indicate that traits evolved at different rates, whereas ancestral character state reconstructions indicate that the ancestral size of most flower traits was larger than the mean observed sizes of the same traits in extant species.

Using both experimental and observational studies, we investigated natural patterns of pollen removal and deposition, visiting frequency of pollinators, patterns of nectar secretion, and effects of pollen removal and stigmatic pollen deposition on the duration of sexual phases in a protandrous plant, Glechoma longituba. We found that visiting frequency of pollinators correlated with the nectar secretion pattern. The nectar volume during the male phase was higher than during the female phase. In the morning, the main pollinator, the bee Anthophora plumipes, mainly foraged for nectar and showed no preference for flowers in male or female phase, despite male phase flowers producing higher amounts of nectar. However, in the afternoon, they changed their behavior and foraged mainly for pollen, and then showed a preference for flowers in male phase. Furthermore, the rates of pollen removal and stigmatic pollen deposition can affect the starting time and the duration of the female phase. When pollen removal and pollination rates are low due to scarcity of pollinator services, the sexual phase can be prolonged, leading to an overlap, and thereby enhance the chance for sexual reproduction through pollinator-facilitated self-pollination. We consider the variation of sexual phases in Glechoma longituba an adaptive mechanism prepared for both cross-pollination enhancement and reproductive assurance depending on the available pollination services. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951904446

The CYCLOIDEA/TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 (CYC/TB1) -like genes have been implicated in the development and evolution of fl oral symmetry in numerous lineages. We thus chose to investigate a possible role for these genes in the evolution of fl oral symmetry within petaloid monocots, using the order Zingiberales as a model system. In the Zingiberales, evolutionary shifts in symmetry have occurred in all fl oral whorls, making the order ideal for studying the evolution of this ecologically signifi cant trait. • Methods: We analyzed TB1- like (TBL) genes from taxa spanning the order in a phylogenetic context. Using RNA in situ hybridization, we examined the expression of two TBL genes in Costus spicatus (Costaceae) and Heliconia stricta (Heliconiaceae), taxa with divergent fl oral symmetry patterns. • Key results: We identifi ed Zingiberales-specifi c gene duplications as well as a duplication in the TBL gene lineage that predates the diversifi cation of commelinid monocots. Shifts in TBL gene expression were associated with evolutionary shifts in fl oral symmetry and stamen abortion. ZinTBL1a expression was found in the posterior (adaxial) staminode of H. stricta and in the abaxial staminodial labellum of C. spicatus. ZinTBL2 expression was strongest in the anterior (abaxial) sepals of H. stricta and in the adaxial fertile stamen of C. spicatus. • Conclusions: This study adds to the growing body of evidence that CYC/TB1 - like genes have been repeatedly recruited throughout the course of evolution to generate bilateral fl oral symmetry (zygomorphy). © 2011 Botanical Society of America.",Costus; CYCLOIDEA (CYC); Developmental evolution; Floral morphology; Floral symmetry; Heliconia; TCP genes; TEOSINTE BRANCHED (TB1); Zingiberales; Zygomorphy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79851506086

In this study, we measured the genetic diversity and structure of two cedar glade endemic species, Leavenworthia alabamica and L. crassa. These species have self-incompatible (SI) and self-compatible (SC) populations and are therefore ideal for understanding how the mating system affects genetic diversity and structure. We found that L. alabamica and L. crassa had high species-level genetic diversity (He = 0.229 and 0.183, respectively) and high genetic structure among their populations (FST = 0.45 and 0.36, respectively), but that mean genetic diversity was significantly lower in SC compared with SI populations (SC vs SI, He for L. alabamica was 0.065 vs 0.206 and for L. crassa was 0.084 vs 0.189). We also found significant genetic structure using maximum-likelihood clustering methods. These data indicate that the loss of SI leads to the loss of genetic diversity within populations. In addition, we examined genetic distance relationships between SI and SC populations to analyze possible population history and origins of self-compatibility. We find there may have been multiple origins of self-compatibility in L. alabamica and L. crassa. However, further work is required to test this hypothesis. Finally, given their high genetic structure and that individual populations harbor unique alleles, conservation strategies seeking to maximize species-level genetic diversity for these or similar species should protect multiple populations. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",genetic diversity; Leavenworthia; mating system; self-incompatibility; selfing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751642507

The accumulation pattern of total phytosterol content was different in the three corn kernels parts. The highest level of total phytosterols (4,670.8mg/100g of oil) was detected in the pericarp fraction at 30 days after pollination (DAP). In the different corn oil samples, three forms of phytosterol were detected: 4-desmethylsterols, 4-monomethylsterols and 4,4-dimethylsterols. The level of total 4-desmethylsterols was higher than those of 4-monomethylsterols and 4,4-dimethylsterols in the different parts of the developing corn kernel. At 30DAP, the pericarp fraction was distinguished by the highest level of total 4-desmethylsterols (4,393.3mg/100g of oil); however, the endosperm part was distinguished by the highest levels of total 4,4-dimethylsterols (340.6mg/100g of oil) and 4-monomethylsterols (18.2mg/100g of oil). ?-sitosterol was the most abundant sterol in the three corn kernel parts during maturation. At 30DAP, the pericarp and endosperm parts showed the highest (3,245.8mg/100g of oil) and the lowest (384.2mg/100g of oil) levels of ?-sitosterol, respectively.

In addition, those compounds may possess anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenicity and antioxidation activities. Thus, one of the main objectives of the industry is to identify plant matrices rich in those high value-added phytocompounds. At present, several functional food products enriched with phytosterols and phytostanols are available on the market. This study suggested that the pericarp fraction of the immature corn kernel (30 days after pollination) could potentially be used as a good source of phytosterols. However, the endosperm part of the immature corn kernel may be a good source of phytostanols. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551665083

However, the biological function of the SUMO E3 ligase, SIZ1, in rice (Oryza sativa) is still under investigation. In this study, we employed two different genetic approaches, the use of siz1 T-DNA mutant and SIZ1-RNAi transgenic plants, to characterize the function of rice SIZ1. Genetic results revealed the co-segregation of single T-DNA insertional recessive mutation with the observed phenotypes in siz1. In addition to showing reduced plant height, tiller number and seed set percentage, both the siz1 mutant and SIZ1-RNAi transgenic plants showed obvious defects in anther dehiscence, but not pollen viability. The anther indehiscence in siz1 was probably a result of defects in endothecium development before anthesis. Interestingly, rice orthologs of AtIRX and ZmMADS2, which are essential for endothecium development during anther dehiscence, were significantly down-regulated in siz1. Compared with the wild-type, the sumoylation profile of high-molecular-weight proteins in mature spikelets was reduced significantly in siz1 and the SIZ1-RNAi line with notably reduced SIZ1 expression. The nuclear localization signal located in the SIZ1 C- terminus was sufficient for its nuclear targeting in bombarded onion epidermis. The results suggest the functional role of SIZ1, a SUMO E3 ligase, in regulating rice anther dehiscence. © 2010 The Authors.

Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with Tth. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5-100?m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average Tth (2.7°C higher) when returning from 2.5?mol?l-1 sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0?mol?l-1 sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during a nest visit (Trange) increased with total duration of the nest visit (0.7°C increase per additional min spent inside the nest). Bees that recruited nestmates (waggle or round danced) were significantly warmer, with a 1.4-1.5 times higher ?Tth (difference between Tth and nest ambient air temperature) than bees who tremble danced or simply walked on the nest floor without recruiting between foraging bouts. However, recruiter Tth was not correlated with finer-scale measures of motivation: the number of waggle dance circuits or waggle dance return phase duration. These results support the hypothesis that forager Tth within the nest is correlated to broad-scale differences in foraging motivation. © 2011 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",Foraging; Heterothermy; Honey bee; Recruitment; Thermoregulation; Waggle dance,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251477576

Invasive rodents (rats and mice) are known to have detrimental effects on many island invertebrates, although these effects are seldom quantified or ecologically understood. Here we provide evidence of the effects of invasive rats (Rattus spp.) on island invertebrate populations using a large-scale natural experiment. We investigated the effects of invasive rats on Falkland camel crickets (Parudenus spp.) in the Falkland Islands (South Atlantic) by comparing an index of camel cricket relative abundance between 18 rat-infested islands, six rat-eradicated islands and 13 naturally rat-free islands (in total, 37 islands). Our study provided two key results. First, camel crickets were up to an order of magnitude more abundant on rat-free islands than on rat-infested or rat-eradicated islands. This difference was larger in native tussac grass Poa flabellata than in other vegetation types. Second, camel cricket populations recovered after rat eradication, because the relative abundance of camel crickets on rat-eradicated islands was intermediate between those of naturally rat-free and rat-infested islands, and among rat-eradicated islands relative abundance was lowest where rats had been cleared most recently. Our results demonstrate severe suppression of a superabundant and large-bodied island endemic invertebrate by invasive rodents, and its prompt recovery after rodent eradication. © 2010 The Authors.

Using maize hybrids PR34F02, PR35P12 and PR36B08 field trials were set up at two locations in eastern croatia in two different years. Two enzymes of proline metabolism were analyzed in the same leaf samples and specific activities of synthetase (P5cS) and proline dehydrogenase (PDh). Plant productivity was evaluated at harvest by the estimation of total and fully developed grain number per ear and per plant, the mean single grain mass, and the mass of grain per plant. The year in which the plants were grown had a very significant effect on the free proline content in the leaf and pollen, as well as on the enzyme activities assayed. The differences between the plants from the two localities were very significant in all tested parameters of plant grain productivity. There was a significant genotype effect on proline content and P5cS total activity in leaf and on all the productivity parameters. Some of the correlations established suggest that the rate of proline synthesis and degradation in maize ear-leaf at pollination might contribute to the final grain production of the maize plant.

However, further enhancement of resistance to abiotic stress is still necessary. In our research, maize plants that were transgenic for both betA (encoding choline dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli) and TsVP (encoding V-H+-PPase from Thellungiella halophila) were produced by cross-pollination. The existence of the transgenes in the pyramided plants was demonstrated by PCR and Southern blotting. The stable expression of transgenes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis. An examination of the drought resistance characteristics demonstrated that the pyramided transgenic plants had higher glycinebetaine contents and H+-PPase activity compared with the parental lines, which had either betA or TsVP, and contained higher relative water content (RWC), greater solute accumulation and lower cell damage under drought stress treatment. The pyramided plants grew more vigorously with less growth retardation, shorter anthesis-silking interval and higher yields than their parental lines and the wild-type. We concluded that co-expression of the two genes involved in different metabolism pathways in pyramided transgenic maize helped to improve the drought resistance over their parental lines that contained either single transgene. Our study suggests that the co-expression of multiple, effective genes in transgenic plants could effectively enhance the resistance to abiotic stress and provide a feasible approach for obtaining maize plants with improved drought resistance. © 2010 The Authors.

Despite the low rate of nucleotide polymorphisms, a wide range of heritable phenotypic variation exists. There is even evidence for heritable phenotypic variation among individuals within some cultivars. Williams 82, the soybean cultivar used to produce the reference genome sequence, was derived from backcrossing a Phytophthora root rot resistance locus from the donor parent Kingwa into the recurrent parent Williams. To explore the genetic basis of intracultivar variation, we investigated the nucleotide, structural, and gene content variation of different Williams 82 individuals. Williams 82 individuals exhibited variation in the number and size of introgressed Kingwa loci. In these regions of genomic heterogeneity, the reference Williams 82 genome sequence consists of a mosaic of Williams and Kingwa haplotypes. Genomic structural variation between Williams and Kingwa was maintained between the Williams 82 individuals within the regions of heterogeneity. Additionally, the regions of heterogeneity exhibited gene content differences between Williams 82 individuals. These findings show that genetic heterogeneity in Williams 82 primarily originated from the differential segregation of polymorphic chromosomal regions following the backcross and single-seed descent generations of the breeding process. We conclude that soybean haplotypes can possess a high rate of structural and gene content variation, and the impact of intracultivar genetic heterogeneity may be significant. This detailed characterization will be useful for interpreting soybean genomic data sets and highlights important considerations for research communities that are developing or utilizing a reference genome sequence. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551699087

However, selfed seed offers no reproductive assurance unless it overcomes inbreeding depression. In trees and other long-lived plants, genetic evidence suggests that selfed seed seldom matures to adulthood, presumably because of severe inbreeding depression. We measured inbreeding depression over 11 yr in two populations each of two New Zealand trees, Fuchsia excorticata and Sophora microphylla, from pollination to germination and performance in both pots and the field. The accumulated inbreeding depression was very high in both cases (F. excorticata: ? = 0:74 and 0.84; S. microphylla: ? = 0:94 and 0.99) and largely late acting, especially in F. excorticata. Fewer than 10% (and < 1% in three of the four cases) of the selfs remain; none have yet flowered, and they appear unlikely to do so. Hence, selfing is likely futile in these species. Thus, fruit, seed, and seedling production are not reliable indicators of successful recruitment: a high density of doomed selfed offspring can mask the absence of the outcrossed seedlings needed for adult replacement. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Phenotypic variation observed for bulb weight, size and soluble solids content was significantly affected by location, growing season and line, while pungency depended on line and plot location. We found higher levels of genetic variation for bulb size and pungency than for soluble solids content, and significant phenotypic correlations indicated that milder onion tend to show larger size and lower soluble solids content. After one cycle of selection, we have obtained progeny with significantly lower pungency levels, and therefore, we estimated a realized heritability of 0.67.

There is a consensus that pathogens are among the key players in this alarming demise of the most important commercial pollinator. One of the pathogens heavily implicated in colony losses is deformed wing virus (DWV). Overt DWV infections manifested as deformed-wing syndrome started to become a threat to honeybees only in the wake of the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor, which horizontally transmits DWV. However, a direct causal link between the virus and the symptom 'wing deformity' has not been established yet. To evaluate the impact of different horizontal transmission routes, and especially the role of the mite in the development of overt DWV infections, we performed laboratory infection assays with pupae and adult bees. We could demonstrate that pupae injected with DWV dose-dependently developed overt infections characterized by deformed wings in adult bees, suggesting that DWV, if transmitted to pupae by the mite, is the causative agent of the deformed-wing syndrome. The OID50 (overt infection dosage) was approximately 2500 genome equivalents. Injecting more than 1×10 7 DWV genome equivalents into adult bees also resulted in overt infections while the same viral dosage fed to adult bees only resulted in covert infections. Therefore, both infection of adult bees through DWV-transmitting phoretic mites and infection of nurse bees through their cannibalizing DWV-infected pupae might represent possible horizontal transmission routes of DWV. © 2011 SGM.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251517091

Among the 173 breeding material screened for occurrence of incompatibility, 36 parents were identified self incompatible and among them nine incompatible parents were further studied for their cross compatibility. Pollen germination was normal in Co 86011, Co 91004 and Co 62198 and slightly inhibited in a cross with Co 99002. Fertilization was accomplished within 4 hr of pollination in crosses Co 8371 × Co 86011, Co 88028 × Co 86011. The presence of Co 86011 and Co 91004 pollen tubes in the ovary 8h after pollination indicated the possibility of normal fertilization, while in cross with Co 94008, restricted pollen tube growth was observed. Pollen tube in the clone 2000-147 did not penetrate the ovary even 10 h after pollination. Self pollen did not support the development of pollen tubes in Co 88028, Co 91004, Co 99002, Co 62198 and Co 86011. In the crosses of Co 88028 × Co 91004, Co 88032 × Co 99002 and Co 88028 × Co 86011 pollen germination and entry of pollen tube was normal. The study indicated that there is no hurdle at the pollen germination stage and delayed/restricted growth of pollen tubes indicated that the barrier operates in the stylar region of the parent. Thus, from our study it could be inferred that i) cross-incompatibility systems are responsible for the failure to produce successful crosses among Co 88028 × Co 91004, Co 88028 × Co 99002.ii) self incompatible parents could be used as safe pistil (Co 837, Co 8371, Co 88028, Co 88025) and pollen parents (Co 62198, Co 86011, Co 94008, Co 91004).",Incompatibility; Pollen; Stigma; Sugarcane,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053010565

Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) is an approach for intensifying agriculture in SSA that aims at maximizing the agronomic efficiency (AE) of applied nutrient inputs. ISFM contains the following essential components: proper fertilizer management, use of improved varieties, the combined application of organic inputs and fertilizer, and adaptation of input application rates to within-farm soil fertility gradients where these are important. This paper evaluates, through meta-analysis, the impact of these components on the AE of fertilizer N (N-AE), defined as extra grain yield per kg fertilizer N applied, in maize-based systems in SSA. Since N-AE is low for excessive fertilizer N application rates or when fertilizer is applied on fertile, unresponsive soil, as was confirmed by scatter plots against control yields and fertilizer N application rates, such values were removed from the database in order to focus on and elucidate the more variable and complex responses under less than ideal conditions typical for SSA. Compared with local varieties, the use of hybrid maize varieties significantly increased N-AE values (17 and 26 kg (kg N)-1, respectively) with no differences observed between local and improved, open-pollinated varieties. Mixing fertilizer with manure or compost resulted in the highest N-AE values [36 kg (kg N)-1] while organic inputs of medium quality also showed significantly higher N-AE values compared with the sole fertilizer treatment but only at low organic input application rates (40 and 23 kg (kg N)-1, respectively). High quality organic inputs (Class I) and those with a high C-to-N ratio (Class III) or high lignin content (Class IV) did not affect N-AE values in comparison with the sole fertilizer treatment. Application of N fertilizer on infields resulted in significantly higher N-AE values [31 kg (kg N)-1] compared with the outfields [17 kg (kg N)-1]. The obtained information indicates that N-AE is amenable to improved management practices and that the various components embedded in the ISFM definition result in improvements in N-AE. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Improved maize germplasm; Meta-analysis; Organic-mineral applications; Site-specific nutrient management; Soil fertility gradients,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651454991

This new species concept is based on a combination of interconnected organs, common histological features, and patterns of association among isolated plant parts. These data expand our knowledge of P. arnoldii from a morphospecies of ovulate cones to an extinct species of pine that produces woody stems with five-needled fascicles of leaves; simple pollen cones with two abaxial pollen sacs per microsporophyll, containing bisaccate pollen grains; seed cones with inflated scale apices, dorsal umbos that do not bear mucros, and a thick-walled sclerotic outer cortex; and coralloid roots with ectomycorrhizal associations. Organs preserved at various stages of development provide evidence for numerous aspects of growth and reproductive biology, including pollination biology and seed cone development. Cladistic analyses of morphological and molecular characters demonstrate that the novel combination of characters displayed by P. arnoldii causes this extinct species to fall near the base of the Pinus L. tree, either as the sister to all living species of the subgenus Pinus or outside the subgenera that have been defined by extant species of Pinus. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Light traps were used to sample moths in 20 plots in two consecutive years. The pollen on moths' bodies was identified and pollen grains counted. This information was used to build a nocturnal pollen-transport network for each year. These are the first networks to characterise a nocturnal plant-visitor community.A total of 4162 moths belonging to 103 species were captured; 25 moth species were found to carry pollen of 12 plant taxa. Adding nocturnal data to diurnal networks increased number of plant taxa, insect species, and unique interactions in the network.Despite differences in species composition, nocturnal networks exhibit similar properties to diurnal networks: significant nestedness, marked asymmetry of interactions, high dependence on a core of generalists, and high inter-annual variation in species abundances and occurrence of interactions.Traditional diurnal plant-visitor networks exclude a significant component of the community, i.e. nocturnal visitors. Exploring links across boundaries between networks (such as between diurnal and nocturnal networks) will provide a more accurate picture of ecosystem structure and function. © 2010 The Authors.

However, linkage among species is mediated by their constituting individuals. Thus, every linked species pair in a network encapsulates a new network of interacting individuals. Very few studies outside the sociology of larger animals have investigated networks at the level of the individual. Here, we analyse the structure of a flower-visitation network of individual thistles Cirsium arvense and honeybees Apis mellifera in a small meadow patch in Denmark. We marked and numbered 62 honeybees and 32 thistle stems and monitored all floral visits. The constructed bipartite network of individual plants and bees had a high connectance and low nestedness, but it was not significantly modular. Frequency distributions of number of links per species (i.e. linkage level) had their best fit to a truncated power law, and interactions were asymmetrical. Unipartite networks of either plants or bees had exceedingly short average path length and high clustering. Linkage level of plants increased with their number of flower heads and height of inflorescence (floral display parameters). Overall, the individual network of honeybees and thistles was denser linked than what is known from species pollination networks. Characteristics of both plants (e.g. floral display) and animals (e.g. foraging behaviour) are likely to generate this intra-specific, inter-individual link pattern. Such features of individual-individual networks may scale up and become important drivers of the structure and dynamics of species-species networks. © 2011 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751619238

Local directional selection on target genes will produce stronger population genetic structure than at neutral loci, whereas the reverse is expected for balancing selection. However, theoretical predictions on the intensity of this signal under precise models of balancing selection are still lacking. Using negative frequency-dependent selection acting on self-incompatibility systems in plants as a model of balancing selection, we investigated the effect of such selection on patterns of spatial genetic structure within a continuous population. Using numerical simulations, we tested the effect of the type of self-incompatibility system, the number of alleles at the self-incompatibility locus and the dominance interactions among them, the extent of gene dispersal, and the immigration rate on spatial genetic structure at the selected locus and at unlinked neutral loci. We confirm that frequency-dependent selection is expected to reduce the extent of spatial genetic structure as compared to neutral loci, particularly in situations with low number of alleles at the self-incompatibility locus, high frequency of codominant interactions among alleles, restricted gene dispersal and restricted immigration from outside populations. Hence the signature of selection on spatial genetic structure is expected to vary across species and populations, and we show that empirical data from the literature as well as data reported here on three natural populations of the herb Arabidopsis halleri confirm these theoretical results. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",frequency-dependent selection; numerical simulations; S-locus; SPAGeDi; spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751641532

Analysis of the progeny showed that the three cultivars are self-compatible, and PCR analysis suggested that the S6 haplotype is responsible for the breakdown of GSI. Nevertheless, in a mixed cultivar orchard, self-fertilization levels differed between the three cultivars: 95% in 'Yehuda', 84% in 'Akko 1' and 77% in 'Avri'. We suspected that the difference among cultivars was due to the flower properties related to pollination and therefore the following parameters were examined along the flowering season: a) in vitro pollen viability, b) in vitro pollen viability at different temperatures, c) percentage of flowers with viable pollen, and d) germination levels of pollen in the stigmas. 'Yehuda' scored highest for all parameters tested, and it was therefore concluded that its high level of self-fertilization is due to its superior flower properties.

Flower development of geophytes is greatly influenced both by the genetics of the individual plant and by environmental factors; their interactions affect a series of molecular and biochemical processes leading to the transition of the plant from vegetative to reproductive development. While the morphological and physiological aspects of florogenesis have been studied in several bulbous species, there is still only limited information on the genetic control of meristem transition, formation of inflorescence, individual flowers, and flower parts. Elucidating the genetic control of florogenesis in geophytes is important, not only for better understanding of their developmental biology, but also because of their agronomic and economic importance. Molecular characterization of genes involved in flower morphology could help to develop novel floral architecture in flower bulbs by classical breeding or by genetic manipulations. Until now, most genetic studies have been performed on commercially important crops.

The trees were pollinated naturally in 2004 and artificially in 2009. Cumulative growth curves based on fruit diameter displayed a single sigmoid pattern in the two years. The growth rate curves of both of seasons had two peaks, and the second peak was higher. In 2010, the average weight per fruit was 41g, the index of fruit shape was 1.04, and there were 3-7 seeds per fruit. These traits were better than those in 2005. However, the soluble solid content in 2005 was higher than that in 2010, and fruit ripening in 2005 occurred 40-50 d earlier than in 2010. The difference of fruit quality characteristics was related to pollination methods at flowering season. Therefore, 'Dahongpao' loquat in the solar greenhouse in Northern China should have artificial or bee pollination to insure fruit set and quality.",'Dahongpao' loquat; Fruit development and traits; Solar greenhouse,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053270794

Two microsatellite-enriched flax genomic libraries were constructed for trinucleotide TTC and ATC motifs. A total of 206 new microsatellite-containing sequences were identified and classified. Thirty eight polymorphic microsatellite markers were characterized and evaluated in eight cultivars from different countries and regions. These loci produced 2 to 12 alleles per locus with an average of 3.395.

The genus Lilium generally includes allogamous species with problems of selfincompatibility and the consequent inability to produce seeds when they are selfpollinated. The intraspecific crosses produce a large quantity of seeds, whereas crosses between different species create many problems. The sexual barriers that hamper interspecific hybridization have been classified into pre-fertilization and post-fertilization barriers. A breeding program on lily was carried out at CRA-VIV, former Institute for Floriculture, in Pescia since 2003 with the aim to overcome barriers of interspecific incompatibility and to produce hybrids presenting new ornamental traits from various species. Ovary and ovule culture has been applied for the production of interspecific Lilium hybrids. Several crosses among Asiatic hybrids ('Golf', 'Polyanna' and 'Gironde'), Oriental hybrids ('Lombardia'), and Longiflorum hybrids ('White Heaven' and 'White Magic') were made by using broken flower buds and the cut-style-method. Other crosses were carried out among Asiatic clones previously selected at the Institute and several wild species like L. pumilum, L. regale, L. aurelian, L. leucanthum and L. 'New Zealand'. Seven, 14 and 21 days after pollination (DAP) ovaries were cut and in vitro cultivated using 4 different substrates (MSO, LO 1, IAA 0.5 and NAA 1) for 50 and 60 days. Subsequently more swollen ovules were taken out from the ovary and subcultivated on two substrates, IBA 0.5, and NAA 0.1, for 180 days. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were utilized for the early identification of interspecific hybrids.

Selection within seedless triploids that occur from rare spontaneous occurrence in diploid open pollinated seed derived from non-reduction in megaspores can be expected to achieve diversity in size, color, season of ripening, and adaptability. Within triploids, parthenocarpy will be the next trait that needs to be addressed in order to eliminate the need for pollination or gibberellin application. The production of seedless triploids from tetraploid × diploid crosses needs to be explored. Selection of rootstocks from Eriobotrya species with high compatibility indicate that progress in loquat production can be achieved from rootstock selection and breeding.

In all cases these prescriptions were compared to intensive crop management. The plant community regenerating from the seed bank was species-poor, highly dynamic and had a high proportion of undesirable crop weeds. Sowing a low-cost, simple mix of tall grasses resulted in a stable community dominated by competitive grasses. Creation of these habitats resulted in negligible shifts in the functional composition of the associated invertebrate community. Sowing a diverse mix of wildflowers resulted in a stable, perennial vegetation community with both legumes and regulating hemi-parasitic plants that supported significantly more pollinator and herbivore species, as well as higher abundances of beneficial arthropod predators. There were no measured synergies when a mix of tall grass and wildflower habitats were created adjacent to each other on the same margin.

Discerning the number and distribution of genes underlying these traits and, in a few cases, identifying the genes involved, has greatly enhanced our understanding over the past 15 years of species formation (reviewed by Noor and Feder and Wolf et al.). However, this work has almost exclusively focused on traits that restrict gene flow between populations that have evolved as a by-product of genetic divergence between geographically isolated populations. By contrast, little is known about the characteristics of genes associated with reinforcement, the process by which natural selection directly favours restricted gene flow during the formation of species. Here we identify changes in two genes that appear to cause a flower colour change in Phlox drummondii, which previous work has shown contributes to reinforcement. Both changes involve cis-regulatory mutations to genes in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (ABP). Because one change is recessive whereas the other is dominant, hybrid offspring produce an intermediate flower colour that is visited less by pollinators, and is presumably maladaptive.

To study fundamental evolutionary questions at the genomic level, a high resolution genetic linkage map is an essential tool for analyses ranging from quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to genome assembly and comparative genomics. We here present a saturated linkage map and match it with the Apis mellifera genome using homologous markers. This genome-wide comparison allows insights into structural conservations and rearrangements and thus the evolution on a chromosomal level.Results: The high density linkage map covers ~ 93% of the B. terrestris genome on 18 linkage groups (LGs) and has a length of 2'047 cM with an average marker distance of 4.02 cM. Based on a genome size of ~ 430 Mb, the recombination rate estimate is 4.76 cM/Mb. Sequence homologies of 242 homologous markers allowed to match 15 B. terrestris with A. mellifera LGs, five of them as composites. Comparing marker orders between both genomes we detect over 14% of the genome to be organized in synteny and 21% in rearranged blocks on the same homologous LG.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that, despite the very high recombination rates of both A. mellifera and B. terrestris and a long divergence time of about 100 million years, the genomes' genetic architecture is highly conserved. This reflects a slow genome evolution in these bees. We show that data on genome organization and conserved molecular markers can be used as a powerful tool for comparative genomics and evolutionary studies, opening up new avenues of research in the Apidae. © 2011 Stolle et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651484927

Almond cultivars 'A200' and 'Sahand' are self-incompatible following pollination and fertilization problems. Therefore, obtaining their late-flowering and self-fertile mutants with good biological traits, by means of mutation, will be very bounteous for breeders and producers. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different exposition times to gamma-radiation on some biological traits of two late-blooming cultivars 'A200' and 'Sahand'. Current shoots of 'A200' and 'Sahand' were exposed to 36 ?C gamma-radiation for 0, 5, 10, 30 and 150 min from the Cobalt 60. The factorial experiment was carried out on 4-year old irradiated trees based on completely-randomized design (CRD) and some biological traits such as: resistance to diseases agents, partial fungus and pests (aphid, mite, etc.), blooming date, leaf bud break date, bearing type, leaf area (LA) and flower density were investigated in all irradiated plants. Results showed that long exposition times have significant positive effects on resistance to disease agents such as: polystigma occharaceum, mite, LA and flower density, but did not have significant effect on bearing type, resistance to aphids, blooming and leaf bud break dates in spring. Effects of cultivars were significant on resistance to pests (aphid, mite and other main destructive pests) and diseases agents and bearing type, while no significance was seen on blooming, leaf bud break dates, LA and flower density. Interaction effect between cultivars and exposition time was significant on resistance to diseases, mite and flowering date, but was not significant on LA, flower density, resistance to aphid and leaf bud break date. However, the maximum resistance to diseases agents, aphid and mite was observed in plants irradiated 150 min in both cultivars. © 2010 Academic Journals.",Almond; Biological traits; Breeding; Gamma-irradiation; Mutants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951712473

However, the use of such models over the pollen emission season is limited by poor estimations of pollen emission. In this study, we present a model that predicts hourly pollen emission fluxes over the pollen season and that accounts for effects of both meteorological conditions and crop variety. It consists of two sub-models that predict: (i) the seasonal pattern on a daily basis and (ii) the normalized diurnal pattern on an hourly basis. To assess the variability of pollen emission, ten field experiments were carried out in July and August over four years using three crop varieties. The model was built from (i) a parameterisation of the measured diurnal and seasonal patterns of pollen emission followed by (ii) a quantification of the relationships between parameter values and meteorological conditions. Total production of pollen was fairly constant for a given variety over years and sowing dates, while patterns of emission varied with meteorological conditions. The pollen emission season was longer when temperature was low and humidity was high. In most cases, the diurnal pattern was unimodal: the onset and the peak of emission were delayed when relative humidity was high or wind speed was low. In some cases, a second peak of emission occurred during the afternoon. This was observed more frequently when temperatures were high. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Anthesis; Cross-pollination; Development model; Pollen emission; Tree-based model; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649324148

Recently, the European species Osmiabicornis (L.) and Osmiacornuta (Latr.) attract more interest as pollinators in fruit orchards in Germany. Several studies indicate the potential of these mason bees as pollinators of pome and stone fruit. Here, we investigated the composition of the pollen loads in the brood cells of these two mason bees in fruit orchards different in habitat characteristics. At eight study sites, trap nests and cocoons of O. bicornis and O. cornuta were installed. During fruit tree blossom, pollen was sampled every two weeks and the percentage of Rosaceae pollen was identified. Landscape characteristics were assessed in a radius of 250 m from the trap nests. At all eight study sites, O. bicornis and O. cornuta collected pollen of Rosaceae. The percentage of Rosaceae pollen in the samples and the local habitat quality of the foraging sites were negatively correlated. In fruit orchards with a low diversity of suitable foraging habitats, brood cells contained a relatively high percentage of fruit tree pollen. These results indicate the potential of O. bicornis and O. cornuta as efficient pollinators in intensively managed fruit orchards. However, intensive fruit orchards appear less suitable as habitats for these mason bees to establish an endogenous pollinator population. Hence, the introduction and management of mason bees in orchards will improve pollination. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Foraging; Landscape characteristics; Mason bee; Osmia bicornis; Osmia cornuta; Pollen; Pollination; Rosaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251601122

Here, we report results of a 3-y interdisciplinary study of changing distributions, population genetic structure, and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations across the United States. We compare current and historical distributions of eight species, compiling a database of >73,000 museum records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of >16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species have declined by up to 96% and that their surveyed geographic ranges have contracted by 23-87%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the microsporidian pathogen Nosemabombi and lower genetic diversity compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining) species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are, thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79551676417

The floral characteristics such as bluish-violet flowers, no perceptible smell, narrow tubular corolla and concealed nectar accumulated at the corolla base conform to 'psychophilous pollination syndrome'. The aggregated arrangement of flowers on the inflorescence is economical and energetically rewarding for the butterflies. The lower lip of the corolla is elaborate and provides comfortable landing place for the butterflies. The nectar is sucrose-rich with 28% sugar concentration and also carbohydraterich with little protein content. It is also an important source of five of the ten essential amino acids required by butterflies; they include isoleucine, valine, lysine, methionine and threonine. Further, it also contains the non-essential amino acids such as alanine, butyric acid, cystine, glutamic acid, glysine, hydroxyproline, proline, serine, aspartic acid and cysteine. With these floral morphological and functional characteristics, the plant is exclusively pollinated by butterflies. Among butterflies, nymphalids and pierids are relatively more diverse in species and consistent foragers than papilionids and hesperiids. Therefore, the interaction between S. jamaicensis and the butterflies is mutualistic; the former for pollination and the latter for nourishment. This floral source is available for a long period and hence is an important nectar source for the maintenance of local butterflies. Additionally, bees also visit the flowers for forage and their visits could contribute to gene flow at population level to some extent. S. jamaicensis produces fruits with minute seeds within a short span of time. Seed dispersal occurs through soil and water movement. They germinate immediately if the soil is sufficiently wet; if not, they remain dormant until the soil is charged with water during monsoon season. The plant with abundant seed production enjoys a 'minor weed' status only.",Butterfly; Minor weed; Psychophily; Stachytarpheta jamaicensis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651456562

As an outcrossing species, rye exhibits high levels of intraspecific diversity, which makes it well-suited for allele mining in genes involved in the frost responsive network. For investigating genetic diversity and the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) we analyzed eleven candidate genes and 37 microsatellite markers in 201 lines from five Eastern and Middle European rye populations.Results: A total of 147 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nine insertion-deletion polymorphisms were found within 7,639 bp of DNA sequence from eleven candidate genes, resulting in an average SNP frequency of 1 SNP/52 bp. Nucleotide and haplotype diversity of candidate genes were high with average values ? = 5.6 × 10-3and Hd = 0.59, respectively. According to an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA), most of the genetic variation was found between individuals within populations. Haplotype frequencies varied markedly between the candidate genes. ScCbf14, ScVrn1, and ScDhn1 were dominated by a single haplotype, while the other 8 genes (ScCbf2, ScCbf6, ScCbf9b, ScCbf11, ScCbf12, ScCbf15, ScIce2, and ScDhn3) had a more balanced haplotype frequency distribution. Intra-genic LD decayed rapidly, within approximately 520 bp on average. Genome-wide LD based on microsatellites was low.Conclusions: The Middle European population did not differ substantially from the four Eastern European populations in terms of haplotype frequencies or in the level of nucleotide diversity. The low LD in rye compared to self-pollinating species promises a high resolution in genome-wide association mapping. SNPs discovered in the promoters or coding regions, which attribute to non-synonymous substitutions, are suitable candidates for association mapping. © 2011 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650979491

Nest management of this Eurasian nonsocial pollinator transformed the alfalfa seed industry in North America, tripling seed production. The most common ALCB management practice is the loose cell system, in which cocooned bees are removed from nesting cavities for cleaning and storage. Traits of ALCBs that favored their commercialization include gregarious nesting; use of leaves for lining nests; ready acceptance of affordable, mass-produced nesting materials; alfalfa pollination efficacy; and emergence synchrony with alfalfa bloom. The ALCB became a commercial success because much of its natural history was understood, targeted research was pursued, and producer ingenuity was encouraged.

Many correlational studies have examined the indirect effects of factors such as landscape context and land management practices and found great variation in bee response. We focus here on the evidence for effects of direct factors (i.e., food resources, nesting resources, and incidental risks) regulating bee populations and then interpret varied responses to indirect factors through their species-specific and habitat-specific effects on direct factors. We find strong evidence for food resource availability regulating bee populations, but little clear evidence that other direct factors are commonly limiting. We recommend manipulative experiments to illuminate the effects of these different factors. We contend that much of the variation in impact from indirect factors, such as grazing, can be explained by the relationships between indirect factors and floral resource availability based on environmental circumstances. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

However, models for mutualistic community assembly are still needed, especially because these communities are experiencing significant anthropogenic disturbances that affect their biodiversity. Here, we present a unique network model that simulates the colonization and extinction process of mutualistic community assembly. We generate regional source pools of species interaction networks on the basis of statistical properties reported in the literature. We develop a dynamic synchronous Boolean framework to simulate, with few free parameters, the dynamics of new mutualistic community formation from the regional source pool. This approach allows us to deterministically map out every possible trajectory of community formation. This level of detail is rarely observed in other analytic approaches and allows for thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of community formation. As for food web assembly, we find that the number of stable communities is quite low, and the composition of the source pool influences the abundance and nature of community outcomes.

In six forest fragments ranging from 2 to 700 ha, we collected all floral visitors, pollinators and non-pollinators, to male-and female-phase inflorescences at the time of their greatest activity. We used multivariate and mixed-effects models to explore differences in guild composition between sexual phases of inflorescences and the effects of forest fragment size on several metrics of the assemblages of floral visitors. We detected 228 786 floral visitors, grouped into 57 species, across the six forest fragments. On average, abundance and species richness of floral visitors to female-phase inflorescences were higher than to male-phase ones. Forest fragmentation had no effect on species richness but negatively affected Shannon's diversity index. Overall, the most abundant species of floral visitors were predominantly found in inflorescences of plants from the large fragments. In contrast, most of the less common species were more abundant in the smallest fragments. The abundance of pollinators (those found on inflorescences of both phases and dusted with pollen that was carried to flower stigmas), and the ratio of pollinators to other floral visitors, increased with fragment size in both sexual phases of the inflorescences but these effects were significantly stronger on male-phase inflorescences than on female-phase inflorescences. These results show that tropical forest fragmentation correlates with changes in the composition of flower visitors to a dominant palm, with a reduction in the abundance of pollinators, but that such changes co-vary with the sexual phase of the plants. © 2010 Cambridge University Press.",beetles; floral visitors; fragmentation; palm; pollination; species richness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251627064

In order to discover the sensory organs involved in this attraction, we have studied the antennae of five species of psychodine moth-flies (former Psychoda sensu lato=Psychodini), pollinators of Arum spp. The antennae of the five Psychodini reveal seven types of sensilla: multiporous tribranched sensilla basiconica (sensilla ascoidea), multiporous sensilla basiconica, multiporous sensilla coeloconica, multiporous sensilla auricillica, uniporous sensilla basiconica, aporous sensilla chaetica, aporous Böhm’s sensilla. Each species possesses three, five or six of these sensillum types. All the multiporous sensilla are probably olfactory receptors while the uniporous sensilla basiconica must possess a contact chemoreceptive function. The multiporous tribranched sensilla basiconica (s. ascoidea), present in all the species, are the best candidates for the reception of the odours given off by the ovipositing sites and the inflorescences of Arum. The multiporous sensilla basiconica and the multiporous sensilla coeloconica may be involved respectively as CO2 receptors or thermoreceptors. Psychoda phalaenoides, which is the main pollinator of A. maculatum, is the species which possesses the largest number of antennal sensilla. The sexual dimorphism, studied only in Psycha grisescens, as concerns the number of sensilla and the absence of a sensillum type which differ according to sex, is difficult to interpret. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",Chodopsycha; Deceptive pollination; Logima; Psycha; Psychoda,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053943319

Thus, flowers more attractive to pollinators usually receive more visits to their reproductive structures. However, this effect of attraction does not necessarily occur in a binary way, all-or-nothing. Loasa tricolor KerGawl. is an annual herb covered with stinging hairs. Flowers present a corolla with five yellow petals and red nectarine scales. In this study, we assess whether the variation in the floral phenotype of L. tricolor affects discrimination by pollinators, following a dose-dependent type of response. This study was carried out in a protected area of Chile where L. tricolor shows high levels of florivory, probably affecting its attraction to pollinators. We experimentally modified the corolla phenotype, removing three or all petals. We measured visitation rate, richness and diversity of pollinator species in treated and control flowers. Results show that three-petal-removal did not reduce the visitation rate compared to control, while complete-petal-removal significantly reduced the visitation rate. Most pollinator species were recorded in the three-petal-removal treatment (nine species), while complete-petal-removal treatment obtained the lowest richness value (four species). These results suggest that species diversity, richness and visitation rates are affected by flower phenotype variation, but probably for complete petal loss only. We suggest that different levels of florivory on L. tricolor do not affect pollinator discrimination in a dose-dependent way.",Florivory; Flower herbivory; Pollination; Visitation rate,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857253845

Several studies have focused on interspecific variation of these signals, but little is known about intraspecific variation in flower scent, particularly for species with wide geographic distributions. In the highly specific mutualism between Ficus species and their pollinating wasps, chemical mediation is crucial for partner encounter. Several studies show that scents, i.e. blends of volatiles, are species-specific, but no studies address interpopulation variation of scents in fig pollination mutualisms, which often have broad geographic distributions. In this study, using absorption/desorption headspace techniques, we analyzed variation in floral scent composition among three populations of each of two widely distributed Asian Ficus species. We identified more than 100 different volatile organic compounds, predominantly terpenes. In both species, significant differences were found between scent bouquets of East Asian and Indian populations. These differences are discussed in relation to geographical barriers that could disrupt gene exchange between these two areas, thereby isolating Indian populations from those of Eastern Asia. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we analysed the spatial scale of genetic structure within and among nine populations of an interacting species pair, the white campion Silene latifolia and the moth Hadena bicruris, along a latitudinal gradient across Northern?Central Europe. This dioecious, short-lived perennial plant inhabits patchy, often disturbed environments. The moth H. bicruris acts both as its pollinator and specialist seed predator that reproduces by laying eggs in S. latifolia flowers. We used nine microsatellite markers for S. latifolia and eight newly developed markers for H. bicruris. We found high levels of inbreeding in most populations of both plant and pollinator?seed predator. Among populations, significant genetic structure was observed for S. latifolia but not for its pollinator?seed predator, suggesting that despite migration among populations of H. bicruris, pollen is not, or only rarely, carried over between populations, thus maintaining genetic structure among plant populations. There was a weak positive correlation between genetic distances of S. latifolia and H. bicruris. These results indicate that while significant structure of S. latifolia populations creates the potential for differentiation at traits relevant for the interaction with the pollinator/seed predator, substantial gene flow in H. bicruris may counteract this process in at least some populations. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Adaptation; Insects; Mutualism; Parasitism; Plant mating systems; Population genetics-empirical; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053602410

These effects on pollination may depend on how pollinators respond to floral resources at multiple levels. In this study, we demonstrate pollinatormediated negative interactions between two invasive plants, Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans. Using constructed arrays of the two species, alone and in mixture, we quantified pollinator visitation at the patch and individual plant levels and measured seed production. We found that co-occurrence of our species led to a shift in pollinator services at both levels. Greater interference occurred when arrays were small and spacings between neighboring plants were large. Aspatially explicit movement model suggests that pollinator foraging behavior, which mediates the interactions between plants, was driven by floral display size rather than species identity per se. Pollinator behavior significantly reduced the proportion of seed set for both species relative to that in single-species arrays. Overall, the dependence of pollinator behavior on patch size, spacing between plants, and patch composition can lead to pollinator-mediated plant interactions that range from facilitative to competitive. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.",Carduus acanthoides; Carduus nutans; Gravity model; Indirect interactions; Invasional interference; Pollination.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650901096

In an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying variation in nectar traits, we designed a series of experiments with flowering Helleborus foetidus individuals under natural and glasshouse conditions, to identify intraplant variation in nectar traits which depend on both intrinsic (sexual phases of individual flowers) and external (pollinator visits and plant growth conditions) factors. The results showed that nectar volume, sugar composition and concentration in Helleborus foetidus varied between floral sexual phases, environmental growing conditions, and levels of flower exposure to pollinator visits. Processes of mate-limitation in male reproductive success or pollen-limitation in female success, as well as flower protogyny and holocrine secretion of nectaries may be involved in nectar variability between floral phases. By comparing different environments we observed that nectar volume and concentration at the nectary and flower level were plastic traits sensitive to external conditions, emphasizing responsiveness to environmental changes and a consequent plasticity in nectar traits such as sugar concentration and volume. Nectar sugar composition did not respond to different growing conditions, suggesting that this is an intrinsic characteristic of this species, but pollinator exposure produced significant changes in the nectar of single nectaries, particularly in the sucrose-fructose balance. Future research on nectar ecology and nectar chemistry will need to consider that nectar traits exhibit different kinds of variation at the intraplant level and under different environmental conditions. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Andalusia; Cazorla; Fructose; Glucose; Growth conditions; Sucrose,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957448955

Therefore, how pollinators respond to human-induced land-use change has important implications for plants and the species that depend on them. Here, we synthesize the published literature on how land-use change affects the main groups of pollinators: bees, butterflies, flies, birds, and bats. Responses to land-use change are predominantly negative but are highly variable within and across taxa. The directionality of pollinator response varies according to study design, with comparisons across gradients in surrounding landscape cover finding largely negative responses and comparisons across local land-use types finding largely positive responses. Furthermore, among the studies using landscape designs, most were performed in systemswhere landuse change is extreme, and such studies find stronger negative effects than those performed in more moderate systems. Across multiple taxa, dietary specialists show greater sensitivity to land use than do generalists. There is a need for studies of pollinator species composition and relative abundance, rather than simply species richness and aggregate abundance, to identify the species that are lost and gained with increasing land-use change. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

We conducted three landscape-scale field studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands, where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run, mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Canola; Competition; Facilitation; Oilseed rape; Pollination; Spill-over,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054008779

However, bees are among the most frequent visitors in some short-corolla species with ornithophilous features, but only few studies identified insects as pollinators of these bromeliads. The importance of visitors for pollination success in Aechmea caudata (Bromeliaceae) was determined through the frequency and pollination effectiveness (measured as seed set/single visit) of its visitors in a secondary Atlantic forest area in southern Brazil. Aechmea caudata is self-incompatible and therefore pollinator-dependent. A total of 16 species were recorded visiting their flowers. Bees were the most rich and frequent taxon (91% of 647 visits). Bombus morio was the most frequent species (41%). Although the floral features of A. caudata, such as scentless, tubular corollas, yellow and red flowers, and nectar secretion during the whole diurnal anthesis, are related to ornithophily, the single hummingbird species Thalurania glaucopis failed to pollinate the flowers. Its low frequency (2.5%) apparently did not promote the pollen flux between conspecific bromeliads. Pollination tests showed that no seeds developed after hummingbird visits. Seeds were formed only at flowers visited by B. morio. We discuss our findings by contrasting them with the results on the similar and sympatric A. lindenii and by emphasizing the importance of bees for pollination of bromeliads with short corolla. Our results show that pollination effectiveness together with frequency data are necessary to analyze the complex interactions between plants and their flower visitors. © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.",Atlantic forest; Bombus morio; Bromeliaceae; Mixed pollination; Pollination effectiveness; Thalurania glaucopis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957790280

We asked whether these areas have separate receptive or adhesive functions and whether they are derived from a single stigma that previously had both functions. We expected that the mechanism of pollen transference would be highly effective at the flower level, i. e., that pollen limitation would affect fruit set rather than seed set. Both areas produce a sticky carbohydrate- and mucilage-positive exudate but only the apical one leads to pollen tube growth into the stylar canal. The subapical and lateral area is regarded here as being homologous to the viscidium of Lowiaceae and Marantaceae. High pollen limitation through fruit set is attributable to the low visitation rate of the single long-billed hummingbird pollinator (Heliomaster furcifer) and to pollen loss caused by nectar robbers, while low limitation through seed set suggests that the efficiency of a few visits of pollen-carrying hummingbirds is high. Recordings of the pollination process indicate that the viscidium is touched before the pollen presenter, when hummingbirds are flying out of the flowers. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Canna indica; Hummingbirds; Pollination biology; Stigmatic secretions; Style anatomy; Viscidium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650994550

We expected that this species had a generalised pollination system, with moths and diurnal visitors as the primary pollinators. To test this, we studied the floral biology, breeding system and floral visitors of this species and the effectiveness of nocturnal and diurnal visitors. Floral biology was defined based on floral morphology, floral cycle and nectar production of the flowers. The breeding system and relative contributions of diurnal and nocturnal visitors to fruit and seed set were analysed through field experiments. E. terscheckii flowers opened at sunset and closed the following day. The peak of nectar production occurred at midnight. Flowers were determined to be self-incompatible. Moths, bees and birds were identified as floral visitors. Moths were the most frequent visitors at night, whereas bees were the most frequent visitors during the day. Fruit production by diurnal pollinators was less than that by nocturnal pollinators; among all floral visitors, moths were the most effective pollinators. We have demonstrated for the first time that moths are the primary pollinators of columnar cacti of the genus Echinopsis.

Flower visitation frequency and foraging behavior differed between queen bumblebees and workers. Queens exhibited less frequent flower visits, longer flight distances between inflorescences, and a smaller number of sequential inflorescence visits within patches than did worker bees. Flowering in early-snowmelt populations occurred in June, when only overwintered queens were available, while flowering in late-snowmelt populations occurred from late July to August, when frequent visits by workers were common. The fruit to flower ratio per inflorescence was lower in early-snowmelt populations due to quantitative pollen limitation, while the seed to ovule ratio per fruit was lower in late-snowmelt populations. This is because geitonogamous pollination by workers was common later in the season, which resulted in a high abortion rate of self-pollinated seeds, that is, qualitative pollen limitation. Thus, pollination efficiency, or the type of pollen limitation, shifts during the flowering season, reflecting the seasonal life cycle of bumblebees in the ecosystem. Many of the self-fertilized seeds aborted due to high inbreeding depression, and the outcrossing rate was ;80% regardless of season. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

The male and female flowers of these species have similar floral structures, but exhibit different pollination systems. At the base of the clade, S. glabra is pollinated by a wide variety of beetles and flies in a generalist pollination system that also includes floral heat and the use of male and female flowers as brood sites for insects. In Asia, however, S. bicolor and S. repanda are pollinated exclusively by one or two different species of gall midges (Resseliella spp.) in a specialist pollination system. In this system only female, pollen-eating gall midges pollinate the flowers and breed on nearby spiderwebs. The gall midge pollination system is specialized and derived from the generalist system in S. glabra, and basal in the clade. Pollen is the main floral resource, and we hypothesize it is exploited to enrich eggs, and as a result species of gall midges could increase reproductive fitness by feeding on a single dependable food source.

In buzz-pollinated flowers, pollen is released through terminal pores after bees vibrate the stamens. Several studies have evaluated the function of 'buzzing' in pollen release, but less attention has been paid to the effect of buzzing on pollen capture and deposition on stigmas. Evaluating the mechanism of pollen dispersion in buzz-pollinated flowers is important because it may affect mating patterns and reproductive success. In this study, we analysed the morphology of sexual organs (anther and stigma) using electron microscopy, and determined the relationship between sexual organ structure and pollen capture function through experimental manipulations of buzz-pollinated flowers of Chamaecrista chamaecristoides, as well as vibration frequencies on floral visitors. Pollen release occurs through two terminal pores at the tip of the stamens. However, unlike most angiosperms that have their stigmatic surface exposed, C. chamaecristoides presents a stigmatic surface inside a cavity covered by trichomes. Experimental manipulations showed that effective fertilisation is only achieved when the style is vibrated, suggesting that buzzing is not only important for pollen release but also for pollen capture and deposition on the stigma. This result, in addition to vibration frequency analysis, suggests that although all floral visitors buzz flowers only those that buzz at higher frequencies achieve effective fertilisation. The anatomical features of sexual organs in flowers of C. chamaecristoides demonstrate that this species possesses a highly specialised, elaborate morphology, with both genders selected for traits that promote buzz pollination. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Poricidal anther dehiscence; Sonication frequency; Stigma trichomes; Stigmatic cavity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650109438

Several plants, and especially orchids, mimic insect semiochemicals to attract insects for unrewarded pollination. Here, we present a new case of pheromone mimicry found in the terrestrial orchid Epipactis veratrifolia. Flowers are visited and pollinated by several species of aphidophagous hoverflies, the females of which also often lay eggs in the flowers. The oviposition behaviour of these hoverflies is mainly guided by aphid-derived kairomones. We show that the flowers produce ?- and ?-pinene, ?-myrcene and ?-phellandrene, and that these compounds attract and induce oviposition behaviour in female hoverflies. This floral odour profile is remarkably similar to the alarm pheromone released by several aphid species, such as Megoura viciae. We therefore suggest that E. veratrifolia mimics aphid alarm pheromones to attract hoverflies for pollination; this is the first time, to our knowledge, that such a ca of mimicry has been demonstrated. © 2010 The Royal Society.",Chemical mimicry; Deceptive pollination; Pheromone,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960045746

Here we investigate sexual dimorphism in an androdioecious population of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua by comparing the resource allocation strategies of males and hermaphrodites grown under different nutrient-availability and competitive regimes. We found that males displayed smaller aboveground vegetative sizes than did hermaphrodites, but neither soil nutrient availability nor competition had a strong independent effect on their relative sizes. Plants adjusted their relative reproductive investment in response to nutrient availability. Specifically, hermaphrodites increased their reproductive allocation when growing in poor soils, whereas males displayed the opposite response. Finally, hermaphrodites were strongly female biased in their sex allocation, and this was more pronounced in nutrient-poor soils. To conclude, sexual dimorphism in androdioecious M. annua shares many features with dioecious and gynodioecious species, particularly wind-pollinated herbs. However, the direction of sex-allocation reaction norms displayed by hermaphrodites of M. annua differs from that documented for several insect-pollinated gynodioecious species, hinting at the importance of either the pollination mode or the\ sexual system as a context of selection shaping the reproductive strategy of plants with both male and female functions. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Anaxagorea prinoides had bisexual flowers and two floral morphs within the studied population were protogynous. The population under study comprised 7 mature trees belonging to one morph and 12 to the other. Statistical analyses showed that the two morphs were in a 50:50% ratio, and therefore the temporal sexual pattern of heterodichogamy is given. When anthesis of flowers in the male stage ended in one morph, anthesis started with flowers in the female stage in the complementary morph. Approximately 1 h before the end of anthesis in one morph, flowers of the reciprocal morph started to emit a fruit-like scent. The temporal separation of the female and the male stages of the two different morphs lasted only approximately 1 h. Six of the seven identified compounds in the banana-like floral scent were esters and one was an alcohol. The main compounds examined are known to be components of fruit scents. Nitidulidae beetles of the genus Colopterus were the pollinators of A. prinoides and during flowering were maintained within the population of this species. This was not only due to the fact that the beetles remained sheltered in the pollination chamber of the flowers, but also because upon release from individuals of male-stage flowers at the end of flower anthesis they were attracted by the odoriferous female-stage flowers of other individuals of the same population. Heterodichogamy of A. prinoides appears to be a means by which reproductive success is augmented. Attraction of beetle pollinators by ""fruit-imitating"" floral scent is not restricted to species of Anaxagorea, but occurs in many representatives of the Annonaceae. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Anaxagorea prinoides; Annonaceae; Beetle pollination; French Guiana; Fruit-imitating floral odour; Heterodichogamy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650928539

Pollination can combine genes from different populations adapted to very different local environments and create greater diversity within the gene pools of a species. Some plant species have evolved exclusive relationships with specific pollinators and are incapable of any other means of reproducing. These species go extinct if their pollinator disappears. A rich native plant community is a mixture of species that range from common to rare. Rare plants often benefit the most from outcross pollination because they are at greater risk for the genetic problems associated with selfing and inbreeding. Maintaining the orchid's pollinators in the grasslands requires more than just the orchid. Most importantly, each hawkmoth species requires host plants for larvae. The services these pollinators provide in terms of promoting reproduction and out-crossing in native grasslands is crucial to the maintenance of plant biodiversity.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959521997

Previous studies considered wind pollination to be a largely random phenomenon, but recent evidence suggests that wind-pollinated species have evolved different complex reproductive adaptations for controlling and maximizing the success of wind pollination. However, compared with angiosperms, wind pollination in gymnosperms is poorly understood. We investigated the male reproductive structures of 13 representative gymnosperm species using a scanning electron microscope and digital camera, and analyzed how the morphological characteristics of male cones and pollen facilitate pollination. These characteristics showed a surprising variation between different gymnosperm species in improving pollination success. For example, the relationship between the position of the male cone and the surrounding vegetative structures is adjusted to optimize pollen release. The pollen grains have sacs and papilla and exhibit particular shapes after release from microsporangia, including boat-like, saccate, papilla-like and spheroid shapes, which facilitate pollen dispersal in the air. Taken together, our results suggest that the extensive diversity of male reproductive structures within gymnosperms represents an evolutionary response to long-term selection and results in solutions to the physical restraints of anemophily.",Gymnosperms; Male cones; Pollen grains; Reproductive structure; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051933008

Grisebach in the biome of the Atlantic rain forest, southern Brazil. On Santa Catarina Island, flowering extends from mid-September to the end of December, with diurnal anthesis. The reproductive system is obligatory xenogamy, thus pollinator-dependent. Flowers secrete 31.84?l of nectar per day, with a mean sugar concentration of 23.2%. Highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur at the beginning of anthesis. Most floral traits are characteristic for ornithophily, and nectar production appears to be adapted to the energy demand of hummingbirds. Continued secretion of the sucrose-dominated nectar attracts and binds visitors to inflorescences, strengthening trapline foraging behaviour. Experiments assessing seed set after single flower visits were performed with the most frequent visitors, revealing the hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis as the most effective pollen vector. In addition, bees are also functional pollinators, as substantiated by their high visitation frequency. We conclude that this pollination system is bimodal. Thus, there is redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees, granting a high probability of successful reproduction in Ae. nudicaulis. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Bromeliaceae; Energy supply; Floral syndrome; Nectar composition; Pollinator effectiveness; Self-incompatibility; Visitation frequency,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650124304

We propose the analysis of food composition in bee trap nests to assess the reliability of network specialization estimates.

The rare species in the networks appear to be more specialized than they really are, and the bias in the estimation of the species degree increases with the rareness.

Regarding the relationship between co-flowering plants, rewarding and non-rewarding orchids in particular, few studies have investigated whether non-rewarding plants affect the pollination success of rewarding plants. Here, floral isolation and mutual effects between the rewarding orchid Galearis diantha and the non-rewarding orchid Ponerorchis chusua were investigated. •Methods Flowering phenological traits were monitored by noting the opening and wilting dates of the chosen individual plants. The pollinator pool and pollinator behaviour were assessed from field observations. Key morphological traits of the flowers and pollinators were measured directly in the field. Pollinator limitation and interspecific compatibility were evaluated by hand-pollination experiments. Fruit set was surveyed in monospecific and heterospecific plots. •Key Results The species had overlapping peak flowering periods. Pollinators of both species displayed a certain degree of constancy in visiting each species, but they also visited other flowers before landing on the focal orchids. A substantial difference in spur size between the species resulted in the deposition of pollen on different regions of the body of the shared pollinator. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that fruit set was strongly pollinator-limited in both species. No significant difference in fruit set was found between monospecific plots and heterospecific plots. •Conclusions A combination of mechanical isolation and incomplete ethological isolation eliminates the possibility of pollen transfer between the species. These results do not support either the facilitation or competition hypothesis regarding the effect of nearby rewarding flowers on non-rewarding plants. The absence of a significant effect of non-rewarding P. chusua on rewarding G. diantha can be ascribed to low levels of overlap between the pollinator pools of two species. © The Author 2010.

A cost-effective method to assess pollen dispersal consists of monitoring the dispersal of fluorescent dyes used as pollen analogues. However, few comparisons between dye dispersal and realized pollen dispersal have been performed to validate the method. We investigated pollen dispersal in two small populations of the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior from urban forest fragments using direct (paternity analyses based on microsatellite DNA markers) and indirect (fluorescent dyes) methods. We compared these methods using two approaches, testing for the difference between the distance distributions of observed dispersal events and estimating parameters of a dispersal model, and related these results to dye dispersal patterns in three large populations. Dye and realized (based on paternity inference) pollen dispersal showed exponential decay distributions, with 74. 2-94. 8% of the depositions occurring at <50 m and a few longer distance dispersal events (up to 151 m). No significant difference in curve shape was found between dye and realized pollen dispersal distributions. The best-fitting parameters characterizing the dye dispersal model were consistent with those obtained for realized pollen dispersal. Hence, the fluorescent dye method may be considered as reliable to infer realized pollen dispersal for forest herbs such as P. elatior. However, our simulations reveal that large sample sizes are needed to detect moderate differences between dye and realized pollen dispersal patterns because the estimation of dispersal parameters suffers low precision. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Dispersal kernel; Microsatellite DNA; Paternity analysis; Primula elatior; Realized pollen dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951555479

Managing rangelands to enhance life requisites for native pollinators likely will require adjusting current practices. Many bumble bee species also nest under or on the ground, but instead of digging narrow underground tunnels, they utilize existing cavities, such as those left behind by burrowing mammals. A diversity and abundance of plants that produce nectar and pollen used by insects, combined with a variety of standing or downed dead wood, bare ground, and overgrown vegetation, are the hallmarks of rich heterogeneous pollinator habitat.

The molecular genetics and function of venation were investigated in the genus Antirrhinum, in which venation is determined by Venosa (encoding an R2R3MYB transcription factor). Pollinator preferences were measured by field tests with Antirrhinum majus. Venosa function was examined using in situ hybridization and transient overexpression. The origin of the venation trait was examined by molecular phylogenetics. Venation and full- red flower colouration provide a comparable level of advantage for pollinator attraction relative to palely pigmented or white lines. Ectopic expression of Venosa confers pigmentation outside the veins. Venosa transcript is produced only in small areas of the corolla between the veins and the adaxial epidermis. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that venation patterning is an ancestral trait in Antirrhinum. Different accessions of three species with full- red pigmentation with or without venation patterning have been found. Epidermal- specific venation is defined through overlapping expression domains of the MYB (myoblastoma) and bHLH (basic Helix- Loop- Helix) co- regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis, with the bHLH providing epidermal specificity and Venosa vein specificity. Venation may be the ancestral trait, with full- red pigmentation a derived, polyphyletic trait.

While many studies focus on the direct impact of alien plants on native systems, indirect effects of plant invaders on co-flowering natives, for example through competition for pollination services, are less well studied and the results are variable. We used six temporally and taxonomically highly resolved plant-pollinator networks from the island of Mahé, Seychelles, to investigate the indirect impact of invasive alien plant species on remnant native plant communities mediated by shared pollinators. We employed fully quantitative network parameters and information on plant reproductive success, and pollinator diversity and behaviour, to detect changes in plant-pollinator networks along an invasion gradient. The number of visits to and fruit set of native plants did not change with invasion intensity. Weighted plant linkage and interaction evenness, however, was lower at invaded sites than at less invaded sites. These patterns were primarily driven by shifts in interactions of the most common pollinator, the introduced honey bee Apis mellifera, while weak interactions and strong native interactions remained unchanged. Synthesis. The implications of these findings are twofold: first, quantitative network parameters are important tools for detecting underlying biological patterns.

In order to overcome the pre-fertilization barrier and obtain some hybrids, we carried out wide hybridization between them again in this study, and tentatively adopted three pollination techniques including mentor pollen, delayed pollination, and gibberellic acid treatment. The average number of pollen grains germinating on stigma at 24 h after pollination and the percentage of embryo were investigated with a temporary mount method and the technique of fluorescence microscopy. It was found that, compared with the control, delayed pollination, gibberellic acid treatment, and mentor pollen significantly increased the average number of pollen grains germinating on each stigma at 24 h after pollination by approximately 152, 235, and 182%, respectively. In addition, all the three pollination techniques significantly increased the percentage of normal embryos at different periods after artificial pollination in comparison to the control. Furthermore, seed sets of the crosses using the three special pollination techniques were 1.1, 1.4, and 2.0%, respectively, whereas we did not obtained any seeds in the control. Taken together, these results suggest that delayed pollination, gibberellic acid treatment, and mentor pollen are three useful pollination techniques for overcoming pre-fertilization barriers and increasing seed set in the wide hybridization between C. grandiflorum 'Yuhuaxingchen' and C. nankingense, and they may be widely applied for increasing breeding efficiency in other chrysanthemum wide hybridization facing similar pre-fertilization barriers. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Chrysanthemum grandiflorum; Delayed pollination; Gibberellic acid; Mentor pollen; Pre-fertilization barrier; Wide cross,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951774770

In a number of wind-pollinated taxa, however, fertilization does not occur immediately. It has been proposed that delayed fertilization promotes pollen competition by providing a ""fair start"" for pollen tubes. To test this hypothesis we compared paternity after simultaneous and consecutive pollinations with multiple donors in Fraxinus excelsior. Additionally, we investigated pollen tube growth in naturally pollinated flowers. Under natural conditions pollen grains arrived on the stigma one by one, and their mean number reached 6 after 10 d of anthesis. A pollen tube from the first-arriving pollen grain entered the style after 24 h and reached the base on the second day following pollination. Fertilization by nuclei from the same firstarriving pollen tube occurred after stigma necrosis about 3 wk later. Paternity tests confirmed that pollen applied first in the experimental pollinations had an overwhelming advantage over pollen applied 24 h later. As delayed fertilization does not play a role in prezygotic selection in this species, flowering phenology might be more important for paternity success than pollen tube growth performance. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Time of flower closure has been explained mainly by light in the traditional botanical literature. We show with a set of experiments that Asteraceae flower heads can close within three hours after pollination, whereas un-pollinated flower heads stay open until the late afternoon. This suggests that closing time strongly depends on pollinators. Using plant-pollinator interaction webs we further demonstrate that the daily pattern of flower opening and the rapid response to pollination can impose strong temporal dynamics on interspecific interactions within a single day. We observed pollinator species turnover and changes in facilitation vs. competition among plants. Our results show for the first time that pollination induces rapid flower closure on the community level.

Here, we identify population genetic divergence in three species of Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) similarly distributed throughout the Great Basin region of the western United States but with different pollination syndromes (bee and hummingbird). The Great Basin ' s mountainous landscape provides an ideal setting to compare the interaction of landscape and dispersal ability in isolating populations of different species. Methods: We used eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to identify neutral population genetic structure between populations within and among mountain ranges for eight populations of P. deustus, 10 populations of P. pachyphyllus, and 10 populations of P. rostriflorus. We applied traditional population genetics approaches as well as spatial and landscape genetics approaches to infer genetic structure and discontinuities among populations. Key results: A ll three species had significant genetic structure and exhibited isolation by distance, ranging from high structure and low inferred gene flow in the bee-pollinated species P. deustus (F ST = 0.1330, R ST= 0.4076, seven genetic clusters identify ed) and P. pachyphyllus (F ST= 0.1896, R ST= 0.2531, four genetic clusters identified) to much lower structure and higher inferred gene flow in the hummingbird-pollinated P. rostriflorus (F ST= 0.0638, R ST= 0.1116, three genetic clusters identify ed).

Here we compare two hermaphroditic insect-pollinated Daphne species (D. rodriguezii and D. gnidium) which differ in distribution (island endemic vs. mediterranean) and floral traits (long- vs. short-tube corolla). We investigated their mating system and pollen limitation by means of hand-pollination experiments and quantified the diversity and abundance of flower visitors by direct observations. Plant size and five reproductive traits (flower production, proportion of viable anthers, pollen production, flower tube length and tepal area) were studied to assess how they contribute to reproductive success, measured as proportion of pollen grains germinated per stigma and fruit set. Selfing was very low and pollen limitation existed in both species, though was higher in D. rodriguezii probably due to the scarcity of flower visitors. The low fruit set in both species suggests that most of the pollen grains found on stigmas are self-pollen. Pollinators appeared to favour some floral traits (specifically, flower tube length or tepal area) in both species, although flower crop in D. rodriguezii was the only reproductive trait influencing fruit set. In both species, the highest variability in reproductive traits and pollination success was within individuals. Our findings suggest that despite both species showed similar mating system, dependency on outcrossing pollen and selection of floral traits, pollen limitation was higher in D. rodriguezii, probably as a higher proportion of self-pollen arrives to its stigmas. © 2010 The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer.",Daphne gnidium; Daphne rodriguezii; Flower traits; Insect pollination; Mating system; Phenotypic selection; Pollen deposition; Species comparison,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951774157

The body size and the length of both the first and the second pairs of wings were higher in the forest fragments and the matrix than in the continuous forest. A significant positive relationship between wing length and body size was observed for all habitats, but the percentage of variance explained was lower in the continuous forest than in the fragments and the matrix. These results suggest that the fragmentation of the Maulino forest would favor phenotypes with larger wings. It is probable that these phenotypes would be best at flying and obtaining scarce resources during foraging.",Bumblebees; Habitat fragmentation; Morphometric changes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860311590

(loblolly pine) parent into the P. elliottii Engelm. (slash pine) background. Several traits were measured in the first growing season: height growth, phenology, tip moth incidence, stem traits, crown architectural and needle traits. Heterosis was evaluated for each trait using analyses of variance by fitting a linear mixed model. All traits were significantly (p value < 0.05) different among families while the significance for heterosis varied by trait. Positive heterosis was found for average rate of shoot elongation (ASRE), total growth (TG), total height and number of needles per fascicle while the opposite was true for base diameter, top diameter, fascicle length, fascicle diameter, crown projected area and phenological traits (cessation, duration and day to reach 50% of the height). Average performance (i.e., no heterosis) was found for initiation of growth, number of branches, number of nodes, tip moth incidence, sheath length and specific leaf area. The analyses indicated that introgression of loblolly pine alleles into slash pine was effective and novel trait combinations were achieved. The pseudo-backcross had larger variation in early height growth than the slash pine families and was taller than all open-pollinated families at the end of the first season. Tip moth incidence was much lower than the loblolly pine family. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Genetic transfer; Heterosis; Pinus elliottii; Pinus taeda; Pseudo-backcross; Southern pines,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751641754

We also manipulated flowers by altering corolla size or nectar volume, or by removing anthers, to examine the effect of these primary and secondary attractants (i.e. rewards and advertisements) on attractiveness. A change in corolla size and shape reduced visiting frequency and pollen load. Removal of anthers did not affect visiting rates, but significantly reduced pollination rates and stigmatic pollen load. A decrease in the nectar volume of a flower was associated with a reduction in handling time and pollen loads on stigmas. These results show that corolla size is an important advertisement to pollinators (particularly at greater distance), which associate hermaphrodite flowers with a larger corolla and a larger volume of nectar than female flowers. We found that artificial changes in population structure affected the behavior of pollinators as well as the pollination rates of flowers. We suggest that the pattern of distribution of hermaphrodite and female clones in a population may serve to avoid pollen limitation in a female clone or patch.

When two females share a patch, they frequently produce clutches that differ in size, the female with the larger clutch optimally producing a more female-biased sex ratio and vice versa. Females can base their sex allocation on their own clutch size only (""self-knowledge"") or on both females' clutch sizes (""complete knowledge""). Few studies have genotyped offspring so that each mother's contribution can be considered separately while none has found that both sources of information are used simultaneously. We genotyped 2489 wasps from 28 figs and assigned their maternity to one of the two foundress females. We argue that likelihood is a very convenient method to compare alternative models, while fitness calculations help to appreciate the cost of maladaptation. We find that the pollinating fig wasp Platyscapa awekei simultaneously uses its own as well as the other females clutch size in allocating sex.

The effect of wind velocity on avocado-flower pollen under laboratory conditions was also studied. Rates of pollination showed highly positive correlations with honeybee density, whereas no correlations were observed with wind velocity. Under laboratory conditions, no effect of wind velocities equivalent to those measured in the field was observed on avocado-flower pollen. Our results agree with earlier work in which wind contributed only slightly to avocado yield. Hence, we conclude that contrasting data which show the effectiveness of wind pollination in avocado are not relevant to most avocado-growing regions, including Israel and California.

However, the question whether it also affects learning and memory remained unanswered. To address this question, we studied the effect of circadian timing on olfactory learning and memory in honey bees Apis mellifera using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. Bees were differentially conditioned to odours and tested for their odour learning at four different ""Zeitgeber"" time points. We show that learning behaviour is influenced by circadian timing. Honey bees perform best in the morning compared to the other times of day. Additionally, we found influences of the light condition bees were trained at on the olfactory learning. This circadian-mediated learning is independent from feeding times bees were entrained to, indicating an inherited and not acquired mechanism. We hypothesise that a co-evolutionary mechanism between the honey bee as a pollinator and plants might be the driving force for the evolution of the time-dependent learning abilities of bees. © 2010 The Author(s).",Circadian; Honey bee; Learning; Olfaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651479728

However, subsets within each network sometimes are different from the complete system. Social wasps are one subset within flower-visiting networks; they use nectar as a secondary food of adults. Some of the visited plants depend on wasps for pollination, and many are further benefited through predation of herbivores captured to feed wasp larvae. Therefore, mutual dependence is lower in the wasp subset compared to complete pollination networks, so we expected wasp-flower networks to exhibit more generalistic interactions. Quantitative datasets were built by recording wasp visits to flowers in six Brazilian localities in four ecoregions, and comparisons were made with complete pollination networks from the literature (with different taxa included). Nestedness (NODF = 0.39 ± 0.06) was similar in wasp-flower and complete pollination networks (NODF = 0.32 ± 0.18). Interaction specialization in wasp-flower networks was lower (median H2' = 0.31 ± 0.09) than in complete pollination networks (median H2' = 0.55 ± 0.17). Modularity in wasp-flower networks (M = 0.36 ± 0.05) was also lower than in complete pollination networks (M = 0.47 ± 0.09); there were on average 5 ± 1 modules on each network formed by species of different genera. In summary, our findings confirm that wasps that feed on nectar interact with similar subsets of plants; therefore, wasp-flower networks are more generalistic than other pollination networks. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that, despite some universal properties found in facultative mutualisms, parts of a system differ from the complete system. Furthermore, mutual dependence influences interaction specialization, and so it is an important structuring factor of mutualistic networks. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Community structure; Complex networks; Hymenoptera; Modularity; Mutualism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650773586

In one, we analyzed the RI effect on a native seed set at three spatial scales. In the second, we tracked IPT from alien to native flower heads using fluorescent pigments as markers. We estimated that pollination distances were in the order of several meters. These distances exceeded the mean distance from each native plant to the nearest alien.

To better understand the reproductive biology of the tropical epiphytic orchid Bulbophyllum variegatum on Réunion, we investigated the floral morphology, breeding system, pollinator diversity, floral scent profile and fruiting success of about 30 individuals in three natural populations during two consecutive flowering seasons. Controlled hand-pollination experiments in two populations showed that the species is self-compatible, but requires pollinator service to achieve reproduction. Videotape pollinator observations were conducted during two flowering seasons for 56 h and revealed that B. variegatum is pollinated by a single species of fly from the Platystomatidae. This fly seems to be attracted by the unpleasant scent produced by the flowers, and does not receive any reward after achieving pollination. In addition, no egg-laying behaviour was observed. Bulbophyllum variegatum thus exhibits a typical sapromyiophilous pollination syndrome which constitutes the first proven case of sapromyiophily within the genus Bulbophyllum on the Mascarene Archipelago. Hand pollinations further showed that fruit set was not significantly higher for flowers that received outcross pollen than for those that were self-crossed (53% and 44% respectively). Fruit sets under natural conditions were significantly different among populations, ranging from 0.5% to 24.3%. This low fruit production is likely due to infrequent pollinator visits, particularly in disturbed forests where the pollinator has never been observed. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",floral scent; fly-pollination; Orchidaceae; self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885690860

Methods: The maximum contribution of feral oilseed rape to impurities in harvested crops was estimated by combining data on feral abundance and crop yield from five established, demographic studies in agricultural habitats in Denmark, Germany (2), France and the UK, constituting over 1,500 ha of land and 16 site-years of observations. Persistence of feral populations over time was compared by visual and molecular methods. Results: Ferals had become established in all regions, forming populations 0.2 to 15 km-2. The seed they produced was always &lt;0.0001% of the seed on crops of oilseed rape in each region. The contribution of ferals to impurity in crops through accidental harvest of seed and through cross-pollination would be an even smaller percentage. Feral oilseed rape nevertheless showed a widespread capacity to persist in all regions and retain traits from varieties no longer grown. Conclusions: Feral oilseed rape is not a relevant source of macroscopic impurity at its present density in the landscape but provides opportunity for genetic recombination, stacking of transgenes and the evolution of genotypes that under strong selection pressure could increase and re-occupy fields to constitute an economic weed burden and impurity in future crops. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Cross pollination; Feral; Genetically modified; GM coexistence; Oilseed rape; Transgene persistence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650926321

The agricultural use of systemic insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, may harm bees through their presence in pollen and nectar, which bees consume. Many studies have tested the effects on honey bees of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid, but a clear picture of the risk it poses to bees has not previously emerged, because investigations are methodologically varied and inconsistent in outcome. In a meta-analysis of fourteen published studies of the effects of imidacloprid on honey bees under laboratory and semi-field conditions that comprised measurements on 7073 adult individuals and 36 colonies, fitted dose-response relationships estimate that trace dietary imidacloprid at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty. These findings raise renewed concern about the impact on honey bees of dietary imidacloprid, but because questions remain over the environmental relevance of predominantly laboratory-based results, I identify targets for research and provide procedural recommendations for future studies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Agrochemicals; Ecosystem services; Pollination; Pollution; Sustainability; Toxicology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651481407

Paternity analysis revealed that outbred males sired significantly more offspring than inbred males. Independently of the effects of inbreeding, male fitness depended on several male traits, including a sexually dimorphic (flower number) and a gametophytic trait (in vitro pollen germination rate). In addition, full-sib matings were less frequent than randomly expected. Thus, inbreeding, phenotype and genetic dissimilarity simultaneously affect male fitness in this animal-pollinated plant. While inbreeding depression might threaten population persistence, the deficiency of effective matings between sibs and the higher fitness of outbred males will reduce its occurrence and counter genetic erosion.",Fitness; Inbreeding; Plant; Pollen; Relatedness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81855193657

Based on evidence of the extent of the orchid's distribution from prior botanical surveys, it is considered to be a recent arrival in a previously unoccupied area of northern Ontario. Second-order polynomial regression revealed a significant increase in mean yearly temperature of 1 Celsius degree in parts of northern Ontario since 1980. Based on close association with limits of yearly temperature, this is considered sufficient to explain the expansion, and the individual extensions of range fit well into the anticipated newly available territory. Based on a consideration of the location of extensions with respect to plant hardiness zones, the landscape that has become available since 1980 is 160 000 km 2, in a band approximately 200 km wide across the southern part of northern Ontario. Assuming further temperature increases, this band is expected to expand to a width of approximately 300 km by 2040, providing 360 000 km 2 of newly available landscape over six decades. Spiranthes cernua produces thousands of seeds per flower by adventitious embryony, allowing single individuals to establish populations through long-distance wind dispersal with no reliance on pollination. Spiranthes cernua is therefore well adapted to quickly colonize new territory that becomes available through climate warming.",Canada; Climate change; Nodding Ladies'-tresses; Ontario; Orchid; Range extensions; Spiranthes cernua,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83155182246

Thus, there are implications to both breeding strategies and orchard management for fruit production. The purpose of this study was to identify and to characterize the S-RNase alleles of the gametophytic incompatibility among apple cultivars developed in Brazil, seeking to give support for choosing right combinations of parent in the apple breeding programs. It also sought to identify correct combinations of scion/pollinator cultivars of commercial apple orchards. A total of 16 specific S-RNase alleles primers were tested against DNA extracted from 12 Brazilian cultivars and their parents. The molecular analysis confronted to the reference cultivars, showed that the cultivars Daiane, Imperatriz and Princesa have the same incompatibility S3 and S5 alleles, while 'Lisgala' showed the alleles S2 and S5; 'Suprema', S1 and S9; 'Catarina', S1 and S19; 'Joaquina' and 'Fred Hough', S5 and S19; 'Baronesa', S3 and S9; 'Duquesa', S2 and S3. For 'Primícia' and 'Condessa' it was only possible to identify one of the S-alleles, namely S24 and S2, respectively, with the second allele remaining to be identified. Progeny test indicated the Mendelian inheritance for RNase alleles.

Despite consuming vast quantities of sugar-rich floral nectar, nectar-feeding bats are long-lived, provoking the question of how they regulate blood glucose. We investigated blood glucose levels in nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina) in experiments in which we varied the amount of dietary sugar or flight time. Blood glucose levels increased with the quantity of glucose ingested and exceeded 25 mmol1-1 l21 blood in resting bats, which is among the highest values ever recorded in mammals fed sugar quantities similar to their natural diet. During normal feeding, blood glucose values decreased with increasing flight time, but only fell to expected values when bats spent 75 per cent of their time airborne. Either nectar-feeding bats have evolved mechanisms to avoid negative health effects of hyperglycaemia, or high activity is key to balancing blood glucose levels during foraging. We suggest that the coevolutionary specialization of bats towards a nectar diet was supported by the high activity and elevated metabolic rates of these bats. High activity may have conferred benefits to the bats in terms of behavioural interactions and foraging success, and is simultaneously likely to have increased their efficiency as plant pollinators. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Blood glucose; Glycated haemoglobin; HbA1c; Hyperglycaemia; Nectarivory; Plant pollinator coevolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054890085

However, there is a shortage of studies examining the evolutionary dynamics of hybridization between outcrossing and selfing taxa. On the basis of differential pollinator attractiveness, production and competitive ability of pollen, as well as levels of inbreeding depression, we predict that the early products of hybridization between outcrossing and selfing lineages will be F1s and first-generation backcrosses sired mainly by the outcrossing lineage, together with selfed F2s containing a limited genetic contribution from the outcrosser. These predictions were tested using amplified fragment length polymorphism and chloroplast markers to analyze the composition of a recent hybrid swarm between predominantly outcrossing Geum rivale and predominantly selfing Geum urbanum. In line with predictions, the hybrid swarm comprised both parental species together with F1s and first-generation backcrosses to G. rivale alone. Chloroplast data suggested that G. rivale was the pollen parent for both observed hybrid classes. However, there was no evidence for F2 individuals, despite the fact that the F1 was fully self-compatible and able to auto-pollinate. The pollen fertility of F1s was only 30% lower than that of the parental taxa, and was fully restored in backcross hybrids. Predicting future evolution in the hybrid swarm will require an understanding of the mating patterns within and among the mix of parental, F1 and backcross genotypes that are currently present. However, these results support the hypothesis that introgression is likely to be asymmetrical from selfing to outcrossing lineages. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Germination declined rapidly for both types of marked pollen after 48 h and before 37 days at -20°C storage, while the unmarked pollen lots retained 93% germination at all stages.

In particular, pollination constraints are modulated by pollinator visitation rates, pollinator visitation behaviour (promoting crossing or selfing), the type and number of pollinia deposited on stigmas (in the case of orchids with subequal pollinia) and the amount of pollen loaded per inflorescence. In order to assess to what extent these factors can affect fruit set in specific orchid-pollinator systems, the repercussions of some of these aspects on reproduction of Broughtonia lindenii were examined in a coastal population in western Cuba. The study focused on plant breeding system, importance of pollen load and type of pollinia on subsequent fruit and seed, limiting factors of seed production and interaction with pollinators. This species presents longlasting flowers that senesce after all forms of effective visit. Pollinator dependence for fruit production was demonstrated, while handpollination experiments revealed selfcompatibility and inbreeding depression at seed level. More pollinia on stigmas enhance the proportion of welldeveloped seeds. In contrast, the pollinia type used in pollination is not important for seed quality of fruits, suggesting that small pollinia are not rudimentary. Natural fruit set in two consecutive years was substantially affected by pollinator activity, and also by systematic depredatory activity of ants and a caterpillar. Considering that this orchid completely lacks nectar and that the local assemblage of pollinators and predators influenced its reproduction, a minor importance of resource constraints in this epiphyte (with longlasting reserve structures) is confirmed at least for a short time. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Cuba; Inbreeding depression; Laeliinae; Melissodes; Pollen limitation; Postremoval senescence; Selfcompatibility; Subequal pollinia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650157576

Here, we show that male and female individuals of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua are sexually dimorphic in both their intraspecific and interspecific competitive abilities. In a controlled experiment, we found that both sexes of M. annua were negatively affected by interspecific competition, but the sensitivity of males and females depended on the identity of their competitor species, with females tending to suppress the aboveground growth of competitor species more than males. Further, we found that intrasexual and intersexual competition affected the aboveground growth of males but not that of females: only males showed a significant reduction in growth when growing with conspecific competitors (male or female). We discuss our results with reference to related studies that suggest that males and females of M. annua have different resource requirements for reproduction, which in turn affect their competitive abilities. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Interspecific competition; Intrasexual competition; Resource requirements; Sexual dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650125663

This reasoning can be applied to flowers and inflorescences, because the increase in flower or inflorescence size can differentially benefit different gender functions, and thus favour preferential allocation to specific floral structures. We investigated how inflorescence size influenced sexual expression and female reproductive success in the monoecious Tussilago farfara, by measuring patterns of biomass, and N and P allocation. Inflorescences of T. farfara showed broad variation in sex expression and, according to expectations, allocation to different sexual structures showed an allometric pattern. Unexpectedly, two studied populations had a contrasting pattern of sex allocation with an increase in inflorescence size. In a shaded site, larger inflorescences were femalebiased and had disproportionately more allocation to attraction structures; while in an open site, larger inflorescences were malebiased. Female reproductive success was higher in larger, showier inflorescences. Surprisingly, male flowers positively influenced female reproductive success. These allometric patterns were not easily interpretable as a result of pollen limitation when naïvely assuming an unequivocal relationship between structure and function for the inflorescence structures. In this and other Asteraceae, where inflorescences are the pollination unit, both male and female flowers can play a role in pollinator attraction. © 2009 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Allocation currency; Allometry; Inflorescence size; Monoecy; Sexual allocation; Sexual expression; Tussilago farfara,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650133010

The genus Quisqualis is maintained to accommodate selected African, Indian, Asian and Malesian species (including Q. indica L. and Q. parviflora Sond.). Diagnostic characters for Quisqualis include: leaves with abundant subepidermal crystalliferous idioblasts, each containing a large druse of calcium oxalate; leaves, stems and flowers with stalked glands but no scales; persistent petiole bases that develop into curved spines; petals well developed; hypanthium tubular or cylindrical, usually longer than 20 mm; stamens and style not or scarcely exserted; style adnate to hypanthium for more than half its length. Quisqualis shares a number of morphological similarities with Combretum Loefl. subgen. Cacoucia (Aubl.) Exell & Stace sect. Poivrea (Comm. ex DC.) G.Don. Some species of Combretaceae from West, West Central and East Africa have the style adnate to the upper hypanthium and display features reminiscent of both Quisqualis and Combretum. These species also have characters of their own and in the past were placed in different sections under Combretum. It is suggested that at least some of these species may be best classified in genera distinct from Combretum and Quisqualis, one of which is Campylogyne Hemsley. Combretum s.str. is defined on the basis of a combination of characters and includes species of which the upper hypanthium is variable in shape, but when tubular or cylindrical, then always shorter than 20 mm. Other diagnostic characters include: stamens exserted well beyond petals; style exserted and free, but when shortly adnate to upper hypanthium (only at the base or for a short distance), then stamens long-exserted. It is suggested that different pollination strategies have developed independently in the Combretum-Quisqualis clade, resulting in convergent morphological trends in floral morphology. These homoplasious similarities in floral morphology are at the root of the difficulties experienced to demarcate genera. An alternative classification is provided for those preferring to include the southern African Quisqualis parviflora under Combretum s. I. For this purpose, a new combination and name, Combretum sylvkola O.Maurin is provided.

Amyriad of indices have been developed to characterize landscape patterns, but not all of them are equally suited to evaluate temporal changes in landscape connectivity as is increasingly needed for biodiversity monitoring and operational indicator delivery. Relevant advancements in this direction have been recently proposed based on graph theoretical methods to analyze landscape network connectivity and on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale. Building from these developments, wemodify arecent index and present the equivalent connected area (ECA) index, defined as the size of a single patch (maximally connected) that would provide the same probability of connectivity than the actual habitat pattern in the landscape. The temporal changes in ECA can be directly compared with the changes in total habitat area. This allows for additional and straightforward insights on the degree to which the gains or losses in habitat amount can be beneficial or deleterious by affecting landscape elements that uphold connectivity in a wider landscape context. We provide a demonstrative example of application and interpretation of this index and approach to monitor changes in functional landscape connectivity. We focus on the trends in European forests at the province level in the period 1990-2000 from Corine land cover data, considering both changes in the forest spatial pattern and in the average permeability of the landscape matrix. The degree of connectivity was rather stable over most of the study area, with a slight overall increase in forest connectivity in Europe. However, a few countries and regions concentrated remarkably high changes in the analyzed period, particularly those with a low forest cover. The species traits also affected the responses to landscape pattern changes, which were more prominent for those species with limited dispersal abilities. We conclude discussing the potential of this approach for consistent indicator delivery, as well as the limitations and possibilities of application to a variety of situations, for which the required quantitative tools are freely available as open source projects. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Growth and compositional changes during development and ripening of 'Lonet-Mesaed' date palm fruit were studied in two successive seasons. The results showed that fruit and flesh weight, diameter and length gradually increased during development until week 14 from pollination (maturity or Bisir stage) but slightly decreased thereafter during ripening at week 16 from pollination (ripening or Rutab stage). The changes in these parameters showed a clear sigmoidal pattern for fruit growth. Seed weight rapidly increased especially from week 6 to 10 (cell elongation or Kimri stage), slightly increased from week 10 to 12 and then decreased at week 16 from pollination. Flesh/seed ratio was sharply decreased from week 6 to 10 from pollination but then gradually increased until ripening. TSS and flesh dry weight percentage slightly increased from week 6 to 10 from pollination and then rapidly increased during maturation and ripening. Acidity percentage sharply decreased from week 6 to 8, remained relatively constant until week 12 from pollination and then slightly increased during maturation and ripening. The concentration of vitamin C increased from week 6 to 8 from pollination but sharply decreased thereafter during maturation and ripening. On a fruit basis, the amount of vitamin C (mg/fruit) increased from week 6 to 8 and decreased at week 10 from pollination with slight changes during maturation and ripening. Total phenol concentration gradually increased during development, slightly decreased during maturation and then sharply decreased during ripening. As amount per fruit total phenols followed a similar pattern as for the concentration. The concentration of soluble tannins increased from week 6 to 8, decreased with fluctuation from week 8 to 14 and then sharply decreased during ripening. However, as amount per fruit, the soluble tannin content gradually increased during development, slightly decreased during maturity and then sharply decreased during ripening. On a dry weight basis, the concentration of all nutrient elements (nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, sodium, zinc, iron, copper and manganese) gradually decreased during development and more progressively during ripening.",Date palm; Development; Growth; Maturity; Phoenix dactylifera L.; Quality; Ripening,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956354965

We also compared differences in seed viability to plant traits, population size and habitat characteristics (soil properties, canopy cover, presence of proximate vegetation). Seed capsules from southern populations were significantly smaller, with only 9% of seeds being viable, compared to 36% in capsules from northern populations. Soil phosphorus concentrations differed between regions, but other habitat characteristics did not correlate with seed viability. Using calculations based on seedling recruitment data from other Caladenia species, we predict that seed output is insufficient to ensure the longterm persistence of the smallest C. rigida populations. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Orchidaceae; Population size; Recruitment potential; Seed output; Seed viability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650088669

In addition, the dispersal distance was assessed in a wind tunnel under constant air flow and then it was compared with the anticipated distances based on the pollen diameter. In the field, the maximum pollen density per day observed was 1.235 grains cm-2 day-1 at three observation points within 2.5 m from the field and inside the field the mean density did not reach the rate of 1 grain cm-2day-1 during 19 flowering days. The results of the wind tunnel experiment also showed that the plants had almost no airborne release of pollen and the dispersal distance was shorter than theoretical value due to clustered dispersal. This study showed little airborne pollen in and around the soybean field and the dispersal is restricted to a small area.

In addition, percentage resistance in relation to the most susceptible genotype and nematode reproduction factors (Rf) were calculated for the maize genotypes screened. Substantial variation existed among the maize hybrids and OPV’s with regard to the nematode parameters evaluated.

Merr.], manual cross-pollination to produce large quantities of hybrid seed is difficult and time consuming. Identification of an environmentally stable male-sterility system could make hybrid seed production commercially valuable. In soybean, 2 environmentally sensitive male-sterile, female-fertile mutants (ms8 and msp) have been identified. Inheritance studies showed that sterility in both mutants is inherited as a single gene. The objectives of this study were to 1) confirm that msp and ms8 are independent genes; 2) identify the soybean chromosomes that contain the msp and the ms8 genes using bulked segregant analyses (BSAs); and 3) make a genetic linkage map of the regions containing these genes. Mapping populations consisting of 176 F2 plants for ms8 and 134 F2 plants for msp were generated. BSA revealed that Sat-389 and Satt172 are closely associated markers with ms8 and msp, respectively. Map location of Sat-389 suggested that the ms8 gene is located on chromosome 7; molecular linkage group (MLG) M. Map location of Satt172 indicated that the msp gene is located on chromosome 2 (MLG Dlb). Genetic linkage maps developed using F2 populations revealed that ms8 is flanked by a telomere and Sat-389 and msp is flanked by Sat-069 and GMES4176. The region between the telomere and Sat-389 is physically 160 Kb. Soybean sequence information revealed that there are 13 genes present in that region. Protein BLASTP analyses revealed that homologs of 3 of the 13 genes are known to a play role in cell division, suggesting putative candidates for ms8. © The American Genetic Association. 2010.

Negligence towards factors influencing almond production, particularly choosing suitable cultivars, may bring about unrecoverable damages. One of the main problems of almond producers in Iran is the irregular and fluctuating production rates. This is the result of early flowering of native genotypes and coincidence of their flowering times with a cold spring. Under such conditions, chilling or lack of suitable pollination and insemination in the absence of pollen carrying insects at the time of flowering, reduces the total product. This type of damage has been estimated at 60-100% in some years. Thus, implementation of research plans and breeding projects on almond may be one of the best shots at producing cold resistant cultivars that may help counter this problem. An experiment was done on three major commercial cultivars of 'Monagha', variety 12 and variety 18, through a double-factor factorial in the form of random blocks with three replications. Treatments included cultivar at 3 levels, cold factor at 6 levels and phenological phase at 3 levels. Results indicated that the highest rate of ionic leakage in different hours after treatment was achieved at -6oC, in which the leakage was significantly higher than at other temperatures. The lowest leakage was achieved at 4oC, in which the leakage was significantly lower than at other temperatures. Variety 12 was more resistant to cold in comparison to the other two cultivars ('Monagha', variety 18). Comparison of means showed that the lowest leakage rate was achieved in the plant swelling (dormant) phase while the highest one was in the fruit phase. In other words, among phenological phases studied here, the newly formed fruit phase was most sensitive and the swollen phase most resistant to cold.",Almond; Cold damage; Cultivar; Leakage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80655123532

Since pollinators' responses to each of these stimuli are usually studied independently, the question of why plants produce multi-component floral displays remains relatively unexplored. Here we used signal detection theory to test the hypothesis that complex displays reduce a pollinator's uncertainty about the floral signal. Specifically, we asked whether one component of the floral display, scent, improved a bee's certainty about the value of another component, color hue. We first trained two groups of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson) to discriminate between rewarding and unrewarding artificial flowers of slightly different hues in the presence vsabsence of scent. In a test phase, we presented these bees with a gradient of floral hues and assessed their ability to identify the hue rewarded during training. We interpreted the extent to which bees' preferences were biased away from the unrewarding hue ('peak shift') as an indicator of uncertainty in color discrimination. Our data show that the presence of an olfactory signal reduces uncertainty regarding color: not only was color learning facilitated on scented flowers but also bees showed a lower amount of peak shift in the presence of scent. We explore potential mechanisms by which scent might reduce uncertainty about color, and discuss the broader significance of our results for our understanding of signal evolution. © 2011.

In this paper, we investigate factors that affect fruit set in Aristolochia baetica (Aristolochiaceae), a Mediterranean pipevine found in southwest Spain. Fruit production was monitored in two populations over 4years (2002-2005), and the causes of flower or fruit loss were determined. Experimental handpollinations were performed, and germinated pollen grains on the stigmas of openpollinated flowers were quantified. Fruit set was always very low (4-14%). Floral abscission initially reduced reproductive output by more than 50%; then herbivory (6-12%) and fruit abortion (8-26%) caused further reductions. Given that the number of efficiently pollinated flowers was always higher than that of ripe fruits, and that xenogamous handpollination did not increase fruit set in relation to openpollination, the final fruit production of A. baetica seems not to be pollenlimited. Fruit abortion of effectively pollinated flowers supports the idea that resource availability limits fruit set. In A. baetica, fruit abortion could lead to mate selection of the best quality fruits. Moreover, the initiated fruits that finally abort could also satiate predators, contributing to increase progeny fitness. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Bethedging; Mate selection; Resource limitation; Sacrificial sibling; Surplus flowers,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650167302

However, few studies have examined how much of the variance in tropical tree fecundity is explained by individual attributes of trees (e.g. number of flowers), and how much is due to contextual variables such as distances to nearest flowering neighbours. Using multiple regressions we examined the relative contributions of these factors to the pollination and fecundity of Goetzea elegans, a mainly self-incompatible tree endemic to Puerto Rico. We studied the largest wild population of the species during the peak flowering and collected data on the frequency of pollinator visits (N = 25 trees), and the fecundity of the whole population (N = 105), including the visitation rate of two pollinators (the honey bee Apis mellifera and the bananaquit Coereba flaveola), the total number of flowers produced by each tree, and the total fruit set and seed viability per tree. We also recorded the distance to flowering conspecifics and heterospecifics, and the height for each tree. Flower number had a strong positive effect on pollinator visitation, but distance to nearest neighbours was equally or more important than flower number in influencing fecundity. Also, competition for limited pollinators between G. elegans and other species has a stronger effect than the facilitation that conspecifics may provide. Our results suggest that pollinator visits and aspects of fecundity of G. elegans depend both on the attributes of individual plants, and on those of the community of other nearby plants. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.",Apis mellifera; Caribbean; Coereba flaveola; fruit set; nearest neighbour distance; partial self-incompatibility; pollination; Puerto Rico; seed viability; tropical trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865736462

The lowest KP enzyme activity (LEA) for each combination of line and DAP can be regarded as indicator to the bioassembly efficiency. In most of the combinations, DGATwas the enzyme with LEA, and glycerol-3- phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) or PAP acted as the enzyme with LEA in a few cases.

DNA sequences from nineteen nuclear and three chloroplast regions show a pattern of colonization from older to younger islands (west to east), with a concomitant decrease in genetic diversity eastwards (? = 0.53% for O'ahu, 0.43% for Moloka'i and 0.36% for Maui). While polymorphisms in the maternally inherited chloroplast have become fixed on different islands (FST = 0.804), significant gene flow between islands is inferred for the nuclear genome (FST = 0.270). This gene flow appears to be uneven, with most gene flow outwards from the central island. The extent of inter-island gene flow through wind pollination was assessed in an isolation-migration framework; the inferred rate, c. 1 migrant per generation, may be sufficient to prevent divergence of S. globosa populations and ensure cohesion of the species following the colonization of new islands. © 2010 The Authors.

Small populations are at risk because individuals are more likely to be affected by stochastic processes and inbreeding depression (Allee effect). Additionally, several studies have found that plants in small populations also experience lower pollinator visitation rates, which may further decrease reproduction. In this study, seed set, pollinator visitation and pollen limitation of Thymus capitatus (L.) was assessed in 32 patches in eight populations of various sizes on the island of Lesvos, Greece. All populations except one were significantly pollen-limited. We found that although free-pollinated flowers produced more seeds in larger populations this was not due to higher pollinator visitation rates as flowers which received pollen supplements also produced more seeds in larger populations. We hypothesize that the higher seed set is due to a generally greater genetic variability or better habitat quality. We show that honeybee visitation alone significantly decreases pollen limitation. © INRA/DIB-AGIB/EDP Sciences, 2010.",Lesvos; Patch size; Pollen limitation; Pollination; Population size; Thymus capitatus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054710516

Weed diversity increased flower visitor diversity, hence ameliorating the measured negative effects of isolation from natural habitat.

Although several conservation strategies for bumblebees address forage availability, other aspects of bumblebee ecology are often ignored. Availability of sufficient nest sites is a key requirement of bumblebee populations and since nesting habitat is likely to have become reduced on intensively farmed land, lower nest site availability may contribute to bumblebee declines. The use of artificial domiciles for bumblebees has been proposed as a potentially useful tool for conservation and for improving pollination services for crops, providing a method of boosting nest site availability where it is otherwise limiting. Here, six different artificial domiciles for bumblebees are trialled in different habitats in southern England and central Scotland. Of these, only one domicile design at one particular site achieved reasonable uptake rates, whilst all other combinations of domicile and site achieved low success. Overall, only 23 of 736 domiciles deployed were occupied by bumblebees (3.1%). Based on current knowledge, attempts to use domiciles for conservation or research in the UK are likely to be ineffective.

Overall, genetic factors strongly affected both early (seed mass, seed germination, early survival) and late (seed/ovule ratio) lifehistory traits.

The second pollination induced a strong loss of reproductive fitness (seed production, seed mass) in inbred D. guliae offspring, regardless of the pollination treatment (selfing/crossing); hence, a strong (genetic) maternal influence constrained early lifehistory traits of the second generation. Based on current knowledge, we conclude that selfcompatibility does not prevent the detrimental effects of inbreeding in D. guliae populations, and may increase the severe extinction risk if outcrossing rates decrease. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Extinction; Inbreeding depression; Maternal effect; Selfcompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650145726

Like honeybees they live in large eusocial colonies and rely on complex chemical recognition and communication systems. In contrast to honeybees, their ecology and especially their chemical ecology have received only little attention, particularly in the Old World. We previously have analyzed the chemical profiles of six paleotropical stingless bee species from Borneo and revealed the presence of species-specific cuticular terpenes- an environmentally derived compound class so far unique among social insects. Here, we compared the bees' surface profiles to the chemistry of their nest material. Terpenes, alkanes, and alkenes were the dominant compound groups on both body surfaces and nest material. However, bee profiles and nests strongly differed in their chemical composition. Body surfaces thus did not merely mirror nests, rendering a passive compound transfer from nests to bees unlikely. The difference between nests and bees was particularly pronounced when all resin-derived compounds (terpenes) were excluded and only genetically determined compounds were considered. When terpenes were included, bee profiles and nest material still differed, because whole groups of terpenes (e. g., sesquiterpenes) were found in nest material of some species, but missing in their chemical profile, indicating that bees are able to influence the terpene composition both in their nests and on their surfaces. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Cuticular profile; Meliponines; Resin; Stingless bees; Terpenes; Wax chemistry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79251637496

Heterostylous plants are characterised by the presence of discrete morphs that differ in sex organ position and in some other ancillary traits. As regards sex organ deployment, different types of polymorphisms have been described, depending on number and type of discrete classes present in populations and degree of reciprocity between them. However, a clearcut characterisation of stylar polymorphisms does not appear to be the best approach when there is great variability among populations because of continuous variation of some of traits examined. A recent study in Lithodora sensu lato (recently split into two separate genera, Lithodora and Glandora) showed a wide variation in sex organ position across species in the genus, which warrants precise population analysis of stylar polymorphism and its reciprocity. We provide a detailed morphometric analysis of flower sexual traits and include those considered to be ancillary characters. We report a wide variation in these traits in populations of Lithodora s.l. and highlight the subjectivity of the former characterisation of style polymorphism based on visual inspection. Ancillary traits appear repeatedly in Lithodora and Glandora, particularly in the latter. The appearance of these traits seems to be related to greater reciprocity between sexual whorls in Glandora, with the exception of G. prostrata. These results agree with evolutionary steps proposed in the buildup of heterostyly according to some evolutionary models. We also examined variation in polymorphisms in light of current models for evolution of heterostyly, and, more specifically, we sought to verify the prediction that flower traits as a whole (i.e., flower integration) respond to selective pressure to assure the exact location of pollen on the pollinator body. Most reciprocal populations and species, where betweenmorph pollen transfer is expected to be higher, would show greater integration. Our results confirm this hypothesis. © 2010 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.",Ancillary character; Disassortative mating; Distyly; Heterostyly; Phenotypic integration; Relaxed stylar dimorphism; Stylar polymorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955085355

Such a method must complement more intensive sampling methods inclusive of molecular cytogenetics, proteomics and genomics. We developed a new method for marking live Pinus taeda pollen using two dyes, rhodamine 123 and aniline blue, dissolved in a sucrose solution. Marked and unmarked pollen were compared with respect to in vitro germination, storage, terminal velocity, and in vivo pollen tube penetration of ovules. We found that: (1) both types of marked pollen retained their capacity for germination, (2) both types of marked pollen had similar aerodynamic properties when compared to unmarked pollen controls, (3) marked pollen retained its germination capacity for 48 h, and (4) of the marked pollen, only the aniline-marked pollen penetrated ovules during pollination. Germination declined rapidly for both types of marked pollen after 48 h and before 37 days at -20°C storage, while unmarked pollen lots retained 93% germination at all stages.

Male cone morphogenesis, pollen development and dispersal are important for successful pollination and reproduction. In this study, we investigated the development of male cone, pollen and the sporangial wall in detail. The results indicate that: (1) The primordia of male cones and leaves begin to differentiate in early June and remain open until the following March. The male cones then mature and release pollen in mid-April. The male cones are drooped and approximately perpendicular to the leaves during pollination. (2) The microsporocytes develop from the sporogenous cell and form a tetrahedral tetrad after two simultaneous asymmetrically meioses, then produce a matured four-cell pollen after three polar mitotic divisions. The matured pollen is hemispheric in shape with a large aperture area and three pollen wall layers; once released from the microsporangia, the pollen becomes boat-like in shape. (3) The sporangial walls are eusporangiate and consist of epidermis, endothecium and tapetum. The differentiation of the tapetum occurs separately from that of the epidermis and endothecium, and originates from the outermost layer of sporogenous cells. The sporangial walls exhibit shrinkage of the epidermis, fibrous thickening of the endothecium, and enzymic dissolution of the tapetum during pollen dispersal, which contributes to microsporangia opening. Based on these results, we conclude that there many unique and primitive characteristics of the development of the male cones, pollen and sporangial wall of G. biloba. In addition, we also found that the male cones, pollen and sporangial walls have evolved efficient structural and morphological adaptations to anemophily.",Ginkgo biloba L.; Male cone; Pollen development; Sporangial wall; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054868562

In this research we describe floral attributes and ancillary floral polymorphisms typically associated to heterostylous plants in Palicourea demissa (Rubiaceae), a distylous shrub of the Venezuelan Andes cloud forests. A hand-pollination experiment was done to evaluate self- and intramorph incompatibility and female reproductive output in both floral morphs. The studied population was morphologically distylous but morph differences in most ancillary floral polymorphisms and reciprocity of the sexual organ heights were found. The floral morphs were self-incompatible and did not differ in fruit set under controlled cross-pollination conditions, but at the population level they exhibited imperfect reciprocal herkogamy. Fruits and seeds of short-styled plants were larger than those of long-styled plants and fruit set was higher in short-styled plants under natural conditions, suggesting a higher reproductive potential among short-styled plants.

Cane discusses how to meet wild bees' needs on Western US Rangelands. Rangeland bees are threatened indirectly by those invasive exotic weeds that displace native plant communities. Contrary to some popular notions, bees are not averse to nonnative plants per se. Old World clover and alfalfa crops, for instance, are avidly visited by diverse New World bees, as are several other papilionaceous legumes that are more invasive in the US West and sericea. Pollinators in extensive rangelands are unlikely to encounter toxic insecticides. In contrast, insecticide poisoning is a substantial risk for bees venturing into conventional cropland and orchards, as well as too many suburban landscapes. In sprawling rangeland landscapes, insecticide use is rarely economical or warranted, which is fortunate for bees.

However, early harvesting can result in poor quality and low vigor of seeds. To elucidate the genetic basis of seed vigor at different stages of maturity, the seeds of a set of recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations at three different stages of maturity (32, 40, and 45 days after pollination; DAP), were used to evaluate the performance of four traits for seed vigor in the field. A genetic linkage map was constructed using 217 SSR makers covering 2438.2 cM with an average interval of 11.2 cM. The results showed that there were significant positive relationships among the four traits of seed vigor at all three sampling times, and all showed quantitative changes according to the degree of maturity of the seeds. However, the four traits of seed vigor were not significantly related to the 100-kernel weight. In total, we detected 16 different QTL for the four measured traits of seed vigor at three sampling times; five QTL were for germination energy, three for germination percentage, four for germination index, and four for vigor index. Interestingly, four QTL for seed vigor, which were detected at all three sampling times, were located in the same region on chromosome 7. This result implies that this region of chromosome 7 is important for seed vigor of seeds harvested before they reach physiological maturity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Genetic analysis; Immaturity; Maize; Seed vigor,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951771922

The colonies used for this purpose are provided by commercial bumblebee breeders, which by now operate at a professional company level. As a result of this practice commercially bred bumblebee colonies are transported and used over large distances and national borders, introducing subspecies into non-endemic regions. The question whether and to what extends gene flow between such managed greenhouse and wild bumblebee populations exists, so far has not been addressed. Here we used samples from three greenhouses in Poland and the surrounding populations to address this question. Using microsatellite DNA data we found strong genetic introgression from the sampled greenhouse populations into the adjacent populations. Depending on the analysed population, the number of individuals assigned to the greenhouse populations ranged from 0.08 to 0.47. We also found that more distant populations were much less affected by genetic introgression from the greenhouses. © 2010 The Author(s).",Bombus terrestris; Genetic introgression; Invasive species; Social insects,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650981374

Reproductive isolation theories predict a loss of genetic diversity and increases in inbreeding and spatial genetic structure (SGS) in such populations. We analysed eight microsatellite loci to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal patterns, genetic diversity, inbreeding and SGS of the tropical tree Copaifera langsdorffii in a small (4.8 ha), isolated population. All 112 adult trees and 128 seedlings found in the stand were sampled, mapped and genotyped. Seedlings had significantly lower levels of genetic diversity (A=16.5±0.45, mean95% s.e.; H e=0.838±0.006) than did adult trees (A=23.2±0.81; H e=0.893±0.030). Parentage analysis did not indicate any seed immigration (m seeds = 0) and the pollen immigration rate was very low (m pollen = 0.047). The average distance of realized pollen dispersal within the stand was 94 m, with 81% of the pollen travelling 150 m. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency and distance of pollen dispersal (r = -0.79, P=0.01), indicating that short-distance pollinations were more frequent. A significant SGS for both adults (50 m) and seedlings (20 m) was also found, indicating that most of the seeds were dispersed over short distances. The results suggested that the spatial isolation of populations by habitat fragmentation can restrict seed and pollen gene flow, increase SGS and affect the genetic diversity of future generations. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Copaifera langsdorffii; microsatellite loci; pollen dispersal; seed dispersal; spatial genetic structure; tropical trees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650304783

Such a market exists in the pollinating bees case (Cheung in, J Law Econ 16(1): 11-33, 1973), but we show that, if transactions over 'externalities' are facilitated, other externalities, which remain at its borders, are also handled with social norms.

PSI is an intermediate reproductive behaviour, described in some angiosperm species, which indicates that selfincompatibility is a quantitative and plastic trait. The present study was performed to substantiate the occurrence of PSI in almond by studying ten cultivars that are traditionally considered to be self-incompatible (four of which had previously shown fruit set after self-pollination). These cultivars were analysed by microscopic observations of the progression of pollen tubes through the pistil following controlled self-pollination, determinations of fruit set after bagging flower buds, and molecular identification of the parentage of the fruits obtained using consensus PCR-primers for Prunus S-RNase alleles. The results showed that, in nearly all cases, the pollen tubes did not enter the ovary and, from a total of 5,349 bagged flower buds, only 17 fruits were obtained. In all cases, PCR analysis of the plants obtained after germination of these seeds showed a band corresponding to an S-RNase allele not present in the maternal progenitor, clearly indicating that they could only have arisen from cross-pollination.Therefore, the low fruit set values observed in some of the cultivars studied were not due to a breakdown in the self-incompatibility response that confers PSI, but to very low rates of contamination with foreign pollen. These results corroborate the selfincompatibility phenotype of the cultivars studied here, and highlight the importance of ascertaining the identity of the parentage in any progeny obtained after bagging.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956293802

It is an important medicinal plant in the Ayurvedic system. Preliminary studies revealed that there is a high percentage of seed abortion in this plant. Since stigma plays an important role in the successful culmination of sexual reproduction in plants a detailed investigation into the structure, receptivity and enzyme activity of the stigma of Boerhaavia diffusa were carried out. Controlled pollinations carried out at different stages of flower development revealed that the stigma is receptive only between 1-4 h after anthesis. SEM studies indicated that the stigma surface is dry type. The surface of stigma was made up of loosely packed papillae which served as a pad for pollen landing. Style was solid having longitudinal cells. Aniline blue fluorescent test showed that neither the stigma nor the style restricted the pollen tube from reaching the ovule. Four enzymes, namely, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, acid phosphatase and esterase were localized on the stigma surface. Besides, stigma specific peroxidase could also be localized on the stigma surface. Activity of the aforementioned four enzymes in the crude extracts of stigma at different intervals after pollination revealed that peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase were active immediately after pollination while acid phosphatase and esterase were active 4-8 h after pollination. Only 50% of the control pollinated flowers set seeds.

Seeds and pollen are the critical stages for gene flow. Here we investigate spatial genetic structure, gene dispersal and the relative contribution of pollen vs seed in the movement of genes in a stable metapopulation of the white campion Silene latifolia within its native range. This short-lived perennial plant is dioecious, has gravity-dispersed seeds and moth-mediated pollination. Direct measures of pollen dispersal suggested that large populations receive more pollen than small isolated populations and that most gene flow occurs within tens of meters. However, these studies were performed in the newly colonized range (North America) where the specialist pollinator is absent. In the native range (Europe), gene dispersal could fall on a different spatial scale. We genotyped 258 individuals from large and small (15) subpopulations along a 60 km, elongated metapopulation in Europe using six highly variable microsatellite markers, two X-linked and four autosomal. We found substantial genetic differentiation among subpopulations (global F ST 0.11) and a general pattern of isolation by distance over the whole sampled area. Spatial autocorrelation revealed high relatedness among neighboring individuals over hundreds of meters. Estimates of gene dispersal revealed gene flow at the scale of tens of meters (5-30 m), similar to the newly colonized range. Contrary to expectations, estimates of dispersal based on X and autosomal markers showed very similar ranges, suggesting similar levels of pollen and seed dispersal. This may be explained by stochastic events of extensive seed dispersal in this area and limited pollen dispersal. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",gene flow; Isolation by distance; microsatellites; pollen dispersal; seed dispersal; spatial autocorrelation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650308906

Different genotypes of its two parental species B. rapa and B. olaeacea carry resistance to this disease. Furthermore, the European winter canola cultivar Mendel, which was bred through introgression of resistance from its parental species, also carries resistance to P. brassicae pathotypes prevelent in Europe. The objective of this study was to investigate the usefulness of resistance of Mendel for the development of clubroot-resistant canola cultivars for the Canadian prairies. For this, crosses between Mendel and two Canadian spring canola ines were made and pedigree breeding was followed. Plants with spring growth habit and resistant to P. brassicae pathotype 3 were recovered in the F2 generation, apparently due to the involvement of major genes in the control of clubroot sistance and vernalization requirement. However, repeated selection over several generations was needed for the improvement of earliness. Most of these resistant lines also showed resistance to P. brassicae pathotypes 5 and 6, and had oil, protein, glucosinolate and saturated fatty acids acceptable to meet the Canadian canola standard. The test hybrids produced using the resistant F6 lines and a male sterile line of the Male Sterility Lembke (MSL) system showed resistance to all three pathotypes in most cases. Furthermore, conversion of these clubroot resistant lines into cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line of the INRAOgura system and evaluation of the BC2 CMS families for resistance revealed the possibilities of using clubroot resistant CMS lines for the development of clubroot resistant F1 hybrid cultivars. However, despite rigorous selection for resistance performed in different generations, a small number of plants with visible disease symptoms appeared in some of the advanced generation pedigree lines and test hybrids, which is possibly due to the involvement of additional gene(s) in the control of clubroot resistance in these lines. Thus, data presented in this paper demonstrate the possibility of using the clubroot resistance of Mendel for the development of open-pollinated as well as hybrid canola cultivars for the Canadian prairies.",Brassica napus; Breeding; Canola; Clubroot resistance; Mendel; Spring canola; Winter canola,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79958050384

Eucalyptus cladocalyx is a species suitable for areas with low water availability and their flowers provide a reliable source for the production of honey. The aim of this study was to examine the heritability of flowering intensity in 49 open-pollinated families of E. cladocalyx in southern Atacama Desert, Chile, with the view to the selection for prolific flowering, but with minimal impact on precocious flowering. The Bayesian variance component estimation model was assumed using the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Threshold models were fitted to flowering data (bi-character model). Flowering intensity was found to be highly heritable (posterior mean: h2 = 0.48; and credible interval: 0.41-0.56). The posterior mean of the genetic correlation between flowering precocity and intensity was positive (r = 0.45) and according to the credible interval (0.341-0.542), it was significantly different from zero, indicating that selection on breeding values of early flowering at age three, would have significant and positive impact on flowering intensity 5 years later (or in 8-year-old trees). These results are important for the start of a small-scale breeding program for the species in southern Atacama Desert. The genetic variability found in these breeding populations may be used for breeding purposes in regions where arid environmental conditions are limiting to the establishment of eucalypts trees. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Genetic correlation; Gibbs sampling; Heritability; Prolific flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951772784

In this study, possible genetic factors responsible for the appearance of off-types were evaluated using two off-type sweet peppers selected out of 120 F1 hybrids. The general morphology of off-type plants showed a stunted stature, narrow leaf shape, and small round-shaped fruits.We hypothesised that these off-type plants might have arisen by inadvertent self-pollination of maternal parental lines, since most sweet pepper F1 hybrids are known to be produced by handemasculation. Indeed, none of the sweet pepper cultivars analysed in this study contained male-sterile cytoplasm, confirming that cytoplasmic male-sterility was not used during F1 hybrid seed production. If the off-type plants were derived from self-pollination of maternal lines, the genetic make-up of the off-type plants should be different from that of normal F1 hybrids. However, the RAPD and SSR marker amplification profiles of off-type and normal F1 hybrids showed no polymorphism, whereas one RAPD and five polymorphic SSR markers were identified among five other F1 sweet pepper cultivars, indicating that the genetic make-up of the off-type and normal F1 hybrids were almost identical. Furthermore, two SSR markers that showed heterozygosity in both off-type and normal F1 hybrids, segregated in the self-pollinated progenies of both off-type and normal F1 hybrids, indicating that the off-type plants were not maternal inbred lines.

Guidance signals from female cells are being identified; however, how pollen responds to those cues is largely unknown. Here, we show that two predicted cation/proton exchangers (CHX) in Arabidopsis thaliana, CHX21 and CHX23, are essential for pollen tube guidance. Male fertility was unchanged in single chx21 or chx23 mutants. However, fertility was impaired in chx21 chx23 double mutant pollen. Wild-type pistils pollinated with a limited number of single and double mutant pollen producing 62% fewer seeds than those pollinated with chx23 single mutant pollen, indicating that chx21 chx23 pollen is severely compromised. Double mutant pollen grains germinated and grew tubes down the transmitting tract, but the tubes failed to turn toward ovules. Furthermore, chx21 chx23 pollen tubes failed to enter the micropyle of excised ovules. Green fluorescent protein-tagged CHX23 driven by its native promoter was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of pollen tubes. CHX23 mediated K+ transport, as CHX23 expression in Escherichia coli increased K+ uptake and growth in a pH-dependent manner. We propose that by modifying localized cation balance and pH, these transporters could affect steps in signal reception and/or transduction that are critical to shifting the axis of polarity and directing pollen growth toward the ovule. © American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952286380

Cell production during carpel/floral-tube growth, fruit set, and fruit growth, and its regulation by cell cycle genes were investigated in apple (Malus×domestica Borkh.). Cell production was inhibited during late carpel/floral-tube development, resulting in growth arrest before bloom. Fruit set re-activated cell production between 8 d and 11 d after full bloom (DAFB) and triggered fruit growth. The early phase of fruit growth involved rapid cell production followed by exit from cell proliferation at ?24 DAFB. Seventy-one cell cycle genes were identified, and expression of 59 genes was investigated using quantitative RT-PCR. Changes in expression of 19 genes were consistently associated with transitions in cell production during carpel/floral-tube growth, fruit set, and fruit growth. Fourteen genes, including B-type cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and A2-, B1-, and B2-type cyclins, were positively associated with cell production, suggesting that availability of G2/M phase regulators of the cell cycle is limiting for cell proliferation. Enhanced expression of five genes including that of the putative CDK inhibitors, MdKRP4 and MdKRP5, was associated with reduced cell production. Exit from cell proliferation at G0/G1 during fruit growth was facilitated by multiple mechanisms including down-regulation of putative regulators of G1/S and G2/M phase progression and up-regulation of KRP genes. Interestingly, two CDKA genes and several CDK-activating factors were up-regulated during this period, suggesting functions for these genes in mediating exit from cell proliferation at G0/G1. Together, the data indicate that cell cycle genes are important facilitators of cell production during apple fruit development. © 2010 The Author.",Cell division; cell expansion; fruit development; fruit size; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649889057

The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating male meiosis in rice (Oryza sativa) remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a rice pollen semi-sterility1 (pss1) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (~40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (~50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence. Map-based molecular cloning revealed that PSS1 encodes a kinesin-1-like protein. PSS1 is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles. Furthermore, PSS1 expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis. The PSS1-green fluorescent protein fusion is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of rice protoplasts. Substitution of a conserved Arg (Arg-289) to His in the PSS1 motor domain nearly abolishes its microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity. Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the pss1 mutant. Together, our results suggest that PSS1 defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice. © American Society of Plant Biologists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952309935

None of the 21 trees were infected, indicating that ALSV has not spread from the infected trees to the neighboring apple trees since it was first detected in 1984. We analyzed seed embryos and seedlings derived from infected trees and detected ALSV in 10 of 223 seed embryos (4.5%) and 10 of 227 seedlings (4.4%). From these results, we conclude that ALSV is seed-transmitted at a rate of ca. 4.5% in apple. We also analyzed seed embryos and seedlings from uninfected apple trees that were hand-pollinated with pollen from infected trees. We detected ALSV in only 1 of 260 seed embryos and in none of the 227 apple seedlings. This result indicated that the seed transmission rate via infected pollen is only 0-0.38%. In situ hybridization analysis of ALSV-infected apple flower buds showed that ALSV was present inside almost all pollen grains and in all ovary and ovule tissues, including the embryo sac and inner integument. © 2010 The Phytopathological Society of Japan and Springer.",Apple; Apple latent spherical virus; Pollen transmission; Seed transmission,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650679977

A 4-year (from 1999 and 2002) field experiment, with treatments consisting of rotations of monoculture canola and pea to rotations that contained these crops every 2, 3, and 4 years with wheat and flax, was conducted on a Black Chernozem (Udic Boroll) silty clay at Melfort, Saskatchewan, to determine the impact of frequency of broad-leaf crops canola and pea in various crop rotations on accumulation and distribution of nitrate nitrogen (N) and extractable phosphorus (P) in the soil profile after 4 years. Two cultivars of canola, an herbicide-tolerant blacklegresistant variety (hybrid) and a conventional (not herbicide tolerant) open-pollinated, blackleg-susceptible variety (OP), were included. Mean effects of crop rotation or rotation length on soil nitrate N were not significant, though the amount of soil nitrate N in different soil layers tended to be greatest with monocultures and least in the 4-year rotation with flax. Effects of crop phase (i.e., individual crops that make up the rotation) × crop rotation interactions on soil nitrate N were significant for all layers in the soil profile. The amounts of nitrate N in soil after canola, especially hybrid canola, were lowest in most crop rotations, suggesting the importance of canola in minimizing downward movement of nitrate N in the soil profile. Soil extractable P in the 0- to 15-cm layer was least with monocultures and greatest in the 4-year rotation with flax. There was a significant effect of crop phase on soil extractable P, but soil P levels varied with crop phase in different rotations. In conclusion, residual nitrate N in soil can be reduced by extending crop rotations and using high-yielding disease-resistant canola cultivars, most likely by improving crop yields. © 2011 Crown copyright.",Broad-leaf crops; Extractable P; Frequency; Nitrate N; Phase; Rotation; Seed yield; Sequence; Soil nutrients,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053468963

In comparison, chromoplasts have evolved the capacity to synthesize and store brightly coloured carotenoid pigments to give flowers and fruits the power to attract pollinators and fruit dispersers. The best performing accumulator of xanthophylls in tomato is the petal chromoplast in contrast to the fruit chromoplast which only seems able to store carotenes. We have generated genetically engineered tomato lines carrying the tomato CrtR-b2 transgene with the aim of forcing the fruit to accumulate beta-xanthophylls. Both chloroplast and chromoplast-containing tissues of hemizygous transgenic plants were found to contain elevated xanthophyll contents as a direct consequence of the increased number of CrtR-b2 transcripts. Hemizygous transgenic leaves contained fourfold more violaxanthin than control leaves. Developing fruits were yellow instead of green since they lacked chlorophyll a, and their violaxanthin and neoxanthin contents were seven- and threefold higher, respectively, than those of the control. Ripe fruits of hemizygous transgenic plants contained free violaxanthin and significant amounts of esterified xanthophylls. Esterified xanthophylls were present also in ripe fruits of control and homozygous plants. However, in transgenic homozygous plants, we observed a reduction in transcript content in most tissues, particularly in petals, due to a post-transcriptional gene silencing process. These findings demonstrate that tomato fruit chromoplasts can accumulate xanthophylls with the same sequestration mechanism (esterification) as that exploited by chromoplasts of the tomato petal and pepper fruit. This study on transgenic plants overexpressing an important carotenoid gene (CrtR-b2) provides an interesting model for future investigations on perturbations in beta-carotene-derived xanthophyll synthesis which in turn may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling carotenoid metabolism in tomato. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Chlorophylls; CrtR-b2; Esterification; Gene silencing; Transcriptional regulation; Xanthophylls,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651395091

While changes in the levels of sugars and abscisic acid (ABA) are thought to play a role in this stress response, the mechanistic basis and genes involved are not known. A candidate gene approach was used with association mapping to identify loci involved in accumulation of carbohydrates and ABA metabolites during stress. A panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes from these metabolic pathways and in genes for reproductive development and stress response was used to genotype 350 tropical and subtropical maize inbred lines that were well watered or water stressed at flowering. Pre-pollination ears, silks, and leaves were analysed for sugars, starch, proline, ABA, ABA-glucose ester, and phaseic acid. ABA and sugar levels in silks and ears were negatively correlated with their growth. Association mapping with 1229 SNPs in 540 candidate genes identified an SNP in the maize homologue of the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene, PISTILLATA, which was significantly associated with phaseic acid in ears of well-watered plants, and an SNP in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, a key regulator of carbon flux into respiration, that was associated with silk sugar concentration. An SNP in an aldehyde oxidase gene was significantly associated with ABA levels in silks of water-stressed plants. Given the short range over which decay of linkage disequilibrium occurs in maize, the results indicate that allelic variation in these genes affects ABA and carbohydrate metabolism in floral tissues during drought. © 2010 The Author(s).",abscisic acid; ASI; association mapping; drought; flower set; kernel set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650654051

Nelson (Reg. No. CV-257, PI 658137) Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) was developed by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station-now Texas AgriLife Research-as a forage-type annual ryegrass. Plant breeding of Nelson was conducted at what is now the Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Overton, Texas. Nelson is a tetraploid where 2n = 4x = 28 chromosomes. Nelson is an open-pollinated three-way cross from ryegrass breeding lines TXR2000-T2, TXR2002-T17, and the cultivar 'Jumbo'. Both TX breeding lines were from 'TAM 90' germplasm that had its chromosome numbers doubled from 14 to 28. Adjacent rows, which were replicated, were grown in an isolation block and allowed to cross-pollinate and produce seed. Subsequent generations were grown and selected for high forage-yield potential and crown rust (caused by Puccinia coronate Corda) resistance at Beaumont, Texas. Seed from these populations was increased in Oregon and was later tested for forage yield across the southern USA. Nelson has high forage-yield potential, good crown rust resistance, and good cold tolerance for the southeastern USA. Nelson is improved for forage yield potential compared with most commercial cultivars in East Texas. The predominant use is projected to be in overseeding warm-season pastures for winter production of forage for grazing animals. Seed production of Nelson will be in Oregon.

'Katy', a natural self-compatible cultivar belonging to the European ecotype group, was used as a useful material for breeding new cultivars with high frequency of self-compatibility by hybridizing with Chinese native cultivars. In this work, the pollen-S genes (S-haplotype-specific F-box gene, or SFB gene) of 'Katy' were first identified as SFB1 and SFB8, and the S-genotype was determined as S1S8. Genetic analysis of 'Katy' progenies under controlled pollination revealed that the stylar S1-RNase and S8-RNase have a normal function in rejecting wild-type pollen with the same S-haplotype, while the pollen grains carrying either the SFB1 or the SFB8 gene are both able to overcome the incompatibility barrier. However, the observed segregation ratios of the S-genotype did not fit the expected ratios under the assumption that the pollen-part mutations are linked to the S-locus. Moreover, alterations in the SFB1 and SFB8 genes and pollen-S duplications were not detected. These results indicated that the breakdown of SI in 'Katy' occurred in pollen, and other factors not linked to the S-locus, which caused a loss of pollen S-activity. These findings support a hypothesis that modifying factors other than the S-locus are required for GSI in apricot. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Apricot (Prunus armeniaca); Mutation; S-RNase; Self-compatibility (SC); SFB,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951772915

Molecular data so far are of limited value for understanding Phyllanthus because of the sheer size of the genus. They can, however, help sort-out cryptic species and provide information on the origin of suspected introduced species. One of the seemingly most widespread species is P. reticulatus, which has been recorded from Asia, Australia, Africa, and Jamaica. The name is based on a mixed collection from tropical Asia now in the Lamarck herbarium, and we lectotypify it here. We use nuclear ITS sequences to test the broad treatment of P. reticulatus in recent floras, identify records of ""P. reticulatus"" from Africa, and investigate the origin of P. reticulatus on Jamaica. A maximum likelihood tree for accessions of P. reticulatus from throughout its supposed range (plus relevant outgroups) shows that the Jamaican plants represent the Asian species, that the African plants called P. reticulatus belong to a separate clade for which P. polyspermus is the oldest available name, and that the sensu lato treatment of P. reticulatus in recent floras is unjustified. Treating the Asian entities P. reticulatus and P. microcarpus as separate species appears justified, and identical ITS sequences in Asian and Jamaican P. reticulatus indicate a recent introduction. The first ""island botanists,"" J. Macfadyen and N. Wilson, introduced many plants from India in the 1800s, and theirs are the oldest Jamaican collections of P. reticulatus. Since the species was introduced to Jamaica without its obligate Epicephala moth pollinators, it does not set fruit, persisting instead by vegetative growth. © Copyright 2011 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.",Anthropogenic introduction; ITS; Jamaica; Lectotypification; Phyllanthaceae; Phyllanthus phylogenetics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956155965

It was once a common bumble bee west of the Cascades but in the late 1990s it experienced a dramatic decline along coastal regions. The cause was speculated to be due to the introduction of pathogens from captive-bred bumble bees used for pollination of greenhouse crops. In extensive surveys conducted in western and southern Oregon, 10 individuals have been recorded since 2000. In this note, we report the collection of 49 individual B. occidentalis over two years in the Zumwalt Prairie Preserve of northeastern Oregon. This finding shows that B. occidentalis persists in northeastern regions of the Pacific Northwest, either because of geographic isolation from or potential resistance to the pathogens that decimated populations in the western part of the region. Further research is needed to determine its occurrence in other regions of its historical range to assess the extent of its decline.

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), is an important pollinator for the commercial production of alfalfa seed. Poor nest establishment is, however, an ongoing problem for bee managers. Megachile rotundata are solitary yet gregarious bees that nest in pre-existing cavities and are attracted to previously used nests. Nest cells contain several components that may serve as cues for nesting females. In the current study, we sought to: 1. determine if there is a preference for cells that previously held male or female conspecific bees; 2. verify attraction to conspecific whole nest cells; and 3. determine which individual nest components of a cell are attractive to nesting females. In a series of cage and open field experiments, M. rotundata females were allowed to initiate nests in blocks containing whole cells or individual cell components from old nests. Statistical analyses of results verified the attraction to conspecific nest cells, with no preference for male or female cells. Females were equally attracted to whole cells from conspecifics and from another megachilid bee, Osmia lignaria. In field cages, females were equally attracted to all cell components, but preferred some cell components over others in open field experiments.

Two mega-environments were formed; the first being the Chillán environment while the second included the remaining environments. Six of the evaluated cultivars, all hybrids except 'Goya', were superior. The mean vs. stability analysis indicated that the Monalisa hybrid had the highest yield and was the most stable cultivar across all environments.

Excessive use of pesticides is increasingly denounced by consumers and the rules controlling their use (particularly with respect to toxic residues) are increasingly restricting. The use of resistant cultivars reduces production costs and increases workers safety. Prospecting through Romanian apricot collections has leaded us to the discovery of several sources of resistance to Sharka. The different Romanian hybrids or local apricot varieties was chosen among the different sources of resistance as it could also be used to develop a weeping variety in the some breeding program. To start with, the resistance mode of heritability was studied by creating F1 generations from the resistant parent crossed with a sensitive one, Mari de Cenad The resistance character is dominant and monogenic (symbols Rm1/m1). Breeding was continued by creating the F2 generations using by resistance parent ""Stark Early Orange"" and ""NJA 2"" and after that to improve fruit quality by use backcrosses with extra quality varieties like Mamaia, Ovidiu, Tudor etc. The paper describes the breeding work involved in this program. The resistance/susceptibility level of 213 descendants from three different crosses between the Romanian apricot cultivar 'Mari de Cenad' (susceptible to Plum pox virus, sharka), and the North American cultivar 'Stark Early Orange', and ""NJA 2"" (resistant) was evaluated during four cycles of study under controlled greenhouse conditions.

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for grain-filling rate were detected using conditional and unconditional QTL analysis of genetic linkage maps comprising 217 SSR markers. The results showed that the grain-filling rate increased between 15 and 35 days after pollination, then decreased at the last two sampling times. Hybrids with high grain-filling rates determined the grain yield in those areas with a short growth season for maize. A total of 23 unconditional QTL for grain-filling rate were detected using the 100-kernel weight as the input data at different sampling stages. They were distributed on 10 chromosomes (except chromosome 9), and some QTL were detected at different sampling stages. In addition, nine conditional QTL were identified using the average increase in 100-kernel weight of per day between two sampling times, and six conditional QTL were detected simultaneously using the unconditional QTL mapping strategy. The QTL mapping results demonstrated that the grain-filling rate is controlled by a complex genetic mechanism, and the QTL detected at different sampling stages might be important contributors to grain yield in maize. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Genetic basis; Grain-filling rate; Maize; QTL mapping,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650753751

(Iridaceae: Iridoideae), a genus of cormous geophytes, we recognize 18 species, eight more than were included in the 1979 account of the genus by M.P. de Vos. One of these, F. ovata, based on Moraea ovala Thunb. (1800), was only discovered to be a species of Ferraria in 2001, and three more are the result of our different view of De Vos's taxonomy. In tropical Africa, F. glutinosa is recircumscribed to include only mid- to late summer-flowering plants, usually with a single basal leaf and with purple to brown flowers often marked with yellow. A second summer-flowering species, F. candelabrum, includes taller plants with several basal leaves. Spring and early summer-flowering plants lacking foliage leaves and with yellow flowers from central Africa are referred to F. spithamea or F. welwilschii respectively. The remaining species are restricted to western southern Africa, an area of winter rainfall and summer drought. We recognize three new species: F. flava and F. ornata from the sandveld of coastal Namaqualand, and F. parva, which has among the smallest flowers in the genus and is restricted to the Western Cape coastal plain between Ganzekraal and Langrietvlei near Hopefield. Ferraria ornata blooms in May and June in response to the first rains of the season. Among the remaining species, F. uncinata subsp. macrochlamys is now F. macrochlamys and is treated as comprising three subspecies: subsp. macrochlamys from central and northern Namaqualand has leaves with thickened, crisped margins; subsp. kamiesbergensis from the southern Kamiesberg has leaves with unthickened margins and blades curved in one direction; and subsp. serpentina from gravels and sands of coastal Namaqualand has serpentine leaves, also with unthickened margins. Among the remaining species, F. divaricata subsp. arenosa is now treated as a synonym of F divaricata. Because of our re-interpretation of the type of F. divaricata, plants which were called F. divaricata subsp. divaricata and subsp. australis are now treated as synonyms under the name F. variabilis. Flowers of Ferraria are unique in Iridaceae in having tepal limbs with crisped margins and a style that divides into flattened branches, each deeply forked with finely fringed adaxial margins. Despite relative floral uniformity, the genus displays a surprising range of discrete pollination systems for so small a genus. Pollinators include Diptera in the families Muscidae, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae (F. crispa group); anthophorine and honey bees (F. ferrariola); eumenid wasps (F divaricata, F. macrochamys, F. variabilis); and Coleoptera in the families Meloidae and Melyridae (F. uncinata). Preliminary phylogenetic analysis using plastid DNA regions shows F. glutinosa to be sister to an unresolved cluster of southern African species and confirms as plesiomorphic the open branching habit, many-flowered inflorescences and exserted globose capsules that characterize F glutinosa and its immediate allies in subgen.

In case of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), wheat x maize cross system is the most successful system due to its higher efficiency, more haploid embryo production and low genetic specificity. The haploid embryo production is affected by many factors i.e. light, temperature, relative humidity and tiller culture media. A study was carried out comprising 25 genotypes of bread wheat for haploid embryo production using 100 mgL-1 2,4-D, 40gL-1 Sucrose and 8mlL-1 Sulphurous acid. Haploid embryo production was observed at various levels of environmental factors i.e. maize pollen collection temperature, time of pollination after tiller emasculation, light intensity and relative humidity during haploid seed formation. Maximum haploid embryo formation recorded was 9.52%. Best temperature observed for pollination was 21-26°C, optimum time duration for pollination was 24 hours after emasculation, light intensity was 10,000 Lux and relative humidity was 60-65% at 20-22°C.",Doubled haploid; In vitro; Wheat; Wheat x maize cross,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864041487

The excellent quality of their kernels makes them highly appreciated and demanded worldwide. However, due to their self-incompatibility, they should be grown along with cross-compatible cultivars, whose lower kernel quality often reduces the economic benefits of the plantation. In addition, although they are cross-compatible, are not good candidates to share the orchard since 'Desmayo Largueta' usually flowers earlier than 'Marcona'. Therefore, to optimize orchard yield, genotypes with overlapping flowering times, cross-compatible with these cultivars and of similar fruit and ripening characteristics are desirable. In order to find suitable pollinators of these cultivars, five 'Marcona' and four 'Desmayo Largueta'-type selections from ""Instituto Técnico Agronómico Provincial (ITAP) de Albacete"" (Spain) were characterized for flowering time and for self and cross-incompatibility. The results obtained showed that the nine ITAP selections were self-incompatible, and that three and one were promising candidates as pollinators of 'Marcona' and 'Desmayo Largueta', respectively. The S-haplotypes of two ITAP selections were characterized by cloning and sequencing their pistil S (S-RNase) and pollen S (SFB) genes. The results also showed that Sf RNase does not have a mutated histidine in C2 region, and detected differences with other previously published sequences for S23RNase and SFB23 allele. Moreover, the sequence for almond SFB27 allele is reported here for the first time. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cross-compatibility; Flowering time; Prunus dulcis; S-haplotype characterization; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649759926

Here we studied the relevance of floral scent and visual display of a night blooming, putatively hawkmoth-pollinated plant Oenothera acaulis (Onagraceae) in the attraction of non-native cockroaches Blatta orientalis (Blattodea: Blattidae), which function as facultative floral larcenists in coastal habitats of central Chile. We experimentally decoupled visual (corolla) and olfactory (fragrance) stimuli by presenting paper corollas and green mesh bags, with or without a freshly-picked natural flower inside. We then contrasted the behavioral responses of roaches in these treatments with those to the natural combination of traits in actual flowers and their respective control treatments, measuring the roaches' frequency of first visits, mean and total residence time spent in each treatment. The roaches primarily used olfactory cues when approaching O. acaulis flowers at two biologically relevant spatial scales. In addition, the presence of conspecific roaches had a strong influence on recruitment to the experimental arena, increasing the statistical differences among treatments. Our results suggest a primacy of floral fragrance over visual stimuli in the foraging responses of B. orientalis. Olfactory cues were necessary and sufficient to attract the roaches, and the visual cues presented in our manipulations only marginally increased their attraction within a 20 cm diameter of the stimulus. The full spectrum of floral visitation behavior was not elicited by the artificial flowers, suggesting the need for additional tactile or contact chemosensory stimuli not provided by paper. Although the nitrogenous scent compounds that we found in O. acaulis flowers are almost exclusively found in hawkmoth-pollinated flowers, the attractiveness of these compounds to a non-native, facultative flower-visiting insect indicates that they do not function as pollinator-specific signals for hawkmoth attraction. © 2011 Current Zoology.",Corolla visual display; Flower fragrance; Larcenists; Night-blooming plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953287037

Recent pollination studies suggest that crop intensification has resulted in a reduction of fruit productivity in different locations. Loquat exhibits gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) and, consequently, fruit set strongly depends on cross-pollination between intercompatible cultivars. S-genotyping and incompatibility group assignment is therefore essential for adequate loquat orchard design. This study reports the molecular characterization of the S-RNase allele composition of 31 loquat cultivars grown in Spain. PCR with primers developed from loquat S-RNase sequences was used in combination with high-performance capillary polyacrilamide electrophoresis for the fine-evaluation of length polymorphisms at the S-RNase gene. This approach allowed to uncover a new S-RNase allele (S5), whose sequence is reported and to characterize the first six S-RNase-based incompatibility groups (I-VI) in loquat, resulting from the combination of five S-alleles (S1-S5). The large number of cultivars that could be assigned to only six groups suggests a narrow genetic base for this crop in Spain and stresses the need for careful determination of the S-genotype of cultivars in an attempt to overcome production problems associated with inadequate pollination. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Eriobotrya japonica; Gametophytic self-incompatibility; Loquat; S-genotype; S-RNase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027928394

We monitored pollen and seed cone production for seven Pinus ponderosa populations (607 trees) separated by up to 28 km and 1,350 m in elevation in Boulder County, Colorado, USA for periods of 4-31 years for a mean per site of 8. 7 years for pollen and 12. 1 for seed cone production. We also analyzed climate data and a published dataset on 21 years of seed production for an eighth population (Manitou) 100 km away. Individual trees showed high inter-annual variation in reproduction. Synchrony was high within populations, but quickly became asynchronous among populations with a combination of increasing distance and elevational difference. Inter-annual variation in temperature and precipitation had differing influences on seed production for Boulder County and Manitou. We speculate that geographically variable effects of climate on reproduction arise from environmental heterogeneity and population genetic differentiation, which in turn result in localized synchrony. Although individual pines produce pollen and seed, only one-third of the covariation within trees was shared. As compared to seed cones, pollen had lower inter-annual variation at the level of the individual tree and was more synchronous. However, pollen and seed production were similar with respect to inter-annual variation at the population level, spatial scales of synchrony and associations with climate. Our results show that strong masting can occur at a localized scale, and that reproductive patterns can differ between pollen and seed cone production in a hermaphroditic plant. © 2010 The Author(s).",Climate forcing; Masting; Resource pulse; Spatial autocorrelation; Wind pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951550928

Tropaeolum majus presents several flowers for each individual and, during the visits, A. variegatus walked throughout the interior of the flower, among the stamens and contacting the ventral region of its body, and while passing through the stigma it lodged the pollen.

The processes promoting species coexistence may be the key to the recovery and maintenance of diversity in these forests. One such process is the Janzen-Connell mechanism, where specialized natural enemies such as seed predators maintain diversity by inhibiting regeneration near conspecifics. In Neotropical forests, anthropogenic disturbance can disrupt the Janzen-Connell mechanism, but similar data are unavailable for South East Asia. We investigated the effects of conspecific density (two spatial scales) and distance from fruiting trees on seed and seedling survival of the canopy tree Parashorea malaanonan in unlogged and logged forests in Sabah, Malaysia. The production of mature seeds was higher in unlogged forest, perhaps because high adult densities facilitate pollination or satiate pre-dispersal predators. In both forest types, post-dispersal survival was reduced by small-scale (1 m2) conspecific density, but not by proximity to the nearest fruiting tree. Large-scale conspecific density (seeds per fruiting tree) reduced predation, probably by satiating predators. Higher seed production in unlogged forest, in combination with slightly higher survival, meant that recruitment was almost entirely limited to unlogged forest. Thus, while logging might not affect the Janzen-Connell mechanism at this site, it may influence the recruitment of particular species. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Anthropogenic disturbance; Janzen-connell hypothesis; Logging; Plant diversity; Predator satiation; Secondary forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054699506

Their energy demand is covered by assimilates which are synthesized in source leaves and transported via the vasculature. Assimilates are unloaded either symplastically through plasmodesmata or apoplastically by specific transport proteins. Here we studied the pathway of phloem unloading and post-phloem transport in developing gynoecia. Using phloem-mobile fluorescent tracers, we show that phloem unloading into cells of ovule primordia followed a symplastic pathway. Subsequently, the same tracers could not move out of phloem cells into mature ovules anymore. A further change in the mode of phloem unloading occurred after anthesis. In open flowers as well as in outgrowing siliques, the phloem was again unloaded via the symplast. This observed onset of symplastic phloem unloading was accompanied by a change in frequency of MP17-GFP-labeled plasmodesmata. We could also show that the change in cell-cell connectivity was independent of fertilization and increasing sink demand. The presented results indicate that symplastic connectivity is highly regulated and varies not only between different sink tissues but also between different developmental stages. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Arabidopsis thaliana; Green fluorescent protein; Ovules; Phloem unloading; Plasmodesmata; Sieve element,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751647455

The different DNA content in P. aurantiaca and P. officinarum demonstrated the actual 2n + n origin, both spontaneous from the field and through experimental crosses, of their hexaploid hybrids. The octoploid 2n + n progeny were recovered from an experimental cross of P. rubra and P. officinarum. The reproductive pathways operating in two maternal facultatively apomictic species and in the hybrids were quantified using a flow cytometric analysis of seeds obtained from either open-pollinated or emasculated plants. Whereas both maternal species displayed a high penetrance of apomixis, the level of apomixis among the majority of 2n + n hybrids was much lower and variable. Some of the hexaploid hybrids had a reduced seed set. Compared to the respective maternal parents, the decrease in apomixis due to haploid parthenogenesis and/or n + n mating was evident in almost all unreduced hybrids, irrespective of their field/experimental origin and ploidy. Hence, the reproductive behaviour in the apomictic maternal parent was profoundly different from that of the 2n + n hybrids with a sexual parent in spite of the preservation of the complete maternal genome in the hybrids. The regulatory interactions in hybrid genomes, such as effects of modifiers, heterochrony, and epigenetic control, may be consistent with the different expressivity of apomixis observed under different genetic backgrounds. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Apospory; Facultative apomixis; Inheritance of apomixis; Residual sexuality; Unreduced hybrids,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951772117

To obtain a suitable comparison between the daily variation of airborne pollen concentrations and flowering, it is necessary for the level of accuracy of both sets of data to be as similar as possible. To analyse the correlation between locally observed flowering data and pollen counts in pollen traps in order to set pollen information forecasts, pollen was sampled using a Burkard volumetric pollen trap working continuously from May 1993. For the phenological study we selected the main pollen sources of the six pollen types most abundant in our area: Cupressaceae, Platanus, Quercus, Plantago, Olea, and Poaceae with a total of 35 species. We selected seven sites to register flowering or pollination, two with semi-natural vegetation, the rest being urban sites. The sites were visited weekly from March to June in 2007, and from January to June in 2008 and 2009. Pollen shedding was checked at each visit, and recorded as the percentage of flowers or microsporangia in that state. There was an association between flowering phenology and airborne pollen records for some of the pollen types (Platanus, Quercus, Olea and Plantago). Nevertheless, for the other types (Cupressaceae and Poaceae) the flowering and airborne pollen peaks did not coincide, with up to 1 week difference in phase. Some arguments are put forward in explanation of this phenomenon. Phenological studies have shown that airborne pollen results from both local and distant sources, although the pollen peaks usually appear when local sources are shedding the greatest amounts of pollen. Resuspension phenomena are probably more important than long-distance transport in explaining the presence of airborne pollen outside the flowering period. This information could be used to improve pollen forecasts. © 2010 ISB.",Aerobiology; Allergy; Forecasting; Phenology; Pollen; Pollen trap,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650686975

A. Camus grows in dense monocultures beneath the canopy of woodlands in eastern North America and along sunny forest edges. This annual matures seeds in chasmogamous (CH) spikelets on terminal racemes and cleistogamous (CL) spikelets on axillary racemes. The objectives were to determine whether density-dependent reductions in growth and reproduction occur, what patterns they show across densities in a sunny vs. shady environment, and whether the intensity of intraspecific competition depends on light environment. Seedlings of M. vimineum were grown at densities corresponding to 105, 526, 947, and 1368 individuals m-2 in 11 cm diameter pots in a greenhouse exposed to full sun or under deep shade (5.8% of full sun). Mature, partially senesced target plants were harvested prior to seed drop. Shoot dry mass, CH and CL spikelet, and seed production, were significantly reduced under shade and at all densities relative to the control (no competition). However, in shade there were no density-dependent effects on reproduction via CL or CH. There was also no density-dependent mortality. Relative competition intensity, based on the density-dependent reduction in shoot mass of target plants increased with increasing mass of competitors and was greatest in the sunny environment. Reproductive mass (i.e., dry mass of CH or CL spikelets and seeds per target plant) was positively correlated with shoot mass across density treatments, suggesting that density-dependent effects on reproduction in competing monocultures were indirectly due to decreased shoot mass at higher densities. Density-yield curves were highest in the sunny environment where they quickly reached saturation, revealing that a solitary individual can produce the same biomass as a group of competing individuals at higher densities. The success of this invasive species in woodlands may be due to high tolerance to a range of intraspecific densities and to an ability to set seed under shady conditions even when densities are high.© 2011 Torrey Botanical Club.",allometry; annual grass; chasmogamy; cleistogamy; density; intraspecific competition; invasive species; Microstegium vimineum; Poaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955427802

To better understand this physiopathy, we evaluated fruit size and the relative amount of 'small' (<0.4 mm) and 'big' achenes (>0.6 mm) in misshapen (MF) and well-formed (WF) fruits from 'Camarosa', 'Ventana' and 'Medina' strawberry cultivars growing in the field. In 'Camarosa', size-dependent achenes functionality was assessed by analysing achenes germinability and differences in time to ripening between MF and WF. We found that the occurrence of fruit deformation was not only strongly dependent on the cultivar (i.e. genetic factor) but also was promoted by low temperatures (i.e. environmental factor). Regardless of the cultivar, MF showed higher percentage of 'small' non-functional achenes than WF, indicating a failure in achene development, which could be related to the functional integrity of reproductive structures. To test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment by pollinating strawberry flowers with pollen developed under low and mild temperatures. Low temperatures reduced pollen viability, and flowers pollinated with low quality pollen led to a higher amount of MF. However, fruit deformation was not completely explained by differences in pollen quality, neither by differences in pistil maturity and receptivity nor ovule viability, suggesting that non-functional achenes might result from a disruption in postfertilisation processes such as embryo abortion as a consequence of low temperatures. © 2010 Association of Applied Biologists.",'Camarosa'; 'Medina'; 'Ventana'; Auxins; berries; fruit ripening; malformation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650225629

Mallard is comparable with 'Midnight' (standard) in many turf characteristics, including turf quality and disease resistance. Mallard is significantly better in drought resistance compared with Unique (parent). The combination of these traits makes Mallard a unique, widely adapted, functional cultivar that should perform well in home lawns, golf courses, and municipalities in the Northeast, transition, North Central, and Upper West, and Mountain regions. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83055161486

The enzymatic activity of the acid invertase, neutral invertase and sucrose synthase (SuSy) and the levels of total soluble sugars (TSS), reducing sugars (RS) and sucrose were evaluated separately in each part of the fruit and seed-pericarp, seed coat, embryo and endosperm-on different days after the pollination (DAP). Based on the results obtained in this study, it is possible to conclude that in the beginning of the development of the rubber tree seeds, until 95 DAP, the endosperm presents high concentration of RS and low concentration of sucrose. After this period, the endosperm of the seed initiates starch accumulation and the concentration of RS decreases followed by the increase in the concentration of sucrose, presenting, after 120 DAP, an inversion of concentration of these two sugars. In the embryo, the levels of TSS, RS and sucrose show significant increase with the progress of the seed development. In the endosperm, the transition of the division phase and cell expansion for the storage of reserve material seem to occur around 120 DAP and is to be controlled mainly by the enzymes acid invertase and SuSy, while in the embryo, such transition seems to occur around 135 DAP and is to be controlled mainly by the enzymes acid and neutral invertases. © 2010 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.",Invertases; Reducing sugars; Sucrose; Sucrose synthase,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651256934

We investigated the reproductive biology of Neem, including phenology, floral biology, pollination ecology and the breeding system, in three natural populations in northern India. Phenological observations established that trees within a population flowered synchronously, but populations varied in the time of onset of flowering; a few trees flowered twice a year. An inflorescence bears ~91 bisexual, white and sweet-scented flowers. The stigma consists of a non-receptive apical region and a subjacent rim of receptive surface; papillae on the two regions differ in their morphology and function. The occurrence of natural pollination both by wind and insects indicates ambophily. Insect pollinators were predominantly represented by Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera; Apis spp. were the most effective pollinators. Although the occurrence of incomplete dichogamy and a pollen: ovule ratio of ~627 indicates the possibility of autogamy, supplemental pollinations clearly established that the trees were 100% self-incompatible and incompatibility is regulated at the gametophytic level. Natural fruit set was low (~5%) and hand cross-pollinations increased the fruit set to ~19%. Our study demonstrated that natural fruit set in Neem is possibly limited by insufficient amounts of xenogamous pollination and resources. © 2010 The Authors.

By connecting species traits with phylogeny, traits with environment, and environment with geography, this comprehensive approach partitions the ecological and evolutionary processes that influence community assembly. Our analysis extends RLQ ordination, which connects site attributes in matrix R (here environmental variables and spatial positions) with species attributes in matrix Q (here biological traits and phylogenetic positions), through the composition of sites in terms of species presences or abundances (matrix L). This methodology, which explores and identifies environmental filters that organize communities, was developed to answer four questions: which combinations of trait states are filtered by the environment, which lineages are affected by these filters, which environmental variables contribute to the assemblage of local communities and where do these filters act? At La Mafragh in north-eastern Algeria, our approach shows that plant species traits were distributed according to environmental filters associated with a salinity gradient. Traits associated with the salinity gradient were convergent among Juncaceae, Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae. The observed phylogenetic and trait patterns were related to how species survived the xeric season. Juncaceae and Cyperaceae, being perennials and anemogamous, tolerate the xeric hot season by restricting their range to the humid centre of the study area (where conditions are close to a subtropical climate). Several Amaranthaceae species co-occur with the Juncaceae and Cyperaceae in two areas with the highest salinity. Most dicots were observed at higher elevations (up to 7 m a.s.l.), had hairy structures that can retain water and reflect solar radiation and were mostly annual or biennial, completing their life cycle before the onset of the xeric season. Synthesis. Our methodology describes environmental filters in terms of identified combinations of traits and environmental factors. It allows spatial and phylogenetic signals to be determined by identifying convergent and conserved patterns in the evolution of traits and spatial scales that structured the environment. Our statistical framework is generic and can be readily extended to a wide range of exciting issues, such as host-parasite, plant-pollinator and predator-prey interactions. © 2010 The Authors.

Taking into account the climatic changes and current requirements at European level, the improvement of the drought resistance for sunflower hybrids is one of the main objectives in the sunflower breeding program. In order to improve drought resistance of sunflower in the context of the global warming and to accelerate this improvement, introgression of resistance genes from wild species (Helianthus argophyllus) was attempted, using embryo rescue techniques, combined with classical procedures to improve crossing, self-pollination and backcrossing (BC). Four cultivated sunflower lines (LC 1039B; LC1099C; LC 1010B; LC 1066C) presented a high compatibility with the wild species when Helianthus annuus was used as female parent and Helianthus argophyllus as male parent. In crosses between Helianthus argophyllus and Helianthus annuus, the absence of compatibility was registered for: H. argophyllus x LC1050B; H. argophyllus x LC1093B; and H. argophyllus x LC0305C. Generally the hybridization compatibility degree expressed as achenes/head was not correlated with the response to embryo culture. The results represent an opportunity for the acceleration of sunflower breeding for drought resistance and for increasing biodiversity in the global warming conditions. © 2011 University of Bucharest.",Embryo rescue; Immature embryos; Interspecific crossing; Sunflower,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952298177

Among the endosperm-preferred TFs 13% were represented by members of the zinc-finger family, 17% by members of the bZIP family and 11% by members of the NAC family. Among the NAC family TFs, we identified APN-1, whose expression was detected 5 days after pollination (DAP) and peaked at 20 DAP. Analysis of the promoter sequence of gene encoding APN-1 revealed the presence of cis-elements related to endosperm-specificity, abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) signalling. Transient expression analysis of a construct containing the ?-glucuronidase gene driven by the Apn-1 gene promoter showed that expression was restricted to the aleurone cell layer.

However, a low seed set rate significantly hindered the development of polyploid rice breeding. Our results show that the seed set rate in polyploid meiosis stability (PMeS) line HN2026-4X was above 80%, but less than 40% in the other two tetraploid lines (4X indicates a tetraploid line and 2X indicates a diploid line). Furthermore, the seed set rate of Balilla-4X×HN2026-4X was also higher (67.18%) compared with that of Balilla-4X×NJ11-4X (37.26%), suggesting that the PMeS trait was transmitted to the next generation. The significantly higher seed set rate was attributed to the high pollen fertility and viability, as well as the normal meiosis of the HN2026-4X line as a male parent and also to successful embryogenesis. Investigations into embryo microstructure suggested that the embryo development pattern in Balilla-4X×HN2026-4X appeared normal at all stages, but many changes were discovered in Balilla-4X×NJ11-4X. The embryos were mainly defective at the four following stages:1 d after pollination (DAP), 2-3 DAP, 4-5 DAP, and 10-15 DAP. The pattern of embryo developmental failure was similar in the two hybrids, but the abortive frequency in Balilla-4X×HN2026-4X was significantly lower than that of Balilla-4X×NJ11-4X at the respective stages. Additionally, aberrant fertilization, poor endosperm development, and abnormal embryo polarization also contributed to the low seed set in the hybrid of Balilla- 4X×NJ11-4X.

Male sterile plants are also suggested to be used as a biological safety method to prevent the spread of transgenes, a risk that is high in the case of rapeseed due to the mode of pollination, out-crossing by wind or insects, and the presence of related, cross-pollinating species in the surrounding ecosystem in Europe. Different natural occurring male sterilities and alloplasmic forms have been tried to be used in rapeseed with more or less success. Due to the difficulties and limitations with these systems, we present a biotechnological alternative: a metabolically engineered male sterility caused by interference with anther-specific cell wall-bound invertase. This is an essential enzyme for carbohydrate supply of the symplastically isolated pollen. The activity of this enzyme is reduced either by antisense interference or by expressing an invertase inhibitor under control of the anther-specific promoter of the invertase with the consequence of a strong decrease of pollen germination ability. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651061446

The only available estimates of S. capitata and S. guianensis outcrossing rates were based on morphological markers, and the genus is considered as being mainly self-pollinated. Here we describe an estimation of the outcrossing rate in S. capitata and S. guianensis using microsatellite markers. The outcrossing rates were estimated in S. capitata and S. guianensis open-pollinated populations of 20 progenies consisting of ten individuals each. The multi locus outcrossing rate for S. capitata was estimated using 10 polymorphic loci, whereas five microsatellites were used for S. guianensis. The multi locus outcrossing rates for S. capitata and S. guianensis were 31 and 26%, respectively, suggesting a mixed mating system with predominance of autogamy. Comparison of single locus and multi locus estimates of outcrossing rates indicated that little inbreeding other than selfing occurred. The estimated Wright's fixation index of the parental generation was lower than expected based on the multi locus outcrossing rate, possibly resulting from the use of some heterozygous breeding genotypes for the study. The data on the outcrossing rate described here are potentially useful for breeding programs and for maintenance of germplasm collections of these Stylosanthes species. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Autogamy; Microsatellite markers; Mixed mating system; Plant breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951774416

We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Coevolution; Complementarity; Convergence; Ecological networks; Evolutionary cascades; Generalists; Mutualisms; Pollination; Seed dispersal; Small-world networks,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931749097

This study evaluates yeast species richness at both the plant community and plant species levels in a montane forest area in southern Spain, and also explores possible correlations between the incidence of different yeast species in nectar and their reported tolerance to high sugar concentrations, and between yeast diversity and pollinator composition. Yeast species occurring in a total of 128 field-collected nectar samples from 24 plant species were identified by sequencing the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rDNA, and rarefaction-based analyses were used to estimate yeast species richness at the plant community and plant species levels, using nectar drops as elemental sampling units. Individual nectar samples were generally characterized by very low species richness (1.2 yeast species/sample, on average), with the ascomycetous Metschnikowia reukaufii and Metschnikowia gruessii accounting altogether for 84.7% of the 216 isolates identified. Other yeasts recorded included species in the genera Aureobasidium, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus, Sporobolomyces, and Lecythophora. The shapes and slopes of observed richness accumulation curves were quite similar for the nectar drop and plant species approaches, but the two approaches yielded different expected richness estimates. Expected richness was higher for plant species-based than for nectar drop-based analyses, showing that the coverage of nectar yeast species occurring in the region would be improved by sampling additional host plant species. A significant correlation was found between incidence of yeast species in nectar and their reported ability to grow in a medium containing 50% glucose. Neither diversity nor incidence of yeasts was correlated with pollinator composition across plant species. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650677377

While detailed ecological or biophysical field studies are needed to quantify the exact amount of ecosystem service supply at local scales, such a monitoring might be unfeasible at the regional scale. Since field scale monitoring schemes for ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning are missing, proxy based indicators can help to assess the historic development of ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning at the regional scale. We show at the example of the historic development (1964-2004) in the district of Leipzig/Germany how land use/land cover data can be used to derive regional scale indicators for ecosystem functions. We focus thereby on two hypotheses: (1) the ecosystem functioning has degraded over time and (2) changes in land use configuration play an important role in this degradation. The study focuses on indicators for ecosystem functions related to (i) water purification by riparian buffer strips, (ii) pollination, (iii) food production and (iv) outdoor recreation. Each indicator builds on the analysis of land use configuration and land use composition information and is tested on sensitivity/robustness with respect to parameters which had to be estimated based on expert knowledge. We show that land use composition is an important aspect in our ecosystem service assessment. Although our study region is faced with a maximum land use change of 11% in the major land use classes between 1964 and 2004, we see a decrease of ecosystem function indicators up to 23%. The regional assessment shows an overall trend for degradation of ecosystem functioning from 1964 to 1984. This trend is reversed between 1984 and 1994 but the process slowed down until 2004 without reaching the level of 1964. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Few studies however, have systematically examined the effect of commercial scale bioenergy plantations on biodiversity in agri-ecosystems. In this study we investigate how the abundance and diversity of two key components of farmland biodiversity (ground flora and winged invertebrates) varied between mature willow Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) and two alternative land-use options (arable crops and set-aside land). Although the abundance of winged invertebrates was similar across all land-uses, taxonomic composition varied markedly. Hymenoptera and large Hemiptera (>5 mm) were more abundant in willow SRC than in arable or set-aside. Similarly although plant species richness was greater in set-aside, our data show that willow SRC supports a different plant community to the other land-uses, being dominated by competitive perennial species such as Elytrigia repens and Urtica dioica. Our results suggest that under current management practices a mixed farming system incorporating willow SRC can benefit native farm-scale biodiversity. In particular the reduced disturbance in willow SRC allows the persistence of perennial plant species, potentially providing a stable refuge and food sources for invertebrates. In addition, increased Hymenoptera abundance in willow SRC could potentially have concomitant effects on ecosystem processes, as many members of this Order are important pollinators of crop plants or otherwise fulfil an important beneficial role as predators or parasites of crop pests. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Biodiversity; Bioenergy; Land management; Semi-natural habitat; Set-aside; Willow SRC,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650563646

The vast majority of Old World species occur in southern Africa and eastern Asia. In this study, we examine biogeographic relationships among Old World species using a phylogenetic approach coupled with molecular evolutionary analyses of the S-RNase self-incompatibility gene. The phylogeny inferred from nuclear granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI), nuclear conserved ortholog set II (COSII) marker C2-At1g24360, and plastid spacer data (trnH-pbsA, trnDGUC-trnT GGU, rpl32-trnLUAG, and ndhF-rpl32) includes a clade of eastern Asian Lycium nested within the African species, suggesting initial dispersal from the Americas to Africa, with subsequent dispersal to eastern Asia. Molecular dating estimates suggest that these dispersal events occurred relatively recently, with dispersal from the Americas to Africa approximately 3.64 Ma (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 1.58-6.27), followed by subsequent dispersal to eastern Asia approximately 1.21 Ma (95% HPD: 0.32-2.42). In accordance, the S-RNase genealogy shows that S-RNases isolated from Old World species are restricted to four lineages, a subset of the 14 lineages including S-RNases isolated from New World Lycium species, supporting a bottleneck of S-RNase alleles concomitant with a single dispersal event from the Americas to the Old World. Furthermore, the S-RNase genealogy is also consistent with dispersal of Lycium from Africa to Asia, as eastern Asian alleles are restricted to a subset of the lineages that also include African alleles. Such a multilocus approach, including complementary data from GBSSI, COSII, plastid spacer regions, and S-RNase, is powerful for understanding dispersal histories of closely related species. © 2010 The Author.",Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST); biogeography; Lycium; molecular dating; S-RNase; self-incompatibility; Solanaceae,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650440382

In the present study, we investigate the pollination and breeding biology of Psychotria carthagenensis Jacq., a widely distributed species that has been described as typically distylous. Fieldwork was carried out mainly at the Panga Ecological Station, in Uberlândia, MG, Brazil. We carried out phenological observations, floral biology studies and hand pollination experiments within the Panga Ecological Station population. We complemented these data with herbarium and field surveys from elsewhere in Brazil. The studied population bloomed at the beginning of the rains (September-December). The main pollinators were Bombus and small Halictidae bees. The Panga Ecological Station population presented pin-monomorphism with only two thrum individuals in more than 100 flowering individuals surveyed. Hand pollinations at the Panga Ecological Station showed self-compatibility and intramorph compatibility. Typical distyly and isoplethy were found in other areas and both morphs appeared in herbarium material. However, pin-monomorphism was also observed elsewhere in Brazil. Typical distyly, pin-monomorphism and homostyly observed concurrently in Brazilian populations of P. carthagenensis indicate that alternative reproductive strategies, probably favoring selfing, appear to have developed independently in this species. © 2010 The Authors.

Several authors have found that resource use in Bombus species is usually based on the correlation between the proboscis length of the bumblebees and the corolla depth of the flowers. The aim of this study was to determine proboscis length of Bombus atratus and b. bellicosus, two Uruguayan bumblebees, and verify the resource exploitation testing two cultivated species, the red clover and the bird's foot trefoil. Bumblebee foraging activity was recorded in two culture conditions: in a red clover and bird's foot trefoil mixed meadow, and in contiguous plots of these legumes, and the proboscis length of collected foragers was determined. Both species of bumblebees exploited red clover and bird's foot trefoil although they did it in different proportions in all instances tested. The results indicated that the choice of the resources in b. atratus and b. bellicosus was influenced by their proboscis length. Bombus atratus has a longer proboscis and preferably visited red clover, possibly obtaining nectar easier and faster than b. bellicosus, which has a shorter proboscis.

Field-grown maize plants were shaded at 1-14 d (SI), 15-28 d (S2), and 29-42 d (S3) after pollination, respectively. Control plants (SO) were grown under natural light. Grain weight, quality, endosperm cell proliferation, cob sugar content, and grain pedicel vascular bundle cross section area were measured. The ultrastructural changes of endosperm cells and endosperm transfer cells were observed after pollination. The result indicated that the grain weight, starch content, endosperm cell number, and volume were declined after shading. On the contrary, the proportion of embryo and endosperm, protein content, and fat content in grain increased. Shading treatments significantly delayed the development of the starch granules and remarkably reduced the endosperm filling status. Among the three treatments, the number of the grain endosperm was the least under shading stress at 1-14 d after pollination. However, the volume of starch granules and the substantiation of endosperm under shading treatment at 15-28 d after pollination were the worst. Compared with the control (natural sunlight without shading), the soluble sugar of maize cob increased significantly, while there was no obvious change in vascular structure of small cluster stalk. The number of protein body in maize endosperm was influenced markedly by low light at different stages after pollination. Low light decreased the volume of the grain endosperm transfer and the cell wall extensions of the basal transfer cells became thinner and shorter under shading treatment than those of the control. Furthermore, the degree of connection and the capacity of the nutrient transport were decreased and the mitochondrion number of the transfer cell was reduced after shading. The change in grain quality after shading was observed due to increase in the proportion of embryo and endosperm. The morphology and functions in endosperm transfer cell and the shortage of energy restricted the nutrient transport greatly with shading at different stages, suggesting that an impeded flux may be one of the important reasons for the reduction of maize grain weight of maize grain at later growth stage under low light condition. © 2011 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",Endosperm cell; Kernel weight; Maize (Zea mays L.); Shading; Transfer cell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751618817

A multi-site study in western Canada was conducted to determine the merits of polymer-coated urea (Environmentally Smart Nitrogen, ESN) compared with urea on weed management and yield of hybrid and open-pollinated (OP) canola. Treatments included a hybrid and OP canola cultivar, ESN and urea, 100 and 150% of soil test N fertilizer rates, and 50 and 100% of registered in-crop herbicide rates. Canola was grown in rotation with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in a no-till system and both crops of the rotation were present each year. Fertilizer and herbicide rate treatments were applied to the same plots in four consecutive years to determine annual and cumulative eff ects. Hybrid compared with OP canola reduced weed tissue N concentration in 40% of the cases and reduced weed biomass in 80% of the cases. Additionally, weed tissue N concentration was lower with ESN than with urea in 70% of the cases, indicating that crop-weed competition for soil N might be reduced if ESN were used. Canola yield was greater for the hybrid cultivar in 15 of 20 site-years. Both cultivars expressed a positive yield response to the 150% N fertilizer rate in 10 of 20 siteyears. This yield response occurred in three additional site-years with hybrid canola, indicating that hybrid cultivars have a higher N demand under favorable growing conditions. Canola yield was similar with ESN and urea in 14 of 20 site-years. The ESN compared with urea increased canola yield in 4 site-years and in one additional site-year for hybrid canola, indicating that ESN may be advantageous in some situations. Canola seed oil concentration was similar with ESN and urea in 19 of 20 site-years. Information gained in this study will be used to develop improved fertilization strategies for canola production on the semiarid Canadian prairies. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951741187

Seeds came from four geographic regions and were stored from 0 to 10 years at one of four storage facilities. Seeds received a standard 1 month of warm moist treatment and 2 months of cold stratification treatment and germination regime, and germination capacity was determined for 100 viable seeds per family. A subset of families received an additional 6 months of cold stratification. Mean germination was 13.4% after 2 months of cold stratification and 76.6% after an additional 6 months of cold stratification, with a wide range among seedlots for both assessments. The length of storage did not affect germination significantly in the first test, but it was associated with a decline in the second test. Germination capacity of up to 80% was achieved with seeds that had been in storage for 10 years. High viability of stored seeds indicate that ex situ seed storage should provide a viable means of conserving genetic resources; however, we recommend that standard protocols for germination of whitebark pine seeds be modified by extending the cold stratification period.

In the shoot apical meristem of chimera TCC (L1-L2-L3, L1 being the outermost layer of shoot apical meristem, L2 the middle layer, L3 the innermost layer; T = tuber mustard, C = red cabbage), the outermost layer was derived from tuber mustard, while the middle and the innermost layers were from red cabbage. In the present study, displacement of the L1 cell layer was found to result in infertile plants. The viability of TCC's pollen from the L2 layer became significantly lower than that of red cabbage, and the self-pollinated embryo aborted at an early stage. Anatomical observation of ovules showed that the cellularized endosperm developed partially and degraded prematurely at the globular-embryo stage. Ovule culture was carried out to rescue the selfed embryos of TCC, and the results showed that ovules at 16 days after pollination could be rescued on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplied with 3% sucrose, 0.2% active carbon, 400 mg/l glutamine, and casein hydrolysate. Morphological, chromosomal, and molecular identifications consistently showed that the selfed progeny of TCC was red cabbage. These investigations indicated that the heterologous L1 cell layer greatly influenced the reproductive characteristics of the plants, although it did not participate directly in gametogenesis and embryo ontogenesis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brassica juncea; Brassica oleracea; Chimera; Ovule rescue; Reproductive characteristics; Sterility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79151475084

As previous studies carried out in Central Europe and the US have shown, bee diversity and abundance is influenced by the structure and the composition of the surrounding landscape. Comparable studies have so far not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13 sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees' abundance was impacted by landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales. The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove, while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land, rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and abundance in the Mediterranean.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027947923

The explanation for such disparity has often been attributed to the evolution of key innovations that facilitate colonization of new ecological niches. The factors underlying diversification in bees remain poorly explored. Bees are thought to have originated from apoid wasps during the Mid-Cretaceous, a period that coincides with the appearance of angiosperm eudicot pollen grains in the fossil record. The reliance of bees on angiosperm pollen and their fundamental role as angiosperm pollinators have contributed to the idea that both groups may have undergone simultaneous radiations. We demonstrate that one key innovation-the inclusion of foreign material in nest construction- underlies both a massive range expansion and a significant increase in the rate of diversification within the second largest bee family, Megachilidae. Basal clades within the family are restricted to deserts and exhibit plesiomorphic features rarely observed among modern bees, but prevalent among apoid wasps. Our results suggest that early bees inherited a suite of behavioural traits that acted as powerful evolutionary constraints. While the transition to pollen as a larval food source opened an enormous ecological niche for the early bees, the exploitation of this niche and the subsequent diversification of bees only became possible after bees had evolved adaptations to overcome these constraints. © 2011 The Royal Society.",Bee-flower relationships; Bees; Diversification; Key innovation; Megachilidae; Nesting biology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054904629
