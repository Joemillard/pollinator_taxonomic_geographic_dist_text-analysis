To facilitate these interactions, many flowers are known to display their attractive qualities, such as scent emission and petal opening, in a daily rhythmic fashion. However, less is known about how the internal timing mechanisms (the circadian clocks) of plants and animals influence their daily interactions. We examine the role of the circadian clock in modulating the interaction between Petunia and one of its pollinators, the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. We find that desynchronization of the Petunia circadian clock affects moth visitation preference for Petunia flowers. Similarly, moths with circadian time aligned to plants show stronger flower-foraging activities than moths that lack this alignment. Moth locomotor activity is circadian clock-regulated, although it is also strongly repressed by light. Moths show a time-dependent burst increase in flight activity during subjective night. In addition, moth antennal responsiveness to the floral scent compounds exhibits a 24-hour rhythm in both continuous light and dark conditions. This study highlights the importance of the circadian clocks in both plants and animals as a crucial factor in initiating specialized plant-pollinator relationships. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041964743

However, the function of auxins in pollen tube elongation in the pistil of rice under heat stress has seldom been previously reported. Results: Two rice genotypes differing in heat tolerance were subjected to heat stress of 40 °C for 2 h after flowering. A sharp decrease in spikelet fertility was found in the Nipponbare (NPB) and its mutant High temperature susceptible (HTS) under heat stress, but the stress-induced spikelet sterility was reversed by 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), especially the HTS. Under heat stress, the pollen tubes of NPB were visible in ovule, while those of HTS were invisible. However, we found the pollen tubes in ovule when sprayed with NAA. During this process, a significant increase in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was found in the pistil of heat-stressed NPB, while in heat-stressed HTS they were obviously decreased. Additionally, the peroxidase (POD) activity in pistil of NPB was significantly decreased by heat stress, whereas there was no difference between the heat-stressed and non-heat-stressed pistils of HTS. Conclusion: It was concluded that the enhancement of heat tolerance in plants by NAA was achieved through the increase of the levels of auxins, which prevented the inhibition of pollen tube elongation in pistil, and the crosstalk between auxins and ROS, which might be involved in this process. In addition, POD might be a negative mediator in pollen tube elongation under heat stress due to its ability to scavenge ROS and degrade auxin. © 2018, The Author(s).",Auxins; Heat stress; Oryza sativa; Peroxidase; Pollen tube elongation; Reactive oxygen species,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043708834

However, parallel changes in biotic interactions remain largely uninvestigated. Here we show how mutualisms involving plants and heterotrophic organisms varied during the last 50,000 years. During 50-25 ka BP, a cool period featuring stadial-interstadial fluctuations, arbuscular mycorrhizal and non-N-fixing plants predominated. During 25-15 ka BP, a cold, dry interval, the representation of ectomycorrhizal, non-mycorrhizal and facultatively mycorrhizal plants increased, while that of N-fixing plants decreased further. From 15 ka BP, which marks the transition to and establishment of the Holocene interglaciation, representation of arbuscular mycorrhizal plants decreased further, while that of ectomycorrhizal, non-mycorrhizal, N-fixing and wind-pollinated plants increased. These changes in the mutualist trait structure of vegetation may reflect responses to historical environmental conditions that are without current analogue, or biogeographic processes, such as spatial decoupling of mutualist partners. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040443503

Their biodiversity is relatively poor and some groups are well-represented, others not, especially not insects. A scarcity of insects forces birds to explore alternative food, such as nectar and fruit. In this way, island birds may pollinate and disperse seed to an extent unseen on any mainland; they may even first consume floral resources of a plant species and then later harvest the fruit of the same species. Through this biotic reuse, they may act as double mutualists. The latter have never been studied at the level of the network, because they are traditionally considered rare. We sampled pollination and seed-dispersal interactions on Galápagos and constructed a plant-bird mutualism network of 108 plant (12% being double mutualists) and 21 bird species (48% being double mutualists), and their 479 interactions, being either single (95%) or double mutualisms (5%). Double mutualists constitute the core in the pollination-dispersal network, coupling the two link types together. They may also initiate positive feedbacks (more pollination leading to more dispersal), which theoretically are known to be unstable. Thus, double mutualisms may be a necessary, but risky prerequisite to the survival of island biodiversity. © 2017 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042769176

In this study, we aimed to examine how the selfing timing correlated with floral traits in three Gentianopsis species in which autonomous selfing is achieved through filament elongation. Although the three Gentianopsis species exhibit no significant variation in their capacity for autonomous selfing, flowers of G. grandis last longer, are larger and have a higher corolla biomass, P/O ratios and male biomass allocation than those of G. paludosa, and especially those of G. contorta. Autonomous selfing occurs in the early floral life of G. paludosa and G. contorta and in the later floral life of G. grandis. Seed production mainly results from autonomous selfing in G. paludosa and G. contorta; however, G. grandis could be more described as having a mixed mating system. We suggest that autonomous selfing in later floral life increases the chance of cross-pollination prior to this, while autonomous selfing in early floral life offers a selective advantage to plants by reducing the resource investment in traits that may increase pollinator attraction and visitation. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042671404

Recently, it has been shown that such changes can be transmitted to subsequent generations. However, the occurrence and extent of transmission across different types of traits is still unexplored. Here, we assessed the emergence and transmission of herbivory-induced changes in Brassica rapa and their impact on interactions with insects. We analysed changes in morphology and reproductive traits as well as in flower and leaf volatile emission during two generations with leaf herbivory by Mamestra brassicae and Pieris brassicae and two subsequent generations without herbivory. Herbivory induced changes in all trait types, increasing attractiveness of the plants to the parasitoid wasp Cotesia glomerata and decreasing visitation by the pollinator Bombus terrestris, a potential trade-off. While changes in floral and leaf volatiles disappeared in the first generation after herbivory, some changes in morphology and reproductive traits were still measurable two generations after herbivory. However, neither parasitoids nor pollinators further discriminated between groups with different past treatments. Our results suggest that transmission of herbivore-induced changes occurs preferentially in resource-limited traits connected to plant growth and reproduction. The lack of alterations in plant-insect interactions was likely due to the transient nature of volatile changes. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042533673

Recent reports of the weakening and periodical high losses of managed honey bee colonies have alarmed beekeeper, farmers and scientists. Infestations with the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor in combination with its associated viruses have been identified as a crucial driver of these health problems. Although yearly treatments are required to prevent collapses of honey bee colonies, the number of effective acaricides is small and no new active compounds have been registered in the past 25 years. RNAi-based methods were proposed recently as a promising new tool. However, the application of these methods according to published protocols has led to a surprising discovery. Here, we show that the lithium chloride that was used to precipitate RNA and other lithium compounds is highly effective at killing Varroa mites when fed to host bees at low millimolar concentrations. Experiments with caged bees and brood-free artificial swarms consisting of a queen and several thousand bees clearly demonstrate the potential of lithium as miticidal agent with good tolerability in worker bees providing a promising basis for the development of an effective and easy-to-apply control method for mite treatment. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040631532

In a mutualistic network between treehoppers-weaver ants and fig-pollinating wasps, we found that the cuticular hydrocarbons of the treehoppers are more similar to the surface chemical profiles of fig inflorescence branches (FIB) than the cuticular hydrocarbons of the fig wasps. Behavioral assays showed that the cuticular hydrocarbons from both treehoppers and FIBs reduce the propensity of weaver ants to attack treehoppers even in the absence of honeydew rewards, suggesting that chemical camouflage helps enforce the mutualism between weaver ants and treehoppers. High levels of weaver ant and treehopper abundances help maintain the dominance of pollinating fig wasps in the fig wasp community and also increase fig seed production, as a result of discriminative predation and disturbance by weaver ants of ovipositing non-pollinating fig wasps (NPFWs). Ants therefore help preserve this fig-pollinating wasp mutualism from over exploitation by NPFWs. Our results imply that in this mutualistic network chemical camouflage plays a decisive role in regulating the behavior of a key species and indirectly shaping the architecture of complex arthropod-plant interactions. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041340689

Here, gibberellins (GA4+7), but not GA3, induced pear parthenocarpy. To systematically investigate the changes upon GA4+7 induced pear parthenocarpy, dynamic changes in histology, hormone and transcript levels were observed and identified in unpollinated, pollinated and GA4+7-treated ovaries. Mesocarp cells continued developing in both GA4+7-treated and pollinated ovaries. In unpollinated ovaries, mesocarp cells stopped developing 14 days after anthesis. During fruit set process, GA4+7, but not GA1+3, increased after pollination. Abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation was significantly repressed by GA4+7 or pollination, but under unpollinated conditions, ABA was produced in large quantities. Moreover, indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis was not induced by GA4+7 or pollination treatments. Details of this GA-auxin-ABA cross-linked gene network were determined by a comparative transcriptome analysis. The indole-3-acetic acid transport-related genes, mainly auxin efflux carrier component genes, were induced in both GA4+7-treated and pollinated ovaries. ABA biosynthetic genes of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase family were repressed by GA4+7 and pollination. Moreover, directly related genes in the downstream parthenocarpy network involved in cell division and expansion (upregulated), and MADS-box family genes (downregulated), were also identified.

In pollinators, parasite exposure to floral phytochemicals may influence between-host transmission and within-host replication. In the bumble bee parasite Crithidia bombi, strains vary in phytochemical resistance, and resistance increases under in vitro selection, implying that resistance/infectivity trade-offs could maintain intraspecific variation in resistance. We assessed costs and benefits of in vitro selection for resistance to the floral phytochemical eugenol on C. bombi infection in Bombus impatiens fed eugenol-rich and eugenol-free diets. We also assessed infection-induced changes in host preferences for eugenol. In vitro, eugenol-exposed cells initially increased in size, but normalized during adaptation. Selection for eugenol resistance resulted in considerable (55%) but non-significant reductions in infection intensity; bee colony and body size were the strongest predictors of infection. Dietary eugenol did not alter infection, and infected bees preferred eugenol-free over eugenol-containing solutions. Although direct effects of eugenol exposure could influence between-host transmission at flowers, dietary eugenol did not ameliorate infection in bees. Limited within-host benefits of resistance, and possible trade-offs between resistance and infectivity, may relax selection for eugenol resistance and promote inter-strain variation in resistance. However, infection-induced dietary shifts could influence pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits. © 2018 The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041611349

Acrocomia aculeata is a neotropical palm currently undergoing domestication due to its sustainability and profitability as an alternative oil crop. The attainment of productive cultivars of this palm may be speed up by somatic embryogenesis. Thus, this study sought to refine an existing somatic embryogenesis cloning protocol for A. aculeata and to investigate the possible genetic influence on the in vitro propagation response, using zygotic embryos from 19 matrices or open-pollinated families. The embryos were inoculated in modified induction media. The following characteristics were evaluated in this phase: swollen embryos, percentage of zygotic embryos that formed callus, embryogenic calli and oxidation. Afterwards the resulting pro embryogenic masses were subsequently cultivated in modified multiplication, maturation and gemination media. In those phases the open-pollinated families response was measured by the growth of their embryogenic mass and the quantity of regenerated and germinated somatic embryos. The refined micropropagation protocol was successful in establishing embryogenic lines and maintaining their cyclic multiplication for a long period; all without the loss of their potential to maturate and regenerate somatic embryos. In general, the multiplication of pro embryogenic masses was effective even in the lowest dose of Picloram (18 ?M). The addition of activated charcoal in the medium favored the maturation of somatic embryos. Plantlets regeneration, although defective in some lineages, was promoted by GA3 (0.55 ?M). The zygotic embryos responsiveness to somatic embryogenesis varied according to their matrices, indicating that if micropropagation is to be used as a mass propagation technique for the species, the explant?s genotype must be considered. © 2018",Auxins; Bioenergy; Cytokines; Genotype effect; Macaúba; Somatic embryogenesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042696263

Nevertheless, there is a deficient understanding of detailed pollen flow patterns, which leads to uncertainty in designing and managing seed orchards of M. oleifera to fit the breeding demand. In order to facilitate the design of breeding strategies for inbreeding lines, paternity analysis by SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) was used to estimate the outcrossing rate and pollen mediated gene flow of M. oleifera. The analysis was carried out in an experimental population domesticated in the dry-hot valley area of Red River with two germplasms (India and Myanmar) of 60 trees, including 12 maternal trees and 60 pollen donors (bisexual flowers, maternal trees were also possible paternal trees in case of selfing). One hundred fifteen seeds out of 288 were confirmed pollen donors by 8 microsatellite loci at 95% strict confidence level. The multilocus outcrossing rate is tm = 0.797 ± 0.096, and single-locus outcrossing rate is ts = 0.742 ± 0.058. Pollen dispersal distance varied from 0 m (self-pollination) to 24.7 m, with an average of 11.9 m, and 95% of effective pollen was dispersed within 20 m, indicating that the effective pollen mediated gene flow is restricted to a limited distance. 50.3% of effective pollen was donated by 9 trees. Moreover, there was no apparent correlation between pollen dispersal distance and pollen contribution rate, as well as between germplasm and reproducibility. The maximum pollen dispersal distance between two trees estimated in this experimental stand is highly localized at current 3 × 3 m planting density, indicating that M. oleifera seed orchards and clones could be planted nearer to each other than previously thought (as far as kilometers). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Moringa oleifera Lam; Outcrossing rate; Paternity analysis; Pollen dispersal; SSR,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042804864

Pollinators behaviour and their community dynamics are often affected by the spatial distribution of floral and nesting resources at the landscape scale, and are thus sensitive to land-use land-cover (LULC) changes and management practices. The main objective of this study is to understand how changes in riparian vegetation and LULC at River Minho affect pollination services. For this, an approach based on the temporal analysis of historical cartography (1898) and current satellite imagery (2016) was used. We developed a novel Pollination Suitability Index for Riverine Landscapes (PSIRL) using LULC data as a proxy of habitat suitability for insect pollinators. PSIRL scores were derived from expert judgment of the local habitat conditions, floral diversity and field surveys. The PSIRL values obtained for both periods were compared using pairwise T-tests. We detected an overall reduction of the pollination services in the riverine landscape of River Minho from 1898 to 2016. However, at local level we observed gains and losses of pollination suitability as a result of distinct LULC changes. There was a marked decrease in the PSIRL in the most downstream and upstream riverine sections due to generalized conversion of scrublands, broadleaved-forests and heterogeneous agricultural areas to artificial surfaces and managed forests dominated by maritime pine and eucalyptus. However, in the middle section of the river, the area occupied by scrublands, riparian and broadleaved forests increased, resulting in an increase of the foraging resources for insects, and a consequent increase of the PSIRL. This index can be used to monitor and capture changes in the pollination suitability of complex riverine landscapes and support further land and river management decisions. The historical cartography proved to be a valuable source of information to characterize LULC change and hence to assess the evolutionary trajectory of pollination ecosystem services, at global and local level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ecosystem services; Historical cartography; Insect pollination; LULC change; Pollination Suitability Index; Riverscapes,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042715567

Predicting habitat suitability for this species is imperative for estimating threat to native species, and predicting future spread. Previous habitat suitability models used bioclimatic variables to make predictions across a broad geographic region, but these showed little utility at predicting risk at the local habitat scale. Therefore, we created a model using environmental inputs that vary across a regional scale (land cover type and percent impervious surface) and focused within a more restricted geographic region, the Northeastern (NE) US. Occurrence records were aggregated from open-sourced data and published records, and maximum entropy methods were used to create the model. We created a second model using bioclimatic variables (temperature and precipitation), to compare utility of both model inputs. We then tested the accuracy of both models by performing weighted random sampling and stratified random sampling across the NE to obtain presence and absence data for A. manicatum. Given previous predictions of widespread habitat suitability, it was surprising that out of 140 sampled locations, A. manicatum were only found at seven. When comparing model accuracy (Cohen's Kappa), both models showed low accuracy (land scape variables KHAT = 0.023; bioclimatic variables KHAT = ?0.094). Models were also not significantly different from each other (Z = 0.548). Therefore, presence-only modeling may not be suitable for this system, either because these variables are not capturing factors restricting A. manicatum's range, or it is too early in the invasion process. Additional probability sampling is suggested to refine predictive models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",GIS; Invasive species; Maxent; Sampling; Suitability distribution modeling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041408116

Pollination is necessary for the health of ecological and agricultural systems, since they guarantee the fecundation of 80% of flower-flora species.

Here we propose a methodology to harmonize energy production, agriculture and the enhancement of ecosystem services, looking for a synergy between different economic activities and stakeholders.

Within the hive, beeswax is a matrix of particular interest because most of the chemicals used in agricultural and beekeeping activities can easily accumulate and persist in this matrix long after treatment has ceased, affecting honeybees survival. However, chemical analyses of pesticide residues in beeswax are not mandatory, so there are no residue limits, for beeswax. The present study was carried out with the aim of investigating the beeswax residue pattern in the Italian hives. 178 beeswax samples collected from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed for 247 pesticides. 73.6% of the analyzed samples reported the presence of one or more pesticides. On average every single sample showed a mean of three different pesticides each with a maximum of fourteen compounds, some of which were banned in Europe or not authorized in Italy. The higher frequencies were associated with three acaricides: coumaphos (60.7% of samples), tau-fluvalinate (50%) and chlorphenvinphos (35.4%), but the higher concentrations were associated to pyrethrins and piperonil butoxide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Beeswax; Hive health; Italy; Multiresidual analysis; Pesticides,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039712354

Less frequently reported, direct and indirect impacts on vertebrates, namely birds, are also known to occur. The Argentine ant Linepithema humile is one of the worst invasive species worldwide, and is responsible for economic and ecological impacts in Madeira since its introduction. Previous reports indicated that Argentine ants may be a frequent predator of nestlings on the Desertas Islands which harbour internationally important seabird colonies. Here, we provide a survey of the records of bird predation by Argentine ants in the Desertas. Furthermore, we also assessed if these invasive ants affected the most abundant crevice-nesting seabird on Deserta Grande, the Bulwer's petrel Bulweria bulwerii, by nest monitoring in the years of 20142016. We found that breeding success varied annually between 0.56 and 0.63 chicks produced per nesting attempt. Ant predation of chicks was observed in only two out of 294 study nests. Furthermore, no relationship was found between local abundance of Argentine ants and breeding success of Bulwer's petrels. We conclude that Argentine ants do not seem to pose a major threat to nesting petrels on the Desertas, although we acknowledge the possibility that environmental changes and episodic population explosions of this invasive species may lead to a greater impact on seabirds reproductive success. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Crevice-nesting seabirds; Invasive species; Linepithema humile; Nestling predation; Oceanic islands; Seabird conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042687224

In this study, we collected pollen, nectar and leaves from a cotton crop treated with imidacloprid and thiamethoxam to measure the residue levels of these two NIs at different application doses during the flowering period. Then, the residual data were used to assess the risk posed by the systemic insecticides to honeybees following mandated methods published by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and a highly toxic risk to honeybees was highlighted. Imidacloprid was found in both pollen and nectar samples, whereas thiamethoxam was found in 90% of pollen samples and over 60% of nectar samples. Analysis of the pollen and nectar revealed residual amounts of imidacloprid ranging from 1.61 to 64.58 ng g?1 in the pollen and from not detected (ND) to 1.769 ng g?1 in the nectar. By comparison, the thiamethoxam concentrations in pollen and nectar ranged from ND to 14.521 ng g?1 and from ND to 4.285 ng g?1, respectively. The results of this study provide information on the transfer of two NIs from seed treatment to areas of the plant and provides an understanding of the potential exposure of the bee and other pollinators to systemic insecticides. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Cotton; Honey bees; Imidacloprid; Risk assessment; Thiamethoxam; UPLC-MS/MS,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042883074

Biopesticides are considered an alternative to synthetic pesticides with a focus on reducing potential detrimental effects to beneficial organisms such as bees. The production of healthy queen stingless bees is essential for the survival and reproduction of hives, although it remains unknown whether biopesticides influence stingless bee reproduction. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the biopesticide azadirachtin on the survival, behavior, morphology, development, and reproduction of queens of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese, 1900). The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a toxic reference standard. Queens were orally exposed in vitro to a contaminated diet (containing azadirachtin and imidacloprid) during development. Azadirachtin resulted in reduced survival, similarly to imidacloprid, altered development time, caused deformations, and reduced the size of the queens reproductive organs. All of these factors could potentially compromise colony survival.

Methods to identify priority areas for ecosystem services can assist in the implementation of such policy objectives. While land use change is an important driver of changes in ecosystem services over time, most prioritization studies do not account for land use change or only assess negative effects. We assessed the effect of land use change on ecosystem services in Europe for a 40-year period and the subsequent consequences for identifying priority areas. We quantified five services under current and future land use. For both time frames all sites were ranked based on their service provision using Zonation. To assess the sensitivity of the prioritization to land use change we compared the location of priority areas and the level of ecosystem services within priority areas in the two time frames. Land use change shifts the location of priority areas. Overlap in priority areas over time ranges from 34.8% overlap for the top 1% priority areas to 75.4% overlap for the top 25% priority areas. Moreover, land use change affects the availability of ecosystem services in top priority areas: Compared to current top priority areas, future top ranked priority areas have lower pollination and carbon sequestration capacity. Capacity of erosion control and flood control are stable over time and nature-based tourism increases. Shifts in priority areas are driven not only by local land use change, but also by land use change in the wider landscape, through connectivity effects and shifts in the relative importance of sites. The real management challenge lies in maintaining ecosystem services within landscapes where production and conservation objectives need to be reconciled and priority areas are affected by both local and landscape wide changes in land use. Moreover, we show that land use change has both local positive and negative effects on ecosystem service priorities, indicating that prioritization studies should not solely incorporate negative effects of land use change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Conservation; Hotspots; Land management; Prioritization; Systematic conservation planning; Trade-offs; Zonation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042194421

Neither a positive nor a negative effect of formic acid (concentration 60%, w/v) on the colony losses could be found, irrespective of the weather conditions around the time of application. The higher concentration of 85% formic acid was linked with reduced colony losses when applications were done in August. Colony losses were reduced when Thymovar was applied in July or August, but applications in September were associated with increased losses compared with apiaries not treated with Thymovar during the same period.

Detailed studies on influence of the pollen source on the berry size and the number of seeds in fruits of the red raspberry were conducted at the Research Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, Poland. Studies were carried on under controlled conditions and were based on three separate greenhouse experiments conducted in 20152017. In these experiments flowers of red raspberries Canby Glen Ample Laszka Polana Polka Radziejowa Schönemann and Willamette were artificially pollinated (by hand) with pollen coming from either the same cultivar (self-pollination, self-fertilization) and/or with pollen collected from other cultivars (cross-pollination, cross-fertilization). It was found that cross-pollination resulted in increase of fruit size and number of seeds per fruit compared to fruits obtained from self-pollination. In majority of the cross-combinations (pollination treatments) the differences between cross-pollination and self-pollination were significant. The larger fruit size and the number of seeds per fruit from cross-pollinated flowers was depended on the particular pollinizer. The results confirm that the cross-fertilization is essential for high yield and improved mass of each berry. It is particularly important in cultivation of red raspberries under the high tunnels for early harvest, where predominantly single cultivar is grown in so called varietal monoculture. These findings suggest that selection of suitable pollinizer should be a new area of research for red raspberry production under cover for early or late crop. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Drupelet; Fruit quality; Metaxenia; Protected cultivation; Raspberries off-season production; Raspberry pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043486441

In order to identify suitable reference gene, we selected the most commonly used reference genes (Act, Apt, cyc and eIF) and ranked their expression stabilities using two statistical algorithms; geNorm and NormFinder. The results from both algorithms showed that Act was the most stable gene for oil palm pollen germination gene.

Although advantages and disadvantages of CA are well studied under sole cropping, less is known about its impact in agroforestry systems. The performance of open pollinated maize varieties under CA, CAWT, sole maize under conventional tillage (CT) and conventional tillage with trees (CTWT) was compared on-farm in equatorial savannah areas over four consecutive seasons in Rwanda and two seasons in Ethiopia. The tree species considered in the study were mature Grevillea robusta (A. Cunn.) and Senna spectabilis (DC.) in Rwanda and mature Acacia tortilis (Forssk.) in Ethiopia. Both CA and the presence of trees consistently reduced maize emergence, leaf area (LA), plant height, and maize yields. Crop emergence was significantly reduced under CAWT compared with CTWT. Maize emergence rates in CAWT and CTWT were respectively 46.9% and 70.1%, compared with 74.7% and 79.8% in sole maize under CA and CT. Grain yield in CAWT and CTWT were respectively 0.37 t dry matter (DM) ha?1 and 1.18 t DM ha?1 as compared with 1.65 t DM ha?1 and 1.95 t DM ha?1 in CA and CT. We conclude that CAWT strongly reduces crop yield in the equatorial savannah of East Africa. CA is incompatible with agroforestry under the conditions of our study. There is an urgent need for rigorous research to revisit if, when and where CAWT can generate benefits for smallholder farmers. © 2018 The Authors",Crop phenology; Equatorial savannah; Maize; Minimum-tillage,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043535162

Quantitative defenses, whose protective effect is dependent on the dose, are effective against a wide range of herbivores, but often divert energy from growth and reproduction. Qualitative defenses often have little allocation costs. However, while deterrent to some herbivores, they often incur costs through other interactions within the community (e.g., decrease in pollination or attraction of other enemies). In the present work, we model the evolutionary dynamics of these two types of defenses, as well and the evolutionary dynamics of the herbivore niche. We assess the effects of such evolutionary dynamics for the maintenance of diversity within the plant-herbivore system, and for the functioning of such systems under various levels of resource availability. We show that the two types of defenses have different implications. Evolution of quantitative defenses often helps to maintain or even increase diversity, while evolution of qualitative defenses most often has a detrimental effect on species coexistence. From a functional point of view, increased resource availability selects for higher levels of quantitative defenses, which reduces top-down controls exerted by herbivores. Resource availability does not affect qualitative defenses, nor the evolution of the herbivore niche. The growing evidence that plant defenses are diverse in types, benefits and costs has large implications not only for the evolution of these traits, but also for their impacts on community diversity and ecosystem functioning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Diversity maintenance; Qualitative defenses; Quantitative defenses; Resource availability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042690412

In order to protect the biodiversity and associated potential ecosystem services of woody networks, we need to understand their drivers. We surveyed the plant diversity and calculated the pollinator resource value and edibility value of 831 woody elements in 47 landscape windows of 1 km2 in the countryside in northern Belgium. The woody network hosted approximately 45% of the plant diversity in the studied countryside, and forest species, grassland species, tall herbs as well as pioneer species coexisted successfully within the woody elements. The pollination resource value showed the highest correlation with the species richness and abundance of the forest species, whereas for edibility the species richness and abundance of the tall herbs were determinative. The number of forest species mainly depended on the presence of forests in the surrounding landscape and the link was even stronger in historical woody elements. For grassland species, tall herbs and pioneers, we found that structural variables of the woody element itself were the most important driver. We argue that by protecting existing woody elements and thoughtfully designing and locating new ones, intrinsic and functional diversity in the countryside can benefit well. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Agro-conservation measures; Agro-ecology; Edible herbs; Plant species groups; Resources for pollinators; Species-environment analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043599657

Soaring cultivation of mass flowering crops (e.g. oil seed rape OSR) and loss of semi-natural habitats (SNH) can strongly affect populations of native pollinators, yet it remains unclear how OSR and SNH affect spatial and temporal turnover of pollinator communities. Here, we examined how the landscape-scale proportions of OSR and SNH affect spatial and temporal community turnover in solitary bees and hoverflies, two key provider groups of pollination and pest control services in temperate agro-ecosystems. Using a novel grid-based landscape-wide sampling approach, we quantified pollinator communities within ten 1 km × 1 km landscapes representing independent gradients in OSR and SNH availability. We sampled during and after OSR flowering, in two subsequent years, yielding app. 8800 specimens representing 160 species. Spatial community turnover, measured as the slope of the dissimilarity-distance relationship, was not influenced by the proportion of OSR at any time. In contrast, SNH decreased community turnover for bees during OSR flowering and for hoverflies after flowering, likely caused by pollinator movement between land use types. This suggests that a high availability of SNH may help to promote an even distribution of native bees and hoverflies within temperate agricultural landscapes, hereby potentially stabilizing landscape-wide pollination services. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bees; Canola; Germany; Landscape context; Oil seed rape; Species turnover; Syrphids; ?-diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042653266

Gesneria pauciflora is a threatened, rupiculous, and riverine species with floral-traits that suggest a hummingbird-pollination system. Because these habitat-pollinator conditions have been linked to pollinator-independent reproductive systems, we expected a breeding system that provides reproductive assurance. We assessed the breeding system and potential vulnerabilities during pollination phase using field observations and pollination experiments, to determine pollinator dependency and the existence of strategies for reproductive assurance. Gesneria pauciflora was pollinated by two hummingbird species but visitation rates were low, probably due to low nectar rewards. Fruit set and seed production were significantly higher in flowers when pollen was artificially delivered (self- and cross-pollination) compared to when it was not (control and autogamy), suggesting that reproduction is pollen-limited. Gesneria pauciflora is self-compatible, with some seeds produced via autonomous selfing without any effects of pollination mechanism on seed germination rates. Florivory by the native plume-moth Postplatyptilia caribica was observed, but its incidence was low (12%). Our findings are consistent with theory on the evolution of plant breeding systems on islands, and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of breeding systems in Caribbean gesneriads. Overall, data do not show immediate vulnerabilities to this listed species at the pollination phase, and autogamy may represent reproductive assurance counteracting unpredictable environmental factors that influence its reproduction. However, its capacity for selfing is small relative to other tubular Puerto Rican Gesneria which may explain its rare status. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Autofertility; Florivory; Hummingbirds; Pollen limitation; Reproductive assurance; Self-compatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043359272

We evaluated effects on reproductive success of field bean (Vicia faba) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) using data from two study systems, both including study sites (1 km radius) with (flower strip sites) or without flower strips (control sites). To assess whether flower strips enhance pollination in the wider landscape, we compared the reproductive success between plants growing in field borders (> 160 m to nearest flower strip) at flower strips sites and control sites. We also tested if flower strips reallocate pollination functions in the landscape. We did this by comparing the reproductive success of plants at flower strip sites, growing adjacent to the flower strips with plants growing in a more distant field border at the same site (> 160 m). Finally, we tested if these potential effects depended on the heterogeneity of the landscape. In field borders without an adjacent flower strip, plant reproductive success was unaffected by the presence of a flower strip at the site, and increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity independently of site type (flower strip vs. control). In contrast, adjacent to the flower strips, reproductive success declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity, resulting in a positive net effect of adjacent flower strips in homogeneous landscapes and a negative effect in heterogeneous landscapes. Our results show that while decreasing landscape heterogeneity may impair pollination in homogeneous landscapes, this can be locally mitigated by sowing flower strips. However, in heterogeneous landscapes, flower strips may instead reduce pollination of adjacent plants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Agri-environment measures; Agri-environment schemes; Landscape complexity; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043983615

Box 874501, Tempe, AZ, United States","Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of ostensibly weedy species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or 3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness and evenness. Our results highlight a lazy lawnmower approach to providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical, and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual households to contribute to urban conservation. © 2018",Backyard habitat; Bee conservation; Management; Suburban lawns; Urban biodiversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043362295

The Atlantic Forest is subject to serious conservation problems due to human activities and is one of the hotpots for the preservation of biodiversity. Bats play important roles in the recuperation of this type of environment as pollinators, seed dispersers and controllers of invertebrate populations. Environments altered by humans may serve as filters that determine the presence of animals with morphologically different characteristics in comparison to those found in preserved environments. In the present study, morphometric characteristics and weight were studied in flat-faced fruit-eating bats (Artibeus planirostris) captured in three protected areas of the Atlantic Forest located in the northern portion of the biome: one well preserved and two with conservation problems. The means of nearly all morphological characteristics evaluated were lower in the most conserved environment, including forearm size, which is directly related to flight and differed significantly between environments with different states of conservation. In recent decades, large and medium-sized trees have been cut down in the less conserved environments, resulting in fewer obstacles for bats during flight. This situation is thought to lead to selective pressure for bats with smaller wings in the more preserved environment, which implies greater flight manoeuvrability. The observation that the state of conservation of forest fragments affects morphometrics further underscores the importance of conservation measures in highly impacted biomes. © 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde",Bats; Discriminant analysis; Forest fragmentation; Principal component analysis; Wing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043569924

Worldwide, artisanal mining is responsible for one third of all mercury released into the environment. By testing bat hair from museum specimens and field collected samples from areas both impacted and unimpacted by artisanal gold mining in Perú we show monomethylmercury (MMHg) has increased in the last 100 years. MMHg concentrations were also greatest in the highest bat trophic level (insectivores), and in areas experiencing extractive artisanal mining. Reproductive female bats had higher MMHg concentrations, and both juvenile and adult bats from mercury contaminated sites had more MMHg than those from uncontaminated sites. Bats have important ecological functions, providing vital ecosystem services such as pollination, seed dispersal, and insect control. Natural populations can act as environmental sentinels and offer the chance to expand our understanding of, and responses to, environmental and human health concerns. Monomethylmercury (MMHg) has increased over the last 100 years with greatest concentrations in highest trophic level of bats, as shown by museum specimens and field collected hair samples, with implications for ecosystem health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Forest disturbance; Madre de Dios River; Mammals; Mercury; Perúvian Amazon,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042335251

An elite maize inbred line Yu816 was selected for evaluation of its senescence mechanism. Phenotypic and chlorophyll content analysis revealed that the onset of leaf senescence occurred earlier in non-pollinated (NONPOL) leaves than pollinated (POL) leaves. Leaf protein species of NONPOL and POL leaves were separately extracted and their proteomes were assessed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis. A total of 4371 protein species were identified, of which 809 exhibited differentially altered abundance (P < 0.05). The identified protein species were related to diverse functions including photosystems, plant hormones, cell death, oxidative degradation, and protein metabolism, suggesting a potential signaling cascade for ear leaf senescence induced by pollination prevention. In addition, leaf total soluble sugar and leaf starch contents were remarkably higher in NONPOL plants than in POL plants. These findings suggest that induced leaf senescence might be associated with nutrient remobilization. Our results reveal a network of molecular mechanisms at the protein level and provide some insights into the early senescence mechanism in higher plants. Biological significance: The coordination between growth and timing for senescence is critical for maize production. However, the molecular mechanism of induced leaf senescence by preventing pollination in maize remains to be further elucidated at the proteomic level. Herein, we revealed some new protein species that are involved in hormone signaling, glycometabolism, oxidation-reduction, protein degradation and photosystem breakdown, and other biological processes that were not previously known to be associated with leaf senescence. This is the first large-scale proteomics study to examine induced leaf senescence in maize by preventing pollination. © 2018",iTRAQ; Leaf senescence; Maize; Pollination prevention; Sugar metabolism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042489696

Animal pollination can enhance yields and increase fruit quality, but the effects of insect pollination on pre- and post-harvest fruit physiology and quality are largely unknown. For the first time, we analysed in much detail the physiological responses of fruit development and marketable quality improvements to different pollination treatments such as self-pollination, open-pollination and hand-pollination. In strawberries, self-pollination led to reduced seed set (fertilized achenes), reduced concentration of the phytohormone auxin, highest share of deformed fruits (>90%), smallest and lightest fruits, considerably lower commercial value (8% of the value of open- or hand-pollinated fruits), and reduced shelf life of fruits. Overall, insect pollination increased the average commercial value of marketable fruits by 92%. The commercial value of hand-pollinated and open-pollinated strawberries did not differ. We conclude that pollination services are not merely important for yield, but also vital for physiological processes that result in better marketable quality (e.g. fruit appearance, flavour-enhancing constituents, prolonged shelf life) and commercial value of many pollinator-dependent crops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Commercial value; Fruit development; Fruit ripening; Phytohormones; Quality; Shelf life; Strawberry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042773916

A laboratory assay was performed to examine the effect of an artificial nectar diet laced with thiamethoxam or clothianidin on survival, fecundity and mobility of Coleomegilla maculata (De Geer [Coleoptera: Coccinellidae]). Seed-treated fields had significantly fewer above-ground natural enemies and pollinators than untreated fields, while subterranean predators were unaffected.

Foraging preferences of pollinators together with plant species availability shape the web of interactions at the local scale. In this study, we focused on the bee pollinator community of a population of the rare protected perennial herb Dictamnus albus, with the aim to characterise the pollen preferences and the foraging niche overlap among species through time. Bees were sampled during four consecutive years in a natural population of D. albus, throughout the blooming period of the plant species. We performed an analysis of insect pollen loads to investigate the interactions with the study species and the co-flowering plants in the area, and to evaluate the degree of foraging overlap among pollinators. Over the study years, all bee species showed a high fidelity to D. albus (6080%), even if some taxa preferentially collected pollen from other flowering species. The foraging niche overlap in the pollinator community decreased together with an increased diversity of co-flowering plant species. The results obtained indicate that bees preferentially forage on D. albus in the studied area, but that co-flowering species contribute to complement their diet and likely reduce competition for foraging resources. It appears therefore important to maintain a high diversity of co-flowering plants to preserve the diversity in the studied pollinator community of D. albus. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bees; Conservation; Dictamnus albus; Entomopalynology; Pollinators; Resource use,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033404537

Helicodiceros muscivorus is a species that emits an odor mimicking the foul smell of rotting meat and thereby attracts blowflies that usually oviposit on carcasses but are deceived into pollinating the plant. Thus, H. muscivorus is a striking case of pollination by brood-site deception. The Balearic lizard, Podarcis lilfordi, exhibits remarkable interactions with dead horse arum. Balearic lizards, which sometimes forage on carcasses, are attracted to blooming dead horse arum. We showed experimentally that P. lilfordi can detect chemical cues from carcasses on cotton swabs and exhibits elevated tongue-flick rates to carcass chemical cues compared to control stimuli. Lizards also detected and located hidden carcasses using only airborne chemical cues. The responses of lizards to chemical cues from the spadix of blooming dead horse arum were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those to carcass odors. Therefore, the decay-like odor that attracts blowflies for the plant's benefit also attracts lizards. This attraction may initially have been somewhat favorable for lizards that eat blowflies, but slightly unfavorable for plants because the lizards ate some pollinators. We suggest that lizards attracted by odor may have learned later to use the plant for thermoregulation and then consume its fruits, making the association more positive for lizards and benefitted arum by seed dispersal. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",behavior; deceptive mimicry; Lacertidae; olfaction; Podarcis lilfordi; vomerolfaction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043511630

Indirect selection mediated via biotic and abiotic stresses could maintain flower color variation in these systems. The selfing forb, Boechera stricta, typically displays white flowers, but some individuals produce purple flowers. We quantified environmental correlates of flower color in natural populations. To disentangle plasticity from genotypic variation, we performed a multiyear field experiment in five gardens. In controlled conditions, we evaluated herbivore preferences and the effects of drought stress and soil pH on flower color expression. In natural populations, purple-flowered individuals experienced lower foliar herbivory than did their white-flowered counterparts. This pattern also held in the common gardens. Additionally, low-elevation environments induced pigmented flowers (plasticity), and the likelihood of floral pigmentation decreased with source elevation of maternal families (genetic cline). Viability selection favored families with pigmented flowers. In the laboratory, herbivores exerted greater damage on tissue derived from white- vs purple-flowered individuals. Furthermore, drought induced pigmentation in white-flowered lineages, and white-flowered plants had a fecundity advantage in the well-watered control.

The localization of gnawing marks on the petals and the histochemistry of the nutritious tissues are emphasized. In some species, nutritious tissue is apparently distributed among all petals, while in other species it is more or less diffusely localized. There are also cases in which nutritious tissue occurs only on clearly localized regions of the inner petals. Petals of selected Amazon species were stained, and studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. The nutritious tissue consists of cells with mucilage-rich walls, which contain starch, lipids and/or tannins.

The LOD of all sugars were 57 mg L?1 and the LOQ were 1719 mg L?1. Field samples were stable for min. 7 weeks at ?18 °C. The technique was applied to two species of Platanthera (Orchidaceae) in order to test whether species-related differences in sugar composition could be observed.

Numerous studies do consider the impacts of robbing on pollinator visitation to robbed plants, but rarely do they focus on its scaled-up impacts on individual pollinator behavior. We used radio telemetry to track the spatial and behavioral responses of the territorial hummingbird Aglaeactis cupripennis to experimental nectar robbing over a period of several days. Simulated nectar robbing impacted foraging behavior by increasing territory area, distance flown, and reliance on novel food resources, especially small-bodied flying insects. We did not observe any impact on the amount of time individuals spent foraging, nor did we observe territory abandonment. These findings indicate that nectar robbing may impose a significant energetic cost on pollinators via increased flight distances and shifts towards potentially less profitable food resources, and demonstrate the importance of quantifying the indirect effects of nectar robbing on pollinators in addition to plants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Diet; Indirect effects; Movement; Plant-animal mutualism; Plasticity; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042671576

Ants are attracted by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), situated near flowers, and may interfere with the efficiency and behaviour of pollinators. We tested the hypothesis that the impacts of antpollinator interactions in plantpollinator systems are dependent on (1) the seasonal activity of EFNs, which increase ant abundance closer to flowers; (2) consequently, an ant effect, where ants decrease the temporal niche overlap of bees due to predator avoidance; and (3) ant density, where higher densities may negatively affect plantpollinator interactions and plant performance. We studied two antplantpollinator systems based on Banisteriopsis campestris and Banisteriopsis malifolia plant species. The periods of high ant abundance coincided with plant species blooming. The presence of ants around flowers reduced the visitation rates of the smaller bees and the temporal niche overlap between bee species was not higher than randomly expected when ants had free access. Additionally, we observed variable ant effects on fruit set and duration of bee visits to both Malpighiaceae species when ant density was experimentally kept constant on branches, especially on B. campestris. Our goal was to show the dual role of ant density effects, especially because the different outcomes are not commonly observed in the same plant species. We believe that reduced temporal niche overlap between floral visitors due to ant presence provides an opportunity for smaller bees to improve compatible pollination behaviour. Additionally, we concluded that ant density had variable effects on floral visitor behaviours and plant reproductive performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ant effects; Antplant mutualism; Bee foraging; Centridini; Niche overlap; Small bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031906131

The intense plant odour of Elsholtzia rugulosa (Lamiaceae) to humans may be attributed to the presence of high concentrations of ?-caryophyllene. In a previous study, Zhang, Yang, and Zhang (Scientific Reports, 6, 2016a, 276161) speculated that the presence of ?-caryophyllene attracts pollinators (e.g., honey bees) to its flowers, an assumption that was assessed through the exploration of the functional significance of specific floral volatile compounds and the evaluation of their effects on the behaviour of Apis cerana (Asian honey bees; a known pollinator) and two non-pollinators, a hornet (Vespa velutina) and a bumblebee (Bombus sp.). The results from these behavioural experiments indicated that both ?-caryophyllene and ?-elemene (both naturally found in flowers of E. rugulosa) were individually attractive to the Asian honey bees. Moreover, the combination of the two was more effective than either of them separately. In contrast, neither compound, nor a blend of the two at different concentrations, was attractive to the hornet and bumblebee species. These results demonstrate that ?-caryophyllene and ?-elemene play a key signalling role in attracting Asian honey bees to E. rugulosa. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",bee pollination; chemical communication; Elsholtzia rugulosa; flower; olfactory signal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043701357

L. Rob. is federally threatened and little is known about its pollination biology. At the Redstone Arsenal population, Alabama, we studied its breeding system, determined major floral visitors and their pollination effectiveness, and explored pollen limitation of fruit and seed production. Fruit initiation was low (3.9%) for cross-pollinated flowers but only marginally greater than for self-pollinated or nonpollinated flowers (none initiated a fruit). Most floral visits (97%) were by bees with 43% of visits by large bees (> 1.5 cm in length) and 51% by medium bees (1-1.5 cm in length). Keel petals of A. priceana flowers enclose the style and stamens: flowers must be ""tripped"" for pollination to occur. Large and medium bees were equally effective in tripping flowers, whereas small bees (< 1 cm in length) did not trip flowers. Success of large and medium bee species (several Bombus species and Megachile sculpturalis Smith) in initiating legumes after a single floral visit ranged from 17-35% but did not differ significantly among species. Pollen supplementation showed legume production was pollen-limited: 24% of supplemented flowers produced fruits versus 6% of nonsupplemented flowers. Seed counts revealed a marginally nonsignificant trend for more seeds in legumes from pollen-supplemented flowers. We conclude that this rare plant species is dependent on medium and large bees for pollination, and that reproduction is partially pollen-limited. Conservation efforts should include measures to protect bee pollinators of this species to ensure that managed populations of this rare plant continue to reproduce sexually. © Copyright 2018 by The Torrey Botanical Society.",Bombus; conservation; keel flower; Megachile; pollen limitation; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043227775

They use multiple host species, but are regularly found in abundance on only some, with the red-flowered Malvaviscus arboreus the primary host in South-East Queensland. Flower-feeding insects commonly use plant odours and colour to recognise their usual hosts, so we quantified the attraction of flying thrips, in the field, to M. arboreus flowers relative to those of a secondary host (Hibiscus rosasinensis). More than two-thirds of the thrips were attracted to H. rosasinensis flowers over those of M. arboreus in a field test. We also compared flowers of these species in a cage, where significantly more thrips approached H. rosasinensis flowers than M. arboreus ones, and in an olfactometer, where significantly more approached the blank than flowers and leaves of either species. Thrips also avoided flower extracts in small arena-based studies. These thrips are clearly, but unexpectedly, more likely to approach the non-ancestral secondary host H. rosasinensis than their primary host plant M. arboreus (with which they presumably evolved), and are repelled by leaf and flower odours of both species. We propose that F. schultzei uses mainly vision in host recognition, and the hummingbird-pollinated M. arboreus has evolved insect-repellent properties.

This region of the fly tree includes 25 000 described extant species with diverse ecological roles such as blood-feeding (haematophagy), parasitoidism, predation, pollination and wood-feeding (xylophagy). Early diverging brachyceran lineages were once considered a monophyletic group of families called Orthorrhapha, based on the shared character of a longitudinal break in the pupal skin made during the emergence of the adult. Yet other morphological and molecular evidence generally supports a paraphyletic arrangement of Orthorrhapha, with strong support for one orthorrhaphan lineage  dance flies and relatives  as the closest relative to all higher flies (Cyclorrhapha), together called Eremoneura. In order to establish a comprehensive estimate of the relationships among orthorrhaphan lineages using a thorough sample of publicly available data, we compiled and analysed a dataset including 1217 taxa representing major lineages and 20 molecular markers. Our analyses suggest that Orthorrhapha excluding Eremoneura is not monophyletic; instead, we recover two main lineages of early brachyceran flies: Homeodactyla and Heterodactyla. Homeodactyla includes Nemestrinoidea (uniting two parasitic families Acroceridae + Nemestrinidae) as the closest relatives to the large SXT clade, comprising Stratiomyomorpha, Xylophagidae and Tabanomorpha. Heterodactyla includes Bombyliidae with a monophyletic Asiloidea (exclusive of Bombyliidae) as the closest relatives to Eremoneura. Reducing missing data, modifying the distribution of genes across taxa, and, in particular, removing rogue taxa significantly improved tree resolution and statistical support.

Plant-derived floral food resources (i.e. nectar and pollen) may be rapidly changing in space and time and pollinators may need to quickly switch to new resources. Butterflies are suitable model organisms to investigate foraging behaviour of insect pollinators, because they can be easily monitored under natural conditions. We studied flower visitation patterns in the Clouded Apollo butterfly Parnassius mnemosyne in relation to the abundance of available floral resources. We recorded flower visitation daily in individually marked butterflies, listed flowering species and estimated flower abundance categories every 3 days in a single meadow, during five consecutive flight periods. Butterflies visited 35 nectar plants from the 71 species available. Few nectar plants were frequently visited (visit ratios for the annually most visited species: 3760%), many were scarcely visited and no visits were observed on several abundant species. Flower abundance and visit ratio varied among years and within flight periods. The number of visits increased with flower abundance in the seven most frequently visited plant species, but not in the occasionally visited ones. Beside their choosiness, Parnassius mnemosyne butterflies were able to adjust foraging behaviour to rapidly changing resource distributions. Diet selectivity in adults might increase the vulnerability of this species. However, visitation plasticity may mitigate the effect of the lack of some nectar plants, as complementary resources can be used as alternatives. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Clouded Apollo; Foraging behaviour; Lepidoptera; Nectar plant; Parnassius mnemosyne; Resource selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035815705

Our study objectives were to examine ES valuations by Rouge National Urban Park (NUP) users as well as perceptions of the impact of the invasive vine Vincetoxicum rossicum. Further, we sought to determine how those valuations and perceptions are affected by ecological engagement (EE). We conducted a social survey of Rouge NUP users and found that valuation of most ESs was significantly greater for EE users. Interestingly, non-EE users tended to give recreation (cultural ES) the highest importance value. Conversely, EE users tended to assign pollination ('supporting ES), the highest importance. Further, we were surprised to find that 15.2% of EE and 38.4% of non-EE users disagreed or were neutral to the notion that V. rossicum is negatively impacting the Park's supporting ESs. Similarly, 32% of EE and 54.1% of non-EE users disagreed or were neutral to the notion that V. rossicum is negatively impacting the Park's aesthetic ESs. We conclude that examination of EE can reveal differential ES valuations and perceptions of invasion impact.

Petunia secreta is a rare annual endemic species of Pedra do Segredo, located in the municipality of Caçapava do Sul, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Although rare, the species possesses a high level of genetic variability. We investigated the reproductive system of P. secreta, including fruit production and seed germinability, in order to determine if its reproductive system can explain its genetic diversity. We sampled five populations and conducted five greenhouse hand-pollination treatments: 1) autonomous apomixis; 2) self-pollination; 3) hand self-pollination; 4) geitonogamy; and 5) cross-pollination. We analysed a total of 40 plants, 468 flowers, and 6,500 seeds. Only autonomous apomixis and self-pollination did not produce fruit. No differences in fruit weight were observed among pollination treatments (P > 0.05). Seeds of two colours were produced, with no differences in germinability. Considering all plants, populations, and treatments, the average germinability was 73 % (range 9 % to 100 %). These results, along with other previous studies, indicate that the reproductive systems of P. secreta, and its large effective population size, can explain its high genetic diversity. © 2018, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

Cholinergic pesticides and their extensive use have been correlated to the decline of pollinators and there is evidence that pesticides act as neuroendocrine disruptors affecting the metabolism of neuropeptides. However, there is a big absence of studies with quantitative results correlating the effect of pesticide exposure with changes on neuropeptides insects, and most of them are conducted under laboratory conditions, typically with individual active ingredients. In this study, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate pesticide effects on honey bees through the analysis of (neuro)peptides. The workflow consists of a rapid extraction method and liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole for preselected neuropeptides. For non-target analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry, multivariate analysis and automatic identification of discriminated peptides using a specific software and protein sequence databases. The analytical method was applied to the analysis of target and non-target (neuro)peptides in honey bees with low and high content of a wide range of pesticides to which have been exposed in field conditions. Our findings show that the identification frequency of target neuropeptides decreases significantly in honey bees with high concentration of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ? 500 ?g kg?1) in comparison with the honey bees with low content of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ? 20 ?g kg?1). Moreover, the principal component analysis in non-target search shows a clear distinction between peptide concentration in honey bees with high level of pesticides and honey bees with low level. The use of high resolution mass spectrometry has allowed the identification of 25 non-redundant peptides responsible for discrimination between the two groups, derived from 18 precursor proteins. It has been shown a correlation between pesticide exposure and a decrease of some neuropeptides and other head peptides in honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Field conditions; High resolution mass spectrometry; Honey bees; Neuropeptides; Pesticides,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041685050

The sustainability and the multiple benefits derived from these complex social-ecological systems is increasingly threatened by weed invasion, extreme disturbance, urban development, and the impacts of a rapidly changing and increasingly variable climate. California's grasslands, oak savannas, and oak woodlands are among the most invaded ecosystems in the world. Weed eradication efforts are rarely combined with seeding on these landscapes despite support for the inclusion of the practice in a weed management program. Depending on seed mix choice, cost and long-term uncertainty, especially for native seed, is an impediment to adoption by land managers. We investigated four seeding mixes (forage annual, native perennial, exotic perennial, and exotic-native perennial) to evaluate how these treatments resist reinvasion and support the delivery of simultaneous multiple ecosystem services (invasion resistance, native richness, nitrogen fixing plants, pollinator food sources, plant community diversity, forage quality, and productivity). We found the increase of exotic and native perennial cover will drive resistance to an invading weedy summer flowering forb Centaurea solstitialis but provides a mixed response to resisting invasive annual grasses. The resistance to invasion is coupled with little tradeoff in forage productivity and quality and gains in plant diversity and native cover. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Aegilops cylindrica; Centaurea solstitialis; Ecosystem services; Grassland restoration; Invasion resistance; Range seeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041657820

Loss of pollinators in particular has major implications, with extirpation of these species potentially leading to severe losses in agriculture and, thus, economic losses. In this study, we forecast the effects of climate change on the distribution of hoverflies in Southeast Europe using species distribution modelling and climate change scenarios for two time-periods. For 20412060, 19 analysed species were predicted to increase their areas of occupancy, with the other 25 losing some of their ranges. For 20612080, 55% of species were predicted to increase their area of occupancy, while 45% were predicted to experience range decline. In general, range size changes for most species were below 20%, indicating a relatively high resilience of hoverflies to climate change when only environmental variables are considered. Additionally, range-restricted species are not predicted to lose more area proportionally to widespread species. Based on our results, two distributional trends can be established: the predicted gain of species in alpine regions, and future loss of species from lowland areas. Considering that the loss of pollinators from present lowland agricultural areas is predicted and that habitat degradation presents a threat to possible range expansion of hoverflies in the future, developing conservation management strategy for the preservation of these species is crucial. This study represents an important step towards the assessment of the effects of climate changes on hoverflies and can be a valuable asset in creating future conservation plan, thus helping in mitigating potential consequences. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Conservation; Endemism; Global warming; Insects; Species distribution modelling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038003470

It has proved to be an efficient algorithm as it has been successfully applied to solve a large number of problems of different areas. CS employs Lévy flights to generate step size and to search the solution space effectively. The local search is carried out using switch probability in which certain percentages of solutions are removed. Though CS is an effective algorithm, still its performance can be improved by incorporating the exploration and exploitation during the search process. In this work, three modified versions of CS are proposed to improve the properties of exploration and exploitation. All these versions employ Cauchy operator to generate the step size instead of Lévy flights to efficiently explore the search space. Moreover, two new concepts, division of population and division of generations, are also introduced in CS so as to balance the exploration and exploitation. The proposed versions of CS are tested on 24 standard benchmark problems with different dimension sizes and varying population sizes and the effect of probability switch has been studied. Apart from this, the best of the proposed versions is also tested on CEC 2015 benchmark suite. The modified algorithms have been statistically tested in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely grey wolf optimization (GWO), differential evolution (DE), firefly algorithm (FA), flower pollination algorithm (FPA) and bat algorithm (BA).

Parasitism can be an important source of mortality for insect populations; however, we know little about the factors influencing vulnerability of wild bees to parasites. Mason bees (genus Osmia; Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) are important pollinators of crops and wild plants and are vulnerable to attack by brood parasites. High nest densities may increase rates of brood parasitism by attracting disproportionate numbers of parasites. 2. Three years of field observations from multiple sites were analysed to assess whether mason bee brood parasitism increased with host density. Mason bees were allowed to nest in artificial nesting blocks and establish natural variation in nesting density. Nest cells constructed by bees were checked for the presence of parasite eggs. 3. Parasitism of nest cells strongly increased with the number of actively nesting bees at a nesting block. Mason bees showed no preference for nesting in blocks that were occupied or unoccupied by other mason bees. Parasitism also increased with the number of days a nest was provisioned and decreased over the course of the season. Nest cells constructed last in a nest were significantly more parasitised than inner cells, despite being sealed against invasions. 4. These findings show positively density-dependent parasitism in mason bees. They also suggest that bees terminate parasitised nests, causing parasitised cells to become outermost nest cells  a behaviour that may represent a defence against parasites. Our results have implications for the management of mason bees as agricultural pollinators, as cultivating them at high densities could reduce offspring survival. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",Cleptoparasites; density dependence; native bees; population ecology; Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032785331

Air sampling was performed by means of 7-day recording volumetric pollen and spore traps, and pollen grains were counted with the aid of a light microscope, according to the methodology proposed by the Spanish Aerobiology Network. Pollen data were expressed as number of pollen grains per cubic metre of air. A peak in Quercus pollen production approximately every four years was detected, coinciding with drought periods. Although the natural vegetation of the studied area has been altered by urban growth and reforestation with pines, it is still represented by a disperse natural population of cork oak, holm oak and kermes oak (predominantly located to the northwest and northeast of the city). In this period the seasonal behaviour of anemophilous pollination of Quercus was studied, along with the relation between its intensity (pollen production) or temporality (phenophase of flowering) and meteorological or climatic variables. Also a study of trends in production and phenology of flowering was carried out. The annual intensity of anemophilous pollination of Quercus was significantly associated with the meteorological conditions of each spring, with the same parameters involved and in the same way as were seen on the daily and weekly scale (positive correlation with temperature and insolation, and negative with precipitation and relative humidity). The tendency for temperature and atmospheric aridity to increase is probably the cause of the trend observed in the spring Quercus pollen production to increase in the western Mediterranean. The temporality of Quercus anemophilous pollination (start date, peak date, end date and duration) changes each year and is positively associated with accumulated temperature and sun hours from 1st January until the dates in question. An accumulation of approximately 796 °C above the 9 °C threshold temperature from 1st January is necessary to trigger the start of the flowering period. We conclude that the effect of climatic change is mainly reflected in the pollination intensity of woody anemophilous species, which, in turn, have adapted their flowering time (phenology) to climate change. It is important to remember that climate change is leading to more arid conditions and that Mediterranean plants are adapted to this macrobioclimate (Mediterranean), which is characterized by a long dry period and high temperatures. © 2017",Adaptation; Aerobiology; Climate change; Correlations; Mediterranean basin; Meteorology; Phenology; Pollen; Quercus; Trends,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043369794

Respondents generally had some knowledge of monarchs but were unaware of monarch population declines and the necessity of milkweed to their life cycle. Respondent knowledge was correlated with more positive attitudes about butterfly conservation. Furthermore, membership in an environmental organization increased the likelihood that the participant had prior knowledge of monarchs and cared about monarch conservation. Respondent socioeconomic factors of age and sex were also significantly correlated with conservation attitudes-older and female participants had more positive attitudes towards general butterfly conservation. Interestingly, females were also less likely than males to admit having prior knowledge of monarchs, indicating that gender may also play an important role in conservation outreach efforts.

Using a mathematical model, we study how adaptations of pollinator preferences influence population dynamics of a two-planttwo-pollinator community interaction module. Adaptation leads to coexistence between generalist and specialist pollinators, and produces complex plant population dynamics, involving alternative stable states and discrete transitions in the plant community. Pollinator adaptation also leads to plantplant apparent facilitation that is mediated by changes in pollinator preferences. We show that adaptive pollinator behavior reduces niche overlap and leads to coexistence by specialization on different plants.

Invasive species often have a distinct timeline and well-recorded population expansion. As invaders encounter new environments, they undergo rapid adaptive evolution. Our aim in this study was to measure variation of floral size in the invasive shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and measure natural selection by pollinators on that trait. Past research has found that this invasive plant is pollinator limited in Washington State and that declines in pollinator populations can contribute to local extinction in another invaded range (New Zealand). This plant is pollinated by both native and introduced species of bees, representing a broad range of pollinator sizes. Cytisus scoparius has a flower structure that is highly conducive to studies on pollinator choice, even in the absence of direct pollinator observations. Methods We surveyed urban and rural sites in and around the city of Olympia in Washington State. Measuring banner width, we were able to show that flower size varies substantially between plants but minimally within plants. By measuring the proportion of flowers that were 'tripped', we could determine pollinator visitation rates and thus determine the level of selection due to pollinator choice alone. Important Findings We found that C. scoparius is under natural selection by pollinators for increased flower size. However, such positive natural selection was only seen in urban populations although it was consistent across two flowering seasons. Rural populations of Scotch broom do not appear to be under selection on flower size. The natural selection by pollinators on broom flowers could result in adaptive evolution into a new pollination niche by an invading species. A higher level of variation in broom flowers seen here than seen in previous works in native regions suggests that C. scoparius may be highly diverse and primed for adaptive evolution. © The Author(s) 2017.",evolution; flower; invasive; pollinator; selection,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043704092

Using a quasi-experimental design, we investigated the effectiveness of two educational approaches: one by authentically encountering living animals at a beehive, the other by using a remote online beehive. We monitored secondary school students (N = 354) perception of bees with respect to interest, danger and conservation as well as situational emotions (interest, well-being, boredom) during both interventions. In both cases positive effects on perception levels were observed, even when already a high willingness to protect bees existed. Using living animals in educational settings is crucial, especially when students situational emotions need targeting. However, we achieved similar intervention results in perception levels using a remote beehive, which therefore constitutes an excellent alternative to raise awareness of the conservation of bees as pollinators when working with living organisms is not possible. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",eLearning; honeybees; living animals; perceived danger; situational emotions; student-centred,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010693185

The flowers are actinomorphic and structurally bisexual with a single whorl of five fleshy tepals, a single whorl of five stamens and a single whorl of five carpels. Tepals, stamens and carpels are opposite, arranged on the same radii and tepals are involute at the base clasping the stamens. Stamens have a massive filament that grades without a joint into the anther. The anthers are dithecate and tetrasporangiate with extensive connective tissue between the tiny pollen sacs. Pollen grains are pantoporate and spiny. The carpels are free, apparently plicate, with many ovules borne in two rows along the ventral margins. Paisia pantoporata is the oldest known flower with pantoporate pollen. Similar pantoporate pollen was also recognised in the associated dispersed palynoflora. Paisia is interpreted as a possibly insect pollinated, herbaceous plant with low pollen production and low dispersal potential of the pollen. The systematic position of Paisia is uncertain and Paisia pantoporata most likely belongs to an extinct lineage. Pantoporate pollen occurs scattered among all major groups of angiosperms and a close match to the fossils has not been identified. The pentamerous floral organisation together with structure of stamen, pollen and carpel suggests a phylogenetic position close to the early diverging eudicot lineages, probably in the Ranunculales. © 2017 The Author(s).

We constructed a high-resolution topoclimatic model of spring and summer temperatures across a 152 km2 restoration area on the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia, and used it to project energetic expenditure and habitat suitability estimates for four major hymenopteran pollinators. For all species, the most heavily modified landscapes were the least suitable, but only for one species, Zapsilothynnus nigripes, was there evidence that the upper thermal tolerance threshold was exceeded broadly. However, at the higher environmental temperatures that we modeled, some species would need to forage up to 10 times their own body mass every hour to meet their energetic requirements. It seems unlikely that the nutritional requirements of most insect pollinators operating at these higher metabolic rates could be met in an impoverished restoration ecosystem, although resource availability remains to be quantified in these habitats. Hence, to increase the likelihood of restoration success by restoring insect pollination networks, nutritional resources may need to be increased during restoration. Accounting for the way that thermoenergetic requirements shape ecological interactions better positions management trajectories aimed at restoring and maintaining key insect pollinators in novel ecosystems. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration",Banksia woodland; ecological energetics; ecological restoration; fragmentation; Hymenoptera; landscape connectivity; pollination; species distribution modeling; topoclimatic modeling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028928916

As these insects support crop production, many practical efforts aim to sustain pollinator diversity which is especially challenging in intensively managed and homogeneous farmland. However, there are ongoing changes of the farmland toward its multifunctionality that includes, for example, wind farm development. Windmills are often built within crops; thus, we examined if the noncropped area around windmills can be valuable habitats for wild plants and pollinating insects: bees, butterflies, and flies. Species richness, abundances, and species diversity index of plants and pollinators around windmills were similar to those found in grassland patches (a typical habitat for these insects) and higher than in the adjacent crops. Pollinator diversity index and species richness at windmills increased with the distance to the nearest grassland patch and windmill. The population sizes of pollinating insects were also positively associated with plant diversity. Particular groups of pollinators showed specific habitat associations: bees occurred mostly at windmills, butterflies were highly associated with grasslands, while flies occurred in a similar number at windmill and on grasslands. Since windmills are frequently built within extensive homogeneous fields, thus, they introduce pollination services into the interior of cropped areas, contrary to field margins, road verges, or seminatural grasslands. Thus, although the development of wind farms has various negative environmental consequences, they can be alleviated by the increase of the local population size and diversity of wild plants and pollinating insects at windmills. © 2017, The Author(s).",Agricultural landscape; Biodiversity; Marginal habitat; Pollinator decline; Weed; Wind farm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038083687

The plants studied revealed a consistent pattern of asynchronous stamen and pollen development as well as a series of predictable changes in style and stigma orientation. Initially, styles and stigmas of pistillate flowers maintain a near-axial (erect) position. Later, when still enclosed by subtending cyathophylls, styles reflex, placing stigmas near early developing anthers shedding pollen. Pollen grains observed on stigmas at this stage indicate cleistogamous pollination. Eventually, paired cyathophylls diverge, exposing the cyathium to the external environment; at this stage, styles and stigmas assume an ascendant position as late-maturing anthers shed pollen, a configuration conducive to chasmogamous pollination.

As a relatively new branch, atomic potential matching (APM) model is inspired by potential field attractions. Compared to the conventional edge potential function (EPF) model, APM has been verified to be less sensitive to intricate backgrounds in the test image and far more cost-effective in the computation process. The optimization process of shape matching can be regarded as a numerical optimization problem, which is disposed by flower pollination algorithm (FPA). This study comprehensively investigates the convergence performances of FPA and the other algorithms in shape matching problem based on APM model.

However, the effect of Bt cotton on many insects is currently virtually unknown. The plant bug Adelphocoris suturalis is now a major pest of cotton in southern China and the beetle Haptoncus luteolus is one of the most ancient cotton pollinators. We conducted laboratory experiments to evaluate the toxicity of the Bt cotton varieties ZMSJ, which expresses the toxins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, and ZMKCKC, which expresses Cry1Ac and EPSPS, on adult A. suturalis and H. luteolus. No significant increase in the mortality of either species was detected after feeding on Bt cotton leaves or pollen for 7 days. Trace amounts of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab proteins could be detected in both species but in vitro binding experiments found no evidence of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab binding proteins. These results demonstrate that feeding on the leaves or pollen of these two Bt cotton varieties has no toxic effects on adult A. suturalis or H. luteolus.

For a distylous system to function effectively, the presence of suitable pollinators that transfer pollen from the two morphs (a short-styled S-morph and a long-styled L-morph) on separate locations of their body is required. In this study, we surveyed pollinator communities visiting flowers of the distylous Primula veris in two different natural habitats (grassland and forest). Previous research has shown differences in the positioning of the anthers and stigmas between flowers of forest and grassland populations, possibly impacting on patterns of pollen transfer and seed set. To test this hypothesis, we measured anther-stigma separation in the two habitats, assessed pollen uptake on the head and proboscis of each of the pollinator species observed, and compared stigmatic pollen deposition and subsequent seed set between shortstyled and long-styled flowers of P. veris. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the ratio of pollen morph uptake by pollinators is related to the length of their proboscis and to differences in floral morphology and that this in turn is related to the efficiency with which legitimate pollen is deposited on S- and L-morph stigmas. The forest and grassland P. veris populations contained distinct pollinator communities. Pollen from L-morph flowers was more abundantly deposited on the proboscis than on the head of the pollinator, whereas the opposite was observed for pollen of short-styled flowers. Tongue length seemed to be a determining characteristic for the predisposition of a pollinator for pollen uptake of a certain pollen morph on the proboscis or head. Proboscis length was positively correlated with proportional uptake of pollen of long-styled flowers, but negatively correlated with the uptake of pollen of short-styled flowers on the head. Long-styled stigmas captured more pollen grains in total, but short-styled stigmas contained proportionally more legitimate pollen. Pollen proficiencies were higher in the grassland habitat, but seed set did not significantly differ between habitats. Overall, these results suggest that that long- and short-tongued insects complement each other in the legitimate pollination of a distylous plant species and that differences in floral morphology do not impact on reproductive success. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.",Distyly; Long-tongued pollinator; Mating systems; Pollination; Pollinator efficiency; Primula,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043340728

Here, we demonstrate the unsurpassed utility of OP testing after shifting the analytical mode from pedigree- (ABLUP) to genomic-based (GBLUP) relationship using phenotypic tree height (HT) and wood density (WD) and genotypic (30k SNPs) data for 1126 38-year-old Interior spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x P. engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) trees, representing 25 OP families, growing on three sites in Interior British Columbia, Canada. The use of the genomic realized relationship permitted genetic variance decomposition to additive, dominance, and epistatic genetic variances, and their interactions with the environment, producing more accurate narrow-sense heritability and breeding value estimates as compared to the pedigree-based counterpart. The impact of retaining (random folding) vs. removing (family folding) genetic similarity between the training and validation populations on the predictive accuracy of genomic selection was illustrated and highlighted the former caveats and latter advantages. Moreover, GBLUP models allowed breeding value prediction for individuals from families that were not included in the developed models, which was not possible with the ABLUP. Response to selection differences between the ABLUP and GBLUP models indicated the presence of systematic genetic gain overestimation of 35 and 63% for HT and WD, respectively, mainly caused by the inflated estimates of additive genetic variance and individuals breeding values given by the ABLUP models. Extending the OP genomic-based models from single to multisite made the analysis applicable to existing OP testing programs. © 2018, The Author(s).",Genetic variance decomposition; Interior spruce; Multienvironment; Open-pollinated families; Pedigree- and marker-based relationships,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042228609

Consequently, the emergence and maintenance of selected floral attributes related to pollinator attraction and rewarding are driven by pollinator pressure. In this paper we explore the effect of pollinators, rainfall, temperature and air humidity on the reproduction of a Brazilian terrestrial orchid, Cranichis candida based on data of phenology, flower resources, olfactory and visual attraction cues, pollinators and breeding system. The flowers of C. candida are strongly protandrous and pollinated by workers of the social native bee Tetragonisca angustula. The bees collect labellar lipoidal substances (wax scales), which are transported to the nest. The lipoidal substance is composed of sterols, hydrocarbons and terpenes. The last presumably protects the bees and their nests against pathogens and other arthropods. C. candida sets fruits through biotic self- and cross-pollination, and spontaneously due the action of raindrops on flowers. Our results indicate that in C. candida, although rain-mediated spontaneous self-pollination happens, fructification mediated by biotic pollinations also occurs, which may result in fruit set by cross-pollination. A mixed pollination system must result in higher genetic variability when compared to species whose fruits are produced entirely by self-pollination. On the other hand, autogamy is a form of reproductive assurance, and has commonly evolved where pollination services are rare or absent. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Flower resource; Meliponini; Orchidaceae; pollination; reproductive assurance; reproductive biology; wax,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037992109

Honeydew-producing treehoppers frequently occur on inflorescences, potentially enhancing ant-mediated negative effects on pollination services. However, the effect of ant-attended, honeydew-producing insects on plant reproduction remains uncertain. We recorded the abundance of treehoppers and ants on Byrsonima intermedia (Malpighiaceae), and monitored floral visitors in a Brazilian cerrado savanna. We manipulated the presence of ants and anttreehopper associations on inflorescences to assess their effect on pollination and fruit formation. We used dried ants pinned to inflorescences to evaluate the effect of ant presence and ant identity on potential pollinators. Results show that the presence of treehoppers increases ant abundance on flowers and disrupts pollination by oil-collecting bees, decreasing the frequency and duration of floral visits and reducing fruit and seed set. Treehopper herbivory has no direct effect on fruit or seed production, which are independent of treehopper density. Pinned ants promote avoidance by floral visitors, reducing the number of visits. Ant identity mediates visitation decisions, with Ectatomma brunneum causing greater avoidance by floral visitors than Camponotus rufipes. Field videos show that pollinating bees are harassed by ants near flowers, prompting avoidance behavior by the bees. This is the first demonstration of indirect effects by honeydew-gathering ants, via disrupted pollination, on plant reproduction in tropical cerrado savanna.

Odour is an important pollinator attractant, but visual traits and interactions between visual and scent traits have seldom been considered. We studied pollination of the carrion flowers of Ceropegia mixta [= Orbea variegata], analysed floral traits and used manipulative experiments to explore the contributions of visual and scent traits to pollinator attraction. Flowers were pollinated primarily by Musca domestica (Muscidae), with lesser contributions by Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae flies. The floral odour (analysed using gas chromatographymass spectrometry) was dominated by oligosulphides and phenol. Comparison of floral and abiotic background colours (analysed using reflectance spectrometry) using a fly colour vision model suggested that flowers would be chromatically indistinguishable from the background. Comparison of fly arrival rates at concealed (but still scented) versus exposed flowers showed that flies can locate flowers without visual cues, but visitation was higher when the flowers were visible. Experiments using model flowers with odour supplied by real flowers (to explore the significance of dark flowers and dark spots on a pale background, which both occur frequently in flowers that mimic carrion or faeces) showed that scented black flowers attracted significantly more flies than similarly scented human-yellow flowers, while the presence or size of black spots on the corolla had no effect on the attraction of flies.

However, the contribution of each vector to pollination of ambophilous species can change under different environmental conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the primary pollination system, abiotic or biotic, of R. ciliata, comparing wet and dry seasons. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) in dry months, wind is the main pollen vector of R. ciliata; (2) in wet months, insects will contribute more to the reproductive success of R. ciliata and compensate for low fruit formation by the abiotic vector. Our hypothesis was not confirmed. We found that higher wind speed can favor pollination by wind in R. ciliata even in wetter months. Because insects were less susceptible to environmental variation, they contributed more in dry months when wind speed was low, thus compensating for lower fruit set by wind. High rainfall and humidity can result in faster settling of pollen grains suspended in the air; however, rainfall does not prevent pollination by wind. Since individuals of R. ciliata are located near the edge of the forest, grouped quite close together, and as the inflorescence is located at the apex of the floral scape, wind can act as pollen vector and the inhibiting effects of rainfall can be minimized. The contribution of each pollen vector is important to the reproductive success of R. ciliata and the effectiveness of wind varies with local environmental conditions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Ambophily; Anemophily; Atlantic Forest; Entomophily; Environmental variations; Phenology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041187822

There is increasing appreciation of trait-mediated indirect effects linking multiple interactions. Flowers interact with both pollinators and floral herbivores, and the flower-pollinator interaction may be modified by indirect effects of floral herbivores (i.e., florivores) on flower traits such as flower size attracting pollinators. To explore whether flower size affects the flower-pollinator interaction, we used Eurya japonica flowers. We examined whether artificial florivory decreased fruit and seed production, and also whether flower size affected florivory and the number of floral visitors. The petal removal treatment (i.e., artificial florivory) showed approximately 50% reduction in both fruit and seed set in natural pollination but not in artificial pollination. Furthermore, flower size increased the number of floral visitors, although it did not affect the frequency of florivory. Our results demonstrate that petal removal indirectly decreased 75% of female reproductive output via decreased flower visits by pollinators and that flower size mediated indirect interactions between florivory and floral visitors. © 2018 The Authors.

In this biome, bees perform the most frequent pollination system. Over the last decade, network analysis has been extensively applied to the study of plant-pollinator interactions, as it provides a consistent view of the structure of plant-pollinator interactions. The aim of this study was to use palynological studies to obtain an understanding of the relationship between floral visitor bees and the pioneer plant S. didymum in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest, and also learn about the other plants that interact to form this network. Five hundred bees were collected from 32 species distributed into five families: Andrenidae, Apidae, Colletidae, Megachilidae, and Halictidae. The interaction network consisted of 21 bee species and 35 pollen types. The Solanum-type bee species with the highest number of interactions were Anthrenoides sp. 1, Augochlora sp. 2, and Augochloropsis notophos, representing 71.78% of their interactions. Augochloropsis notophos and Augochlora sp. 2 were the only common species in the flowers of S. didymum. Given the results of our study, we conclude that Solanum is an important source of pollen grains for several native bee species, mainly for the solitary species that are more diverse in the south of Brazil. Moreover, our results indicate that bees from the families Halictidae (A. notophos, Augochlora) and Andrenidae (Anthrenoides) are the pollinators of S. didymum. © 2018 by the authors.",Floral visitors; Food web; Mutualistic relationship; Palynological data; Vibratile,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042226309

Plants of Ruppia exhibit hydrophily (water pollination). Transitions to hydrophily have been repeatedly accompanied by modifications to pollen characters. However, comprehensive investigations of pollen development in hydrophilous plants are limited, and most center on taxa that, unlike Ruppia, exhibit significant exine reduction. Investigating the consequences of the transition to water pollination for the pattern of pollen development in a comparative context will yield information about the lability of the pollen developmental pathway as well as the functional pollen traits required for successful water pollination. Methodology. Inflorescences of Ruppia maritima were field collected and anthers prepared for microscopy. Anthers and developing pollen grains at the sporogenous, microspore mother cell, tetrad, free microspore, and mature grain stages were studied using combined LM, SEM, and TEM. Pivotal results. A thin but distinct callose special wall surrounds Ruppia tetrads, and portions are often shared by adjacent tetrads. Divergence in exine development between the proximal and distal walls occurs during the free microspore stage, resulting in heteropolar pollen grains with a reduced exine on much of the distal surface. There are no major ultrastructure differences in the endexine or intine between the proximal and distal surfaces. On the proximal surface, muri that comprise the reticulum consist of a solid ridge of sporopollenin, with no infratectal columellae. We show, unequivocally, that a distinct foot layer surrounds the entire microspore. Tapetal cells invade the anther locule before meiosis, and this timing supports the close relationship of Ruppiaceae and Cymodoceaea. Ruppia is confirmed to have tricellular pollen at the time of dispersal. Conclusions. Modifications to the pollen developmental program involving both timing and location of developmental events have given rise to traits that are hypothesized to be adaptive for water pollination. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

One possible cause of bee declines is pesticide use. Bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, have been shown to be less efficient foragers and collect less pollen on foraging trips than unexposed bees. We investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) chronically exposed to imidacloprid at field-realistic levels of 2.6 and 10 ppb showed learning deficits that could affect foraging. Bumblebees were tested for their ability to associate flower colour with reward value in a simulated foraging environment. Bumblebees completed 10 foraging trips in which they collected sucrose solution from artificial flowers that varied in sucrose concentration. The reward quality of each artificial flower was predicted by corolla colour. Unexposed bumblebees acquired a preference for feeding on the most rewarding flower colour on the second foraging trip, while bumblebees exposed at 2.6 and 10 ppb did not until their third and fifth trip, respectively. The delay in preference acquisition in exposed bumblebees may be due to reduced flower sampling and shorter foraging trips. These results show that bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid are slow to learn the reward value of flowers and this may explain previously observed foraging inefficiencies associated with pesticide exposure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bumblebee; Foraging; Imidacloprid; Learning; Memory; Neonicotinoid,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038868257

However, the extent to which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains poorly explored. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment?sown wildflower strips and hedgerows?and landscape-scale greening measures within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their contribution to crop yield. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average by 10% and 13%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures share was increased from 6% to 26%. For pollination, the increase was stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14%) than in fields without adjacent EFA (7%). Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control (pest predation and parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural management. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial, species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional production system studied. Further research is needed to better understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES. Potential improvements include minimising trade-offs while promoting synergies between ES provision, food production and biodiversity conservation. © 2017 The Authors.

Nectar robbers can affect pollinator behavior and indirectly affect plant fitness. The signal of such effects (positive, neutral, or negative) may depend on how the primary pollinators of a given plant species respond to robbed flowers. Comparative studies are important to give insight on which factors are linked to these differential outcomes of nectar robbing on plant reproductive success. Here, we investigated the effect of a common Neotropical nectar robber, the stingless bee, Trigona spinipes (Apidae), on the reproductive success of the bee-pollinated Crotalaria vitellina (Fabaceae) and the hummingbird-pollinated Besleria longimucronata (Gesneriaceae). Methodology. We compared the robbing rate (number of flowers robbed relative to total flower display) between species and evaluated the effect of robbing on plant reproductive success by comparing the seed number per fruit of robbed fruits (identified by the presence of scars in the calyx, caused by the robber) with that of intact fruits. Pivotal results. The hummingbird-pollinated B. longimucronata had a higher proportion of robbed flowers than the bee-pollinated C. vitellina. Moreover, we found a negative effect of robbing on seed number per fruit for B. longimucronata but no effect for C. vitellina. Conclusions. The differences in the outcome of nectar robbing can be interpreted based on previous studies of pollinator behavior: hummingbirds often avoid nectar-robbed flowers, while bees often do not exhibit a preference between robbed and intact flowers. Our results show that the same robber species can have differential effects on the reproductive success of distinct plant species. In this sense, the outcome of nectar robbing will depend on the interplay between plant traits and pollinator behavior. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

This study aimed to characterize ES supply in deforestation context where an improvement of scientific knowledge should help develop more efficient environmental management. For three case studies in the Brazilian Amazon impacted by deforestation, seven indicators of potential ES supply were mapped at a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m: biodiversity index (indicator of food web support); richness of pollinators (pollination); index of soil chemical quality (support to production); water available for plants (water regulation); soil carbon stocks (support to production and climate regulation); rate of water infiltration into the soil (soil erosion control); and vegetation carbon stocks (climate regulation). To map these indicators, in situ measurements of ES for 135 sampling points and remote sensing data were linked using regression methods. These methods were used to predict ES values and identify environmental factors that influence ES supply. The resulting maps help in understanding the influence of environmental factors on ES spatial distribution within the sites. The analyses illustrate the influence of land-use changes on ES supply and the role of context effects due to the heterogeneity of the biophysical environment, the temporality of deforestation and/or their diversified sociopolitical contexts.

Analyses of FSGS have been used retrospectively to infer seed dispersal and other ecological processes. The spring ephemeral Megaleranthis saniculifolia, endemic to Korea, is insect-pollinated and has no special seed dispersal mechanism, and its seedling recruitment is quite low. Given these ecological and life-history traits, we expect that there would be significant FSGS in juveniles, which would persist into adult stage. Since M. saniculifolia is self-compatible and many adults produce 23 inflorescences, we expect considerable inbreeding. To test these predictions, we used allozyme-based Sp statistics to compare two undisturbed populations on Mt. Deogyu (DEO) and Mt. Taebaek (TAE), as well as between juveniles (J) and adults (A) stages. We also measured genetic diversity and inbreeding in each population. The two populations exhibited significant FSGS in both life stages. Although the strength of FSGS was reduced with increasing stage (J, Sp = 0.0313; A, Sp = 0.0178 in DEO and J, Sp = 0.0502; A, Sp = 0.0286 in TAE), differences in FSGS between stages and between populations were not significant. Within-population genetic diversity (mean %P = 27.0, A = 1.27, He = 0.116) was relatively low and comparable to reference values for both endemic and narrowly-distributed plant species. Genetic differentiation between sites, however, was high (FST = 0.465), and the two populations exhibited a significant deficit of heterozygotes (mean FIS = 0.289), primarily due to selfing and biparental inbreeding (effective selfing rate was ?0.40). Our results revealed that the magnitude and spatial scale of FSGS in M. saniculifolia is strong and does not differ significantly with life-history stage. The strong FSGS, low within-population genetic variation, high between-population genetic differentiation, and high inbreeding are consistent with the species limited seed dispersal and a mixed mating system. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Conservation; Demographic genetics; Ecological traits; Genetic structure; Inbreeding; Limited seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039458715

Much work has gone into understanding the effects of habitat enhancements in agricultural systems on wild bee abundance, richness and pollination services. However, the effects of ecological restoration targeting natural ecological endpoints (e.g. restoring former agricultural fields to historic vegetation types or improving degraded natural lands) on wild bees have received relatively little attention, despite their potential importance for countering habitat loss. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of ecological restoration on wild bee abundance and richness, focusing on unmanaged bee communities in lands restored and managed to increase habitat availability and quality. Specifically, we assessed bee abundance and/or richness across studies comparing restored vs. unrestored treatments and studies investigating effects of specific habitat restoration techniques, such as burning, grazing, invasive plant removal and seeding. We analysed 28 studies that met our selection criteria: these represented 11 habitat types and 7 restoration techniques. Nearly all restorations associated with these studies were performed without explicit consideration of habitat needs for bees or other pollinators. The majority of restorations targeted plant community goals, which could potentially have ancillary benefits for bees. Restoration had overall positive effects on wild bee abundance and richness across multiple habitat types. Specific restoration actions, tested independently, also tended to have positive effects on wild bee richness and abundance. Synthesis and applications. We found strong evidence that ecological restoration advances wild bee conservation. This is important given that habitat loss is recognized as a leading factor in pollinator decline. Pollinator responses to land management are rarely evaluated in non-agricultural settings and so support for wild bees may be an underappreciated benefit of botanically focused management. Future restoration projects that explicitly consider the needs of wild bees could be more effective at providing nesting, foraging and other habitat resources. We encourage land managers to design and evaluate restoration projects with the habitat needs of wild bee species in mind. © 2017 The Authors.

Declining honeybee populations require us to find alternative solutions for sustainable agriculture. Native bees are proving to be efficient pollinators. Mason bees (Osmia lignaria) provide valuable pollinator services for some woody orchard species, but their value as pollinators for herbaceous crops is largely untested. We assessed the effectiveness of O. lignaria supplementation on nine strawberry farms over two growing seasons. We specifically selected mason bees for this work because they emerge from cocoons in the springtime, when few other bees are available for pollination. Cocoons are easily deployed on farms and emerged bees have a small flight radius, so they remain localized. We placed cocoons on one side of each berry farm plot (our mason bee addition treatment) but not on the opposite side (our control). We tagged and monitored berries on nine farms throughout the growing season. We performed statistical comparisons of berries from the treatment and control for differences in berry growth rate and size. In addition, we supplemented farms with native bee homes constructed from three materials (bamboo, Phragmites and wood). This allowed us to determine whether adult mason bees would produce a subsequent generation of bees on farms and whether the bees had a preference for nest material type. Our work demonstrates that mason bees can be used successfully to pollinate herbaceous berry crops. We found that berry growth rate was significantly higher and berry volume was significantly larger for berries from the treatment relative to the control. We also found that adult bees successfully utilized the bee homes for laying the next generation of offspring and that bees colonized bamboo homes more than other home types. Synthesis and applications. Our results are the first to show that native mason bees (Osmia lignaria) can be used successfully to provide pollination services on strawberry farms. Their use results in the production of bigger berries and faster berry growth rates than managed honeybees alone. Mason bees overwinter (and can be purchased) in cocoons, offering great potential for efficient and effective pollination services, for a variety of agricultural applications across different geographical regions. The availability of suitable nesting sites and protection of subsequent generations of cocoons from wasp parasitization warrant future consideration. © 2017 The Authors.

The ability to sonicate (buzz) flowers is widespread in bees but not ubiquitous. Despite the prevalence of this pollinator behavior and its importance to natural and agricultural systems, the evolutionary history of floral sonication in bees has not been previously studied. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of floral sonication in bees by generating a time-calibrated phylogeny and reconstructing ancestral states for this pollen extraction behavior. We also test the hypothesis that the ability to sonicate flowers and thereby efficiently access pollen from a diverse assemblage of plant species, led to increased diversification among sonicating bee taxa. We find that floral sonication evolved on average 45 times within bees, possibly first during the Early Cretaceous (100145 million years ago) in the common ancestor of bees. We find that sonicating lineages are significantly more species rich than nonsonicating sister lineages when comparing sister clades, but a probabilistic structured rate permutation on phylogenies approach failed to support the hypothesis that floral sonication is a key driver of bee diversification. This study provides the evolutionary framework needed to further study how floral sonication by bees may have facilitated the spread and common evolution of angiosperm species with poricidal floral morphology. © 2018 The Author(s).

No genetic structuring was detected in A. palmeri, but A. parryi formed three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to geographical locations. One genetic cluster of A. parryi contained populations from lower elevations and had lower levels of genetic diversity, probably indicating anthropogenic origins.

However, these bees will forage on, recruit for, and pollinate this plant during a seasonal dearth of preferred food sources. Olfactory learning plays a key role in forager constancy and pollination, and we therefore tested the effects of acute and chronic TRP feeding on forager olfactory learning, using proboscis extension reflex conditioning. At concentrations of 0.5-10 µg TRP ml?1, there were no learning effects of acute exposure. However, memory retention (1 h after the last learning trial) significantly decreased by 56% following acute consumption of 0.5 µg TRP ml?1. Chronic exposure did not alter learning or memory, except at high concentrations (5 and 10 µg TRP ml?1). TRP concentrations in nectar may therefore not significantly harm plant pollination. Surprisingly, TRP slightly increased bee survival, and thus other components in T. hypoglaucum honey may be toxic. Long-term exposure to TRP could have colony effects but these may be ameliorated by the bees aversion to T. hypoglaucum nectar when other food sources are available and, perhaps, by detoxification mechanisms. The co-evolution of this plant and its reluctant visitor may therefore likely illustrate a classic compromise between the interests of both actors. © 2018.

We conducted maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data of plastid matK-trnK and trnL-trnF and nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences for 36 genera and 182 species of Spiranthinae plus appropriate outgroups. The results strongly support monophyly of Spiranthinae (minus Discyphus, Discyphinae and Galeottiella, Galeottiellinae) and five major lineages, namely monospecific Cotylolabium (sister to the remaining Spiranthinae) and the Eurystyles, Pelexia, Spiranthes and Stenorrhynchos clades. Eighteen of the 27 genera of Spiranthinae for which more than one species was included in our analyses are monophyletic. Paraphyly of large genera, such as Cyclopogon and Sarcoglottis, resulted from segregation of particular species or groups of species exhibiting minor modifications of structures directly involved in pollination (e.g. nectary, rostellum and viscidium). Conversely, polyphyly has resulted from convergent evolution of floral attributes in distantly related species (e.g. Mesadenus). Some of the morphological characters used traditionally for generic delimitation and in nonmolecular cladistic analyses of Spiranthinae are discussed against the evolutionary framework set by our molecular trees, emphasizing putative synapomorphies and problems derived from inappropriate character coding or incorrect homology assessments. Our ancestral area analysis indicates that Spiranthinae originated in eastern South America, with subsequent migrations and secondary radiations in Mesoamerica and North America, plus a derived migration from the latter region to the Old World (Spiranthes). © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.",Ancestral area; Floral morphology; Homology; Homoplasy; Molecular phylogenetics; Pollination syndrome; Taxonomy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043322728

Nectar chemistry is important for understanding plant nutrient allocation and plantpollinator interactions. However, many plant species are difficult to sample as their flowers are small and produce low amounts of nectar. We compared the effects of different methods of nectar collection on the amino acid composition of flowers with low volumes of nectar. We used five methods to collect nectar from 60 (5 × 12) Calluna vulgaris flowers: microcapillary tubes, a low-volume flower rinse (the micro-rinse method, using 2 ?l water), filter paper, a high-volume flower rinse (2 ml water) and a flower wash (2 ml water). We analysed the samples for free amino acids using quantitative UHPLC methods. We found that the micro-rinse method (rinsing the nectary with enough water to only cover the nectary) recovered amino acid proportions similar to raw nectar extracted using microcapillary tubes. The filter paper, 2 ml rinse and 2 ml wash methods measured significantly higher values of free amino acids and also altered the profile of amino acids. We discuss our concerns about the increased contamination risk of the filter paper and high-volume rinse and wash samples from dried nectar across the floral tissue (nectar unavailable to floral visitors), pollen, vascular fluid and cellular fluid. Our study will enable researchers to make informed decisions about nectar collection methods depending on their intended chemical analysis. These methods of sampling will enable researchers to examine a larger array of plant species' flowers to include those with low volumes of nectar. © 2017 The Authors.

An important prerequisite to tailor conservation action is to understand the drivers and patterns of species-rich communities, and how they change in space and time during a whole season. To account for this, we surveyed wild bees and flowering plants using standardized transects in 11 natural habitat fragments of an IUCN important plant area along the coast of Israel. We used phylogeny- and taxon-based methods of community structure analyses to study the assembly processes of bee communities, and investigated the effects of several landscape parameters on bee diversity using generalized linear models (GLMs). Our results illustrate that natural habitat sites comprised significantly higher species richness compared to disturbed habitat sites, and show that even the smallest habitat fragments harbored unique bee assemblages, with significant species replacement (turnover) found in both space and time. Our GLMs indicated that flower diversity, and semi-natural habitat within 500 m of habitat fragments were important drivers of bee diversity, but we found no evidence for a speciesarea relationship among sites. Finally, we document a case of phylogenetic overdispersion despite low species richness, which highlights the importance of accounting for phylogenetic diversity rather than only species richness to reach a more fine-grained understanding of pollinator diversity. This, in turn, is pivotal to developing conservation actions to protect these essential pollinators and their interaction with rare and endemic plant species in this highly threatened ecosystem. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Anthropogenic disturbance; Beta diversity; Co-occurrence; Fragmentation; Habitat loss; Phylogenetic diversity; Pollinator conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033483497

Reproduction may also increase with heterospecific density (community-level Allee effect), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and the consequences for community dynamics can be complex. Allee effects have crucial consequences for the conservation of declining species, but also the dynamics of range edge populations. In invasive species, Allee effects may slow or stop range expansion. Observational studies in natural plant communities cannot distinguish whether reproduction is limited by pollination-mediated interactions among plants or by other neighbourhood effects (e.g. competition for abiotic resources). Even experimental pollen supply cannot distinguish whether variation in reproduction is caused by direct density effects or by plant traits correlated with density. Finally, it is unknown over which spatial scales pollination-mediated interactions occur. To circumvent these problems, we introduce a comprehensive experimental and analytical framework which simultaneously (1) manipulates pollen availability and quality by hand pollination and pollinator exclusion, (2) manipulates neighbourhoods by transplanting target plants, and (3) analyses the effects of con- and heterospecific neighbourhoods on reproduction with spatially explicit trait-based neighbourhood models. Applying this framework to Senecio inaequidens, one of Europe's fastest plant invaders, we found that the seed set was strongly pollen limited. Reproduction had increased by pollinator-mediated facilitation by both con- and heterospecific neighbours which may lead to (community-level) Allee effects. Pollination-independent interactions, such as amelioration of abiotic conditions through neighbours, contributed to additional positive neighbour effects. However, these pollination-independent interactions were weaker than the pollination-mediated interactions and they occurred over smaller spatial scales. Finally, the strength and direction of neighbourhood effects depended on neighbour traits and thus changed with the trait composition of the neighbourhood. Synthesis. By manipulating both pollen availability and target plant locations within neighbourhoods, we can comprehensively analyse spatially explicit density dependence of plant reproduction. This experimental approach enhances our ability to understand the dynamics of sparse populations and of species geographical ranges. © 2017 The Authors.

However, it is unknown whether biosynthesis of metabolites that attract insects is a basic and general trait, or if it is specific for yeasts that live in close association with insects. Our goal was to study chemical insect attractants produced by yeasts that span more than 250 million years of evolutionary history and vastly differ in their metabolism and lifestyle. We bioassayed attraction of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster to odors of phylogenetically and ecologically distinct yeasts grown under controlled conditions. Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the insect-associated species Candida californica, Pichia kluyveri and Metschnikowia andauensis, wine yeast Dekkera bruxellensis, milk yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, the vertebrate pathogens Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, and oleophilic Yarrowia lipolytica were screened for fly attraction in a wind tunnel. Yeast headspace was chemically analyzed, and co-occurrence of insect attractants in yeasts and flowering plants was investigated through a database search. In yeasts with known genomes, we investigated the occurrence of genes involved in the synthesis of key aroma compounds. Flies were attracted to all nine yeasts studied. The behavioral response to baker's yeast was independent of its growth stage. In addition to Drosophila, we tested the basal hexapod Folsomia candida (Collembola) in a Y-tube assay to the most ancient yeast, Y. lipolytica, which proved that early yeast signals also function on clades older than neopteran insects. Behavioral and chemical data and a search for selected genes of volatile metabolites underline that biosynthesis of chemical signals is found throughout the yeast clade and has been conserved during the evolution of yeast lifestyles. Literature and database reviews corroborate that yeast signals mediate mutualistic interactions between insects and yeasts. Moreover, volatiles emitted by yeasts are commonly found also in flowers and attract many insect species. The collective evidence suggests that the release of volatile signals by yeasts is a widespread and phylogenetically ancient trait, and that insectyeast communication evolved prior to the emergence of flowering plants. Co-occurrence of the same attractant signals in yeast and flowers suggests that yeast-insect communication may have contributed to the evolution of insect-mediated pollination in flowers. © 2018 The Authors.

Most prominently, buzz-pollination is known from Solanum (Solanaceae) defining the solanoid flower type by Knut Fægri. The flowers of buzz-pollinated, Australian Halgania resemble the actinomorphic Solanum floral architecture: The plants have a yellow anther cone with an apical pore, protruding from a widely funnel-shaped to rotate, blue to violet corolla. However, Fægri rejected the solanoid flower type for some of the Halgania species due to a contracted inflorescence, a funnel-shaped corolla or an ostensible lack of a female stage. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, we investigated traits referring to the floral architecture of Halgania and compared the flowers of different species. In all investigated species the anthers of the cone are connected via long, intertwined trichomes (denoted capillinection) both between the individual anthers and in the central stylar channel. The anther opening is functionally reduced to an apical pore by 1) capillinection and spatial compression of the thecal walls, leaving only small apical slits and 2) by anther appendages that unify the ten slits to a single pore. Halgania flowers are morphologically similar to each other and are buzz-pollinated. We conclude that they are all structurally and functionally matching the flowers of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, and thus the concept of solanoid flowers as defined by Knut Fægri. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Floral sonication; Pollinator guidance; Vibratile pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039452804

B.S.P.] in order to obtain reliable estimates for supporting eastern Canadian tree breeding strategies. The study was based on data collected from two series of progeny tests of black spruce in New Brunswick (NB) including 285 open-pollinated families and more than 57,000 individual trees. Height (HT), diameter at breast height (DBH), and stem forking (SF) were periodically measured between ages 5 and 35 years. Results showed that tree volume (V), HT and DBH were highly genetically controlled, with average individual narrow-sense heritability (hi2) estimates of 0.29, 0.29 and 0.21, and family mean heritability (hF2) estimates of 0.82, 0.85 and 0.77, respectively. SF had low hi2 (= 0.06 on average) but had moderate hF2 (= 0.56), indicating family selection might effectively reduce SF. Both hi2 and hF2 increased with age and then stabilized or declined, being the highest around ages 1520 years for all traits. The type-B genetic correlation (rB) estimates were moderate to high for all the traits, suggesting negligible genotype × environment interactions. Strong ageage genetic correlation estimates were found for growth traits, implying the potential for practicing early selection. Ageage genetic correlation estimates were moderate for SF (= 0.72). Traittrait genetic correlation estimates were strong and positive among growth traits, but between growth traits and SF they were mostly negligible albeit positive. Overall, results suggest that genetic selection will be effective for growth traits but much less so for reducing stem forking in New Brunswicks black spruce. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Coefficient of additive genetic variance; Genetic correlations; Heritability; Picea mariana,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035766901

However, information about the pollination biology of carnivorous plants is scarce. To increase knowledge of reproductive ecology of carnivorous plants we focused on Pinguicula moranensis. Specifically, based on the presence of large, zygomorphic and spurred flowers, we predicted higher reproductive fitness in cross-pollinated than in self-pollinated flowers. Within a plot of 51 m2 we characterised the reproductive phenology, including flower lifespan and stigmatic receptivity. We identified pollinators and their movement patterns within the plot. Breeding system was experimentally evaluated using hand-pollination (i.e. autonomous, self- and cross-pollination). Flowers of P. moranensis were visited by long-tongued pollinators, mainly members of the Lepidoptera. Hand-pollination experiments confirmed our prediction and suggest that flower traits might favour cross-pollination. We mainly discuss the implications of the patchy distribution of plants and behaviour of pollinators on gene movement in this plant species, as pollination between genetically related individuals could be occurring. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Breeding system; carnivorous plant; hand-pollination; Lepidoptera; reproductive fitness,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036514134

We hypothesized that risk of reproductive limitation can be evaluated from combined analysis of pollen activity, ovule fertilization and germination in the context of population demographics and fragmentation. The marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe), a rare emblematic species of European heathland and fen, was investigated at the southern limit of its range in eighteen populations encompassing one to several hundred thousand individuals, spanning small fragments to extensive well-preserved areas. An index of habitat fragmentation was determined from GIS; field surveys determined the ratio of juvenile to reproductive age states; fluorescence microscopy of pistils determined, for each population, the proportion of flowers exhibiting active pollen tube growth. Analysis of seed lots determined the ovule fertilization rate and seed germination capacity. Some of the small populations occupying restricted habitat fragments showed high rates of pollination (100%) and normal age state demographics. However, reproductive characters all exhibited exponential rise to maximum relationships with population size, indicating clear tipping points (for pollination, at a threshold of 7 reproductive adults, and for ovule fertilization rate and germination at 42 reproductive adults). Thus although small populations may set seed, exhibit a normal age state structure, and may appear viable, reproductive effectiveness declines when population size falls below 42 generative individuals and < 7 is an indicator of strong limitation. Although many remnant populations of G. pneumonanthe are in the order of 50150 individuals these should be not be considered as MVPs; they are on the brink of calamity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Demographics; Dispersal; Habitat fragmentation; Ovule fertilization; Plant conservation; Pollen limitation; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034660206

Several hummingbird species, including Annas (Calypte anna), Black-chinned (Archilochus alexandri), Allens (Selasphorus sasin), and Costas (Calypte costae) hummingbirds, make extensive use of non-native plants of urban areas of Southern California. Exploitation of urban ornamentals may expose hummingbirds to increased interactions with invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile), which are also frequently found foraging on flowers in such habitats. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which hummingbirds interact with invasive ants at nectar resources in a series of aviary and wild experiments. When given a choice, hummingbirds avoided flowers and feeders with ants in or feeding at a sucrose solution. We identified specific ant-derived cues (visual, tactile, and gustatory) which are sufficient to elicit changes in bird foraging. Tactile and gustatory cues appeared to play the strongest role in mediating interactions with Argentine ants, with visual cues alone not enough to deter hummingbirds from feeding at sugar resources with ants. Our experiments provide support for interference competition at floral resources, where ants limit the birds access to flowers and feeders. Significance statement: Hummingbirds and invasive Argentine ants both visit and exploit floral resources. However, hummingbirds avoid nectar sources that are occupied by ants. Here, we detail a series of mechanistic experiments to determine the proximate cause of this avoidance behavior. We found that the touch and taste of ants is strongly aversive to both wild, free-foraging and aviary hummingbirds. In urban environments and under low water situations, Argentine ants and hummingbirds come into frequent competition for the same few flowers. This competition leads to changes in foraging behavior and may have negative effects on hummingbirds. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Hummingbird foraging; Invasive species; Nectar; Pollination; Resource competition,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042475265

(P genome) is a wild relative of wheat that harbours many genetic variations that could be used to increase the genetic diversity of wheat. To agronomically transfer important genes from the P genome to a wheat chromosome by induced homoeologous pairing and recombination, it is necessary to determine the chromosomal relationships between Agropyron and wheat. Here, we report using the wheat 660K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to genotype a segregating Agropyron F1 population derived from an interspecific cross between two cross-pollinated diploid collections Z1842 [A. cristatum (L.)

Genetic linkage maps were constructed using 913 SNP markers distributed among seven linkage groups spanning 839.7 cM. The average distance between adjacent markers was 1.8 cM. The maps identified the homoeologous relationship between the P genome and wheat and revealed that the P and wheat genomes are collinear and relatively conserved. In addition, obvious rearrangements and introgression spread were observed throughout the P genome compared with the wheat genome.

Arthropod communities respond to these abiotic effects of roads, as well as to the indirect effects of vegetation changes. The Dempster Highway is a year-round gravel highway that travels 737 km through the Subarctic and Arctic ecosystems of Yukon and the Northwest Territories, Canada. In July 2016, in a Subarctic region of Yukon, we established nine transects spaced at 4-12 km intervals along a 56 km segment of the Dempster Highway and sampled arthropods at 1, 10, and 100 m from the highway on each transect. Our objective was to determine the effect of road proximity on the diversity, abundance, and composition of arthropod communities, with a special focus on the functionally and phylogenetically diverse group, Hymenoptera. We found that total arthropod abundance was lowest at the intermediate distance from the road, a pattern driven by high Diptera abundance close to the road and high Collembola abundance far from the road. We suggest that Diptera may be responding to increased moisture and plant biomass near the road, while Collembola may be responding to changes in soil characteristics. Hymenoptera abundance was greater close to the road than farther away, a pattern that may be driven by high Diptera parasitoid abundance near the road. Our results suggest that arthropods are good indicators of ecosystem function and that roads may have important effects on Subarctic ecosystem services (e.g., pollination, pest control). As infrastructural development continues in the Canadian North, it is of vital importance to anticipate and predict the effects of this development on the unique and diverse fauna of the Subarctic ecosystem. © The Arctic Institute of North America.",Abundance; Arthropods; Disturbance; Diversity; Entomology; Hymenoptera; Insects; Northern; Roads; Subarctic; Tundra,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042668677

This study examines the effects of microsite variation and restoration treatment on successional trajectories and three-to-eight-year restoration outcomes in upland prairies in Oregon's Willamette Valley. I sought first to determine whether different upland prairie restoration units show similar successional trajectories, second, to identify which exotic species have persistent effects on restoration outcomes, and finally, to determine how variation in restoration treatment, topography, and aspect affect restoration outcomes. Permanent plots in two replicate units showed very similar trends over five years, and similar outcomes to restoration units at a second upland site. Exotic annuals were short-lived and did not prevent establishment of the primary planted species, the native grass Festuca roemeri (Roemer's fescue). Festuca roemeri established well mid-slope and in valleys but not on ridges. Where native forbs were seeded, forb abundance was higher in plots with less F. roemeri cover, suggesting that it is not cost-effective to seed forbs along with high rates of native grasses. However, seeding F. roemeri at high rates may be an effective strategy when forb seed is not available. A suite of exotic perennial forbs, including Hypochaeris radicata (false dandelion), contributed to diversity and provided nectar resources for pollinators without becoming dominant, while other exotic forbs such as Cirsium spp. (thistle) and Dipsacus fullonum (Fuller's teasel) required active management. © 2018 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.",Agrostis; Danthonia californica; Festuca roemeri; Forb; Grass-specific herbicide,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043289623

However in the northern Great Plains, field margins can oftentimes be areas of saline soil, which can impact seed germination and seedling establishment. Therefore, a replicated growth chamber experiment was used to determine winter camelina (Camelina sativa), winter pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.), echium (Echium plantogineum), cuphea (Cuphea viscosissima X Cuphea lanceolata), and calendula (Calendula officinalis) tolerance to germinating under saline conditions. A total of 50 seeds, replicated 3 times were germinated in petri dishes saturated with NaCl, CaCl, and Na2SO4 solution at 0, 0.2, 2, 4, 8, and 16 dS m?1 in an incubator at constant 20 °C. Fully germinated seeds were counted and removed daily for 7 days, followed by every other day for a total of 21 days. Final germination percent, corrected germination rate index, and germination velocity were calculated. Germination percent, corrected germination rate index and germination velocity were negatively affected by increases in salinity for camelina, pennycress, cuphea, and calendula. Echium germination was not impacted by salt or salinity level. Sodium based salts were more detrimental for camelina, pennycress, and calendula. Camelina and cuphea germination was tolerant to salinity, with average salinity thresholds of 8.0 and 3.1 dS m?1 and a 25% germination decline at 35.3 and 11.0 dS m?1, respectively. Pennycress and calendula germination was moderately tolerant to salinity with average salinity thresholds of 5.9 and 2.7 dS m?1 and a 25% germination decline at 9.4 and 7.7 dS m?1, respectively.

However, little is known about S genotypes and S allele frequencies in Citrus cultivars. First, S genotypes and S allele frequencies of Citrus accessions were studied with S4 and S5 gene alleles of Hassaku (C. hassaku hort. ex Tanaka) a putative hybrid between self-incompatible pummelo [C. maxima (Burm.) Merrill; syn. C. grandis Osbeck] and Kunenbo (C. nobilis Lour. var. kunep Tanaka). About 200 Citrus accessions were pollinated with each of the homozygous S1 seedlings (S4S4 and S5S5) of Hassaku. Pollen tube arrest in the styles indicated that 19 of 202 (9.4%) accessions have an S4 allele and 12 of 191 (6.3%) accessions have an S5 allele. In pummelo, the rate of accessions with S4 allele was 1.4% (1/72), while that with S5 allele was 5.9% (9/76). This suggests that the two alleles are originated from pummelo and the allele frequency is 0.7% (1/144) for S4 and 5.9% (9/152) for S5.

Traditional methods can reveal correlated phylogenies between interacting organisms, suggesting a co-evolutionary association. However, several processes could lead to cophylogeny, including (1) vicariance, (2) phylogenetic tracking and (3) co-evolution. We present a framework to investigate diffuse co-evolution between groups of interacting taxa. Our methodology incorporates two complementary statistical methods to test for evolutionary signals. First, we test for correlated taxonomies between interacting species, and then we test for an association between the pattern of interactions and taxonomy of interacting species. We use these methods to clearly distinguish between three possible explanations of cophylogenies, when present. Our methodology is designed to explore diffuse evolutionary signals among many interacting taxa: it is robust to polytomies and generalization and can use taxonomic trees in place of phylogenies. Thus, we use taxonomic distances to identify groups of associated taxa, as opposed to specific co-evolutionary relationships. In a case study, we find significant evidence for phylogenetic tracking, vicariance and asymmetry. Generally, our method can be applied whenever relevant taxonomy is well resolved and includes sufficient variation at multiple taxonomic ranks between two groups of interacting taxa. This adaptable method can incorporate many types of data on species traits or behaviours, such as phylogenetic relatedness, pollination efficacy, interaction strengths and visitation rates. The analysis we provide here may be of use to a broad range of ecologists interested in evaluating diffuse evolutionary patterns in groups of interacting species. © 2017 The Authors.

The objectives of this work were to generate and characterize the ploidy level, mode of reproduction, and fertility of a novel 308 individual sexual synthetic tetraploid population (SSTP) developed by intercrossing 29 sexual F1 hybrids originated by hybridizing several naturally occurring apomictic tetraploids from diverse origin with a few ESTGs. Ploidy levels were determined using flow cytometry, and reproductive modes were evaluated by a molecular assay with apospory-linked markers and embryo sac observations. The tetraploid level and the sexual mode of reproduction remained stable after two cycles of recombination during the generation of the SSTP. Fertility was evaluated based on seed set under self- and open pollination during 3 yr. The SSTP exhibited in average 30.2 and 15.2% seed set under open and self-pollina-tion, respectively, showing a predominantly cross-pollination behavior with variable levels of self-fertility. There were no differences in terms of fertility between the SSTP and the ESTG.

In the Campanulaceae, presentation of pollen on stylar hairs and progressive stigma curvature have been hypothesised to facilitate delayed selfing, but experimental tests are lacking. Stigma curvature is common in Campanula, a genus largely characterised by self-incompatibility, and therefore is unlikely to have initially evolved to promote self-fertilisation. In derived self-compatible species, however, stigma curvature might serve the secondary function of delayed selfing. We investigated delayed selfing in Triodanis perfoliata, a self-compatible relative of Campanula. Using floral manipulation experiments and pollen tube observations, we quantified the extent and timing of self-pollination. Further, we hypothesised that, if stigma curvature provides the benefit of delayed selfing in Triodanis, selection should have favoured retention of self-pollen through the loss of a stylar hair retraction mechanism. Results of a stigma removal experiment indicated that autonomous selfing produces partial seed set, but only some selfing was delayed. Pollen tube observations and a flower senescence assay also supported the finding of partial delayed selfing. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that pollen-collecting hairs retract during anthesis, which may limit the extent of delayed selfing. Delayed selfing appeared to be only partially effective in T. perfoliata. The stylar hair retraction in this species would seem to contradict selection for selfing. We suggest that caution and rigour are needed in interpreting floral traits as adaptive mechanisms for delayed selfing. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Autonomous selfing; Campanula; delayed selfing; reproductive assurance; secondary pollen presentation; Triodanis perfoliata,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043677997

To investigate the mechanisms involved in this process, 2 maize hybrids were grown in field crops at 2 sowing densities and under 3 irrigation regimes (well-watered control, drought before pollination, and drought during pollination), in all possible combinations. Samples of ear tips were taken 26 days after synchronous hand pollination and used for the analysis of gene expression and sugars. Glucose and fructose levels increased in kernels with high abortion risk. Several FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN (FLA) genes showed negative correlation with abortion. The expression of ZmFLA7 responded to drought only at the tip of the ear. The abundance of arabinogalactan protein (AGP) glycan epitopes decreased with drought and pharmacological treatments that reduce AGP activity enhanced the abortion of fertilized ovaries. Drought also reduced the expression of AthFLA9 in the siliques of Arabidopsis thaliana. Gain- and loss-of-function mutants of Arabidopsis showed a negative correlation between AthFLA9 and seed abortion. On the basis of gene expression patterns, pharmacological, and genetic evidence, we propose that stress-induced reductions in the expression of selected FLA genes enhance abortion of fertilized ovaries in maize and Arabidopsis. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",corn; drought stress; FLA; seed abortion,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041231978

Here we employed a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, in combination with morphometric analyses, to investigate a small western Mediterranean clade in the flowering plant genus Linaria that radiated in theQuaternary.After confirming the morphological and genetic distinctness of eight species, we evaluated the relative performances of concatenation and coalescent methods to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Specifically, we focused on assessing the robustness of both approaches to variations in the parameter used to estimate sequence homology (clustering threshold). Concatenation analyses suffered from strong systematic bias, as revealed by the high statistical support for multiple alternative topologies depending on clustering threshold values. By contrast, topologies produced by two coalescent-based methods (NJst, SVDquartets) were robust to variations in the clustering threshold. Reticulate evolution may partly explain incongruences between NJst, SVDquartets and concatenated trees. Integration of morphometric and coalescent-based phylogenetic results revealed (i) extensive morphological divergence associated with recent splits between geographically close or sympatric sister species and (ii) morphological convergence in geographically disjunct species. These patterns are particularly true for floral traits related to pollinator specialization, including nectar spur length, tube width and corolla color, suggesting pollinatordriven diversification. Given its relatively simple and inexpensive implementation, GBS is a promising technique for the phylogenetic and systematic study of recent radiations, but care must be taken to evaluate the robustness of results to variation of data assembly parameters. © 2017 The Author(s).",Coalescence; concatenation; genotyping-by-sequencing; Linaria; phylogeny; RAD-Seq; radiation; speciation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042359184

We present econullnetr, an r package combining null modelling and plotting functions for networks, with data-export tools to facilitate its use alongside existing network analysis packages.

The outputs can be analysed from the level of individual links to whole networks.

Heath forest as occurred in Belitung Island, Indonesia is a specific habitat for many endemic species, which are poor in nutrients and very fragile in response to any disturbance. We observed Hoya species-one of the epiphytic genus in the tropic in the heath forest and on other habitats of Belitung Island, Indonesia. Hoya species are plants with promising uses as functional ornamental plants (able to absorb pollutants from their growing environments), and as sources of certain medicinal and pharmaceutical compounds. A survey of Hoya was carried out on Belitung Island, off the southeast coast of Sumatra, in 2015, 2016 and 2017. There are two interesting Hoya species that grow well in the ""padang community"" of the heath forest, on the island: i.e. H. coronaria Blume and H imperialis Lindl. These two have attractive flower size and color. Another species, H. verticillata (Vahl) G.Don, with less attractive flower color, is distributed in the mixed forest of the beach areas, while H. multiflora Blume and H. scortechinii King & Gamble, also with less attractive flower color, are distributed in mixed forest of upper elevations. The distribution and habitat preference of different Hoya species indicate different requirements for moisture and temperature, which we hypothesize also result in differences in the pollinator species visiting the plants. The ""padang community"" of the heath forest on Belitung experiences maximum temperatures up to 37°C in the afternoon. It is located in an Af climate type, with average rainfall, air temperature and humidity of ± 205 mm/month, 27°C and 77.5%, respectively.

This was tested on three lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) landraces originated from different regions of Greece, germplasm presumably comprising mixtures of homozygous genotypes due to the self-pollinating nature of the crop. Single-plant selection under ultra-low density (interplant distance of 50 or 80 cm) resulted in first- and second-generation sister lines. Progeny testing was conducted in three locations, while the final evaluation at farming density included an additional marginal environment. Wide interplant distance accelerated phenotypic expression of susceptibility to viruses, reflected by high coefficient of variation of single-plant yields. Compared to the mother populations, higher yields combined with reduced virus incidence was observed in the first-generation sister lines, and even higher yields in the second-generation lines partly attributable to further improvement of their sanitary status. Remarkably, at the farming density across five environments, second generation sister lines had mean grain yields by 8, 10 and 20% higher compared to their respective ancestors. Individual sister lines exhibited up to 32% higher yields and stability in agronomic terms, i.e. on both the GGE biplot model and regression approach of G×E interaction.

It is supposed to be an intermediate stage in the evolutionary pathway from hermaphroditism to dioecy in angiosperm. Hermaphrodites gain fitness through both seed and pollen production whereas females gain fitness only through seed production. As females spread in a gynodioecious population, sexual selection prompts hermaphrodites to invest in male function and male-biased hermaphrodites prevail. In the gynodioecious shrub Daphne jezoensis (Thymelaeaceae), female frequency is stably around 50% in most populations, and fruit-set rate of hermaphrodites is commonly low. Therefore, D. jezoensis is likely at a later stage in the evolutionary pathway. Female function of hermaphrodites (fruit-set rate, selfing rate, seed size, and germination rate) was assessed in three populations under natural conditions. In order to evaluate the potential seed fertility and inbreeding depression by selfing in hermaphrodites, hand pollination treatments were also performed. Over a 2-year period under natural conditions, 1829% of hermaphrodites and 6981% of females set fruit. Across all three populations, the mean fruit-set rate ranged 9.549.2% in females and only 3.910.2% in hermaphrodites. Even with artificial outcross-pollination, 5991% of hermaphrodites failed to set any fruit. When self-pollination was performed in hermaphrodites, both of fruit-set and germination rates were decreased, indicating early-acting inbreeding depression. In addition, more than half of the hermaphrodite seeds were produced by selfing under natural pollination, but pollinator service was still required. Totally, hermaphrodites performed poorly as seed producers because of the intrinsically-low fruiting ability and a combination of autogamous selfing and strong inbreeding depression, indicating the absence of reproductive assurance. These results indicate that the mating system of D. jezoensis is functionally close to dioecy. © 2017, The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer Japan KK.",Fruit set; Gynodioecy; Hermaphrodite; Pollen limitation; Selfing; Subdioecy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029683990

Recent studies have shown that an ontogenetic diet shift undermines the resilience of stage-structured food webs. Here, we study the integration of stage-structured food-web theory into theory of hybrid community (i.e. mixture of different interaction types), considering that not only diet but also interaction type often changes because of ontogenetic niche shift (e.g. the metamorphosis of pollinating insects, in which juveniles and adults are herbivores and pollinators, respectively). We developed and mathematically analysed a one-consumer two-resource model in which juvenile and adult consumers utilise different resources as antagonists and mutualists, respectively. Model analyses illustrated that the consumer either goes extinct or coexists with the resources depending on the initial condition when the resources have low carrying capacities while their community dynamics always converge to a single steady state when the resources have high carrying capacities. These dynamic features are different from those of the corresponding purely antagonistic module in previous studies, in which the consumer always goes extinct for low resource carrying capacities while the dynamics converge to either juvenile-dominated or adult-dominated state depending on the initial conditions for high resource carrying capacities. Taken together, we can suggest that ontogenetic antagonismmutualism coupling is stabilising in that it increases the potential for species coexistence in unproductive environments while improving community resilience in productive environments. Further, these effects are generally robust to interaction nonlinearity. Beyond the previous concern of the instability in stage-structured food-webs, our results suggest that antagonismmutualism coupling can play a crucial role in stabilising stage-structured hybrid (e.g. plantanimal) communities under environmental changes. The present study represents an important first step in understanding how interaction type diversity can mediate the dynamics of stage-structured communities. © 2017 The Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030238187

Bulbophyllum, however, is unusual in that the labellar secretions of most species investigated to date lack sugars, and, therefore, cannot be considered true nectar. The African species Bulbophyllum saltatorium is an exception in that it produces not only nectar but also possesses specialized, capitate oleiferous trichomes. The nectary of B. saltatorium is borne on the labellum and is represented by a deep, narrow, median longitudinal groove, having a small aperture, and flanked by trichomes. Isodiametric epidermal cells lining this groove secrete nectar which collects both in the groove and on the surface of the labellum. As well as a nectary, the labellum of B. saltatorium also bears three types of unicellular trichomes: the longest trichomes are borne distally and abaxially; the marginal ones form a rim around the entire labellum, and finally, massive, capitate trichomes occur proximally and adaxially. These are oleiferous, containing large quantities of oil which might function as precursors of volatile components of fragrance or provide a food-reward. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time for such oleiferous trichomes to be described for Bulbophyllum. Therefore, apart from their color and markings, flowers of this species are able to attract pollinators in at least two, possibly three ways: food-reward in the form of nectar; fragrance; and possibly food-rewards in the form of food-hairs. © 2017, The Author(s).",African Bulbophyllum; Cell wall ingrowths; Flower morphology; Labellar micromorphology; Nectaries; Oleiferous trichomes; Section Ptiloglossum; Ultrastructure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029897256

However, the endosperm formation in apomictic Paspalum notatum Flüggé does not depend on the EBN. The aim of this work was to characterize gene expression during seed formation from apomictic and sexual P. notatum using complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism methodology. To induce the formation of seeds with different m:p genomic ratios, crosses were made between genotypes with different ploidy levels and reproductive modes. RNA was isolated from ovaries 24 h after pollination, when maximum endosperm growth rate was expected. Some of the 49 differen-tially expressed transcript-derived fragments (DETDFs) provided relevant information. Three of those were found in ovaries of apomictic plants with an EBN different from 2:1. A DETDF was predicted to be involved in sucrose metabolism during the accumulation of hexose and starch in the endosperm and might be related to EBN insensitivity. Twenty-two DETDFs were found in crosses where sexual plants were used as the female parent and the predicted m:p ratio was not 2:1. One of those was related to the failure of fusion of the polar nuclei in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Finally, three transcripts presented similarity with a casein kinase II that regulates the accumulation of storage products in seeds of A. thaliana. Both processes might be involved in endosperm development in P. notatum. © Crop Science Society of America | 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711 USA All rights reserved.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042531639

The BER incidence rate was zero in Apogee- and ABA-, medium in water-, and high in GA4 + 7-treated plants from 26 to 40 days after pollination (DAP). At 26 DAP, healthy blossom-end fruit tissue still not showing visible BER symptoms was used for transcriptome analysis. Candidate genes potentially inhibiting or triggering BER were identified through a correlation analysis between gene expression levels at 26 DAP and BER incidence rate from 26 to 40 DAP. Genes inhibiting BER should be up-regulated in Apogee- and/or ABA-treated fruit and down-regulated in GA4 + 7-treated fruit. Genes triggering BER should be down-regulated in Apogee- and/or ABA-treated fruit and up-regulated in GA4 + 7-treated fruit. Most of the candidate genes inhibiting BER have functions leading to higher resistance to oxidative stress and toxic compounds, whereas most of the candidate genes triggering BER have functions leading to higher levels of oxidative stress and cell death. The results suggest that Apogee and ABA inhibited BER possibly by increasing fruit tissue resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other toxic compounds, whereas GA4 + 7 triggered BER possibly by increasing the levels of fruit oxidative stress. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Abscisic acid; BER; Disorder; Gene; Gibberellin; Prohexadione-calcium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019942434

Persimmon (Diospyros kaki; 2n = 6x = 90) accumulates a large amount of proanthocyanidins (PAs) in its fruit, resulting in an astringent taste. Persimmon cultivars are classified into four types based on the nature of astringency loss and the amount of PAs at maturity. Pollination constant and non-astringent (PCNA)-type cultivars stop accumulating PAs in the early stages of fruit development and their fruit can be consumed when still firm without the need for artificial deastringency treatments. While the PCNA trait has been shown to be conferred by a recessive allele at a single locus (ASTRINGENCY; AST), the exact genetic determinant remains unidentified. Here, we conducted transcriptome analyses to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying this trait using developing fruits of an F1 population segregating for the PCNA trait. Comparisons of the transcriptomes of PCNA and non-PCNA individuals and hierarchical clustering revealed that genes related to the flavonoid pathway and to abiotic stress responses involving light stimulation were expressed coordinately with PA accumulation. Furthermore, coexpression network analyses suggested that three putative transcription factors were central to the PA regulatory network and that at least DkMYB4 and/or DkMYC1, which have been reported to form a protein complex with each other for PA regulation, may have a central role in the differential expression of PA biosynthetic pathway genes between PCNA and non-PCNA. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Abiotic stress; Coexpression network analysis; Diospyros kaki; Fruit transcriptome; Proanthocyanidins,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035328328

We measured uptake and dissipation of soil-applied imidacloprid and dinotefuran in nectar and leaves of 2 woody plant species, a broadleaf evergreen tree (Ilex × attenuata) and a deciduous shrub (Clethra alnifolia), to assess concentrations to which pollinators and pests might be exposed in landscape settings. Three application timings, autumn (postbloom), spring (prebloom), and summer (early postbloom), were evaluated to see if taking advantage of differences in the neonicotinoids systemic mobility and persistence might enable pest control while minimizing transference into nectar. Nectar and tissue samples were collected from in-ground plants and analyzed for residues by high-performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (HPLCMS/MS) in 2 successive years. Concentrations found in nectar following autumn or spring applications ranged from 166 to 515 ng/g for imidacloprid and from 70 to 1235 ng/gg for dinotefuran, depending on plant and timing. These residues exceed concentrations shown to adversely affect individual- and colony-level traits of bees. Summer application mitigated concentrations of imidacloprid (831 ng/g), but not dinotefuran (2351191 ng/g), in nectar. Our data suggest that dinotefuran may be more persistent than is generally believed. Implications for integrated pest and pollinator management in urban landscapes are discussed.

Pecan is a wind pollinated monoecious tree exhibiting heterodichogamy, and the location and timing of functioning female and male organs are different. The limited availability of pecan genomic information has hindered research on the mechanisms underlying its flower development. In this study, we obtained the first de novo assembly of pecan transcriptome and performed acomparative analysis of pecan female and male inflorescences using RNA-seq technology. A final dataset containing 53894 unigenes in the female pecan inflorescence was obtained, with an N50 length of 1411 bp, while only small differences existed among female and male inflorescence unigenes. Using the bioinformatics approach, we identified 11813 simple sequence repeats in unigenes and developed primers for 7725 of them. A total of 5826 differentially expressed genes were identified between pecan female and male inflorescences. A large number of them were linked to plant hormone regulation, especially revolved in the gibberellin biosynthesis (GA2OX and GA20OX), gibberellin signal reception (GID1) and gibberellin regulation (GASA, GRF, GRAS).

In contrast, species of drier environments, such as the restinga, may show different patterns. Here, we investigated a bromeliad from the southern Brazilian restinga, Aechmea kertesziae. We used nine nuclear microsatellite markers, two non-coding plastid sequences and controlled pollination experiments to examine the genetic structure and diversity across the geographical distribution of the species. Our results suggest demographic stability for A. kertesziae during the Quaternary, despite other restinga species showing demographic expansion. Aechmea kertesziae shows high genetic diversity, which is probably the result of its self-incompatibility, allied to the long-term persistence of the populations, constant population sizes and clonal reproduction. A strong phylogeographical break was identified with the plastid markers, recovering two main evolutionary lineages showing little gene flow between them. However, no geographical barrier could be associated with this deep Pliocene divergence. Moderate levels of genetic structure were detected with nuclear microsatellites, which was associated with a more recent habitat fragmentation process.

With these strategies, it is easy to select new types of B. napus, but difficult to select new types of B. rapa or B. oleracea by self-pollination. This characteristic May be a consequence of high competition with B. napus gametes. To verify the role of gamete viability in producing new B. napus individuals, the meiotic chromosome behavior of the interspecific hybrid between B. napus (Zhongshuang 9) and B. oleracea (6m08) was studied, and microspore-derived (MD) individuals were analyzed. The highest fitness of the 9:19 (1.10%) pattern was observed with a 5.49-fold higher than theoretical expectation among the six chromosome segregation patterns in the hybrid. A total of 43 MD lines with more than 14 chromosomes were developed from the hybrid, and 8 (18.6%) of them were B. napus-like (n = 19) type gametes, having the potential to broaden the genetic basis of natural B. napus (GD = 0.43 ± 0.04).

Here, pollen (palynological) richness and diversity (Hill N1) are compared with vegetation richness and diversity from forest and savannah ecosystems in the New World and Old World tropics (Neotropics and Palaeotropics).

Pollen counts were obtained from 15 to 22 traps per plot, and aggregated pollen sums for each plot were &gt; 2,500. The palynological richness/diversity values from the Neotropics were moist evergreen forest = 86/6.8, semi-deciduous dry forest = 111/21.9, wooded savannah = 138/31.5, and from the Palaeotropics wet evergreen forest = 144/28.3, semi-deciduous moist forest = 104/4.4, forest-savannah transition = 121/14.1; the corresponding vegetation richness/diversity was 100/36.7, 80/38.7 and 71/39.4 (Neotropics), and 101/54.8, 87/45.5 and 71/34.5 (Palaeotropics). No consistent relationship was found between palynological richness/diversity, and plot vegetation richness/diversity, due to the differential influence of other factors such as landscape diversity, pollination strategy, and pollen source area.

The identification of genes controlling panicle exsertion will play a central role in hybrid rice breeding. C115, a chromosome segment substitution line carrying introgression segments of Nipponbare in genetic background of indica variety 9311, had significantly shortened panicle exsertion, uppermost internode length and plant height. Genetic analysis in F2 and F3 populations derived from a cross of C115 and 9311 indicated that the shortened panicle exsertion of C115 was recessive and controlled by a single Medelian factor, and the allele from Nipponbare decreased the phenotypic value. Primary mapping suggested qPE12, the Nipponbare introgression segment locating on the long arm of chromosome 12, was responsible for this phenotypic variation. Based on map-based cloning strategy, fine mapping was carried out with a total of 1130 recessive individuals selected from F2 and F3 populations, delimiting qPE12 to a 190-kb region.

Molecular marker paternity assays may improve genetic gain in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) half-sib family breeding programs by utilizing a larger coefficient of additive genetic variation. To evaluate the potential to improve breeding outcomes by use of a molecular marker paternity assay in allotetraploid white clover (2n = 4x = 32), seven single-locus, homoeologue-specific simple sequence repeat markers were genotyped and analyzed on 1277 half-sib progeny and their 20 parents from a polycross pollinated by bumble bees (Bombus sp.). Paternity was assigned to 88.9% of progeny using a likelihood algorithm implemented in Cervus. Estimates of additive genetic variances from multisite, space-planted field experiments established in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) were used to predict selection responses. Joint maternal and molecular-marker-assayed paternal half-sib family selection offered improved theoretical selection gains relative to conventional maternal half-sib family selection for herbage yield and trifoliate center leaflet width. The estimated selection responses based on empirical parameters demonstrated the theoretical wisdom of incorporating molecular-marker-assayed paternity in white clover breeding programs as an effective tool to improve selection responses per cycle of selection. © Crop Science Society of America.

However, it is not well understood how these responses are influenced by inbreeding. We grew clones of self- and cross-pollinated offspring of Silene vulgaris (Caryophyllaceae) and measured a number of functional traits involved in stress responses under eight different treatments, including a control, drought, copper addition, simulated herbivory, and two levels of nutrient deficiency and shade. Inbreeding influenced phenotypic plasticity in some functional traits. In particular, the environmental sensitivity of four traits  stem length, leaf area, leaf chlorophyll content and specific leaf area  was lower in offspring from self- than from cross-pollination. Biomass allocation patterns changed in response to the environment in agreement with optimal partitioning theory, but were not influenced by inbreeding. Two traits potentially involved in general stress response  leaf senescence and anthocyanin production  were increased under copper stress and nutrient deficiency but reduced in the herbivory and shade treatments. Inbreeding did not increase these general stress responses, but reduced anthocyanin production in all stress treatments.

How orchid seeds attach to their substrate and survive after dispersal is largely unknown. C-lignin is a recently discovered specialized lignin, found in seed coats of some plants, including orchid species, but its functional and biological significance is obscure. We studied seed coat ontogenesis in three species (Neuwiedia veratrifolia, Cypripedium formosanum and Phalaenopsis aphrodite) that represent basal and advanced branches in orchid phylogeny and divergent life forms. From each species, controlled pollination yielded several stages of seed development, from which seed coats (testa) were isolated and analysed by ATR-FT-IR spectroscopy. The use of the ATR set-up ensured that the chemical information originated only from the integral outer seed surface layers. The FT-IR bands of C-lignin are presented here for the first time, and distinguished from bands of G/S-lignin. In the seed coats, C-lignin developed after G/S-lignin in N. veratrifolia and C. formosanum, while only G/S-lignin developed in P. aphrodite. We discuss C-lignin properties and possible function in relation to seed coat properties. The species differed with respect to sequence and amounts of deposition, not only of lignins but also lipids, resulting in differences in mature seed coat compositions. Thus we revealed an unexpected and marked diversity among orchids with respect to seed surface chemistry, with possible implications for seed and germination ecology. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2018.",Cypripedium formosanum; dust seeds; infrared spectroscopy; Neuwiedia veratrifolia; Orchidaceae; Phalaenopsis aphrodite; seed coat ontogenesis; surface chemistry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040346406

The timing and pattern of chalcidoid diversification is so far poorly understood and has left many important questions on the evolutionary history of Chalcidoidea unanswered. In this study, we infer the early divergence events within Chalcidoidea and address the question of whether or not ancestral chalcidoids were small egg parasitoids. We also trace the evolution of some key traits: jumping ability, development of enlarged hind femora, and associations with figs. Our phylogenetic inference is based on the analysis of 3,239 single-copy genes across 48 chalcidoid wasps and outgroups representatives. We applied an innovative a posteriori evaluation approach to molecular clock-dating based on nine carefully validated fossils, resulting in the first molecular clock-based estimation of deep Chalcidoidea divergence times. Our results suggest a late Jurassic origin of Chalcidoidea, with a first divergence of morphologically and biologically distinct groups in the early to mid Cretaceous, between 129 and 81 million years ago (mya). Diversification of most extant lineages happened rapidly after the Cretaceous in the early Paleogene, between 75 and 53 mya. The inferred Chalcidoidea tree suggests a transition from ancestral minute egg parasitoids to larger-bodied parasitoids of other host stages during the early history of chalcidoid evolution. The ability to jump evolved independently at least three times, namely in Eupelmidae, Encyrtidae, and Tanaostigmatidae. Furthermore, the large-bodied strongly sclerotized species with enlarged hind femora in Chalcididae and Leucospidae are not closely related. Finally, the close association of some chalcidoid wasps with figs, either as pollinators, or as inquilines/gallers or as parasitoids, likely evolved at least twice independently: in the Eocene, giving rise to fig pollinators, and in the Oligocene or Miocene, resulting in non-pollinating fig-wasps, including gallers and parasitoids. The origins of very speciose lineages (e.g., Mymaridae, Eulophidae, Pteromalinae) are evenly spread across the period of chalcidoid evolution from early Cretaceous to the late Eocene. Several shifts in biology and morphology (e.g., in host exploitation, body shape and size, life history), each followed by rapid radiations, have likely enabled the evolutionary success of Chalcidoidea. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",biological shifts; egg parasitoids; evolution; fig wasps; parasitoid wasps; Phylogenomics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039739591

Determining Ambrosia's evolutionary relationships has been the subject of much interest, with numerous studies using morphological characters, cytology, comparative phytochemistry, and chloroplast restriction site variation to produce conflicting accounts the relationships between Ambrosia species, as well as the classification of their close relatives in Franseria and Hymenoclea. To resolve undetermined intra-generic relationships within Ambrosia, we used DNA extracted from tissues obtained from seed banks and herbarium collections to generate multi-locus genetic data representing nearly all putative species, including four from South America. We performed Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic analyses of six chloroplast-genome and two nuclear-genome markers, enabling us to infer monophyly for the genus, resolve major infra-generic species clusters, as well as to resolve open questions about the evolutionary relationships of several Ambrosia species and former members of Franseria. We also provide molecular data supporting the hypothesis that A. sandersonii formed through the hybridization of A. eriocentra and A. salsola. The topology of our chloroplast DNA phylogeny is almost entirely congruent with the most recent molecular work based on chloroplast restriction site variation of a much more limited sampling of 14 North American species of Ambrosia, although our improved sampling of global Ambrosia diversity enables us to draw additional conclusions. As our study is the first direct DNA sequence-based phylogenetic analyses of Ambrosia, we analyze the data in relation to previous taxonomic studies and discuss several instances of chloroplast/nuclear incongruence that leave the precise geographic center of origin of Ambrosia in question. © 2017",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039446433

However, as the floral nectar can often not be directly detected by pollinators, many flower visitors use secondary metabolites such as odor- or taste-proxies to anticipate nectar quantity and quality. Plants might exploit these sensory inferences of the pollinator to increase their pollination rates without increasing their caloric investment into their floral rewards. Here we investigated the effects of natural variation in certain primary and secondary floral metabolites in three populations of the wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuata, on the pollination behavior of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Although offering the same caloric value per flower, the plants of these populations differ in the compositions and concentrations of sugars within the nectar. Moreover, the flowers of these plants emitted highly contrasting levels of attractive floral volatiles (benzyl acetone), but did not differ in the amounts of defensive nectar metabolites (nicotine). In wind tunnel assays with M. sexta moths, plants from those populations that released the largest amount of benzyl acetone as well as those that had a higher ratio of nectar sucrose were more frequently visited and re-visited by the hawkmoth. High emissions of benzyl acetone additionally correlated with a higher time investment of the moths into individual flowers on each visit, leading to the largest foraging success of the moths on those flowers that were most strongly scented. We propose that it is the variation of flower metabolites and their detection by the pollinator rather than the actual caloric value of the nectar, which determines pollinator visitations to a certain flower population. Hence, plants could potentially create a specialist pollinator community by altering their floral signals, either by producing volatiles that pollinators prefer or by providing nectar sugars that pollinators are most sensitive to, while at the same time keeping the caloric value of their nectar rewards at a constant level. These findings highlight the importance of variations among floral signals and their detection by specific pollinators for plant diversification as well as for the evolution of specific plant-pollinator interactions. © 2018 Haverkamp, Hansson, Baldwin, Knaden and Yon.",Chemosensation; Flower volatiles; Manduca sexta; Nectar; Nicotiana attenuata; Plant populations; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042790245

Initial reports noted that AtZHOUPI (AtZOU) coordinates endosperm breakdown and the concomitant separation of the embryo from this structure in Arabidopsis. The results of this study show that rice genomes contain two most closely related homologs of AtZOU, OsZOU-1 and OsZOU-2; of these, OsZOU-1 expression is limited to within the endosperm where it can be detected throughout this structure 5 days after pollination (DAP). Its expression gradually decreases from seven DAP to nine DAP.

Heterologous expression of OsZOU-1 and OsZOU-2 in Atzou-4 mutants also revealed that OsZOU-1 partially complements the seed phenotypes of these individuals, while its counterpart, OsZOU-2, was unable to recover these phenotypes. The over-expression of OsZOU-1 severely disrupts both seed development and plant growth in transgenic rice lines, as plants in which this gene has been knocked down failed in the separation of endosperm from embryo and cuticle formation during seed development. The results of this study therefore suggest that OsZOU-1 is orthologous to the AtZOU, and regulates both endosperm development and cuticle formation in rice. © 2018 Dou, Zhang, Yang and Feng.",Cuticle formation; Endosperm development; OsZOU-1; Rice; Transcription factors,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043342605

The Arabidopsis genome encodes six UXSs, which fall into two groups based upon their subcellular location: the Golgi lumen and the cytosol. The latter group appears to play an important role in xylan biosynthesis. Cytosolic UDP-Xyl is transported into the Golgi lumen by three UDP-Xyl transporters (UXT1, 2, and 3). However, while single mutants affected in the UDP-Xyl transporter 1 (UXT1) showed a substantial reduction in cell wall xylose content, a double mutant affected in UXT2 and UXT3 had no obvious effect on cell wall xylose deposition. This prompted us to further investigate redundancy among the members of the UXT family. Multiple uxt mutants were generated, including a triple mutant, which exhibited collapsed vessels and reduced cell wall thickness in interfascicular fiber cells. Monosaccharide composition, molecular weight, nuclear magnetic resonance, and immunolabeling studies demonstrated that both xylan biosynthesis (content) and fine structure were significantly affected in the uxt triple mutant, leading to phenotypes resembling those of the irx mutants. Pollination was also impaired in the uxt triple mutant, likely due to reduced filament growth and anther dehiscence caused by alterations in the composition of the cell walls. Moreover, analysis of the nucleotide sugar composition of the uxt mutants indicated that nucleotide sugar interconversion is influenced by the cytosolic UDP-Xyl pool within the cell. Taken together, our results underpin the physiological roles of the UXT family in xylan biosynthesis and provide novel insights into the nucleotide sugar metabolism and trafficking in plants. © The Author(s) 2017.

The degree to which spatial correlations in cyclic dynamics are the result of endogenous factors related to local dynamics vs. exogenous forcing has been one of the central questions in ecology for nearly a century. With the goal of obtaining a robust explanation for correlations over space and time in dynamics that would apply to many systems, we base our analysis on the Ising model of statistical physics, which provides a fundamental mechanism of spatial patterning. We show, using 5 y of data on over 6,500 trees in a pistachio orchard, that annual nut production, in different years, exhibits both large-scale synchrony and self-similar, power-law decaying correlations consistent with the Ising model near criticality. Our approach demonstrates the possibility that short-range interactions can lead to long-range correlations over space and time of cyclic dynamics even in the presence of large environmental variability. We propose that root grafting could be the common mechanism leading to positive short-range interactions that explains the ubiquity of masting, correlated seed production over space through time, by trees. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

The alliance offers an excellent opportunity for investigating perianth evolution and functional adaptations because of the presence of different numbers of petal whorls and contrasting floral chamber morphologies. The absence of the inner petal whorl in Dasymaschalon renders it distinctive in the family: previous studies have suggested that its three outermost stamens might be homologous with the inner petals of the sister genus, Friesodielsia, reflecting a homeotic shift of floral organ identify from inner petals to stamens. To investigate this hypothesis and general perianth evolution in the alliance, we (i) compared the floral vascularization of selected Dasymaschalon and Friesodielsia species using paraffin serial sectioning, and (ii) mapped selected perianth characters of inferred functional significance onto a molecular phylogenetic framework of the Dasymaschalon alliance (46 accessions; five cpDNA, and two nrDNA markers). The results indicate that the vasculature of the outermost stamen whorl of Dasymaschalon does not fuse with the perianth cortical vascular system, but instead splits from the basal traces of the free stamen bundles, contradicting previous inferences of homology with the inner corolla whorl of other Annonaceae. The loss of the inner petal whorl in Dasymaschalon is less likely to be due to a homeotic mutation, and instead possibly involved either the loss of genes that are responsible for determining inner petals or else the expression failure of these genes. Optimizations of perianth characters indicate that the absence of the inner petal whorl and the connivence of outer petals during anthesis are synapomorphic for Dasymaschalon. Circadian trapping of pollinators is inferred either to be derived in the stem lineage of the DasymaschalonFriesodielsia clade, or else to have evolved in parallel in the Dasymaschalon and Friesodielsia lineages. Subsequent changes in the remaining petals of Dasymaschalon flowers (which do not fully separate during anthesis) are likely to have enabled perpetuation of the circadian trapping mechanism, lessening the adverse impacts of inner petal loss. © 2018 Guo, Thomas and Saunders.",Annonaceae; Dasymaschalon alliance; Inner petal loss; Organ homology; Perianth evolution,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043310180

However, little research has been done on the degree and type of parthenocarpy in citrus, except a few Citrus cultivars. To increase the knowledge about parthenocarpy for cultivation and breeding of seedless citrus, 113 Citrus accessions including pummelo, mandarin and their relatives were investigated. In self-incompatible accessions flower buds just before anthesis were bagged, while in self-compatible accessions they were non-pollinated to examine autonomous parthenocarpy or style-removed three days after pollination to examine stimulative parthenocarpy. Fruit set rate in each treatment in the 113 accessions was recorded one month after anthesis and the mature fruits were harvested to examine their size and seedlessness. There was no clear difference between stimulative and autonomous parthenocarpy in Citrus accessions examined, indicating that fruit set and development in the accessions is due to autonomous parthenocarpy. The parthenocarpic fruit set occurred in 22 of 50 accessions for pummelo, 26 of 32 accessions for pummelo relatives, 3 of 9 accessions for yuzu and relatives, 12 of 21 accessions for mandarin and relatives, and 63 of 113 accessions in total.

Since Kishu mandarin (a seed parent of satsuma) and yuzu (a seed parent of Kabosu) showed very little or no parthenocarpic fruit growth, it was suggested that Kunenbo carried parthenocarpic genes to satsuma mandarin and the other Kunenbo relatives showing medium to high autonomous parthenocarpy.

Pollinator occupancy of host plants often depends on plant location, flowering synchrony and sex. The nursery pollination system between the dioecious dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis (Arecaceae) and the host-specific palm flower weevil Derelomus chamaeropsis was investigated. For the first time, sex, flowering synchrony and spatial distribution of plants was related to the occupancy probability and the abundance of D. chamaeropsis larvae, important traits influencing both pollinator and plant fitness. Methods During the flowering season, all inflorescences in anthesis were counted every 12 d and a flowering synchrony index was calculated taking into account all possible correlations with generalized linear mixed models. To analyse the spatial structure of plants, larva occupancy and abundance, different techniques of spatial point pattern analysis were used. Key results In total, 5986 larvae in 1063 C. humilis inflorescences were recorded over three consecutive seasons. Male inflorescences showed a higher presence and abundance of weevil larvae than females, but interestingly approx. 30 % of the females held larvae. Also, larvae occurred mainly in highly synchronous plants with a low number of inflorescences, perhaps because those plants did not lead to a resource dilution effect. There was no evidence of spatial patterns in larva occupancy or abundance at any spatial scale, suggesting high dispersal ability of adult weevil. Conclusions The results in a nursery-pollinated dioecious palm demonstrate that plant sex, flowering display and flowering synchrony act as additive forces influencing the presence and abundance of the specialized pollinator larvae. Contradicting previous results, clear evidence that female dwarf palms also provide rewarding oviposition sites was found, and thus the plant 'pays' for the pollination services. The findings highlight that plant local aggregation is not always the main determinant of pollinator attraction, whereas flower traits and phenology could be critical in specialized plant-pollinator interactions. © The Author(s) 2018.",Chamaerops humilis; Dioecious; Flowering synchrony; Mutualism; Pollinator weevil; Presence-abundance pollinator; Spatial point pattern analysis; Specialized pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042932749

This is particularly the case for cocoa midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), which are essential for cocoa pollination and thus yield, but agro-ecological management frequently neglects them. We report the first assessment of cocoa midge population dynamics from two Caribbean countries across a full year, and relate this to seasonal climate variables. We used static suction traps along transects to sample insects monthly, from six cocoa farms across three Caribbean islands, with a particular focus on known pollinators of cocoa. A total of over 87,000 insects were captured, including more than 1800 cocoa midges. Midges were present in all months of the survey and on all sites, but typically comprised less than 2% of the total insects caught. At least twelve different species of cocoa midges were identified from this survey. The previous month's rainfall positively predicted cocoa midge absolute abundance and further analysis also revealed a relationship between rainfall and relative midge abundance. In particular, during drought periods, midge numbers were very low, consistent with their larval ecology. Humidity and mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures did not relate to midge abundance. Rainfall negatively influenced the Shannon-Weaver index. The findings highlight the possible threat of droughts to cocoa pollination services and the importance of proactive farm management to support them. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Agroecology; Agroforestry; Biodiversity; Ceratopogonidae; Pollination; Rainfall,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034605475

However, several studies show that certain mass flowering crops, such as oilseed rape (OSR), can alter the pattern of pollinator abundance at a field and landscape level. These studies have focused mainly on bees; information about the effect of OSR crops on other taxa is missing. We evaluated the abundance of bees and other (non-bee) flower visitors, and the fruit set of insect-pollinated target plants (Raphanus sativus and Onobrychis viciifolia) on the margins of OSR and cereal fields in landscapes with varying densities of non-cropped habitats (landscape structure). The presence of OSR crops and wildflower resources in field margins had varying effects on the abundance of bees and non-bee flower visitors. Bee abundance was enhanced by OSR crops, but decreased in complex landscapes. On the other hand, the abundance of non-bee flower visitors depended on the landscape structure, particularly on the location of cereal fields. Despite the numerous and diverse communities of pollinators attracted by OSR crops and wildflower resources, fruit set was enhanced only for generalist insect-pollinated plant species, because competition processes for pollinators affect specialist plant species.

High configurational landscape heterogeneity due to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation. Agri-environment schemes should acknowledge the so far neglected benefits of small-scale agriculture for biodiversity and its potential services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Agri-environment schemes; Insect-pollinated plants; Landscape configuration; Pan trap; Pollinators; Trap nest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035101689

ERG plays a vital role in early seed development in Antirrhinum majus. However, the mechanism that regulates seed development remains unclear. Blasting the genome sequence revealed two homologies of ERG, AtERG1, and AtERG2 in Arabidopsis. In this study, we foundthat AtERG2 is localizedin the mitochondria andbinds mitochondrial 18S RNA. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that AtERG2 was mainly expressed in the leaf vein, trichome, and ovule. The T-DNA insertion lines of AtERG2 showed silique shortage, early seed abortion, and sporophytic maternal effects (SME), in which some seeds arrested in the zygotic stage at 1.5 days after pollination (DAP) and aborted at 2.0 DAP in aterg2-1 +/?. We further showed that the ovules of these arrested seeds presented unusual tissue degradation inside the embryo sacs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated at 1.0 and 1.5 DAP in the arrested seeds, and the transcription of several ROS-responsive genes, WRKY40, ANAC017, and AOX1a, was up-regulated in the aterg2-1 +/? arrested seeds at 1.5 and 2.0 DAP, but not in wild-type (WT) and aterg2-1 +/? developed seeds. The cell death-related gene BAG6 was also transcriptionally activated in aterg2-1 +/? seeds arrested at 2.0 DAP. Additionally, the protein level of mitochondria protein ATPase Subunit 6 was lower in 2-DAP siliques of aterg2-1 +/?than it was in those of WT. These results suggested that AtERG2 promotes early seed development by affecting the maturation of the mitochondria ribosome small subunit and mitochondrial protein translation in Arabidopsis. © 2018 Cheng, Li, Yuan, Li, Xi, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Zhao, Zhao and Han.",Arabidopsis; AtERG2; Cell death; Early embryo development; Mitochondria 18S RNA; ROS,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043350356

While reversing habitat loss on agricultural land is challenging, increasing the farmland configurational heterogeneity (higher field border density) and farmland compositional heterogeneity (higher crop diversity) has been proposed to counteract some habitat loss. Here, we tested whether increased farmland configurational and compositional heterogeneity promote wild pollinators and plant reproduction in 229 landscapes located in four major western European agricultural regions. High-field border density consistently increased wild bee abundance and seed set of radish (Raphanus sativus), probably through enhanced connectivity. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of crop-crop borders for pollinator movement as an additional experiment showed higher transfer of a pollen analogue along crop-crop borders than across fields or along semi-natural crop borders. By contrast, high crop diversity reduced bee abundance, probably due to an increase of crop types with particularly intensive management. This highlights the importance of crop identity when higher crop diversity is promoted. Our results show that small-scale agricultural systems can boost pollinators and plant reproduction. Agri-environmental policies should therefore aim to halt and reverse the current trend of increasing field sizes and to reduce the amount of crop types with particularly intensive management. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In the present study, we combine conventional analytical approaches with DNA meta-barcoding to identify pollen grains attached to migrating adults of the turnip moth, Agrotis segetum (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Northeast China. More specifically, pollen grains were dislodged from 2566 A. segetum long-distance migrants captured on Beihuang Island (Bohai Sea) and identified to many (plant) species level. Pollen belonged to 26 families of plants, including Fagaceae, Oleaceae, Leguminosae, Asteraceae, Pinaceae and Rosaceae, including common species such as Citrus sinensis, Olea europaea, Ligustrum lucidum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Castanopsis echinocarpa, Melia azedarach and Castanea henryi. As the above plants are indigenous to southern climes, we deduce that A. segetum forage on plants in those locales prior to engaging in northward spring migration. Our work validates the use of DNA-assisted approaches in lepidopteran pollination ecology research and provides unique and valuable information on the adult feeding range and geographical origin of A. segetum. Our findings also enable targeted (area-wide) pest management interventions or guide the future isolation of volatile attractants. © 2018 by the authors.

As a result, growers and researchers have utilized the restoration of local and landscape habitat diversity to support pollinators, and wild bees in particular. Although a majority of studies to date have focussed on effects in pollinator-dependent crops such as almond, tomato, sunflower, and watermelon, supporting wild bees in self-pollinated crops, such as grapes, can contribute to broader conservation goals as well as provide other indirect benefits to growers. This study evaluates the influence of summer flowering cover crops and landscape diversity on the abundance and diversity of vineyard bee populations. We showed that diversity and abundance of wild bees were increased on the flowering cover crop, but were unaffected by changes in landscape diversity. These findings indicate that summer flowering cover crops can be used to support wild bees and this could be a useful strategy for grape growers interested in pollinator conservation as part of a broader farmscape sustainability agenda. © The Author(s) 2017.

Despite the prevalence of aggregative nesting, the underlying drivers and fitness consequences of this behavior remain unclear. I investigated the effect of two key characteristics of nesting aggregations (cavity availability and progeny density) on reproduction and brood parasitism rates in the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria Say) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), a solitary species that nests gregariously and appears to be attracted to nesting conspecifics. To do so, I experimentally manipulated nest cavity availability in a region of northern Utah with naturally occurring populations of O. lignaria. Nest cavity availability had a negative effect on cuckoo bee (Stelis Montana Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) parasitism rates, with lower parasitism rates occurring in nest blocks with more available cavities. For both S. Montana and the cleptoparasitic blister beetle Tricrania stansburyi Haldeman (Coleoptera: Meloidae), brood parasitism rate was negatively correlated with log-transformed O. lignaria progeny density. Finally, cavity availability had a positive effect on male O. lignaria body weight, with the heaviest male progeny produced in nest blocks with the most cavities. These results suggest that cavity availability and progeny density can have substantial effects on brood parasitism risk and reproduction in this solitary bee species. © The Author(s) 2017.

When the ratio is disrupted, the seed development is impaired. Rice interploidy crosses result in endosperm failures, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that the defective endosperm in rice interploidy crosses was associated with nonadditive expression of small RNAs and protein-coding genes. Interestingly, 24-nt small interfering RNAs were enriched in the 5? and 3? flanking sequences of nonadditively expressed genes in the interploidy crosses and were negatively associated with the expression of imprinted genes. Furthermore, some PRC2 family genes and DNA methylation-related genes including OsMET1b and OsCMT3a were upregulated in the 2×4 cross (pollinating a diploid mother with a tetraploid father) but repressed in the reciprocal cross. These different epigenetic effects could lead to precocious or delayed cellularization during endosperm development. Notably, many endosperm-preferred genes, including starch metabolic and storage protein genes during grain filling, were found to be associated with DNA methylation or H3K27me3, which are repressed in both 2×4 and 4×2 crosses. WUSCHEL homeobox2 (WOX2)-like (WOX2L), an endosperm-preferred gene, was expressed specifically in the rice endosperm, in contrast to WOX2 expression in the Arabidopsis embryo. Disruption of WOX2L in transgenic rice by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing blocked starch and protein accumulation, resulting in seed abortion. In addition to gene repression, disrupting epigenetic process in the interploidy crosses also induced expression of stress-responsive genes. Thus, maintaining the 2m:1p genome ratio in the endosperm is essential for normal grain development in rice and other cereal crops. Interploidy crosses in rice disrupted expression of small RNAs, small RNA-associated genes including imprinted and endosperm-preferred genes, and epigenetic processes such as DNA and histone methylation, leading to abnormal cellularization during the grain-filling stage and, ultimately, endosperm failures and seed abortion. © 2017 The Author",endosperm; epigenetics; gene expression; polyploidy; seed; small RNA,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041611231

Wide variation in grain size and shape observed among Aegilops tauschii can be retained in synthetic allohexaploid wheats, but the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, the natural and resynthesized allohexaploid wheats with near-identical AB genomes and different D genomes (TAA10 and XX329) were employed for analysis. Results: Significant differences in grain size and weight between TAA10 and XX329 were observed at the early stages of development, which could be mainly attributed to the higher growth rates of the pericarp and endosperm cells in XX329 compared to TAA10. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis identified that 8891 of 69,711 unigenes (12.75%) were differentially expressed between grains at 6 days after pollination (DAP) of TAA10 and XX329, including 5314 up-regulated and 3577 down-regulated genes in XX329 compared to TAA10. The MapMan functional annotation and enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in categories of cell wall, carbohydrate and hormone metabolism. Notably, consistent with the up-regulation of sucrose synthase genes in resynthesized relative to natural allohexaploid wheat, the resynthesized allohexaploid wheat accumulated much higher contents of glucose and fructose in 6-DAP grains than those of the natural allohexaploid wheat. Conclusions: These data indicated that the genetic variation of the D genome induced drastic alterations of gene expression in grains of the natural and resynthesized allohexaploid wheats, which may contribute to the observed differences in grain size and weight. © 2018 The Author(s).",Allohexaploid wheat; D genome; Gene expression; Grain size and weight,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041390502

Transcriptomes define many of the tissue-specific gene expression patterns in maize, and some key genes and their regulatory networks have been established at the transcriptional level. In this study, the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra-mass spectrometry technique was employed as a quantitative proteome assay of four representative maize tissues, and a set of high-confidence proteins was identified. Integrated analysis of the proteome and transcriptome revealed that protein abundance was positively correlated with mRNA level with weak to moderate correlation coefficients, but the abundance of key proteins for function or architecture in a given tissue was closely tempospatially regulated at the transcription level. A subset of differentially expressed proteins, specifically tissue-specific highly expressed proteins, was identified, for example, reproductive structure and flower development-related proteins in tassel and ear, lipid and fatty acid biosynthetic process-related proteins in immature embryo, and inorganic substance and oxidation reduction responsive proteins in root, potentially revealing the physiology, morphology, and function of each tissue. Furthermore, we found many new proteins in specific tissues that were highly correlated with their mRNA levels, in addition to known key factors.

In intensive farming regions, such as the Upper Midwest (UMW) of the USA, natural and pastoral vegetation largely has been replaced by annual crops such as maize (Zea mays L.), soyabean (Glycine max L.) and wheat (Triticum spp.). Neither the energy (nectar) nor protein (pollen) needs of pollinating and other beneficial insects are being met sufficiently by the new, high-intensity, agricultural landscape. Several potentially useful oilseed crops can be grown in the UMW, and many of these oilseeds are highly attractive to beneficial insects. Prior research showed that some of these oilseeds produced abundant nectar, but their corresponding values for pollen production are unknown. Accordingly, the aim of our research was to document pollen (and protein) production per unit area of twelve oilseed crops grown in Minnesota and associate these values with levels of beneficial insect visitation during anthesis. Our results show that oilseed crops such as camelina (Camelina sativa L.), flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) produce relatively little pollen (?40 kg/ha); borage (Borago officinalis L.), calendula (Calendula officinalis L.), canola (Brassica napus L.), crambe (Crambe abyssianica Hochst) and cuphea (Cuphea viscosissima Jacq. × Cuphea lanceolata W. T. Aiton) produce bountiful pollen resources (50150 kg/ha); and oilseed echium (Echium plantagineum L.) generates massive amounts of pollen (>400 kg/ha), about 50% of which is protein. Our study is unique in presenting a season-long perspective of pollen production in alternative oilseed crops, a resource valuable to pollen-feeding insects such as managed and wild bees. Diversification of UMW landscapes that includes alternative oilseed crops such as oilseed echium and cuphea can potentially provide a ready source of pollen and protein to help combat pollinator decline.

However, impacts on relevant ecological functions such as insect pollination from other crop management factors are poorly explored. Pest insects and crop resources such as water availability can directly affect crop yields, but it is unknown if there are indirect effects through effects on insect pollination. With a factorial experiment, we examined how irrigation and control of pollen beetles affected crop attractiveness and pollinator visitation in an open-pollinated spring oilseed rape cultivar. We studied how irrigation and pest control modified the production of flowers and nectar in oilseed rape, and if this in turn affected the flower-visitation of honey bees and bumble bees. Pest control increased the number of oilseed rape flowers by 69%, and the amount of nectar per flower with 36%, but for the latter only in non-irrigated plots. Furthermore, we found higher pollinator densities in plots with reduced pollen beetle densities. Pest control also reduced the number of non-legitimate flower visits, suggesting higher pollination efficiency in plots with reduced pollen beetle densities. We show that crop management affects the value of mass-flowering crops as a resource for pollinating insects. Development of pest control tools that are harmless to pollinators could increase the value of flowering crops as food resources for pollinating insects. © 2017 Gesellschaft für Ökologie",Apis mellifera; Bombus; Brassica napus; Crop pollination; Irrigation; Nectar; Pollen beetle; Sclerotinia,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031493241

Climactic conditions influence the activity levels of blueberrys primary commercial pollinator, honey bee (Apis mellifera). Cool springs with frequent rainfall, which are common during the spring bloom period in western Washington, can reduce honey bee activity, pollination efficiency, and subsequent fruit set and yields. Increasing honey bee hive density may be a simple technique that growers can employ to increase the number of honey bees foraging during periods of good weather, interspersed with the poor weather, and therefore, increase fruit set and related yield components. The objective of this study was to evaluate if increased honey bee hive densities improve pollination and subsequent yield components in western Washington blueberry. Three field sites with mature Duke plants were stocked with 10 hives/ha of honey bees (control), and three other field sites (also Duke) were stocked with 20 hives/ha (high hive density). Honey bee visitation and yield components, including fruit set and berry weight, were measured. Estimated yield, seed number/berry, and fruit firmness were also monitored. There were no significant differences in fruit set regardless of honey bee hive density. However, honey bee visitation and estimated yield increased with increased honey bee hive density. Berry weight and seed number per berry were also increased with increased honey bee hive density, although firmness was unaffected. Results indicate that increasing honey bee hive densities can help blueberry growers improve berry size and overall yields, suggesting this is a practice growers can implement if their production is constrained by insufficient pollination. © 2018, American Society for Horticultural Science.

This framework proposes that species traits will explain how different species respond to disturbance (i.e. response traits) as well as their contribution to ecosystem function (i.e. effect traits). However, predictive response and effect traits remain elusive for most systems. Here, we use data on crop pollination services provided by native, wild bees to explore the role of six commonly used species traits in determining both species response to land-use change and the subsequent effect on crop pollination. Analyses were conducted in parallel for three crop systems (watermelon, cranberry, and blueberry) located within the same geographical region (mid-Atlantic USA). Bee species traits did not strongly predict species response to land-use change, and the few traits that were weakly predictive were not consistent across crops. Similarly, no trait predicted species overall functional contribution in any of the three crop systems, although body size was a good predictor of per capita efficiency in two systems. Overall we were unable to make generalizable predictions regarding species responses to land-use change and its effect on the delivery of crop pollination services. Pollinator traits may be useful for understanding ecological processes in some systems, but thus far the promise of traits-based ecology has yet to be fulfilled for pollination ecology. © 2017 The Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030086515

In animal-pollinated species, flower shape is strongly fashioned by selection imposed by pollinators, which is expected to vary according to guilds of effective pollinators. Using the Antillean subtribe Gesneriinae (Gesneriaceae), we tested the hypothesis that pollination specialists pollinated by one functional type of pollinator have maintained more similar corolla shapes through time due to more constant and stronger selection constraints compared to species with more generalist pollination strategies. Using geometric morphometrics and evolutionary models, we showed that the corolla of hummingbird specialists, bat specialists, and species with a mixed-pollination strategy (pollinated by hummingbirds and bats; thus a more generalist strategy) have distinct shapes and that these shapes have evolved under evolutionary constraints. However, we did not find support for greater disparity in corolla shape of more generalist species. This could be because the corolla shape of more generalist species in subtribe Gesneriinae, which has evolved multiple times, is finely adapted to be effectively pollinated by both bats and hummingbirds. These results suggest that ecological generalization is not necessarily associated with relaxed selection constraints. © 2017 The Author(s).

Size-based pollinator exclusion experiments combined with visual observations showed that presence of honey bees (Apis mellifera jemenitica) was important for pollination and thereby the production of fruits and seeds. Smaller insects, mainly species of stingless bees (Hypotrigona spp. and Liotrigona cf. bottegoi) and solitary bees (Compsomelissa borneri) could partly compensate pollination in absence of honey bees, but fertilisation and fruit yield was reduced. A positive correlation between fertilisation percentage and number of honey bee colonies within radii of 900 and 1000 m was observed. The percentage of fertilisation and number of mature fruits per fascicle were higher in trees with colonies of stingless bees in the trunk when honey bees were excluded by bagging. We conclude that local beekeeping with honey bees and stingless bees is likely to have a positive influence on fruit production of shea trees in the farmed West African parklands, which speaks in favour of a pollinator friendly environment. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Agroforestry parklands; Honey bees; Pollination; Solitary bees; Stingless bees; Vitellaria paradoxa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983399875

These interactions could potentially shift between mutualism and parasitism, depending on the presence and abundance of both the nursery pollinator and of other pollinators. We investigated the fitness trade-off in a Mediterranean plant (Silene latifolia), which has a specialist nocturnal nursery pollinator moth (Hadena bicruris) and is also visited by several diurnal pollinators. We estimated the pollination rates and fecundity of S. latifolia in both natural and experimental populations in the Mediterranean. We estimated natural pollination rates in different flowering times and with presence/absence of the H. bicruis moth. Then by exposing plants to each pollinator group either during the day or at night, we quantified the contribution of other diurnal pollinators and the specialized nocturnal nursery pollinator to plant female fitness. We found no difference in plant fruit set mediated by diurnal versus nocturnal pollinators, indicating that non-specialist pollinators contribute to plant female fitness. However, in both natural and experimental populations, H. bicruris was the most efficient pollinator in terms of seeds produced per fruit. These results suggest that the female fitness costs generated by nursery pollination can be overcome through higher fertilization rates relative to predation rates, even in the presence of co-pollinators. Quantifying such interactions is important for our understanding of the selective pressures that promote highly specialized mutualisms, such as nursery pollination, in the Mediterranean region, a centre of diversification of the carnation family. © The Author(s) 2018.

Three doses of pyraclostrobin and control were used as treatments such as 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin, and repeated three times. Percentage of fallen flower, fruiting stage, fruit production, frequency of bee`s visitation, and bee`s behavior was observed as variables in this experiment. Results showed that 1) percentage of fallen flowers was reduced by applying pyraclostrobin at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 up to 50 % compared to control, 2) flowering rate was faster than control at 1.5 and 2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin, 3) application of 1.5  2.0 cc L-1 of pyraclostrobin increased the number of young fruits and pinheads, and 4) pollinators preferred to visit flowers of coffee trees which sprayed by pyraclostrobin than control treatment especially Apis mellifera. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.",Apis indica; Apis mellifera; Arabica coffee; Fallen flower; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038228510

In addition, we assume that the insect population reduces the number of visits to the plants after several unsuccessful visits. We are interested in the conditions for the coexistence of both species, especially in the appearance of damped or sustained oscillations. We focus the analysis on the parameters that measure the balance among deceit, the benefit that the insect gets from the plant, and the learning by the pollinators.

During daily foraging in agricultural landscapes, they encounter a mosaic of patches with nest and foraging habitat and unsuitable matrix. It is insufficiently clear how spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources and foraging traits of bees affect their daily foraging performance. We investigated potential brood cell construction (as proxy of fitness), number of visited flowers, foraging habitat visitation and foraging distance (pollination proxies) with the model SOLBEE (simulating pollen transport by solitary bees, tested and validated in an earlier study), for landscapes varying in landscape fragmentation and spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources. Simulated bees varied in body size and nesting preference. We aimed to understand effects of landscape fragmentation and bee traits on bee fitness and the pollination services bees provide, as well as interactions between them, and the general consequences it has to our understanding of the system. This broad scope gives multiple key results. 1) Body size determines fitness more than landscape fragmentation, with large bees building fewer brood cells. High pollen requirements for large bees and the related high time budgets for visiting many flowers may not compensate for faster flight speeds and short handling times on flowers, giving them overall a disadvantage compared to small bees. 2) Nest preference does affect distribution of bees over the landscape, with cavity-nesting bees being restricted to nesting along field edges, which inevitably leads to performance reductions. Fragmentation mitigates this for cavity-nesting bees through increased edge habitat. 3) Landscape fragmentation alone had a relatively small effect on all responses. Instead, the local ratio of nest to foraging habitat affected bee fitness positively through reduced local competition. The spatial coverage of pollination increases steeply in response to this ratio for all bee sizes. The nest to foraging habitat ratio, a strong habitat proxy incorporating fragmentation could be a promising and practical measure for comparing landscape suitability for pollinators. 4) The number of flower visits was hardly affected by resource allocation, but predominantly by bee size. 5) In landscapes with the highest visitation coverage, bees flew least far, suggesting that these pollination proxies are subject to a trade-off between either longer pollen transport distances or a better pollination coverage, linked to how nests are distributed over the landscape rather than being affected by bee size. © 2018 Everaars et al.

Ceratopogonid midges are considered to be the main pollinators, but the limited available evidence on the sexual reproduction is based almost exclusively on cultivated cacao and knowledge is nonexistent for wild populations. We documented flower visitors in wild and cultivated plants by applying glue on 2237 flowers of wild and cultivated cacao trees in Bolivia to trap floral visitors. We caught 631 insects belonging to seven orders, corresponding to a mean capture rate of 0.3 insects per flower. The most abundant and diverse insect order on both cacao types was Hymenoptera, represented mainly by small parasitoids. Hymenoptera were more abundant on wild cacao, whereas species richness was higher on cultivated cacao. The abundance and species richness of Diptera were not significantly different between wild and cultivated cacao. However, species composition and proportion of Diptera species differed between both wild and cultivated cacao. Ceratopogonidae were only represented by 13 individuals belonging to seven species. Cacao pollen was carried by only a single specimen of Encyrtidae. We were thus unable to identify actual pollinators. We found significant differences among the visitor assemblages between wild and cultivated cacao, which suggest that midges alone were probably too rare to act as main or even sole pollinators of cacao in our study region. Potential additional pollinators would be small Diptera (e.g., Chloropidae and Phoridae) and Hymenoptera (e.g., Eulophidae and Platygastridae). © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Diptera; Forcypomyia; Hymenoptera; Midge; Pollinator,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989199315

Due to self-incompatibility, the development of new varieties was largely based on mutant selection from the predominant variety Glasers Rote. By crossing Glasers Rote with wild types from South Africa in the 1980th, new cross-based varieties arose. Since the cultivation of cross-based varieties, precocious floral withering has been observed more frequently in production areas, suggesting that successful fertilization through open-pollination induces early floral senescence. A cluster analysis of current varieties based on AFLP markers confirmed the close relationship of old varieties and showed the expanded genetic diversity of cross-based varieties. Cross-experiments revealed that both, crosses of Glasers Rote-based genotypes with new cross-based genotypes and crosses between new genotypes, were successful. In contrast, selfings as well as crosses between old genotypes failed to produce seeds due to inhibition of pollen tube growth. Interestingly, we detected one self-compatible genotype, which provides new possibilities for breeding. No significant effect of open-pollination on the flowering period was observed by studying 16 genotypes, including old and new ones. This circumstance allows the mixed cultivation of different varieties in one production area. However, the flowering period was significantly affected by genotype and environment, suggesting that environmentally adapted varieties with long flowering periods can be bred. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",AFLP; Cross compatibility; Floral withering; Flowering time; Pollination; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041705010

Here, we use a comparative approach to investigate spontaneous and learned colour preferences in foraging bees of two tropical and one temperate species. We hypothesised that tropical bees utilise different sets of plants and therefore might differ in their spontaneous colour preferences. We tested colour-naive bees and foragers from colonies that had been enclosed in large flight cages for a long time. Bees were shortly trained with triplets of neutral, UV-grey stimuli placed randomly at eight locations on a black training disk to induce foraging motivation. During unrewarded tests, the bees responses to eight colours were video-recorded. Bees explored all colours and displayed an overall preference for colours dominated by long or short wavelengths, rather than a single colour stimulus. Naive Apis cerana and Bombus terrestris showed similar choices. Both inspected long-wavelength stimuli more than short-wavelength stimuli, whilst responses of the tropical stingless bee Tetragonula iridipennis differed, suggesting that resource partitioning could be a determinant of spontaneous colour preferences. Reward on an unsaturated yellow colour shifted the bees preference curves as predicted, which is in line with previous findings that brief colour experience overrides the expression of spontaneous preferences. We conclude that rather than determining foraging behaviour in inflexible ways, spontaneous colour preferences vary depending on experimental settings and reflect potential biases in mechanisms of learning and decision-making in pollinating insects. © 2017, The Author(s).",Foraging decisions; Learning and memory; Pollination; Sensory bias; Sensory ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039990595

These techniques present a tough competition to traditional numerical methods which suffer from convexity and continuity assumptions and which normally employ a gradient based search that is sensitive to the initial solution. While initial BI techniques suffered from limitations such as premature convergence and dependence on control parameters, eventually, these issues were specifically addressed by improved variants and many novel BI methods. The population based computing methods are particularly attractive for solving multi-objective (MO) problems due to their capability of producing a large number of Pareto-optimal solutions in one run. In this paper, an integrated ranking index (IRI) composed of TOPSIS and fuzzy-min concept is proposed as a performance metrics to aggregate the different objectives. The performance of eight handpicked recent BI techniques is compared for the solution of wind integrated multi-objective optimal power dispatch (MOOD) problem for simultaneous minimization of fuel cost and emission.

Plant-flower visitor networks yield insights into how natural vegetation supports crop pollination. Although crops themselves also support pollinators, the importance of spillover of flower-visiting pollinators from natural vegetation into croplands is increasingly appreciated. Natural vegetation not only provides forage and nesting sites, but can also support crop flower visitors when the crop is not flowering. We evaluated indirect effects between mango (the dominant tropical fruit crop globally) and wild plant species in neighbouring vegetation, and the factors determining these indirect effects, by constructing flower visitor networks. We constructed these networks for transects that included mango fields and neighbouring natural vegetation in north-eastern South Africa. Surveys were conducted before, during and after mango flowering, to allow evaluation of the importance of pollinator support when the crop was not in flower. Network analysis showed that potential indirect effects of other plant species on mango increased with flower abundance of those species, although this increase was less marked for species growing in natural vegetation. The cumulative (total, i.e. indirect effects summed) effect of natural vegetation on mango flower visitation was greater both during mango flowering and when it was not flowering. This is likely because of the greater plant diversity in natural systems, and because the combination of these species provided flowers over a protracted period.

The oviposition choices of phytophagous insects determine the environment that their offspring will experience, affecting both larval performance and host plant fitness. These choices, however, may be influenced by other activities, such as nectar foraging. 2. In the Sonoran Desert, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) oviposits primarily on the perennial herb Datura wrightii. It has been reported to oviposit on the smaller-flowered, co-blooming, sympatric annual Datura discolor as well. Datura is also M. sexta's most important source of nectar in this region. Nectaring and oviposition decisions thus determine M. sexta's reproductive success, as well as the relative benefits (pollination) and costs (herbivory) that each Datura species derives from this interaction. 3. The nectaring and oviposition choices of adult M. sexta on these congeners were studied to investigate how nectar foraging influences oviposition. Larval performance on the two hosts was then assessed. 4. Nectaring and oviposition were behaviourally linked, with M. sexta preferring the perennial D. wrightii as both a nectar source and larval host when given a choice between the two species. This preference disappeared, however, when only D. discolor bore flowers. 5. In the laboratory, larvae developed at equal rates when fed D. wrightii or D. discolor leaves, but survival was higher on D. wrightii when larvae fed on intact plants. 6. These findings suggest that while female preferences match larval performance in most cases, the link between nectaring and oviposition may at times bias moths to lay eggs on inferior larval hosts. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",Herbivory; Manduca sexta; oviposition decisions; pollination; preferenceperformance hypothesis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030655807

Here, we extend multivariate permutation-based phylogenetic regression to evaluate trait correlations in two sets of interacting species while accounting for their respective phylogenies. This extension is appropriate for both univariate and multivariate response data, and may use one or more independent variables, including environmental covariates. Imperfect correspondence between species in the interacting lineages can also be accommodated, such as when species in one lineage associate with multiple species in the other, or when there are unmatched taxa in one or both lineages. For both univariate and multivariate data, the method displays appropriate type I error, and statistical power increases with the strength of the trait covariation and the number of species in the phylogeny. These properties are retained even when there is not a 1:1 correspondence between lineages.

Ecological network analysis is a useful tool for evaluating factors that alter the interaction structure and resistance of systems to species loss, but is rarely applied across multiple empirical networks sampled within the same study. The non-random arrangement of species interactions within a community, or network structure such as nested or modular organization, is predicted to prevent extinction cascades in ecological networks. How ecological gradients such as disturbance regimes shape network structural properties remains poorly understood despite significant efforts to quantify interaction structure in natural systems. Here, we examine changes in the structure of plantfloral visitor networks in a tallgrass prairie using a decadal and landscape-scale experiment that manipulates prescribed burn frequency and ungulate grazing, resulting in different grassland states. Plant and floral visitor communities and accompanying network structure were impacted by grassland fire and grazing regimes. The presence of grazers increased flowering plant species richness, network floral visitor species richness, and decreased network nestedness. Fire frequency affected flowering plant and floral visitor community composition; community composition impacted network specialization and modularity. Grassland state resulting from fire-grazing interactions has important implications for the resistance of flowering plant and floral visitor communities to species loss. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Community ecology; Disturbance; Ecological networks; Interactions; Pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035752283

In montane regions, where climate change is expected to cause earlier snow melt but may not change the last frost-free day of the year, plants that bud earlier might be directly impacted by frost through damage to flower buds and reproductive structures. However, the indirect effects of frost mediated through changes in plantpollinator interactions have rarely been explored. We examined the direct and pollinator-mediated indirect effects of frost on three wildflower species in southwestern Colorado, USA, Delphinium barbeyi (Ranunculaceae), Erigeron speciosus (Asteraceae), and Polemonium foliosissimum (Polemoniaceae), by simulating moderate (?1 to ?5°C) frost events in early spring in plants in situ. Subsequently, we measured plant growth, and upon flowering measured flower morphology and phenology. Throughout the flowering season, we monitored pollinator visitation and collected seeds to measure plant reproduction. We found that frost had species-specific direct and indirect effects. Frost had direct effects on two of the three species. Frost significantly reduced flower size, total flowers produced, and seed production of Erigeron. Furthermore, frost reduced aboveground plant survival and seed production for Polemonium. However, we found no direct effects of frost on Delphinium. When we considered the indirect impacts of frost mediated through changes in pollinator visitation, one species, Erigeron, incurred indirect, negative effects of frost on plant reproduction through changes in floral traits and pollinator visitation, along with direct effects. Overall, we found that flowering plants exhibited species-specific direct and pollinator-mediated indirect responses to frost, thus suggesting that frost may play an important role in affecting plant communities under climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",climate change; frost; phenology; plant reproduction; plantpollinator interactions; pollination services,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041312889

This study estimates the production of soybean resulting from pollination by honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) in two consecutive growing seasons in Paraná (Argentina). Experiments had two treatments: excluded flower-visiting insects (EV) and non-excluded flower-visiting insects (NEV). The abundance of honeybees was similar in both years, although soybean production differed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) between years. The NEV treatment out-yielded (P &lt; 0.001) the EV treatment by 18% (5224 vs. 4415 kg ha?1) in year 1, which was associated with an increase in the seeds per unit area but not with individual seed weight. In contrast, seed yield (on average 3830 kg ha?1) and seeds per unit area did not differ between treatments in year 2. Individual seed weight was 35% (P &lt; 0.05) higher in EV than in NEV in both years. The mechanisms involved in the seed yield increase could be related with pollen sterility in relegated flowers in secondary racemes or in distal locations of primary racemes under favorable conditions, as recorded in year 1. Thus, the action of honeybees carrying pollen from fertile flowers to relegated flowers may have increased the pod and seed set in treatment NEV in year 1. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS.",foraging hours; honeybees; pollination; seed yield; soybean,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042323006

A translocation event in common bean and soybean is confirmed against Apios and Vigna species. Abstract: Apios (Apios americana; apios), a tuberous perennial legume in the Phaseoleae tribe, was widely used as a food by Native Americans. Work in the last 40 years has led to several improved breeding lines. Aspects of the pollination biology (complex floral structure and tripping mechanism) have made controlled crosses difficult, and the previous reports indicated that the plant is likely primarily an outcrosser. We used a pseudo-testcross strategy to construct a genetic map specific to the maternal parent. The map was built using single-nucleotide polymorphism markers identified by comparing the expressed sequences of individuals in the mapping population against a de novo maternal reference transcriptome assembly. The apios map consists of 11 linkage groups and 1121 recombinationally distinct loci, covering ~ 938.6 cM. By sequencing the transcriptomes of all potential pollen parents, we were able to identify the probable pollen donors and to discover new aspects of the pollination biology in apios. No selfing was observed, but multiple pollen parents were seen within individual pods. Comparisons with genome sequences in other species in the Phaseoleae showed extended synteny for most apios linkage groups. This synteny supports the robustness of the map, and also sheds light on the history of the Phaseoleae, as apios is relatively early diverging in this tribe. We detected a translocation event that separates apios and two Vigna species from Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max. This apios mapping work provides a general protocol for sequencing-based construction of high-density linkage maps in outcrossing species with heterogeneous pollen parents. © 2017, The Author(s).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032208012

Studies addressing single plant-animal interactions are common, but studies simultaneously considering multiple plant-animal interactions in a landscape context are still scarce. We selectively excluded flower-visiting insects on phytometer plants and quantified how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions shaped the reproductive success of a common annual plant, wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis). Floral herbivory by larvae of rape pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) strongly reduced fruit production, but could be minimized by insecticide application. Total seed production (the product of fruit production and seeds per fruit) strongly increased with pollinator visitation. On average, pollinator access to plants enhanced seed numbers by 754%. Insecticide treatment almost redoubled this number. The landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitats in 1000 m radius) surrounding phytometer plants did not affect plant-animal interactions, presumably due to the high dispersal ability of both the pollen beetles and the major pollinators (syrphid flies, bumblebees). In conclusion, pest control increased reproductive success only in the case of sufficient pollination. © 2018 Grass et al.",Brassicaceae; exclusion experiment; florivory; herbivory; landscape; plant-animal interaction; pollination; reproductive fitness; Sinapis arvensis,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043700743

In 2013, a widespread and episodic flowering event provided an opportunity to characterize how Joshua trees reproductive success and population structure vary in response to the climate variability across its range. We examined the reproductive success and stand structure of 10 Joshua tree populations distributed across the Mojave Desert. Joshua tree density varied by more than an order of magnitude across sites. At 8 of the 10 sites, nearly 80% of the Joshua trees were in bloom, and at the other two 40% were in bloom. The range of seed production and fruit set across the study populations varied by more than an order of magnitude. Fruit production occurred at all of our study sites suggesting that yucca moth pollinators were present at our sites. Increasing temperature had strong positive correlations with the number of trees in bloom (R2 = 0.42), inflorescences per tree (R2 = 0.37), and fruit mass (R2 = 0.77) and seed size (R2 = 0.89. In contrast, temperature was negatively correlated with Joshua tree stand density (R2 = -0.80). Positive correlations between temperature and greater flower and seed production suggest that warming may positively affect Joshua Tree reproduction while negative relationships between temperature and stand density are suggestive of potential constraints of warmer temperatures on establishment success.

While local factors of bee decline are relatively well known and potential mitigation strategies at the landscape scale have been outlined, the regional and continental-scale threats to bee diversity have only been marginally explored. Here we document large-scale spatial patterns for a representative bee subfamily, the determinants of its species richness, and assess major threats to these pollinators. Using a comprehensive global dataset of Colletinae (genera Colletes, also called polyester or cellophane bees for their underground nests lined with a polyester secretion, and Mourecotelles), a species-rich subfamily whose organismal and physiological ecology is representative of many bees, we measured species richness and endemism on global to continental scales. We explored the relationships between bee species richness and potential environmental stress factors grouped into three categories: contemporary climate, habitat heterogeneity, and anthropogenic pressure. Bees of the subfamily Colletinae demonstrate the reversed latitudinal gradient in species richness and endemism suggested for bees; the highest species richness of Colletinae was found between 30° and 50° latitude in both the northern and southern hemispheres. Centres of endemism largely overlapped with those of species richness. The importance of the Greater Cape Floristic Region, previously identified as a centre of richness and endemism of bees, was confirmed for Colletinae. On the global scale, present-day climate was a significant predictor of species richness as was flowering plant diversity represented by vascular plant species richness and centres of plant diversity. Our main conclusion is that climate change constitutes a potential threat to bee diversity, as does declining diversity of vascular plants. However, a significant overlap between centres of bee richness and plant diversity might increase chances for developing conservation strategies. © 2017, The Author(s).",Cape Region; Colletidae; Invertebrates; Latitudinal diversity gradient; Macroecological analysis; Species richness; Weighted endemism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029543316

We studied a population in Uberlândia, Central Brazil, observing floral biology features, diversity of visitors and breeding system. Flowers showed diurnal anthesis and a single-day life span. Pollen was the only floral resource offered, and poricidal anthers were clustered in the centre of the flower, while style was bent away from flower axis creating a transient herkogamy and flower monosymmetry. Style moves towards the floral axis during the day facilitating pollination. To date we do not know other Tococa species displaying such stylar features, which may be an intermediate form between the actinomorphic Miconieae and specialized zygomorphic Tococa. Contrasting with previous studies, the self-incompatibility found in T. guianensis indicates that transient herkogamy may function to avoid stigma clogging with self-pollen and allow flexible use of specialized buzz-pollinating bees. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",Buzz pollination; Floral biology; Melastomataceae; Miconieae; Monosymmetry; Transient herkogamy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033680676

Flower resources such as pollen and nectar are provided by the vine plants as well as other flowering plants including cover crops grown between the vine rows. Little is known about how management and landscape context affects bee communities in pollinator-independent crop systems such as grapevine. This study investigates the effect of organic versus conventional management on bee species richness and abundance in vineyards in Italy and South Africa both having a Mediterranean climate. In each country, six pairs of organic and conventional vineyards were studied in simplified and complex agricultural landscapes. A total of 433 bee individuals from 25 species and 1049 individuals from 15 species were recovered in pan traps from Italy and South Africa respectively. Bee abundance showed region specific response to the effects of vineyard management. Flowering plants and proportion of uncultivated land mediated differences in bee abundance. Higher flowering plant species richness and flower density were found in organic vineyards compared to conventional vineyards in South Africa but these flowering plant indices were not significantly different between the two vineyard management types in Italy. This emphasizes the necessity for local and region specific studies for informing conservation, as even in the same crop system with a similar climate, the effects of farm management differed between countries. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Landscape complexity; Mediterranean-type ecosystems; Organic versus conventional management; Pollinator abundance and diversity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035801852

This procedure detects all sidelobe peaks form the samples of the radiation pattern in the entire visible region. For illustration, a low sidelobe radiation pattern synthesis problem is formulated for two concentric regular hexagonal antenna array (CRHAA) geometries, having 6- and 8- rings. To verify the extent of applicability of the proposed procedure, both broadside and scanned array configurations are considered. Feed current amplitudes are considered as the optimizing variables. Two variations of current distributions are considered, i) identical feed for all the elements on a ring (hence the one variable per ring needs to be optimized), and ii) asymmetric excitation distribution (set of excitation amplitude of all elements as optimizing variables). The design objective has been considered to optimize the radiation patterns with very low interference from the entire sidelobe region. To restrict the fall of directivity value, a constraint on the lower limit of directivity value is considered. The impacts of symmetry and the constraint on directivity on the search of these algorithms are studied.

The species has been facing declines in many areas of the world, the causes being identified as multifactorial. Recently, it has been theorised that some plant-dwelling animals may develop a dependence on the medicinal properties of their hots plants secondary metabolites. Here, the question of honey bee self-medication using organic materials, namely propolis, nectar, honey, honeydew, pollen, wood, and algae for self-medication is addressed. Self-medication in honey bees is a largely unexplored area and thus a comprehensive overview of the field is provided. Prior studies suggest that recent honey bee colony declines are driven by decreased forage plant availability. The problem is expanded and it is suggested, that if honey bees developed a dependence on medical properties of some disappearing plants or materials, this could explain a part of the colony losses observed around the world. To date, convincing evidence points towards self-medication with honey and propolis. Bees also contact plant secondary metabolites, fatty acids, essential oils, and microorganisms that are active against the causative agents of American foulbrood, European foulbrood, nosemosis, chalkbrood, stonebrood, and varroasis. In the future, selected taxa of plants with medicinal properties may be planted to boost honey bee health without chemotherapy.

Reproductive phenology and vectors of parasitic plant genes (pollinators and dispersers) can contribute to or erode reproductive isolation of populations infecting different host species. We asked whether desert mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum (Santalaceae tribe Visceae syn. Viscaceae), differs ecologically across its dominant leguminous hosts in ways affecting reproductive isolation. Parasite flowering phenology on one host species (velvet mesquite, Prosopis velutina) differed significantly from that on four others, and phenology was not predicted by host species phenology or host individual. Comparing mistletoe populations on mesquite and another common host species (catclaw acacia, Senegalia greggii) for which genetically distinct host races are known, we tested for differences in interactions with vectors by quantifying pollinator visitation, reward production, pollen receipt, and fruit consumption. Mistletoes on mesquite produced more pollinator rewards per flower (1.86 times the nectar and 1.92 times the pollen) and received ~ 2 more pollen grains per flower than those on acacia. Mistletoes on the two host species interacted with distinct but overlapping pollinator communities, and pollinator taxa differed in visitation according to host species. Yet, mistletoes of neither host showed uniformly greater reproductive success. Fruit set (0.70) did not differ by host, and the rates of fruit ripening and removal differed in contrasting ways. Altogether, we estimate strong but asymmetric pre-zygotic isolating barriers between mistletoes on the two hosts. These host-associated differences in reproduction have implications for interactions with mutualist vectors and population genetic structure. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Mistletoe; Phenology; Pollination; Reproductive isolation; Seed dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037664293

In grassland working landscapes managed for ecological services and livestock production, it is essential to understand the influence of grazing practices on biodiversity to guide conservation. We used grassland butterflies to investigate the effects of four grazing management practices on biodiversity and pollination services from 2015 to 2016. We hypothesized grazing management practices would generate differing floristic resources that would thereby influence grassland butterfly community composition. To address our hypothesis, we sampled floral resources using belt transects and butterfly community and species level dynamics using line-transect distance sampling. We detected 2578 butterflies representing 34 species. Management practice was not a significant predictor of floral (p = 0.319) or butterfly community composition (p = 0.604), and sites under the same management showed dissimilarity in ordination space, indicating differences that may not be associated with grazing practices. At the species level, management explained density for six of nine butterfly species, but no individual management practice was optimal for a majority of detected species. Thus, over the timeframe of this study, grazing management practices did not generate differences in floristic community composition to drive community-level responses in grassland butterflies. Rather, management drove differences in individual species abundance within the butterfly community, likely contributing to the butterfly diversity observed at a broader scale. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Butterfly; Disturbance; Fire; Grazing; Pollinator; Tallgrass prairie,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043784543

Bats deserve attention because they occupy different trophic niches and perform different functions in nature, acting as flower pollinators (nectarivores), seed dispersers (frugivores), and pest controllers (insectivores). The effects of climate change on the distribution of bat species occurring in the Carajás National Forest (Eastern Amazon, southeastern Pará state, Brazil) was examined by modeling species distributions. A total of 83 species of bats providing the above mentioned services were analyzed for the years 2050 and 2070 to answer the following two questions: (i) Which species are potentially more sensitive to climate changes and will not be able to find suitable areas in Carajás in the future, and (ii) Which are the priority areas that protect the greatest number of species from climate change. Of the total species analyzed, 47 (57%) will potentially not find suitable areas in Carajás under the scenarios employed. Pollinators, seed dispersers, and more-generalist (omnivorous) bats will potentially be the most affected, suffering a 2836% decrease in suitable area under the 2070 scenario, which may have implications for the plants with which those species interact. According to the scenarios employed, the Carajás National Forest, as well as other conservation units in Pará, will not protect most species in the future. The most suitable areas are located mainly to the north and west of the state and under varying degrees of conservation: from well-preserved protected areas to areas degraded due to different anthropogenic impacts. This study emphasizes that the possible effect of climate change and the location of species protection areas need to be analyzed together to ensure that the areas that will act as potential climate refuges for species in the future are indeed protected. © 2017",Biodiversity; Clime; Conservation; Ecological interactions; Trophic niche,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039760636

Moench] would create opportunities for greatly reducing tillage and preventing soil degradation. Efforts to select for perenniality and grain production among progeny of hybrids between S. bicolor (2n = 20) and the weedy tetraploid perennial S. halepense (L.) Pers. (2n = 40) are complicated in that F1 hybrids produced by diploid × tetraploid sorghum crosses are usually tetraploid. In 2013, a set of random pollinations between 19 diploid cytoplasmic male-sterile inbred lines and 43 tetraploid perennial plants produced 165 F1 hybrid plants, more than 75% of which had highly atypical plant, panicle, and seed phenotypes. Phenotypic segregation in F2 populations derived from atypical hybrids was also anomalous. Examination of mitotic metaphase cells in F1 or F2 root tips revealed that 129 of the 165 hybrids were diploid. Parentage of the diploid progenies was confirmed using simple-sequence repeat analysis. The mechanism by which diploid hybrids arise from diploid × tetraploid crosses is unknown, but it may involve either production of monohaploid (n = 10) pollen by the tetraploid parent or chromosome elimination during early cell divisions following formation of the triploid zygote. The ability to produce diploid germplasm segregating for S. bicolor and S. halepense alleles could have great utility, both for the development of perennial sorghum and for the improvement of conventional grain sorghum. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Chromosome; Genetic resource; Germplasm enhancement; Interspecific hybridization; Perennial; Ploidy; Sorghum breeding,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033395001

However, this pattern is not always evident in the progeny. The present study aimed to assess the relationship of parental distance with the agronomic performance of raspberry families and three estimators based on non-environmental effects: specific combining ability, general combining ability, and best linear unbiased prediction. A total of 35 genotypes, including eight open-pollinated raspberry cultivars and their 28 F1 hybrids, were scored for vegetative and fruit traits. The relationship between estimators and parental distance ranged from 0.02 to 0.66. The estimators based on purely additive effects were superior to the per se performance of raspberry crosses. Additionally, it was observed that the specific combining abilityas an estimator associated with the parental genetic relatednessperformed poorly, and low correlation coefficients were observed for most of the traits. It was found that the degree of association for the estimators increased when narrow-sense heritability was high. It is concluded that the estimators based on only additive effects show a better association with parental relatedness, and therefore parental distance was an effective parameter in identifying crosses with high yield and large fruit size. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Additive effect; Best linear unbiased prediction; General combining ability; Hybrid performance; Parental genetic relatedness; Rubus idaeus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041368770

Plants however can employ chemical defences to reduce bacteria density. In North American, bee-pollinated Penstemon digitalis, the nectar volatile S-(+)-linalool can influence plant fitness, and terpenes such as linalool are known for their antimicrobial properties suggesting that it may also play a role in plantmicrobe interactions. Therefore, we hypothesized linalool could affect bacterial growth on P. digitalis plants/flowers. Because P. digitalis emits linalool from nectar and nectary tissue but not petals, we hypothesised that the effects of linalool could depend on tissue of origin due to varying exposure. We isolated bacteria from nectary tissue, petals and leaves, and compared their growth relative to control using two volatile concentrations representing the natural emission range of linalool. To assess whether effects were specific to linalool, we compared results with the co-occurring nectar volatile, methyl nicotinate. We show that response to floral volatiles can be substance and tissue-origin specific. Because linalool could slow growth rate of bacteria across the P. digitalis phyllosphere, floral emission of linalool could play a role in mediating plantbacteria interactions in this system. © 2018, The Author(s).",Anti-microbial; Phyllosphere; Plant defence; Scented nectar; Volatile organic compounds (VOCs),Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043261556

Self-compatibility is a requirement for reproductive assurance via selfing and may therefore be beneficial in environments with infrequent or unpredictable pollinator service. However, self-compatible plants may spatially separate anthers from stigmatic surface within flowers (herkogamy), potentially preventing autonomous self-pollination while promoting outcrossing. We investigated the effects of herkogamy on patterns of mating in a self-compatible, homostylous alpine herb, Primula halleri, which evolved from obli-gately outcrossing, heterostylous ancestors. Primula halleri displays diminishing herkogamy during anthesis, affecting its capacity for self-pollination. Specifically, we tested whether higher herkogamy at the end of anthesis (terminal herkogamy) promotes higher outcrossing rates at the cost of lower seed set, while lower terminal herkogamy ensures seed set via self-pollination at the cost of inbreeding. Methodology. We estimated family- and population-level genetic outcrossing rates in four populations using microsatellites and derived an estimate for inbreeding depression. We tested effects of different levels of terminal herkogamy on means and variances of outcrossing rates. We also assessed whether seed set was resource or pollen limited. We interpreted results in light of previously published data on seed set with and without pollinator-exclusion treatment. Pivotal results. Population-level outcrossing rates ranged between 0.5 and 0.8. Outcrossing rates of plants with higher terminal herkogamy had similar means but lower variances than those of plants with lower terminal herkogamy. This result demonstrates that separation between sexual organs larger than 1 mm in mature flowers favors outbreeding, while below this threshold, delayed selfing ensures reproduction. Conclusions. Contrary to long-held notions about the association of homostyly and selfing, we provide new genetic evidence that the homostylous P. halleri adopts a mixed mating system due to variable herkogamy. Moreover, our results support a trade-off between seed number and seed quality effected through variation in herkogamy, illustrating that herkogamy affects multiple aspects of reproductive fitness simultaneously. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

We used sequential exploratory mixed methods to compare landowner and conservation practitioners perceptions, evaluate perceived benefits, and identify potential improvements to CRP. Focus groups of practitioners informed a quantitative survey of landowners who had properties >160 total acres in Nebraska. Results suggest potential misalignment in perceptions between practitioners and landowners. Practitioners were concerned that conservation, especially of wildlife, was secondary to profit. But the majority of landowners valued CRP-related ecosystem services, including native pollinators. Practitioners posited that younger landowners were primarily profit motivated, but CRP enrollment did not differ by demographics. Practitioners and landowners identified rule complexity as a major challenge and practitionerlandowner relationships as critical to success.

In North America, this species has been introduced numerous times from a variety of different source populations in Europe and Africa. Since then, feral populations have expanded into many different environments across their broad introduced range. Here, we used whole genome sequencing of historical museum specimens and newly collected modern populations from California (USA) to analyze the impact of demography and selection on introduced populations during the past 105 years. We find that populations from both northern and southern California exhibit pronounced genetic changes, but have changed in different ways. In northern populations, honey bees underwent a substantial shift from western European to eastern European ancestry since the 1960s, whereas southern populations are dominated by the introgression of Africanized genomes during the past two decades. Additionally, we identify an isolated island population that has experienced comparatively little change over a large time span. Fine-scale comparison of different populations and time points also revealed SNPs that differ in frequency, highlighting a number of genes that may be important for recent adaptations in these introduced populations. © The Author(s) 2018.

The software incorporates user-defined initial parameters and input files to account for the initial census size of two species in a closed population, the number of intermediate specific classes, the directional fertility among specific classes, the fitness coefficients for each specific class, the inheritance of fitness, and the degree of ageing and self-incompatibility of the individuals. All these demographic and adaptive parameters can be modified by the user to analyze their effect on the evolution of the mixed population. SIMHYB allows the traceability of each individual, whose pedigree is also recorded. For each simulated generation the software yields an output file that is easily convertible to an input for STRUCTURE, one of the most popular soft-wares for the Bayesian analysis of populations. Application of SIMHYB to simulate Quercus ilex and Q. suber hybridizing populations, and further analysis with STRUCTURE, reveals that advanced introgressed individuals are very often misclassified with the currently available set of nuclear microsatellite markers, so that introgression between these two species could have been underestimated in previous studies.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, there is interest in developing herbicide-resistant TK germplasm by a variety of means, including selection, transgene insertion, and gene editing. The potential release of such germplasm raises the question of gene flow between TK and its ubiquitous weedy relative, the common dandelion, Taraxacum officinale (TO). The potential for introgression may be influenced by the reproductive biology of TO, which can exist as a diploid sexual or polyploid obligate apomict. In North America, only polyploid, apomictic TO has been described. As weedy TO types exhibit obligate apomixis, they are expected to be unreceptive to TK pollen; however, it may still be possible for them to pollinate TK. To this end, unidirectional crosses were conducted and progeny were evaluated with molecular markers. Taraxacum officinale pollen used to fertilize TK flowers produced low seed set and seeds with a low germination rate. However, 23% of rare viable progeny proved to be the result of true hybridization. Outdoor TK seed production areas heavily contaminated with TO were also screened for naturally occurring hybridization during a three-year period using a combined strategy of both phenotyping (~3.35 million plants) and genotyping. Hybrids were detected during one of these years, at a rate of 1 in 100,000, when pollination was augmented with beehives. Hybrids from controlled crosses exhibited TO characteristics, such as lacerate leaves and apomixis. Some apomictic hybrids were able to produce viable seeds, whereas non-apomicts were sterile. Seeds produced by apomictic hybrids demonstrated the ability to establish and produce apomictic progeny when in competition with perennial ryegrass. The prevalence of apomixis in TO may limit subsequent pollen-mediated gene flow and introgression, but more work is needed to understand the longevity of apomictic hybrids under natural conditions. © 2018 Iaffaldano et al.",gene flow; hybridization potential; rubber; Taraxacum kok-saghyz; Taraxacum officinale,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043712891

As an important nutrient resource for pollinators, including honeybees and bumblebees, pollen quality is of growing interest in assessing available nutrition to foraging bees. To date, quantifying the protein-bound amino acids in pollen has been difficult and methods rely on large amounts of pollen, typically more than 1 g. More usual is to estimate a crude protein value based on the nitrogen content of pollen, however, such methods provide no information on the distribution of essential and non-essential amino acids constituting the proteins. Here, we describe a method of microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis using low amounts of pollen that allows exploration of amino acid composition, quantified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), and a back calculation to estimate the crude protein content of pollen. Reliable analysis of protein-bound and free amino acids as well as an estimation of crude protein concentration was obtained from pollen samples as low as 1 mg. Greater variation in both protein-bound and free amino acids was found in pollen sample sizes <1 mg. Due to the variability in recovery of amino acids in smaller sample sizes, we suggest a correction factor to apply to specific sample sizes of pollen in order to estimate total crude protein content. The method described in this paper will allow researchers to explore the composition of amino acids in pollen and will aid research assessing the available nutrition to pollinating animals. This method will be particularly useful in assaying the pollen of wild plants, from which it is difficult to obtain large sample weights. © 2017 The Authors.

Methods: Children with nasal symptoms from grass pollen induced rhinitis but without rhinosinusitis symptoms were selected. Their parents were asked to complete a diary during pollen exposure to report nasal symptoms and drugs used daily. When rhinosinusitis was suspected, the confirmatory diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis was made by fibro-endoscopy. Children without inhalant allergy served as controls. Results: Seventeen out of 242 children (7.0 per cent) had a diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis, confirmed by fibro-endoscopy, during grass pollination, compared to 3 out of 65 (4.6 per cent) in the control group (p = 0.49). Among allergic children, those with acute rhinosinusitis had symptoms for a greater number of days and/or a higher symptoms score than children without acute rhinosinusitis. Conclusion: Children with grass pollen induced rhinitis during exposure to pollen have an incidence of endoscopically confirmed acute rhinosinusitis comparable to non-allergic children. This suggests that grass pollen induced rhinitis is a negligible risk factor for acute rhinosinusitis.

ZmMs7 is isolated by a map-based cloning approach and encodes a PHD-finger transcription factor orthologous to rice PTC1 and Arabidopsis MS1. The MCS transgenic maintainer lines are developed based on the ms7-6007 mutant transformed with MCS constructs containing the (i) ZmMs7 gene to restore fertility, (ii) ?-amylase gene ZmAA and/or (iii) DNA adenine methylase gene Dam to devitalize transgenic pollen, (iv) red fluorescence protein gene DsRed2 or mCherry to mark transgenic seeds and (v) herbicide-resistant gene Bar for transgenic seed selection. Self-pollination of the MCS transgenic maintainer line produces transgenic red fluorescent seeds and nontransgenic normal colour seeds at a 1:1 ratio. Among them, all the fluorescent seeds are male fertile, but the seeds with a normal colour are male sterile. Cross-pollination of the transgenic plants to male-sterile plants propagates male-sterile seeds with high purity. Moreover, the transgene transmission rate through pollen of transgenic plants harbouring two pollen-disrupted genes is lower than that containing one pollen-disrupted gene. The MCS system has great potential to enhance the efficiency of maize male-sterile line propagation and commercial hybrid seed production. © 2017 The Authors.

Comparing phylogenetically related species that differ in ecology can help identify factors that select for flower colors. We compared the distribution of inflorescence colors of the 98 spiny versus the 189 non-spiny species of the Asteraceae in the flora of Israel, and found significant differences between the two groups. Yellow/white inflorescences dominate the non-spiny species, while pink/purple/blue flowers dominate the spiny plants. We hypothesize that the pink/purple/blue flowering of the spiny species may advertise their deterring spines to mammalian herbivores. This putative aposematic signal is particularly conspicuous in summer, when the surrounding landscape turns yellow and grazing pressure is highest. Additional potential adaptive functions for pink/purple/blue flowering in summer-blooming species include increased visibility to pollinators, and improved protection from radiation damage due to the flowers high anthocyanin content. The pollinator attraction and radiation defense hypotheses, however, do not account for the observation that the spiny species that flower in yellow/white and in pink/purple/blue have overlapping blooming periods, as do yellow/white and pink/purple/blue flowers of non-spiny species. Phylogenetic constraints may further influence Asteracean flowering colors, a hypothesis that is partially consistent with our data. Spine colors differ significantly from flower color in the spiny species, suggesting that spine and flower colors may have evolved in response to different selective agents. Proximately, the different colors of flowers and spines may reflect the cellular location of pigments in different cell types (anthocyanic red parenchyma versus yellow carotenized lignified hard cells). © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Defense; Evolution; Herbivory; Inflorescence; Thorns,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037713271

Absent frequent disturbance, remnant tallgrass prairie rapidly converts to a dominant cover of woody plants. This creates unique challenges for conservation of prairie-specialist insects dependent on increasingly small and isolated habitats prone to direct and indirect threats from climate variability, habitat degradation, and management activities; or lack thereof. Regal fritillary butterflies (Speyeria idalia) exemplify this problem, with sharp population declines in recent decades and considerable disagreement on management practices, particularly in the use of prescribed burning to maintain habitat. Spanning 20-years (19972016), we evaluated regal fritillary populations within seven sites in relation to fire, habitat, and climate records to better understand these interacting effects on interannual and long-term population changes. Though fire had short-term negative effects on regal fritillary abundance, habitat quality was one of the most important factors explaining populations and was positively associated with prescribed fire. Burning every 35 years maximized regal fritillary abundance, but even annual burning was more beneficial to regal populations than no burning at all. Unburned refugia are important in maintaining populations, but creating and maintaining high quality habitat with abundant violets (Viola spp) and varied nectar sources, may be the most impactful management and conservation tool. Regal fritillary butterflies were consistently more than twice as abundant on high quality habitats and this relationship held across, and often dwarfed the effects of, various prescribed fire regimes or climate variability. © 2017",Grasslands; Habitat quality; Pollinators; Prairie; Prescribed fire; Regal fritillary,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037686223

This study assessed the influence of seed and pollen dispersal, as well as the effect of demographic and genetic features on the magnitude of fine-scale spatial genetic structure (SGS). Sampling was performed in 11 plots where 50 neighboring adult trees were sampled from each plot, while biparentally and paternally inherited genomes were used for analysis with microsatellites. Fine-scale SGS was significant but showed contrasting patterns among plots. Although the magnitude of SGS in C. brevifolia mainly results from restricted seed dispersal, short-distance pollen dispersal could also explain fine-scale SGS in some plots, which is rather uncommon in wind-pollinated conifer species. The lack of a general and consistent trend of SGS among plots and between genomes indicates that pollen and seed dispersal varies at plot level. The complex SGS patterns in C. brevifolia may result from the unequal ratio of male and female strobilies of trees within the same plots, at different reproductive periods. Demographic features such as habitat fragmentation did not influence the magnitude of SGS in C. brevifolia, whereas low tree aggregation reduced it. Further, the significant correlation observed between linkage disequilibrium (LD) and plots with significant SGS supports the assumption that under specific conditions, LD is likely to be caused by the magnitude of SGS. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Conifer; Forest; Gene flow; Genetic diversity; Linkage disequilibrium; Microsatellites,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041291252

Four remnant populations of different sizes were investigated. Eight highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to genotype 534 adults and 704 embryos. We used contrasting sampling schemes and different methodological approaches to analyze the pollen flow. We observed a lower rate of inbreeding and correlated mating in the fragmented vs. the non-fragmented subpopulation. Using parentage analysis, we detected a bidirectional pollen movement across subpopulations. Pollen flow was found to be directed towards small subpopulations based on parentage and anisotropic analysis. Pollen immigration amounted to more than 50%. Although most pollination occurred within a distance of less than 200 m, longer distance pollen movements of more than 3 km were also detected. Pollen dispersal in the large and dense subpopulation was reduced, and a smaller number of effective pollen sources were detected compared to a smaller fragmented subpopulation. We obtained consistent estimates for the number of effective pollen donors (approximately 6 per mother tree) using three different methods. The average pollen dispersal distance at the landscape level amounted to 276 m while at the local level, 174 m was estimated. Bigger trees were better pollen contributors than smaller trees.

This study reports the first use of the DArTseq platform to genotype two closely related self-pollinated oil palm populations, namely AA0768 and AA0769 with 48 and 58 progeny respectively. Genetic maps were constructed using the DArT and SNP markers generated in combination with anchor SSR markers. Both maps consisted of 16 major independent linkage groups (2n = 2× = 32) with 1399 and 1466 mapped markers for the AA0768 and AA0769 populations, respectively, including the morphological trait shell-thickness (Sh). The map lengths were 1873.7 and 1720.6 cM with an average marker density of 1.34 and 1.17 cM, respectively. The integrated map was 1803.1 cM long with 2066 mapped markers and average marker density of 0.87 cM. A total of 82% of the DArTseq marker sequence tags identified a single site in the published genome sequence, suggesting preferential targeting of gene-rich regions by DArTseq markers. Map integration of higher density focused around the Sh region identified closely linked markers to the Sh, with D.15322 marker 0.24 cM away from the morphological trait and 5071 bp from the transcriptional start of the published SHELL gene. Identification of the Sh marker demonstrates the robustness of using the DArTseq platform to generate high density genetic maps of oil palm with good genome coverage.

The granular pouches are two groups of cells on the abaxial side of the stamens of three of the ten species examined. They vary slightly in shape and position and the way in which they develop. In all three the cell contents become granular, then the walls break down and finally disappear living the granules free. Polarized light, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy have shown these granules to be crystals. Although one test for crystal composition was positive for calcium oxalate, two others were not. Poricidal dehiscence in nine of the species is accomplished by resorption and/or collapse tissues. Resorption tissue alone occurs in two species, both in one, and six species have only collapse tissue. Cells of both tissues are initially meristematic. Resorption tissue develops crystals and breaks down in the same way as granular pouches. Cells of collapse tissue vacuolate, flatten and disappear without formation of crystals. In only one species a well-developed endothecium appears to function as in most angiosperms. Granular pouches have not been reported for any other family. Poricidal dehiscence is present in a few other families as are tissues similar to resorption and collapse tissues. It is suggested that 1) the endothecium may have gradually been replaced by resorption tissue and this by collapse tissue; 2) granular pouches may be portions of obsolete resorption tissue. Characteristics of Enkianthus campanulatus stamens support the designation of a new subfamily (Enkianthoideae). It might appear that the unusual characteristics of ericaceous stamens could be related to pollination mechanisms, but confirmatory studies are practically nil in the literature. © 2017",Anther dehiscence; Ericaceae; Granular pouches; Poricidal dehiscence; Stamen development,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038966773

Moench) and maize (Zea mays L.) in Africa. Trap cropping systems have been shown to be a valuable tool in management of this pest. To optimize trap cropping strategies, an understanding of host-plant preference for moth oviposition and host suitability for larval survival on potential trap plants is a prerequisite. Therefore, we assessed seven brachiaria accessions (Poaceae) for preference by C. partellus moths and subsequent larval performance. In two-choice tests with a local open-pollinated maize variety (cv. Nyamula), significantly higher numbers of eggs were deposited on brachiaria accessions Marandu, Piata, and Xaraes than on maize, whereas fewer eggs were recorded on plants of Mulato II, Mulato I, and Cayman. There was a significant and negative correlation between the trichome density on plant leaves and C. partellus oviposition preference for brachiaria. In addition to poor larval performance on brachiaria, there was no clear ranking in the accessions regarding larval orientation, settling, arrest, and food ingestion and assimilation. First instars did not consume leaf tissues of brachiaria plants but consumed those of maize, which also suffered more stem damage than brachiaria plants. No larvae survived on brachiaria plant tissue for longer than 5 days, whereas 79.2% of the larvae survived on maize.

We used 41,304 SNP markers and compared pedigree vs. marker-based genetic models by analysing height, diameter, basic density and pulp yield for Eucalyptus urophylla × E.grandis control-pollinated families represented by 949 informative individuals. We evaluated models accounting for additive, dominance, and first-order epistatic interactions (additive by additive, dominance by dominance, and additive by dominance). We showed that the models can capture a large proportion of the genetic variance from dominance and epistasis for growth traits as those components are typically not independent. We also showed that we could partition genetic variances more precisely when using relationship matrices derived from markers compared to using only pedigree information. In addition, phenotypic prediction accuracies were only slightly increased by including dominance effects for growth traits since estimates of non-additive variances yielded rather high standard errors. This novel result improves our current understanding of the architecture of quantitative traits and recommends accounting for dominance variance when developing genomic selection strategies in hybrid Eucalyptus. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Breeding strategy; Dominance; Epistasis; Heritability; Predictive ability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036529490

We tested the relative contribution of geographic and environmental isolation in genetic and phenotypic divergence within and between two species of the figwort Ameroglossum (Scrophulariaceae) inhabiting spatially isolated habitats, known as inselbergs. Location: Borborema Plateau, north-eastern Brazil. Methods: Multivariate models of redundancy (RDAs) and partial redundancy analyses (pRDAs) were used to partition the geographic and climate components of genetic variation in 48 microsatellite alleles, and phenotypic variation in 11 leaf and flower traits. We also used linear mixed-effect models (LMEs) to test independent associations of floral tube length variation among inselbergs with local pollinator phenotypes, climate and geography. In each approach, we analysed the data for each species separately and in pooled models for both species. Results: RDAs revealed that genetic variation within and between the species of Ameroglossum was associated similarly with geography and climate. Phenotypic variation within A. manoel-felixii and between species was also associated similarly with geography and climate but, within A. pernambucense, phenotype was more strongly associated with climate. Linear mixed-effect models revealed that flower divergence in A. manoel-felixii was associated only with the bill length of local hummingbirds, whereas floral variation in A. pernambucense was associated with geography, bill length and climate. Only climate was associated with flower divergence between species. Main conclusions: Genetic and phenotypic variation in Ameroglossum are associated with geographic and environmental isolation. These findings indicate a significant role of ecological factors shaping plant divergence among inselbergs, irrespective of their spatial distances. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Ameroglossum manoel-felixii; Ameroglossum pernambucense; genetic divergence; genetic drift; inselbergs; isolation by distance; isolation by environment; local adaptation; phenotypic divergence,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041668736

About half of the species in the tribe are currently assigned to the genus Eucera and to a few other related genera. In this large genus complex, comprising ca. 390 species, the boundaries between genera remain ambiguous due to morphological intergradation among taxa. Using ca. 6700 aligned nucleotide sites from six gene fragments, 120 morphological characters, and more than 100 taxa, we present the first comprehensive molecular, morphological, and combined phylogenetic analyses of the Eucera complex. The revised generic classification that we propose is congruent with our phylogeny and maximizes both generic stability and ease of identification. Under this new classification most generic names are synonymized under an expanded genus Eucera. Thus, Tetralonia, Peponapis, Xenoglossa, Cemolobus, and Syntrichalonia are reduced to subgeneric rank within Eucera, and Synhalonia is retained as a subgenus of Eucera. Xenoglossodes is reestablished as a valid subgenus of Eucera while Tetraloniella is synonymized with Tetralonia and Cubitalia with Eucera. In contrast, we suggest that the venusta-group of species, currently placed in the subgenus Synhalonia, should be recognized as a new genus. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate convergent loss or gain of important diagnostic traits to minimize the use of potentially homoplasious characters when establishing classifications. Lastly, we show that the Eucera complex originated in the Nearctic region in the late Oligocene, and dispersed twice into the Old World. The first dispersal event likely occurred 24.216.6 mya at a base of a clade of summer-active bees restricted to warm region of the Old World, and the second 13.912.3 mya at the base of a clade of spring-active bees found in cooler regions of the Holarctic. Our results further highlight the role of Beringia as a climate-regulated corridor for bees. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Ancestral range construction; Bees; Beringia; Cladistics; Divergence time estimation; Homoplasy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033447956

The simulation-based data sets included 50 samples of 1000 individuals of seven populations derived from a common population with linkage disequilibrium. The populations had non-inbred and inbred progeny structure (50 to 200) with varying number of members (5 to 20). The individuals were genotyped for 10,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotyped for a quantitative trait controlled by 10 QTLs and 90 minor genes showing dominance. The SNP density was 0.1 cM and the narrow sense heritability was 25%. The QTL heritabilities ranged from 1.1 to 2.9%. We applied mixed model approaches for both GWAS and genomic prediction using pedigree-based and genomic relationship matrices. For GWAS, the observed false discovery rate was kept below the significance level of 5%, the power of detection for the low heritability QTLs ranged from 14 to 50%, and the average bias between significant SNPs and a QTL ranged from less than 0.01 to 0.23 cM. The QTL detection power was consistently higher using genomic relationship matrix. Regardless of population and training set size, genomic prediction provided higher prediction accuracy of complex trait when compared to pedigree-based prediction. The accuracy of genomic prediction when there is relatedness between individuals in the training set and the reference population is much higher than the value for unrelated individuals. © 2017, Institute of Plant Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Poznan.",False discovery rate; Genomic prediction; Mapping precision; Power of QTL detection; Prediction accuracy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041773992

Plants were subjected to the following treatments: Only fertilized with 20 kg N ha-1 at sowing and with 40 kg N ha-1 at 25 days after emergence (DAE) (F); only inoculated with Rhizobium tropici strain SEMIA 4080 at sowing and fertilized with 40 kg N ha-1 at 25 DAE (I+N); and inoculated and fertilized with 20 kg N ha-1 at sowing and with 40 kg N ha-1 at 25 DAE (IF). An additional treatment was done only in the second season and plants were inoculated with no N fertilization at any phase (I-N). Crop growth rate and leaf area index were enhanced by IF and F treatments as compared to I+N treatment, however, net assimilation rate did not differ among the treatments. At the pollination and flowering stages for seasons, LSPC was significantly increased by IF treatment, which also caused the highest final yield compared with the remaining treatments in both seasons. Therefore, the fertilization with 20 kg N ha-1 at sowing together with inoculation and 40 kg N ha-1 at 25 DAE is recommended for obtaining high yield in bean cultivation with high technology. As the inoculation with Rhizobium at sowing and fertilization with 40 kg N ha-1 at 25 DAE (I+N) had the same crop yield as plants fertilized at sowing and at 25 DAE (F), it can be recommended for a low-cost technology cultivation employed by small farmers. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040367379

However, the use of DNA testing to deliver legal evidence has been very limited in the agro-food chain, also because in this field, a genetic concordance is rarely sustained with indications on the interpretation and statistics of a DNA profile. Zucchini is the most important and diverse horticultural group belonging to Cucurbita pepo, a plant species that yields a large variety of edible fruits such as squashes and pumpkins. Challenges in genetic discrimination of zucchini material exiting the agro-food chain typify the problems in DNA typing of horticultural food products, because of limited allelic diversity, presence of common alleles, highly processed food and genetic similarity with other edible species. The aims of this work were to identify zucchini varieties in commercial products by a means of Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) analysis and to provide indications for the statistical interpretation of a match. We assessed the efficacy of SSRs analyzing some of the most diffused hybrids and open pollinated zucchini varieties. SSRs were also screened for transferability in DNA isolated from edible organs of different plant species that are frequently present in food products containing zucchini. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility to identify the variety in food products of different origins. The statistical evaluation on the rarity of DNA profiles in zucchini indicated that the genetic match presented in this work cannot be attributed to chance alone. Based on this evidence, the advantages and pitfalls of food DNA typing for variety identification of a horticultural crop are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cucurbita pepo; DNA profile; Molecular markers; Random match probability; SSR; STR; Traceability,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026747611

The effects of such exposure are poorly understood. RESULTS: Starch granule size was increased by 5 days' short-term heat stress (35.0 °C) and the increase was higher when the stress was introduced early. Heat stress increased the iodine binding capacity of starches and no difference was observed among the three stages. Starch relative crystallinity was increased and swelling power was decreased only when heat stress was introduced early. Heat stress also increased the pasting viscosity, and this effect became more pronounced with later applications of stress. Heat stress reduced starch gelatinization enthalpy, and the reduction gradually increased with later exposures. Heat stress increased the gelatinization temperature and retrogradation enthalpy and percentage of the samples, with the increases being largest with earlier introduction of high temperature. CONCLUSION: Heat stress increased the pasting viscosities and retrogradation percentage of starch by causing change in granule size, amylopectin chain length distribution and crystallinity, and the effects observed were more severe with earlier introduction of heat stress after pollination. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",granule size; heat stress; physicochemical property; starch structure; waxy maize,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030170940

Many transplanting studies with forest tree species have previously reported substantial genetic differentiation among populations within their native range. However, the question of how local is local is still highly debated in conservation biology because studies on genetic patterns of variation within and among populations at the local scale are limited and scattered. In this study, we compare the level of genetic differentiation among populations of six different perennial plant species based on their variation in spring flushing. We assess the level of additive genetic variation present within the local population. For all six species, we find significant differentiation among populations from sites with mean annual temperature ranging between 7.4°C and 8.4°C. The observed variation can only be partly explained by the climate at the site of origin. Most clear relationship between early flushing and higher average spring temperature is observed for the three wind-pollinated species in the study, while the relations are much less clear for the three insect-pollinated species. This supports that pollination system can influence the balance between genetic drift and natural selection and thereby influence the level of local adaptation in long-lived species. On the positive side, we find that the native populations of woody plant species have maintained high levels of additive genetic variation in spring phenology, although this also differs substantially among the six studied species. © 2018 The Authors.

However, the evolution of such associations has so far not been examined. We analysed variation in Rhododendron flowers, in a phylogenetic context, to test whether the evolution of floral symmetry types and pigment patterns are correlated. Variation in floral symmetry due to variation in corolla form, stamen flexion, stamen arrangement, pistil flexion, as well as corolla pigment patterns was documented in 98 species of Rhododendron. Phylogenetic relations among these species were estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods, building on a published molecular dataset of sequences of RNA Polymerase II subunit (RPB2-I). Evolution of the floral traits was studied using phylogenetic correlation tests and ancestral state reconstructions (maximum parsimony, MP and ML methods). Significant correlations were found between corolla pigment pattern and type of floral symmetry at the level of corolla form, stamen flexion or arrangement, and pistil flexion. As expected from their similar roles in enhancing attractability to pollinator, monosymmetric corollas and presence of pigment pattern are correlated; in addition, monosymmetry involving other whorls too shows such a relationship with pigment patterns, and with each other. Multiple evolutionary shifts were detected between monosymmetry and polysymmetry of floral traits in Rhododendron. The relationship between floral monosymmetry attributes and presence of corolla pigment patterns, and additionally, frequent evolutionary shifts in these traits suggest pollinator-mediated selective pressures in Rhododendron. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",Ancestral state reconstruction; Corolla; Floral symmetry; Patterned pigmentation; Phylogenetic correlation; Rhododendron,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034618510

Using honeybees as a model to study olfactoryvisual integration at the neuronal level, we focused on mushroom body (MB) output neurons (MBON). From a neuronal circuit perspective, MBONs represent a prominent level of sensory-modality convergence in the insect brain. We established an experimental design allowing electrophysiological characterization of olfactory, visual, as well as olfactoryvisual induced activation of individual MBONs. Despite the obvious convergence of olfactory and visual pathways in the MB, we found numerous unimodal MBONs. However, a substantial proportion of MBONs (32%) responded to both modalities and thus integrated olfactoryvisual information across MB input layers. In these neurons, representation of the olfactory visual compound was significantly increased compared with that of single components, suggesting an additive, but nonlinear integration. Population analyses of olfactoryvisual MBONs revealed three categories: (i) olfactory, (ii) visual and (iii) olfactoryvisual compound stimuli. Interestingly, no significant differentiation was apparent regarding different stimulus qualities within these categories. We conclude that encoding of stimulus quality within a modality is largely completed at the level of MB input, and information at the MB output is integrated across modalities to efficiently categorize sensory information for downstream behavioural decision processing. © 2018 The Authors.",Electrophysiology; Insects; Mushroom body output neurons; Olfaction; Olfactory; Vision; Visual integration,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043492074

Hybrid cattails (Typha × glauca) are rapidly displacing their parental species, the native broadleaf cattail (T.latifolia) and the introduced narrow-leaf cattail (T. angustifolia), but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We evaluated the potential for direct and indirect interactions among cattails using a series of experiments. First, we evaluated whether seed germination was affected by hybrid leaf litter using a factorial experiment in which we tested for indirect effects of leaf-litter leachate and shading. Second we tested whether these indirect effects of hybrid leaf litter affected seedling performance using a factorial common-garden experiment. Finally, we tested for direct competitive interactions between hybrid and native cattail seedlings. One or more components of hybrid leaf-litter leachate strongly reduced the germination of the parental cattail species, but not that of the hybrid. There was no evidence that direct competitive interactions affected seedling performance. Because regular recruitment by seeds appears to be important in shaping patterns of genetic diversity in natural populations, our findings provide a mechanism for explaining the dominance of hybrid cattails in eastern North America. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Common-garden experiment; Invasive plants; Seed germination; Typha latifolia; Typha × ?glauca,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035773501

The health of honey bees is in decline in many countries worldwide, and RNA viruses together with other biological, environmental and anthropogenic factors have been identified as the main causes. The rapid genetic variation of viruses represents a challenge for diagnosis. Thus, application of deep sequencing methods for detection and analysis of viruses has increased over the last years. In this study, we leverage from the innate Dicer-2 mediated antiviral response against viruses to reconstruct complete viral genomes using virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Symptomatic A. mellifera larvae collected from hives free of Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and the parasitic Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) were used to generate more than 107 million small RNA reads. We show that de novo assembly of insect viral sequences is less fragmented using only 22 nt long vsiRNAs rather than a combination of 2122 nt small RNAs. Our results show that A. mellifera larvae activate the RNAi immune response in the presence of Sacbrood virus (SBV). We assembled three SBV genomes from three individual larvae from different hives in a single apiary, with 12% nucleotide sequence variability among them. We found 34% variability between SBV genomes generated in this study and earlier published Australian variants suggesting the presence of different SBV quasispecies within the country. © 2018",Genome assembly; Honey bee; Sacbrood virus; siRNA; Small RNA sequencing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041626487

We examined the effects of local and landscape factors on the richness and abundance of bees in farms around Bangkok, Thailand. Bee communities in 24 mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchards in heavily modified landscapes (6199% anthropogenic land cover) were compared. We predicted that bees would be more species rich in orchards with higher flower diversity, whereas small-sized bees with non-eusocial and/or below-ground nesting habits would be more sensitive to human disturbance, and hence rare. Twenty-eight species were caught and individuals of genus Apis comprised >92% of 3842 bees sampled and dominated all 24 sites. Habitat effects on bee richness and abundance were stronger at the farm scale than at the landscape scale. At the farm scale, total bee richness and abundance, as well as small, non-eusocial and below-ground nesting bee richness and abundance, were negatively associated with field size and positively associated with flowering plant diversity. The percentage of urban land cover within a 1-km radius was weakly but positively related to total bee richness and small-sized bee richness; total bee abundance was positively associated with wetland cover. A greater diversity of flowering plants retained in smaller fields maintained higher bee richness and abundances, particularly small-sized bees.

In particular, honey, commercial pollination services and nucleus colonies are produced sequentially at foraging sites throughout the year. The model determines a migratory beekeepers revenues, variable costs, gross income from each sequence of foraging sites under the constraint that the total time allocated to the foraging sites be less than or equal to the annual production cycle duration. The bio-economic model allows sequential choices and jointness in foraging sites to be tested, so as to ascertain whether the various stages in the sequential production process are independent of each other.

Understanding this is important for managing genetic diversity of threatened species. This study assessed the spatial genetic structure of the rare riparian Grevillea sp. Cooljarloo (Proteaceae), which is restricted to a 20 km2 region impacted by mining in the northern sandplains of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, an international biodiversity hotspot. Within creek lines and floodplains, the distribution is largely continuous. Models of dispersal within riparian systems were assessed by spatial genetic analyses including population level partitioning of genetic variation and individual Bayesian clustering. High levels of genetic variation and weak isolation by distance within creek line and floodplain populations suggest large effective population sizes and strong connectivity, with little evidence for unidirectional gene flow as might be expected from hydrochory. Regional clustering of creek line populations and strong divergence among creek line populations suggest substantially lower levels of gene flow among creek lines than within creek lines. There was however a surprising amount of genetic admixture in floodplain populations, which could be explained by irregular flooding and/or movements by highly mobile nectar-feeding bird pollinators. Our results highlight that for conservation of rare riparian species, avoiding an impact to hydrodynamic processes, such as water tables and flooding dynamics, may be just as critical as avoiding direct impacts on the number of plants. © The Author(s) 2017.

Vertical pollen transmission of viroids is attributed to the infection by viroid in the embryo sac through infected pollen. To identify the viroid infection in pollen and pollen tubes elongating through the transmitting tract, we used in situ hybridization to histochemically analyze the distribution of Tomato planta macho viroid (TPMVd) in pollen grains, the stigma, and style of petunia plants. TPMVd was present in the generative nucleus and vegetative nucleus of mature infected pollen grains and germinating pollen grains. During pollen tube growth, TPMVd was present in the vegetative nucleus and two sperm nuclei, which were generated by division of the generative nucleus in the style transmitting tract. These findings indicated that viroid infection in sperm nuclei is responsible for vertical pollen transmission of viroids. TPMVd infection from TPMVd-infected pollen tubes to the transmitting tract was not observed. In addition, TPMVd signals were not confirmed in the stigma and transmitting tract of TPMVd-infected petunia plants, suggesting that viroids may not replicate in these tissues at the stage of mature style.

Several fruit rot-resistant watermelon germplasm lines have been developed for use in breeding programs. To evaluate the development of Phytophthora fruit rot on fruit of different ages, plants of fruit rot-resistant and susceptible lines were planted at weekly intervals for five consecutive weeks in experiments conducted over three years (2011 to 2013). Flowers were routinely inspected and hand pollinated to ensure having fruit of different ages. In each year, different aged fruit were harvested on the same day and inoculated with a 5-mm agar plug from an actively growing colony of P. capsici. Inoculated fruit were maintained in a room set to conditions conducive for disease development (>95% relative humidity, 26 ± 2°C).

Efforts to conserve and augment green cover in cities, however, often lack data on the genetic diversity of urban trees, which could be crucial to the success of such programmes. We investigate the population genetics of the cluster fig Ficus racemosa, which occurs naturally in Indian cities and is a keystone species for urban fauna. Genetic analysis of 51 F. racemosa trees in urban Bangalore, India, shows no evidence of inbreeding; the overall inbreeding coefficient (Fis) across 12 microsatellite markers (0.0366) was non-significant with no evidence of heterozygote deficit. Spatial genetic structure (SGS) analysis of 47 trees showed an overall negative relationship between kinship coefficient and spatial distance, with strong SGS at distances &lt;1 km. The absence of heterozygote deficit is likely due to the figs obligate mutualistic association with fig wasps which pollinate their flowers even across long distances. However, the strong SGS at short distances could result from clumped seed dispersal close to natal trees. Therefore, the pattern of population genetics for F. racemosa from urban Bangalore likely results from short-distance seed dispersal and long-distance pollen flow. Despite the scattered and fragmented nature of green areas within cities, these gene mobility factors maintain robust population genetics in F. racemosa even at low population densities. The same may not apply for Ficus species that are planted as vegetative cuttings in cities and therefore may have limited genetic diversity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Bangalore; Figs; India; Keystone resource; Pollen movement; Population genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030705153

Despite increasing recognition for its nutritional value and economic importance, information on smallholder avocado production systems across agro-climatic zones and determinants for tree productivity are literally lacking. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine the determinants for avocado tree holdings by smallholder farmers and investigate the effect of avocado production systems and management conditions on fruit yield by individual avocado trees in Southern Ethiopia. Data required for the study was collected through a combination of focus group discussions, household survey and field tree inventories. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, analyses of variance and linear regression methods using statistical software for social sciences (SPSS version 20). In the study region, avocado is mainly grown as an integral component of the coffee- and enset-based agroforestry systems. The number of avocado trees owned by smallholder producers was related to district, sex of household head, age of household head, educational status, land holding size, pest and disease damage and access to extension services. Productivity of avocado was significantly (p < 0.05) different between production systems. The highest avocado fruit yield was observed from trees grown in the coffee and enset-based agroforestry systems. However, the smallholder producers complain that the yields of coffee and enset grown under avocado trees could be very low. The total height of avocado trees was significantly (p < 0.05) different across the different production systems. The mean heights of matured (2125 years old) avocado trees were 17.57 ± 0.86 m (±SE; N = 20) under coffee-based agroforestry system and 14.93 ± 1.24 m when grown as individual trees around homes. Proper extension support is needed to disseminate improved production techniques: encompassing proper tree spacing, tree training, pruning, soil amendments, growing optimum number of trees for successful pollination and improved harvesting. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Agroforestry; Harvesting; Non-grafted avocado; Tree canopy; Tree height,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991087179

The early successional stage of a plantation, which can be dominated by grasses and herbaceous plant species, can provide a habitat for various species of wild bees. We sampled bees from 13 early successional plantation patches of different sizes, ranging from 1.3 to 10 ha. We then applied a hierarchical community model to infer species richness/abundancearea relationships. The results showed that estimates of population densities of individual species were unchanged with respect to area, suggesting that smaller patches can have the same value per area as larger patches. Estimated species richness increased rapidly for the small range of patch sizes examined. Total abundance was found to linearly increase with area. The inclusion of random site effects into the model resulted in significant density variations among patches; therefore, patch area was not the only determining factor of species abundance. These outcomes in relation to management operations for forests and plantations suggest that small patches of early successional forest contribute to conserve and restore wild bee diversity. © 2017 The Authors",Anthophila; Apiformes; Apoidea; Clear-cut; Hymenoptera; Larix leptolepis; Planted; Species-area; Succession,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034429454

Here, we used high-throughput RNA sequencing on laser capture microdissected and manually dissected maize embryos from reciprocal crosses between inbred lines B73 and Mo17 at six time points (313 days after pollination, DAP) to analyze allelic gene expression patterns. Co-expression analysis revealed sequential gene activation during maize embryo development. Gene imprinting was observed in maize embryos, and a greater number of imprinted genes were identified at early embryo stages. Sixty-four strongly imprinted genes were identified (at the threshold of 9:1) on manually dissected embryos 513 DAP (more imprinted genes at 5 DAP). Forty-one strongly imprinted genes were identified from laser capture microdissected embryos at 3 and 5 DAP (more imprinted genes at 3 DAP). Furthermore, of the 56 genes that were completely imprinted (at the threshold of 99:1), 36 were not previously identified as imprinted genes in endosperm or embryos. In situ hybridization demonstrated that most of the imprinted genes were expressed abundantly in maize embryonic tissue.

Maize populations, genetically more heterogeneous, can evolve and better adapt to a broader range of edaphicclimatic conditions. These populations usually suffer from low yields; it is therefore desirable to improve their agronomic performance while maintaining their valuable diversity levels. With this objective, a long-term participatory breeding/on-farm conservation program was established in Portugal. In this program, maize populations were subject to stratified mass selection. This work aimed to estimate the effect of on-farm stratified mass selection on the agronomic performance, quality, and molecular diversity of two historical maize populations. Multilocation field trials, comparing the initial populations with the derived selection cycles, showed that this selection methodology led to agronomic improvement for one of the populations. The molecular diversity analysis, using microsatellites, revealed that overall genetic diversity in both populations was maintained throughout selection. The comparison of quality parameters between the initial populations and the derived selection cycles was made using kernel from a common-garden experiment. This analysis showed that the majority of the quality traits evaluated progressed erratically over time. In conclusion, this breeding approach, through simple and low-cost methodologies, proved to be an alternative strategy for genetic resources on-farm conservation. © 2017 The Authors.

Thirty of the most vigorous BC1 plants were intercrossed in a greenhouse. Fertility of the BC1 plants was studied by examining their pollen at 250× and by determining the number of well-developed seeds per pollinated flower after the crosses. Percent well-formed microspores averaged 62.7% for BC1plants compared with 30.9% for their F1hybrid parents. Fruit set percentage was high from the BC1intercrosses, with an average of 9.29 plump seeds per pollinated flower. The 2500 BC1seedlings in the field were highly variable in vigor, but fewer than 10% were as vigorous as the median vigor of highbush × highbush seedlings. BC1plants in the field averaged ?1 month later ripening than highbush × highbush seedlings and berries averaged slightly smaller. Berry clusters were very loose compared with those of highbush. Berry flavor was highly variable from plant to plant, but the berries averaged less sweet and lower in acid than highbush berries. New flavor components not found in highbush seedlings were found in only a few BC1seedlings. Fresh berries from BC1plants made bright red juice when crushed in water, whereas berries from most highbush cultivars produced brown to yellow juice/water mixes. Although berry quality in the BC1population averaged lower than in highbush seedlings, some plants had berry quality as high as typical cultivars. Because V. stamineum is highly drought-tolerant, cultivars bred using V. stamineum introgression could have improved upland adaptation. © 2018, American Society for Horticultural Science.

However, such isotropic pattern of FSGS may not always occur when spatially asymmetric processes, for instance, wind direction during dispersal, are considered in wind-pollinated and -dispersed plants. This study assessed the pattern of FSGS in the keystone tropical wetland plant Cyperus papyrus (papyrus) as a function of these isotropic and anisotropic processes. We tested the hypothesis that the FSGS would be influenced by predominant wind direction during pollen and seed dispersal, as well as by the physical distance between individuals. We genotyped a total of 510 adults and 407 juveniles from three papyrus swamps (Ethiopia) using 15 microsatellite markers. In addition, the contemporary directional dispersal by wind was evaluated by seed release-recapture experiments and complemented with parentage analysis. Adults and juveniles differed in the strength of isotropic FSGS ranging from 0.09 to 0.13 and 0.12 to 0.16, respectively, and this suggests variation in dispersal distance. Anisotropic FSGS was found to be a function of asymmetric wind direction during dispersal/pollination that varied between sites. Historical gene dispersal distance was astoundingly low (< 4 m), possibly due to localized seed rain. According to our contemporary dispersal estimates, mean pollen dispersal distances were longer than those of seed dispersal (101 and < 55 m, respectively). More than two-thirds of seeds and half of pollen grains were locally dispersed (? 80 m). The difference in historical and contemporary dispersal distance probably resulted from the asymmetric wind direction due to change in vegetation cover in the surrounding matrix. We further concluded that, in addition to wind direction, post-dispersal processes could influence gene dispersal distance inferred from the FSGS. © The Author(s) 2018.

Its fascinating shapes, brilliantly gilvous flowers, and unusual flowering time endow this species with extremely high ornamental value. However, only five wild populations of R. longipedicellatum surviving in limestone habitat have been found through elaborate field investigation, and the number of the populations decreases further or is even confronted with risk of extinction due to the damage of human activities. To enhance the protection and utilization of R. longipedicellatum, this study systematically investigated several important aspects of reproductive biology, including floral syndrome, pollen viability and stigma receptivity, petal color reflectance, breeding system, and pollination biology. The results demonstrated that arched styles not only create obvious herkogamy that avoide self-pollination, but also effectively reduce rain damage to the intrinsic characteristics of the stigma surface secretions, promoting the female fitness of R. longipedicellatum in poor weather. Pollen viability maintained a high level over the flowering period. The reflectance spectrum of petals had two peaks at wavelengths of 360 and 580 nm. Tests of OCI, P/O and artificial pollination all indicated that R. longipedicellatum was self-compatible and that the breeding system was mixed mating. Geitonogamy mediated by Bombus braccatus was the primary pollination route in the natural environment, which suggested that the breeding system of R. longipedicellatum might be evolving from selfing to outcrossing. The pollination vector of R. longipedicellatum was very specific, in that only B. braccatus was confirmed to deliver pollen to the stigmas. Visitation frequency was influenced by the activity rhythms and resource requirements of the different castes (i.e., sex). B. braccatus workers were the most effective pollinators because of higher visitation frequency and more effective contribution to fruit production, whereas the presence of B. braccatus males might enhance pollen flow within the population to a certain extent. Finally, these findings not only provided a reliable theoretical basis for hybridization breeding of R. longipedicellatum as parents, but also laid a solid foundation for further molecular biology studies to more broadly reveal the mechanisms of its endangerment in the future. © 2018 Li, Liu, Li, Ma, Wan, Liu and Fu.",Breeding system; Flowering biology; Limestone habitat; Pollination biology; Reflectance spectrum; Rhododendron; Special threatened plant,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043363507

It belongs to the tribe Anthospermeae, which is distinctive in the family Rubiaceae through its small, simple, wind-pollinated flowers and its southern hemisphere distribution. The tribe comprises four main clades found respectively in South Africa, Africa, Australia and the Pacific. The high level of allopatry among the four subtribes is attributed here to their origin by vicariance. The Pacific clade, subtribe Coprosminae, is widespread around the margins of the South Pacific and also occurs on most of the high islands. Distributions of the main clades in the subtribe are mapped here and are shown to be repeated in other groups. The distribution patterns also coincide with features of regional geology. Large-scale volcanism has persisted in the central Pacific region since at least the Jurassic. At that time, the oldest of the Pacific large igneous provinces, the Shatsky Rise, began to be erupted in the region now occupied by French Polynesia. Large-scale volcanism in the central Pacific continued through the Cretaceous and the Cenozoic. The sustained volcanism, along with details of the clade distributions, both suggest that the Coprosminae have persisted in the central Pacific by survival of metapopulations on individually ephemeral islands. It is also likely that vicariance of metapopulations has taken place, mediated by processes such as the subsidence of the Pacific seafloor by thousands of metres, and rifting of active arcs by transform faults. It is sometimes argued that a vicariance origin is unlikely for groups on young, oceanic islands that have never been connected by continuous land, but metapopulation vicariance does not require physical contact between islands.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041313492

In this study, we combined experimental and computational modeling approaches to examine the morphological and genetic divergence and reproductive isolation of two tentative species of Sinalliaria (Brassicaceae) endemic to eastern China, S. limprichtiana and S. grandifolia. Most of the examined morphological characters (including hairs of leaf blades and stems, corolla length and width, and flower stalk length) were well-delineated between two species at the same ploidy level, and there was clear evidence of reproductive isolation between them (mainly due to post-pollination barriers) in the common garden environment. There were also strong and consistent divergences in the population genetic data. Coalescent simulations based on sequence variation of the nuclear genes suggest that interspecific divergence began during the Pleistocene when the climate oscillated in eastern Asia. Gene flow between two species appears to have been very limited and asymmetrical. Our results suggested that both species are well-differentiated and that the fast divergence between them might have been together shaped by both stochastic processes and habitat selection pressures. © 2018 Zhang, Zeng, Hu, Fan, Zheng and Hu.",Common garden; Genetic divergence; Morphological delimitation; Reproductive isolation; Sinalliaria,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043349443

Emasculated flowers were crossed with the pollen of donor parents during receptability of stigmas as well as hand self-pollination for each female parent. Results showed that some traits such as percentage of fruit set, seed numbers and total soluble solids (TSS) were affected by the pollen source.

One hundred and ninety-eight samples were taken at 11 sites and genotyped using seven microsatellite loci. Complementary methods including F-statistics, analyses of molecular variance and clustering analyses were used to assess genetic diversity and population structure. Most of the genetic diversity was partitioned within populations, and c. 28% was due to differences among populations. The mean expected and observed heterozygosities were 0.65 and 0.48, respectively, with an FIS of 0.27, suggesting high levels of inbreeding. Samples were sorted into two Bayesian groups, which were not associated with geographical distribution. Admixture levels varied between populations, but estimated migration levels were low, with less than one individual per generation migrating among populations. The mean genetic diversity of P. contracta was 0.66. Combined with previous studies, our results provide evidence that populations of P. contracta evolved under geographical, but not genetic, isolation.

Extensive crosses within and among three lineages of wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon) were performed to address the incidence, developmental timing and histological manifestations of hybrid seed failure. These lineages encompass different, yet fairly recent, divergence times and both allopatric and partially sympatric pairs. Methods Mature seeds were scored visually 2 months after hand pollinations, and viable-looking seeds were assessed for germination success. Using histological sections from early-developing seeds from a sub-set of crosses, the growth of three major seed compartments (endosperm, embryo and seed coat) was measured at critical developmental stages up to 21 d after pollination, with a focus on the timing and histological manifestations of endosperm misdevelopment in abortive hybrid seeds. Key Results For two of three interspecific combinations including the most closely related pair that was also studied histologically, almost all mature seeds appeared 'flat' and proved inviable; histological analyses revealed impaired endosperm proliferation at early globular embryo stages, concomitant with embryo arrest and seed abortion in both cross directions. The third interspecific combination yielded a mixture of flat, inviable and plump, viable seeds; many of the latter germinated and exhibited near-normal juvenile phenotypes or, in some instances, hybrid necrosis and impaired growth. Conclusions The overall results suggest that near-complete hybrid seed failure can evolve fairly rapidly and without apparent divergence in reproductive phenology/biology. While the evidence accrued here is largely circumstantial, early-acting disruptions of normal endosperm development are most probably the common cause of seed failure regardless of the type of endosperm (nuclear or cellular). © The Author(s) 2017.

Although some studies have already explored how patch loss affects metacommunity dynamics, the effect of patch configurational fragmentation remains vaguely understood. Here we construct a patch-dynamic model for various plant-animal interactions in fragmented landscapes, including neutralism (0, 0), poison (0, ?), competition (?, ?), predation (?, +), fruitivory (0, +) and mutualism (+, +). Counter-intuitively, negative plant-animal interactions (harmful for one or both species) show stronger tolerance to habitat destruction (i.e., higher species persistence) than positive interactions (beneficial to one or both species), in spite of lower patch occupancy. This is because animal species survival in positive interactions largely depends on plant species abundance. Furthermore, neutralism displays most robust to both patch loss and fragmentation while mutualism showing most vulnerability. Essentially, neutral interaction leads to more patches available for both plant and animal species, while in mutualistic interaction (e.g., pollination), both plant and animal species can only persist when they co-occur at the same patches. Compared to other interactions, predation (?, +) results in lowest patch occupancy, but such trophic interaction does not exhibit highest sensitivity to habitat destruction. Overall, our modelling framework provides new insights into how different plant-animal interactions respond to landscape fragmentation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Competition; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat loss; Mutualism; Predation; Species dispersal,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034426560

The first phase of floret opening at anthesis is short and induced by lodicule turgidity. Some wheat florets re-open post-Anthesis for several days, known as the â  second opening', for which the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We performed detailed physiological, anatomical, and histological investigations to understand the biological basis of the flower opening process. Wheat florets were observed open when the ovary was unfertilized. Unfertilized ovaries significantly increased in radial size post-Anthesis, pushing the lemma and palea apart to open the florets. The absence of fertile pollen was not directly linked to this, but anther filament elongation coincided with initiation of ovary swelling. The pericarp of unfertilized ovaries did not undergo degeneration as normally seen in developing grains, instead pericarp cells remained intact and enlarged, leading to increased ovary radial size. This is a novel role for the ovary pericarp in wheat flower opening, and the knowledge is useful for facilitating cross-pollination in hybrid breeding. Ovary swelling may represent a survival mechanism in autogamous cereals such as wheat and barley, ensuring seed set in the absence of self-fertilization and increasing genetic diversity through cross-pollination. © The Author 2017.

To understand the dynamical mechanism of a tipping point and to predict its occurrence as a system parameter varies are of uttermost importance, tasks that are hindered by the often extremely high dimensionality of the underlying system. Using complex mutualistic networks in ecology as a prototype class of systems, we carry out a dimension reduction process to arrive at an effective 2D system with the two dynamical variables corresponding to the average pollinator and plant abundances. We show, using 59 empirical mutualistic networks extracted from real data, that our 2D model can accurately predict the occurrence of a tipping point, even in the presence of stochastic disturbances. We also find that, because of the lack of sufficient randomness in the structure of the real networks, weighted averaging is necessary in the dimension reduction process. Our reduced model can serve as a paradigm for understanding and predicting the tipping point dynamics in real world mutualistic networks for safeguarding pollinators, and the general principle can be extended to a broad range of disciplines to address the issues of resilience and sustainability.",Complex systems; Dimension reduction; Mutualistic networks; Nonlinear dynamics; Tipping points,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040864036

Counting pollen and ovules in flowers is essential to understand how much is invested in each gender. Classical methods to count very numerous pollen grains and ovules are inefficient when pollen grains are tightly aggregated, and when fertilization rates of ovules are unknown. In this study we have therefore developed novel counting techniques based on computed tomography. In order to demonstrate the potential of our methods in very difficult cases, we counted pollen and ovules across inflorescences of deceptive and rewarding species of European orchids, which possess both very large numbers of pollen grains (tightly aggregated) and ovules. Pollen counts did not significantly vary across inflorescences and pollination strategies, whereas deceptive flowers had significantly more ovules than rewarding flowers. The within-inflorescence variance of pollen-To-ovule ratios in rewarding flowers was four times higher than in deceptive flowers, possibly demonstrating differences in the constraints acting on both pollination strategies. We demonstrate the inaccuracies and limitations of previously established methods, and the broad applicability of our new techniques: They allow measurement of reproductive investment without restriction on object number or aggregation, and without specimen destruction. © The Author(s) 2017.

A dynamic, heterosexual core group model with risk of infection through both vaginal and anal pathways is formulated and comprehensively analysed. The model is coupled to a general population model and fitted to HIV prevalence data for Zimbabwe in order to explore the parameter space related to heterosexual AI. The model fit supports a core group size ranging between 5?20% and exposure risk to AI in excess of 50%. The control effort quantified by the reproductive number (RA) at commencement of the epidemic corresponds to R0=4.40. With the contribution of heterosexual AI to Zimbabwe's (and that of the sub-Saharan African region) epidemic unknown, the study apportioned infections between the two infection pathways. New infections due to VI ranged from 2?4.5% and 0.5?2.7% from heterosexual AI. The study estimates infection probabilities ranging from 0.15 to 0.35 for both receptive and infective AI. By quantifying the incidence due to VI and AI risks, we put emphasis on the necessity for targeted interventions. To project the potential impact of heterosexual AI in high HIV prevalence settings, we raised the core group size to 20% in the year 2010 coinciding with reported heterosexual AI prevalence outside of Africa and allowed the proportion of infection risk associated with AI to vary. Prevalence and incidence projections were made up to the year 2020 starting from a baseline value of zero exposure to AI transmission risk per sex act, progressively increasing exposure to 50% and 70% respectively. A 50% exposure to AI would result in HIV prevalence scaling up by 23% from the baseline values in year 2020. Increasing exposure to 70% was projected to increase HIV prevalence by 38% in year 2020. The HIV infection risks associated with AI are recognised and inform HIV policy for men who have sex with men, yet the same risks are ignored in HIV intervention programmes for heterosexuals. This study highlights the potential danger of increasing prevalence of heterosexual AI in settings with high HIV prevalence.

Closely related hermaphroditic and dioecious species with biotic pollination provide the opportunity to study and compare traits related to pollinator attraction and their consequences on reproductive components. A higher predictability of pollination syndromes is expected in dioecious species, which are dependent on pollinators, than in self-compatible hermaphroditic taxa. Dioecious species may suffer pollen limitation depending on the quality of floral rewards and the kind and abundance of pollinators, whereas no pollen limitation is expected in hermaphroditic species with autonomous self-pollination. Additionally, in the absence of pollen limitation, more or better seeds are expected in dioecious species, according to the sexual specialization hypothesis. Methods In natural populations of the hermaphroditic Fuchsia fulgens and Fuchsia arborescens and dioecious Fuchsia parviflora and Fuchsia obconica, all endemic to Mexico, we first described flower phenology, flower production and longevity and nectar volume and concentration. Then, we evaluated the correspondence between floral visitors and pollination syndromes. In hermaphrodite plants, we determined the level of herkogamy and the potential for autonomous self-pollination. Finally, we evaluated the effect of pollen limitation on fruit set and seed number and assessed seed germination for all species. Important Findings In contrast to our prediction, dioecious species did not show a higher correspondence between pollination syndromes and floral visitors than did hermaphrodites; however, male flowers exhibited a higher correspondence than female flowers. No pollen limitation was detected in dioecious species, for which visitation rate did not differ between male and female flowers. The hermaphroditic F. fulgens showed pollen limitation for seed number, despite the presence of autonomous selfing. Fruit set from autonomous pollination was higher in F. arborescens, which showed a lower level of herkogamy compared with F. fulgens. Finally, dioecious species produced fewer but heavier seeds compared with hermaphrodite species. Although Fuchsia is classified as an outcrossing genus, both hermaphroditic species showed autonomous self-pollination. The heavier but lower number of seeds per fruit in dioecious species may be related to the more efficient resource allocation expected from sexual specialization. This could play an important role in the evolution of dioecy; however, a comparative phylogenetic approach is required to confirm this hypothesis. © The Author(s) 2016.

Barriers to establishment and invasion include reproductive limitations. Clematis vitalba L. has been a popular horticultural species for the past century and is widely distributed and can be highly invasive. In Ireland, it is considered naturalized and potentially invasive. Despite this, little is known about its reproductive biology. Methods We carried out manipulative field experiments in Ireland and compared fruit and seed set from a number of pollination treatments, namely cross-pollination, geitonogamy, autogamy and natural pollination. We also recorded floral visitation to C. vitalba through a series of timed observations. Important Findings We found that C. vitalba is capable of uniparental reproduction via geitonogamy and autonomous selfing, albeit at a reduced rate compared with outcrossing treatments. Clematis vitalba was visited by at least 10 native pollinator taxa, with hoverflies dominating visitation. Neither fruit set nor seed set in our study population was pollen limited. Given the lack of reproductive constraint, C. vitalba may easily spread in suitable habitats. This is of concern in Ireland, given its prevalence in some of the country's most floristically diverse regions. © The Author(s) 2018.

Both abiotic stress and species interactions can limit populations and potentially set range boundaries, but we have a poor understanding of when and where each is most critical. A commonly cited hypothesis, first proposed by Darwin, posits that abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) are stronger determinants of range boundaries in apparently abiotically stressful areas (""stress"" indicates abiotic factors that reduce population growth), including desert, polar, or highelevation environments, whereas species interactions (e.g., herbivory, competition) play a stronger role in apparently less stressful environments. We tested a core tenet of this hypothesis-that population growth rate is more strongly affected by species interactions in less stressful areas-using experimental manipulations of species interactions affecting a common herbaceous plant, Hibiscus meyeri (Malvaceae), across an aridity gradient in a semiarid African savanna. Population growth was more strongly affected by four distinct species interactions (competition with herbaceous and shrubby neighbors, herbivory, and pollination) in less stressful mesic areas than in more stressful arid sites. However, contrary to common assumptions, this effect did not arise because of greater density or diversity of interacting species in less stressful areas, but rather because aridity reduced sensitivity of population growth to these interactions. Our work supports classic predictions about the relative strength of factors regulating population growth across stress gradients, but suggests that this pattern results from a previously unappreciated mechanism that may apply to many species worldwide. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.",Abiotic stress; Climate change; Population growth; Range boundaries; Species interactions,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042108939

Seven parameters to be optimized are ?1, ?2, ?3, ?4, ?, Rc, b in order to obtain polarization curves closely converged to those obtained in the manufacture's datasheet. MVO is characterized by simple construction, less controlling parameters and requiring less effort in computation process. Four sets of experimental voltage stack are taken into consideration; two of them are used for optimization process while the others are used for model validation in the presence of two types of parameter constraints. Comparative studies including statistical parameters with two types of methods are performed; the first methods are reported in the literature like SGA, HGA, HABC, RGA and HADE while the second approaches are programmed such as grey wolf optimizer (GWO), artificial bee colony (ABC), mine blast algorithm (MBA) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). The obtained results reveal that MVO is the best choice among the others since it presents less fitness function and less convergence time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Fuel cell parameter estimation; Multi-verse optimizer; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034017115

We present newdata for numerous Schisandraceae, the largest ANITA family, from fieldwork, nocturnal filming, electron microscopy, barcoding and molecular clocks to infer pollinator/plant interactions over multiple years at sites throughout China to test the extent of pollinator specificity. Schisandraceae are pollinated by nocturnal gall midges that lay eggs in the flowers and whose larvae then feed on floral exudates. At least three Schisandraceae have shifted to beetle pollination. Pollination by a single midge species predominates, but one species was pollinated by different species at three locations and one by two at the same location. Based on molecular clocks, gall midges and Schisandraceae may have interacted since at least the Early Miocene. Combining these findings with a review of all published ANITA pollination data shows that ovipositing flies are the most common pollinators of living representatives of the ANITA grade.Compared to food reward-based pollination, oviposition-based systems are less wasteful of plant gametes because (i) none are eaten and (ii) female insects with herbivorous larvae reliably visit conspecific flowers. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Here we use a global dataset of 80 published plantpollinator interaction networks as well as pollinator effectiveness measures from 34 plant species to assess the importance of A. mellifera in natural habitats. Apis mellifera is the most frequent floral visitor in natural habitats worldwide, averaging 13% of floral visits across all networks (range 085%), with 5% of plant species recorded as being exclusively visited by A. mellifera. For 33% of the networks and 49% of plant species, however, A. mellifera visitation was never observed, illustrating that many flowering plant taxa and assemblages remain dependent on non-A. mellifera visitors for pollination. Apis mellifera visitation was higher in warmer, less variable climates and on mainland rather than island sites, but did not differ between its native and introduced ranges. With respect to single-visit pollination effectiveness, A. mellifera did not differ from the average non-A. mellifera floral visitor, though it was generally less effective than the most effective non-A. mellifera visitor. Our results argue for a deeper understanding of how A. mellifera, and potential future changes in its range and abundance, shape the ecology, evolution, and conservation of plants, pollinators, and their interactions in natural habitats. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

It is usually evaluated by the quantification of the number of viable and non-viable pollen grains that are present in a sample after an adequate pollen grain staining procedure. Although the manual counting of both types of grains is the simplest and most sensitive approach, it is a laborious and time-demanding process. In this regard, novel image-based approaches can assist in the objective, accurate and cost-effective phenotyping of this trait. Results: Here, we introduce PollenCounter, an open-source macro implemented as a customizable Fiji tool for the high-throughput phenotyping of pollen viability. This tool splits RGB images of stained pollen grains into its primary channels, retaining red and green color fractionated images (which contain information on total and only viable pollen grains, respectively) for the subsequent isolation and counting of the regions of interest (pollen grains). This framework was successfully used for the analysis of pollen viability of a high number of samples collected in a large collection of grapevine cultivars. Results revealed a great genetic variability, from cultivars having very low pollen viability (like Corinto Bianco; viability: 14.1 ± 1.3%) to others with a very low presence of sterile pollen grains (Cuelga; viability: 98.2 ± 0.5%). A wide range of variability was also observed among several clones of cv. Tempranillo Tinto (from 97.9 ± 0.9 to 60.6 ± 5.9%, in the first season). Interestingly, the evaluation of this trait in a second season revealed differential genotype-specific sensitivity to environment. Conclusions: The use of PollenCounter is expected to aid in different areas, including genetics research studies, crop improvement and breeding strategies that need of fast, precise and accurate results. Considering its flexibility, it can be used not only in grapevine, but also in other species showing a differential staining of viable and non-viable pollen grains. The wide phenotypic diversity observed at a species level, together with the identification of specific cultivars and clones largely differing in this trait, pave the way of further analyses aimed to understand the physiological and genetic causes driving to male sterility in grapevine. © 2018 The Author(s).",Computer vision; Plant phenotyping tool; Pollen sterility; Pollination; Vitis vinifera L,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040323564

Although, Arbequina is considered by many authors as self-compatible, increasing evidence questions its full self-compatibility. Our results clearly illustrate that, contrary to earlier assumptions, Arbequina olive behaves as a self-incompatible variety. Self-pollen rejection in the style, low levels of self-fertilization and decreased initial and final fruit set after self-pollination in comparison to cross-pollination treatments clearly indicate that Arbequina is self-incompatible. Furthermore, even seed and fruit size were depressed in response to self-pollination, despite the lighter crop produced in self-pollinated shoots. This was observed in both on and off Arbequina trees. Both pollinizers tested, Manzanillo and Picual, matched results obtained under free open-pollination and significantly increased the yield obtained under self-pollination. Our results suggest the convenience of establishing pollinizers for large, high-density Arbequina orchards, especially in new areas of olive cultivation, where wind pollination may be not enough to ensure beneficial cross pollen flow. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Fruit set; Olea europaea; Pollen-pistil interaction; Pollination; Seed set; Self-incompatibility,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034259724

An additional goal was to determine the origin (allotetraploid vs. autotetraploid) of H. megalanthus by exploring morphological variations in the di-haploid (2x) H. megalanthus progeny. Gamete origin was proved in all five H. monacanthus lines obtained and in 49 of the 70 H. megalanthus lines by using flow cytometry and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The five double-haploid (2x) H. monacanthus lines showed low vigor and abnormal flower development, with malformed ovules and aborted pollen grains. Only one flower set fruit, giving several viable seeds. For H. megalanthus, both abnormal ovules and defective anthers were observed in the di-haploid (2x) and double di-haploid (4x) lines. Among the 46 di-haploid lines, only 14 set fruit. Another 13 di-haploid lines formed flower buds that abscised before anthesis or soon after pollination. The severe sterility of the double-haploid H. monacanthus and the reduced fertility of all the di-haploid and double di-haploid H. megalanthus lines can be linked to their reduced heterozygosity, which drastically affected the development of normal female and male organs. We thus concluded that chromosome doubling, as occurred spontaneously in the double-haploid H. monacanthus and the double di-haploid H. megalanthus, is not sufficient to restore fertility in Hylocereus. We also observed very low gametoclonal variation among the di-haploid (2x) H. megalanthus lines, a finding that supported an autotetraploid, rather than an allotetraploid, origin of this species. Nonetheless, despite the above-described challenging limitations, these gamete-derived lines are currently being bred as the seed parent, offering unique possibilities for genetic research and additional breeding. © 2018 Li, Arroyave Martinez, Shaked and Tel-Zur.",Breeding; Gamete-derived progenies; Gametoclonal variation; Perennial fruit crop; Sterility; Vine cacti,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041329135

One of the most evolutionarily relevant and threatened Italian endemic is the Webb's hyacinth (Bellevalia webbiana Parl.). As the reproductive behaviour of this species and its connection with human impact are currently unknown, the aim of this study was to characterise the reproductive traits of the Webb's hyacinth in contrasting habitats. All the 5 known richest populations across the species range were investigated. Their reproductive strategies were inferred by measuring inflorescence height, fruit set, seed set and P/O ratio. Reproductive features varied greatly amongst stands and also in relation to the degree of human disturbance. However, in all cases, seed sets showed low values. P/O values point towards full xenogamy and it is concluded that effective cross-pollination may be the main mode of sexual reproduction in Bellevalia webbiana. The reasons for the low reproductive performances may reside in pollen limitation, Allee effect and/or intrinsic reduced fertility of the species.

At age 7, seedlings pollinated with contaminate pollen were the shortest across all four sites, but had survival levels (83%) similar to open-pollinated (84%) and pure orchard seedlings (86%). Open-pollinated seedlings had intermediate heights while pure orchard seedlings were tallest. The level of pollen contamination in open-pollinated seedlots was estimated to be 26%. Survival for all pollen sources combined was similar at the two high-elevation sites (84%) and low-elevation sites (86%). Using a yield model to compare volume/ha at rotation age for open-pollinated orchard seedlings and pure orchard seedlings, differences were small and increased due to site index (SI; from 3 to 6 m3/ha) but not due to planting density. Equivalent discounted benefits at rotation were 27 vs. 54 C$/ha at the two extreme site indices (18 vs. 25), respectively. These projected reductions due to pollen contamination are magnified by the large area that is regenerated annually with orchard seed of coastal Douglas-fir and contamination can cause a reduction in benefits of up to C$748,500 per year at the highest SI at a planting density of 1111 trees/ha. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",A-class seed; growth and yield modelling; progeny testing; Pseudotsuga menziesii,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018845286

Because diverse floral diets have a positive impact on honey bee health, identifying the plants preferred by foragers provides valuable information to manage bee-friendly habitats. Recent studies have utilized palynology to better understand honey bee nectar foraging preferences. Futhermore, the International Honey Commission has established standards for analyzing honey samples. However, standards for studying the plant taxonomic composition of honey bee pollen pellets have not been established. The goal of this project was to determine the minimum number of pollen grains that need to be counted to obtain an accurate floral taxonomic representation in a pollen pellet sample. To do this, pollen samples were collected from pollen traps placed outside honey bee hives, and a pollen subsample foraged by each colony was acetolyzed and identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Cohorts of 100 pollen grains obtained from homogenized pollen samples from three different colonies were counted successively 5 times for a total count of 500 pollen grains per colony. This was repeated for each of the replicates from the three separate colonies. We found no statistically significant differences in the number or proportion of floral taxa found between the 200 and 500 pollen grain counts in two out of the three colonies sampled. Species diversity index analysis suggested that the higher number of floral taxa found in some 500-grain counts were attributed to a relatively low presence of minor pollen types. Thus, a 200 pollen grain count seems sufficient to assess the predominant, secondary and important minor plant taxa present in a pollen sample, while a 500-grain count may be needed to elucidate a more specific taxonomic assessment of additional minor taxa floral types to determine a sample's geographic origin. © 2017 AASPThe Palynological Society.",Apis mellifera; honey bee; melissopalynology; pollen identification,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018326349

Efficiency in pollination has been related to plant investment in gamete production and to the pollen to ovule ratio (P/O), which has been proposed as an indication of the likelihood of enough pollen grains reaching the stigmas to result in maximum reproductive success. In heterostylous species, cross-pollination is promoted by the reciprocal position of sexual organs between morphs and a heteromorphic incompatibility system, which precludes selfing and fertilizations among plants of the same morph. Morphological features like reciprocity (between morphs) and herkogamy (within morph) together with the breeding system are thought to influence pollination quality. Therefore, a close relationship between the pollination efficiency, morphological characteristics, and incompatibility would be expected. Pollination treatments and morphological measurements were carried out to describe the breeding system, herkogamy, and reciprocity of six Melochia species. Afterward, the relation between the P/O (as a surrogate of the efficiency in pollination), and reciprocity, herkogamy and incompatibility was evaluated. Monomorphic M. nodiflora and distylous M. pyramidata are self-compatible species, whereas the rest of the species are self- and morph-incompatible. There was a positive relationship between the P/O value and the degree of herkogamy and incompatibility. However, P/O values appear to increase when higher reciprocity is found in the populations. As expected, the lower values of P/O are associated with lower levels of herkogamy and compatibility in the Melochia species studied. The relationship between the factors is discussed under different scenarios of the pollinators predictability. © 2016 Società Botanica Italiana.",herkogamy; heterostyly; incompatibility system; pollen limitation; pollen/ovule ratio; reciprocity,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995467073

The bottom-up modeling paradigm provides an ideal approach to bridging the gap between known mechanisms of individual organisms and unknown spatialtemporal dynamics of pollination at the field scale. By linking empirical data to stochastically-based ecological process modeling, we present a spatially-explicit agent-based simulation model that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangements, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency throughout a blueberry bloom season. The firmly validated open-source model is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches. Sensitivity analysis suggested that fruit set and resulting measures of productivity such as fruit mass and viable seeds per fruit were sensitive to parameterization of blueberry genotype or clone size and the amount of blueberry plant cover in a field. Fruit set due to pollen compatibility was sensitive to ovule number per flower and foraging bee density. Simulation experiments allowed us to compare bee pollination efficiencies at the bee taxon population level (honey bees, bumble bees, and native solitary bees), the effect of foraging distance from bee nest or colony site on fruit set, and test whether the mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility (pre- vs. post-zygotic decision making by the plant) in wild blueberry pollination at the field level matters in estimating yield. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bee foraging; Cross pollination; GAMA platform; Simulation-based model; Spatial and genetic variability; Vaccinium angustifolium; Wild blueberry,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036465333

These actions all require practitioners to determine what mixture of plant species to select to best support diverse and functionally important pollinators. Like in the selection of areas for nature reserves, plant choices must balance function against differences in cost. To date, plant mixes have been compiled using expert opinion based on the performance of individual species, but researchers and practitioners have called for a systematic approach to optimize mixtures. We applied a decision analytic approach to select best flowering mixes to meet two specified objectives at the least cost: maximizing total bee richness or maximizing crop-pollinating bees. The model identified best plant mixes for each objective across a range of budgets. Accounting for the variation in costs among plant species allowed for substantially more cost effective mixes with little loss in achieving the target objective. Including multiple objectives simultaneously revealed the power of the approach to meet complex goals. The resulting mix supported over 96% of the bee species for both goals at no difference in cost. This gain in efficiency could dramatically increase the extent of habitat implemented and remove financial barriers to adoption by stakeholders and conservation practitioners. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bees; Decision tool; Optimization; Pollinator enhancement; Seed mix,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033702814

Females ability to invade and persist among hermaphrodites depends, in part, on pollinators providing adequate pollination to females. We directly measured diurnal and nocturnal pollinators contributions to female and hermaphrodite seed production in artificial populations of gynodioecious Silene vulgaris by experimentally restricting pollinator access. We found that female relative seed production in this system depended strongly on pollination context: females produced more than twice as many seeds as hermaphrodites in the context of abundant, nectar-collecting moths. Conversely, females showed no seed production advantage in the context of pollen-collecting syrphid flies and bees due to acutely hermaphrodite-biased visitation. We infer that variation in pollinator type, behaviour and abundance may be important for achieving the female relative fitness thresholds necessary for the maintenance of gynodioecy. Generally, our study illustrates how pollinator-mediated mechanisms may influence the evolution of breeding systems and associated suites of floral traits. Segments of a pollinator community may facilitate gynodioecy by selecting for plant characteristics that increase the attractiveness of both sexes to pollinators, such as nectar rewards. Conversely, discriminating visitors in search of pollen may restrict gynodioecy in associated plant lineages by reducing male steriles fitness below threshold levels. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

In order to provide a clear answer to that question, five experiments were designed on various scales performed under three environmental conditions. The results show that under protected cropping conditions, CGMMV is transmitted by the honeybees. The location of the beehive in relation to both the CGMMV primary inoculum source and the healthy plants during honeybee foraging plays an important role in the efficiency of CGMMV spread. Furthermore, in the presence of early stage CGMMV-inoculated plants, the efficiency of CGMMV spread to uninoculated plants placed on the honeybees path to the beehive may increase.

However, effects of size (biomass or reproductive investment) and height were not separated in most previous studies. Here, using experimental populations of monoecious plants, Ambrosia altemisiifolia, we examined (1) how male and female reproductive investments (MRI and FRI) change with biomass and height, (2) how MRI and height affect male reproductive success (MRS) and pollen dispersal, and (3) how height affects seed production. Pollen dispersal kernel and selection gradients on MRS were estimated by 2,102 seeds using six microsatellite markers. First, MRI increased with height, but FRI did not, suggesting that sex allocation is more male-biased with increasing plant height. On the other hand, both MRI and FRI increased with biomass but often more greatly for FRI, and consequently, sex allocation was often female-biased with biomass. Second, MRS increased with both height and MRI, the latter having the same or larger effect on MRS. Estimated pollen dispersal kernel was fat-tailed, with the maximum distance between mates tending to increase with MRI but not with height. Third, the number of seeds did not increase with height.

Calosphace (Lamiaceae, Lamiales) is a highly diverse clade endemic to the New World. The phylogenetic relationships of Calosphace have been previously investigated using DNA sequences of nuclear ITS region and plastid psbAtrnH intergenic spacer, but the resulting trees lack resolution and support for many clades. The present paper reassesses the phylogenetic relationships of subgenus Calosphace, including a broader taxon sampling, with a special focus on representing previously unsampled sections, and using an additional plastid marker (trnLtrnF region). Our results show increased resolution and overall patterns of support, recovering ten main clades. Within core Calosphace, the most inclusive of these main clades, 17 new subclades were identified. Of the 42 sections for which more than one species was analysed, only 12 are monophyletic. Our biogeographical analysis identified at least twelve migrations to South America from Mexican and Central American lineages, in agreement with previous suggestions of multiple origins of South American Calosphace diversity. This analysis also confirmed a colonization of the Antilles by Andean lineages. The reconstruction of ancestral states of pollination syndromes showed multiple shifts to ornithophily from melittophily and one reversal to the latter. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",Area shifts; ITS; Neotropics; Pollination shifts; trnHpsbA intergenic spacer; trnLtrnF region,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028014785

Here, we characterised which pollinator species are attracted by oilseed rape and how this affected the structure of plantpollinator networks in nearby grasslands. We surveyed 177 networks from three countries (Germany, Sweden and United Kingdom) in 24 landscapes with high crop cover, and compared them to 24 landscapes with low or no oilseed rape during and after crop blooming. On average 55% of grassland pollinator species were found on the crop, which attracted 835% of individuals away from grasslands. However, networks in the grasslands were resistant to these reductions, since mainly abundant and highly mobile species were attracted. Nonetheless, simulations indicated that network structural changes could be triggered if > 50% of individuals were attracted to the crop (a value well-above that found in our study system), which could affect community stability and resilience to further disturbance. © 2017 The Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017395073

However, extensive intramorph pollination occurs commonly in heterostylous species, leading to recurrent questions about the functional and evolutionary significance of heterostyly. Methods: To identify the sources of stigmatic pollen (autogamous [intraflower], geitonogamous [intraplant], vs. interplant), we emasculated either one flower or entire plants in experimental populations of the two closely related buckwheat species, distylous Fagopyrum esculentum and homostylous F. tataricum. Differences in pollen size allowed unambiguous identification of pollen on stigmas. Results: Only 2.4% of F. tataricum pollen and 1.5% of F. esculentum pollen arrived successfully on compatible stigmas of other plants. In the former (homostylous) species, 71.3% of the pollen load on stigmas was autogamous, 10.8% was geitonogamous, and 17.9% was interplant. In the latter (distylous) species, 37.45% of the pollen on stigmas was autogamous, 13.8% was geitonogamous, 17.0% was intramorph, and 31.75% was intermorph. The amount of incompatible pollen arriving on stigmas was greatly decreased by both one-flower and whole-plant emasculations, and thus, the proportion of compatible pollen deposited increased with one-flower emasculation and increased even more with whole-plant emasculation. Conclusions: Our quantification of pollen-donor sources in these two species indicated that heterostyly in Fagopyrum esculentum provided a nearly 2-fold fitness advantage (in terms of compatible pollination) over expected (random) pollen transfers between morphs. Because of reduced herkogamy, the homostylous F. tataricum was highly autogamous. © 2018 Botanical Society of America",disassortative pollination; distyly; homostyly; pollen fate; pollen transfer proficiency; Polygonaceae; self pollination; stigmatic pollen loads,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042049474

The model was run using two different sources of data to inform the floral resource component of the model. First, the model was run driven by proxies and approximate values gathered from the literature. The second iteration of the model utilized field-based data to generate floral resource abundance and distribution values. Both models utilized honey bee-specific species preference data drawn from field observations and expert opinion in the literature. Results indicated an 8.1% increase in the amount of land designated as high quality when the model was informed by field-based data. Such discrepancies are important when considering the potential implications of ecosystem services mapping studies on policy. As a tool, ecosystem services mapping provides the opportunity to spatially evaluate the impact that different land-use planning regimes could have on the supply and provision of various ecosystem services.

Reproductive phenology was sampled monthly from December 2014 to November 2015. We describe floral biology, breeding system via pollination treatments and evaluate floral visitors from focal and filming observations. Pollen grains found on moth proboscis were compared among cactus species under light microscopy. We used fluorescent dye particles to test intra- and interspecific pollen flow. These three species have extended flowering with greater intensity in the wet season, causing high overlap. They have white and hypocrateriformis flowers that open at twilight or nightfall and last about 15 h. H. balansae seems to be self-incompatible, while E. rhodotricha presented self-compatibility. P. saxicola presented self-fertility, but most of the population seems to be self-incompatible. We suggest sphingophily for the three species, but only P. saxicola was visited by Manduca rustica (Sphingidae). However, we observed pollen grains of all three species on the proboscis of moths, especially M. rustica and M. sexta. Prolonged anthesis allowed bees (herein considered as secondary pollinators) to visit flowers of E. rhodotricha and P. saxicola. It can be concluded that the studied species share nocturnal and diurnal pollinators, suggesting interspecific pollen flow, which, however, could not be detected with fluorescent dye particles. In view of the low frequency of primary pollinators, it appears that these three species have different reproductive strategies, ensuring the fruiting and production of viable seeds. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Breeding system; cactus flowering; generalist pollination; night blooming; reproductive phenology; secondary pollinators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038020615

In this paper, a modified flower pollination algorithm (MFPA) is proposed for determining the age and relative contribution of different stellar populations of galaxies. The results show that the proposed algorithm can search efficiently through the very large space of the possible ages for the different integrated colour of galaxies. The proposed algorithm will be applied to an integrated colour of galaxy NGC 3384. The numerical results and statistical analysis show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better than a previously used genetic algorithm (Attia et al., 2005) and cuckoo search (Abdel-Baset et al., 2015).

Generally ants are considered as nectar robbers that do not provide pollination service. We studied the pollination system of the endangered dry grassland forb Euphorbia seguieriana and found two ant species to be the most frequent visitors of its flowers. Workers of Formica cunicularia carried five times more pollen than smaller Tapinoma erraticum individuals, but significantly more viable pollen was recovered from the latter. Overall, the viability of pollen on ant cuticles was significantly lower (p < 0:001)-presumably an antibiotic effect of the metapleural gland secretion. Amarking experiment suggested that ants were unlikely to facilitate outcrossing as workers repeatedly returned to the same individual plant. In open pollinated plants and when access was given exclusively to flying insects, fruit set was nearly 100%. In plants visited by ants only, roughly one third of flowers set fruit, and almost none set fruit when all insects were excluded. The germination rate of seeds from flowers pollinated by flying insects was 31 ± 7% in contrast to 1 ± 1% resulting from ant pollination. We conclude that inbreeding depression may be responsible for the very low germination rate in ant pollinated flowers and that ants, although the most frequent visitors, play a negligible or even deleterious role in the reproduction of E. seguieriana. Our study reiterates the need to investigate plant fitness effects beyond seed set in order to confirm ant-plant mutualisms. © 2018 Rostás et al.",Ants; Breeding system; Foraging behaviour; Geitonogamy; Germination; Inbreeding depression; Metapleural gland; Pollen; Siberian spurge,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042349953

With modern and more intensive agricultural practices they have become smaller (less than 1600 m2) and more isolated study which also affects ecosystem functions. Most ecosystem function studies using field experiments focus on a single function. Here, we investigate three functions in the same landscape at the same time. We investigated how local (trees, shrubs and grass-cover in small remnant habitats) and landscape factors (amount of and distance from key habitats i.e. forest and semi-natural grasslands) affect pollination, biological pest control and seed predation. We applied a multifunctional approach using different organisms to analyze pollination success (Primula veris), predation on aphid pests (Rhopalosiphum padi) and seed predation (of Helianthus annuus). A set-up of 3 different experiments were placed in situ on 12 midfield islets. Pollination was more affected by local factors than landscape factors, although pollination success was improved by a smaller proportions of surrounding crop fields. Seed predation was higher on islets with more surrounding forest and also with more trees on the habitat, especially close to shrubs, compared to more open areas of habitat. Predation on aphids decreased on midfield islets with a larger amount of nearby forest but was positively affected by increasing local tree cover on the habitat. We show that managing semi-open habitats that are connected to other natural or semi-natural habitats can improve pollination success and biological pest and weed control, thus potentially increasing yield in surrounding crop fields. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Biological pest control; Ecosystem function; Midfield islets; Pollination; Seed predation; Small habitats,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039982510

It has been extensively dealt by number of researchers in the past, and different optimization algorithms have been applied for the synthesis of LAA. This paper presents a relatively new optimization technique, namely flower pollination algorithm (FPA) for the design of LAA for reducing the maximum side lobe level (SLL) and null control. The desired antenna is achieved by controlling only amplitudes or positions of the array elements. FPA is a novel meta-heuristic optimization method based on the process of pollination of flowers. The effectiveness and capability of FPA have been proved by taking difficult instances of antenna array design with single and multiple objectives. It is found that FPA is able to provide SLL reduction and steering the nulls in the undesired interference directions. Numerical results of FPA are also compared with the available results in the literature of state-of-the-art algorithms like genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, cuckoo search, tabu search, biogeography based optimization (BBO) and others which also proves the better performance of the proposed method. Moreover, FPA is more consistent in giving optimum results as compared to BBO method reported recently in the literature. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",Antenna; Evolutionary computing; Flower pollination algorithm; Linear antenna array; Optimization,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979243049

The rarity of this breeding system is probably because of the difficulty of colonization for distylous plants and the paucity of pollinators on oceanic islands. However, the endemic and endangered tree Psychotria homalosperma has maintained its distylous nature in the oceanic Bonin Islands, Japan. To understand how the distylous breeding system of P. homalosperma has been maintained on these islands and to characterize the reproduction systems, we studied the pollination and reproductive biology of this species. Specifically, we observed current flower visitors and estimated their effects on plant reproduction. We also examined the floral traits and floral volatiles of P. homalosperma to infer its original pollinators, because plantpollinator relationships in the Bonin Islands have recently been disrupted by anthropological activities. Finally, we examined the fruit set and pollen tube growth in the stigmas under hand and open pollination. Although original pollinators were presumed to be moths with long proboscises, the introduced honeybee, Apis mellifera, was the most common flower visitor. The honeybee carried pollen grains only unidirectionally, from the short- to long-styled morphs, because it could not reach the hidden stigmas of the short-styled flowers, and long-styled flowers set fruits 1.738 times more than short-styled ones. This case study indicates that the instability of pollinator fauna can cause distylous species to be rare on oceanic islands. © 2017 The Society for the Study of Species Biology",Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands; distyly; introduced honeybee; oceanic islands; pollinator shift; Psychotria homalosperma,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039909281

Despite the abundance of these three palm species, the breeding system and pollination mechanisms need further clarification. We used controlled hand-pollination experiments to investigate the breeding systems of these three species. We also observed and captured floral visitors, as well as examined their bodies for pollen, to determine the pollinator assemblages. Our experiments demonstrated that all three palms are self-compatible, and some flowers may set fruit with no manipulation. Natural (open) pollination treatments yielded more fruit than either cross- or self-pollination, indicating no shortage of pollination and suggesting that multiple visits by many pollinators enhances fruit set. We observed a wider variety of visitors (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera) to flowers of sabal and saw palmetto, as they offer both nectar and pollen. On flowers of silver palm, we observed only pollen-collecting bees. We found evidence of palm flower specialists in only two cases: Xylocopa micans bees carried only Coccothrinax pollen and Anartia jatrophae butterflies carried only Sabal pollen. All other visitors appeared to be generalists as they carried pollen from multiple plant species. These results highlight the importance of subcanopy palms in the pine rocklands ecosystem as they provide floral rewards for a wide array of insects that are beneficial for other plants of this imperiled habitat.",flowers; insects; palms; pine rocklands; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041220010

It is monoecious and protandrous. Flowering and pollination biology studies carried out in the coconut in different countries, at different times of the year, and in different environmental conditions have given widely divergent results on every aspect of flowering and pollination. It has been found that the coconut palm shows the capacity to adapt its flowering and pollination biology to suit various environmental variables in order to ensure its successful pollination and seed setting. These include self pollination, cross pollination, wind pollination, insect pollination, changes in flowering biology even within an individual palm such as effecting variations in length and occurrence of male and female phases in flowering even with minor changes in temperature and rainfall. They appear to be an adaptive mechanism to ensure the successful survival of the species under natural conditions. It is therefore concluded that the coconut possesses an opportunistic flowering and pollinating system. This may be considered as an adaptive mechanism of the species to ensure its survival, possibly since the coconut palm is monospecific. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Coconut; Cocos nucifera L; Cross pollination; Flowerinng bology; Opportunistic pollination system; Pollination biology; Self pollination; Survival strategy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021846491

The result showed that it was protandrous and that the stigma had no receptivity until the end of pollen dispersal. Its style showed a regular movement pattern during the flowering phase. The style was upright, very close to anthers at first; then it quickly curved down 90° from the base just before the dehiscing of anthers, but went back to the former upright state after pollen dispersal of all 6 anthers. From the blossoming to the end of pollen dispersal, the stigma was smooth and dry, and had no receptivity to pollens until the style went back to the upright state with papillae, and mucus appeared. The curving down movement of the style significantly widened the relative distance between the stigma and the dehiscing anthers. Therefore, protandry and style movement are double safeguard mechanisms for avoiding selfing and promoting outcrossing in Eremurus altaicus, which has important significance in its reproduction and evolution potential.",Foxtail lily; Mating system; Pollination; Protandry; Style movement,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040929876

The presence of flowers with poricidal anthers, heterostemony and pollen as the only reward are common traits in Melastomataceae species and are associated with buzz pollination by bees. Trembleya laniflora Cong. (Melastomataceae: Microlicieae) is an endemic species from campo rupestre tropical grassland, with large and white pollen flowers differing from the common purple-colored flowers of the Tribe. We examine the relationship between the distinct floral characteristics of T. laniflora and its pollination syndrome and reproduction ecology. We observed different individuals of T. laniflora randomly sampled in Serra do Cipó Espinhaço Range, Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. We carried out observations on their reproductive phenology (31 individuals), flower biology (3), pollination (23), and tested the reproductive system (29). Trembleya laniflora presented a seasonal flowering pattern in the dry and post-dry seasons (MayOctober) and set fruits during the dry, post-dry and rainy seasons (JuneDecember). Floral aperture occurred mainly during the night and the first hours of the morning, the period with the greatest availability of fresh flowers and with the highest visitation by Xylocopa bimaculata. Tests identified the species as non-apomictic, self-incompatible and dependent on large bees such as Xylocopa, Bombus, Centris and Ptiloglossa for pollination. Trembleya laniflora showed a specialized pollination system mediated by a restricted group of bees that perform crepuscular buzz pollination. Floral characteristics and reproductive biology of T. laniflora are likely adaptive responses to pollination by large bees foraging during the crepuscular hours. Our results support the pollination syndrome hypothesis, demonstrating a direct relationship between a set of floral characters and the principal pollinators of the species.

Positive directional pollinator-mediated selection on floral size has been widely shown to reduce phenotypic variance. However, the underlying mechanism of maintaining within-population floral color polymorphism is poorly understood. Divergent selection, mediated by different pollinators or by both mutualists and antagonists, may create and maintain such polymorphism, but it has rarely been shown to result from differential behavior of one pollinator. We tested whether different behaviors of the same pollinators in morning and evening are associated with dimorphic floral trait in Linum pubescens, a Mediterranean annual plant that exhibits variable within-population frequencies of dark- and light-colored flower tubes. Usia bicolor bee-flies, the major pollinators of L. pubescens, are mostly feeding in the flower in the morning, while in the evening they are mostly visiting the flowers for mating. In 2 years of studying L. pubescens in a single large population in the Carmel, Israel, we found in one year that dark-centered flowers received significantly higher fraction of visits in the morning. Fitness was positively affected by number of visits, but no fitness differences were found between tube-color morphs, suggesting that both morphs have similar pollination success. Using mediation analysis, we found that flower size was under positive directional pollinator-mediated selection in both years, but pollinator behavior did not explain entirely this selection, which was possibly mediated also by other agents, such as florivores or a-biotic stresses. While most pollinator-mediated selection studies show that flower size signals food reward, in L. pubescens, it may also signal for mating place, which may drive positive selection. While flower size found to be under pollinator-mediated selection in L. pubescens, differential behavior of the pollinators in morning and evening did not seem to explain flower color polymorphism. © 2017 The Authors.

Adding artificial nesting sites, such as trap nests, can promote cavity-nesting bees in agroecosystems, but effectiveness could be limited by the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape and by natural antagonists. In two European regions, we exposed artificial trap nests in paired field boundaries adjacent to oilseed rape (OSR) fields or non-flowering crops for 2 years within 32 landscapes covering two independent gradients of OSR cover and semi-natural habitat (SNH) cover in the landscape. We analysed the effects of local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity, landscape complexity and natural antagonists on community composition and population dynamics of trap-nesting bees. Numbers of brood cells showed a strong, three-fold increase in response to the additional nesting sites. Species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting bees that were active during OSR flowering increased significantly with increasing amounts of early season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of OSR. Later foraging species benefited instead from the availability of late-season alternative flower resources or SNH cover once the mass-flowering had ceased. Density-dependent parasitism increased following mass-flowering, while no density-dependent effect was found during mass-flowering. Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of floral resource availability on community growth rate was mediated by community size. Community size showed a strong negative effect on community growth rate. Despite positive density-dependent parasitism, antagonists had only weak regulating effects on community growth rate. Synthesis and applications. Trap-nesting bee populations grow markedly with the increasing availability of food resources in the landscape and effectiveness of trap nests is only marginally limited by natural antagonists. Thus, trap nests could be a simple pollinator-supporting strategy to accompany the current expansion of mass-flowering crops and to ensure pollination services for insect-pollinated crops. Trap nests benefit, not only early season active generalist bees during oilseed rape flowering, but also species with later phenology if accompanied by other pollinator-supporting practices. © 2017 The Authors.

However, more needs to be understood about how fragmentation influences ecological interactions, particularly pollination. Gypsum outcrops are historically fragmented Mediterranean habitats and settings for the evolution of many endangered soil-specialist plants with narrow ranges. In this study, we aimed to determine how fragmentation (area and connectivity) affects: (i) pollinator community composition and (ii) structural properties of pollination networks; and whether there are differences in the effects of fragmentation on: (iii) the number of interactions and visits among pollinator functional groups; and (iv) the number of interactions and specialisation degree between soil-specialist and soil-generalist plants. We characterised the degree of fragmentation and the pollination network structures in 12 gypsum habitat fragments embedded in a cropland matrix during two consecutive years. We found significant relationships between fragmentation and network structure. The effects of fragmentation differed among pollinator functional groups, but not between soil-specialist and soil-generalist plants, in terms of number of interactions. However, the relatively higher pollinator specialisation of soil-specialist plants suggested greater dependence on pollinators. Inter-annual variations in the network structures demonstrated the importance of temporal replication. The observed patterns related to the landscape structure and pollination at both the network and species levels provide insights into the key ecological processes in gypsum islands. These findings may help to identify the potential drivers of species persistence, especially for endangered soil-specialist plants with narrow ranges in a changing scenario with exacerbated habitat fragmentation. © 2017 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Connectivity; ecological network; fragment area; fragmentation; gypsum; soil-specialist plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039852984

Location: Southeast region of Brazil. Methods: We classified tree species found in a total of 40 forest sites (18 primary, 11 restored, 11 secondary) according to pollination mode, based on the literature. We calculated and compared functional dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness between forest types. Results: Functional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20%, >80%, respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee, wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination, whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and small insect pollination. Conclusions: Our results indicate a rather stable assemblage of pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes, and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in plantpollinator interactions. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science",Atlantic forest; Brazil; community structure; ecosystem management; forest fragmentation; functional diversity; human disturbance; meta-analysis; natural regeneration; plantanimal interactions; pollination syndromes; reproductive traits; restoration ecology; semi-deciduous forest,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031494333

Behavioral assays were performed with freshly eclosed naive galler wasps. Syconia with different oviposition histories, i.e. with or without prior oviposition, were presented to wasps in no-choice assays and the time taken to the first oviposition attempt was recorded. The wasps exhibited a preference for syconia previously exposed to conspecifics for oviposition over unexposed syconia. Additionally, syconia exposed to oviposition by heterospecific wasps were also preferred for oviposition over unexposed syconia indicating that wasps recognise and respond to interspecific cues. Wasps also aggregated for oviposition on syconia previously exposed to oviposition by conspecifics. We investigated chemical cues that wasps may employ in accepting an oviposition resource by analyzing syconial volatile profiles, chemical footprints left by wasps on syconia, and syconial surface hydrocarbons.

Epidendreae is one of the most diverse tribes among the orchids with remarkable variation in life form, floral morphology and pollination syndromes. Its circumscription was recently revised and subtribes Agrostophyllinae and Calypsoinae were transferred into this tribe. One of the principal floral characters utilized in classification of orchids is the incumbency or bending of the column. This study records and compares late stages of anther, column and lip development, and discusses anther characters in fifteen representative taxa of five of the six subtribes in Epidendreae with respect to classification and pollination biology. Methods. A series of late floral stages were sampled and fixed for examination under scanning electron microscope. Results. Anther incumbency or bending in this group varies from 90° to almost 180°. Incumbency in the late stages of development is reached in Bletiinae, Ponerinae, Pleurothallidinae and Laeliinae whereas incumbency is reached early in its development in Corallorhiza and Govenia of Calypsoinae. Discussion. Our observations indicate that the position of Chysis in subtribe Bletiinae needs revision based on differences in a number floral, and in particular of anther characters; and that Coelia only shares the early anther incumbency with Calypsoinae members, but not the rest of floral and anther characters. Anatomical characters such as crystals around the actinocytic stomata on the anther cap and sugar crystals in Laeliinae; lack of rostellum in Bletiinae; coalescent anther with the column, lack of trichomes and papillae on lip keels, and underdeveloped rostellum in Chysis; a mechanism by which the anther cap comes off(it is joined with the grooved lip by a claw) in Isochilus are all related to pollination syndromes and reproductive biology. © 2018 Valencia-Nieto et al.",Anther; Chysis; Development; Epidendreae; Incumbency; Orchidaceae; Pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042698422

During the growing season, partridge pea produces numerous flowers that are visited by many bee and wasp species. However, which bees/wasps act as the principle pollinators of partridge pea has not been explored thoroughly. We used mesh cages with different hole sizes (2.5, 0.64, 0.32, and 0.16 cm2) to screen out different sized pollinators and collected data on pod length, seed number, and percentage of pods formed per flower number (pod set). We also collected partridge pea flower insect visitors and estimated pollen loads on their bodies to determine the amount of pollen available for pollination services. Overall, partridge peas in cages with larger holes produced longer pods and more seeds compared to those in cages with smaller holes. However, no significant difference in pod set was observed among plants grown in the various size cages. Thirteen flower visitors were observed to visit open partridge pea flowers. The most common insect visitors were Bombus spp., Agapostemon splendens, and Apis mellifera. Apis mellifera contained significantly less pollen on its body compared to that on all other common bees. Likely pollinators of partridge pea in Florida are larger bees such as Xylocopa and Bombus and possibly Agapostemon splendens, a smaller halictid bee.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040331914

Given that insects are much smaller than bats, they may be more effective at transferring pollen for plant species with similar stamen and pistil lengths, such as the 'Monthong' durian cultivar. The present study clarifies the role of insects in pollinating the 'Monthong' cultivar by examining the floral biology, conducting pollination treatments on 19 trees and observing floral visitors in southern Thailand. Stigmas were receptive by 17h00, and over 50% of 'Monthong' anthers had dehisced by 17h30. Several bee species began foraging on flowers during the late afternoon, and the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) continued to visit throughout the night. Our results show that at 4 wk after pollination, the highest fruit set occurred from hand-crossed pollination (13.5%), followed by open pollination (5.5%), insect pollination (3.3%) and automatic autogamy (2.0%), indicating that this cultivar is highly self-incompatible. Moreover, insects appear to be important pollinators of 'Monthong' durian in areas where nectar bats visit infrequently. One bee species in particular, Apis dorsata, commonly foraged on flowers at dusk and appears to be the most effective insect pollinator of durian. Our findings highlight that nocturnally foraging bees are capable of securing pollination for night-blooming plant taxa, even those typically considered to be bat-pollinated. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.",Apis dorsata; Asian honey bee; Durio zibethinus; entomophily; giant honey bee; insect pollination; plant-pollinator interaction; stingless bee,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042924557

Among the 3980 proteins identified from the two samples, 139 proteins were identified as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Of these proteins, laccase-4 (LAC4), was found to be related with lignin synthesis, and ?-glucosidase 15 (BGLU15) and peroxidase 47 (PER47) were involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway.

At community level, spatially aggregated co-flowering species can thus be expected to exhibit suitable suites of traits to avoid competition and ensure pollination. We explored the problem by answering the following questions: (1) are co-flowering species specialized on different guilds of pollinators; (2) do co-flowering pollinator-sharing species segregate spatially; and (3) do co-flowering pollinator-sharing species that diverge in anther position spatially aggregate more than those that converge in anther position?. Study Site: Euganean Hills, NE Italy. Methods: Plant composition, flowering phenology and interactions between each entomophilous plant species and pollinating insects were monitored every 15 days in 40 permanent plots placed in an area of 16 ha. We quantified the degree of flowering synchrony, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation between each pair of entomophilous species. We then tested the relationship between the degree of co-flowering, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation, and between spatial aggregation and anther position. Results: Entomophilous species converged, at least partially in flowering time, and the phenological synchronization of flowering was significantly associated with the sharing of pollinator guilds. Co-flowering pollinator-sharing species segregated spatially. Furthermore, co-flowering pollinator-sharing species that diverged in anther position aggregated more than those that converged in anther position. Conclusions: Reproductive traits that facilitate the co-existence of co-flowering species include specialization on different pollinator guilds and a phenological displacement of the flowering time. Furthermore, in circumstances of increased competition due to phenological synchronization, pollinator-sharing and spatial aggregation, the chance of effective pollination might depend on differences in anther position, resulting in a divergent pollen placement on pollinator bodies. One of the most interesting results we obtained is that the presence of one mechanism does not preclude the operation of others, and each plant species can simultaneously exhibit different strategies. Although more studies are needed, our results can provide additional information about plantplant interactions and provide new insights into mechanisms allowing the co-existence of a high number of plant species in local communities. © 2017 International Association for Vegetation Science",anther position; assembly rules; dry grasslands; flowering synchrony; pollinator-sharing; spatial aggregation/segregation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042348477

The species is self-incompatible, but intra- and inter-morph compatible. Populations are either dimorphic (including both morphs) in the region of the Strait of Gibraltar, or L-monomorphic (with only L plants) in the inland of the Iberian Peninsula. This variation correlates with the most common floral visitors, being primarily long-tongued and short-tongued pollinators, respectively, a rare condition in Mediterranean plants. The maintenance of S-flowers relies on long-tongued insects, as only those deliver pollen to short-styled stigmas. Narcissus flowers present a long and narrow tube, at the bottom of which nectar accumulates, and a floral corona, which has been proposed as an important trait for the attraction of pollinators. Here we tested the importance of the corona on pollination of L and S flowers. We described UV reflectance patterns of the corona and tepals, and characterised VOCs in intact flowers and flowers with trimmed coronas. We also conducted a field experiment in the dimorphic and monomorphic region to estimate the importance of corona removal on seed production in stands with solitary plants and in groups to control for compatible pollen limitation. Reflectance was higher in the tepals than the corona, although both traits presented a reflectance peak around 450 nm wavelength. L- and S-flowers produced similar volatiles, regardless of the manipulation of the corona. Across dimorphic and monomorphic regions, S-flowers with the corona removed suffered a reduction in seed production of ca. 50%, while seed production remained similar in L flowers both with the corona intact and removed. Plants in solitary stands suffered a strong reduction in seed production, which was more pronounced in the monomorphic region. Our results suggest that the corona in Narcissus is more important for the pollination of S-flowers, which generally have lower seed production compared to L-flowers. Taken together, these results suggest that the floral corona indirectly plays an important role for maintenance of the polymorphism. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Diurnal and nocturnal pollination; flower corona; flower fragrance; flower reflectance; moths; style polymorphism; syrphids; winter flowering,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039845446

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal time to carry out manual pollination efficiently in tomatillo. Closed flower buds with yellow coloration were covered and five manual pollination times (days one, two, three, four and five) and one non-pollinated control were evaluated in two families of the Diamante and Manzano varieties. A 5 x 2 x 2 factorial treatment design was used in a randomized complete block experimental design with four replicates. The experimental unit consisted of 10 floral buds. The number of fruits (NF), fruit weight (FW), total seed weight (TSW), total number of seeds (TNS) and weight of 100 seeds (W100S) were evaluated. The highest efficiency was obtained when manual pollination was carried out on the second and third days. The Diamante variety had a higher NF (7.8), TSW (2.315 mg) and TNS (1.415.8), while Manzano Tepetlixpa had higher FW (420.17 g) and W100S (191, 538 mg). Family one of the Diamante variety was superior in TNS, but family two had larger seed size. In Manzano Tepetlixpa there were no differences between families. On the other hand, Diamante reached its highest seed production with pollination on day three, without statistically exceeding day two. Manzano had higher seed production when pollinated on day two, but did not statistically exceed day three. Therefore, it was determined that the optimal period of pollination in tomatillo is between two and three days after having covered the floral buds.",Crosses; Fertilization; Self-incompatibility; Tomato races,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040838574

The flowers are campanulate, bisexual, weakly protandrous, selfcompatible and facultative autogamous. The forager guilds indicate that thripsophily, melittophily and psychophily are functional pollination syndromes. Ballistichory, anemochory and hydrochory are the seed dispersal modes. Seeds germinate as soon as they reach the ground if the soil has sufficient moisture or else they remain dormant and germinate during the rainy season. Such seed dispersal modes and flexible germination responses enable the plant to invade and colonize new areas. Further, the plant with perennial woody root stock stays alive during the dry season, sprouts back to life during the rainy season to re-start its life cycle. The dual modes of regeneration enable the plant to form extensive herbaceous cover and bind the soil effectively. Therefore, the plant is an important soil binder and useful at controlling soil erosion. © Lakshminarayana & Raju 2018.",Anemochory; Ballistochory; Facultative autogamy; Hydrochory; Melittophily; Merremia tridentata; Psychophily; Thripsophily,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042551857

The importance of infectious diseases has been documented in honeybees, but there is little information on the extent to which these diseases are shared with other pollinator orders. Here, we establish for the first time the presence of three important bee viruses in hoverfly pollinators (Diptera: Syrphidae): black queen cell virus (BQCV), sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus strain B (DWV-B). These viruses were detected in two Eristalis species, which are behavioural and morphological bee mimics and share a foraging niche with honeybees. Nucleotide sequences of viruses isolated from the Eristalis species and Apis mellifera were up to 99 and 100% identical for the two viruses, suggesting that these pathogens are being shared freely between bees and hoverflies. Interestingly, while replicative intermediates (negative strand virus) were not detected in the hoverflies, viral titres of SBV were similar to those found in A. mellifera. These results suggest that syrphid pollinators may play an important but previously unexplored role in pollinator disease dynamics. © 2018 The Authors.",Acute bee paralysis virus; Emerging infectious diseases; Honeybee; Hover fly; Slow bee paralysis virus; Varroa destructor virus,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043988590

Pseudogamous gametophytic apomicts, which require a fertilization to initiate seed development, of various ploidy levels frequently co-occur with their lower-ploid sexual ancestors, but the stability of such mixed populations is affected by reproductive interferences mediated by cross-pollination. Thereby, reproductive success of crosses depends on the difference in ploidy levels of mating partners, that is, on tolerance of deviation from the balanced ratio of maternal versus paternal genomes. Quality of pollen can further affect reproductive success in intercytotype pollinations. Cross-fertilization, however, can be avoided by selfing which may be induced upon pollination with mixtures of self- and cross-pollen (i.e., mentor effects). We tested for reproductive compatibility of naturally co-occurring tetraploid sexuals and penta- to octoploid apomicts in the rosaceous species Potentilla puberula by means of controlled crosses. We estimated the role of selfing as a crossing barrier and effects of self- and cross-pollen quality as well as maternal: paternal genomic ratios in the endosperm on reproductive success. Cross-fertilization of sexuals by apomicts was not blocked by selfing, and seed set was reduced in hetero- compared to homoploid crosses. Thereby, seed set was negatively related to deviations from balanced parental genomic ratios in the endosperm. In contrast, seed set in the apomictic cytotypes was not reduced in hetero- compared to homoploid crosses. Thus, apomictic cytotypes either avoided intercytotype cross-fertilization through selfing, tolerated intercytotype cross-fertilizations without negative effects on reproductive success, or even benefitted from higher pollen quality in intercytotype pollinations. Our experiment provides evidence for asymmetric reproductive interference, in favor of the apomicts, with significantly reduced seed set of sexuals in cytologically mixed populations, whereas seed set in apomicts was not affected. Incompleteness of crossing barriers further indicated at least partial losses of a parental genomic endosperm balance requirement. © 2017 The Authors.

We investigated B. excelsa individuals and fruits, to check mating system index variations in a population by using open-pollinated seeds which were hierarchically sampled within and among fruits from nine trees genotyped for ten microsatellite loci. Outcrossing rate (tm) changed between trees (0.491.0) and fruits (0.531.0), but seeds were predominantly produced by outcrossing (0.92) at mean population level. Mating between related trees (tm - ts) was detected in six trees (0.04 0.08) and in 32 fruits in trees (0.030.22), thus it suggests that the population presented some related trees in our intra-population spatial genetic structure. Individual fixation index values of seed trees (Fm) were lower than the seedling fixation index values (Fo), fact that suggests the selection against inbred individuals between the seed and adult stages. The correlated mating showed that seeds sampled at population level were predominantly composed of half-sibs (66%) and full-sibs (20%). Paternity correlation was significantly higher within (rp(w)) than among (rp(a )) fruits at population level, mostly in individual trees. Results evidenced that mating was not random due to self-fertilization, to mating between related trees and correlated mating, and families comprised different relatedness levels such as half-sibs, full-sibs, self-sibs and self-half-sibs; some cases, mating presented inbreeding. These results were addressed to discuss strategies for seed collection applied to conservation ex situ, tree breeding and environmental reforestation. © 2017 The Authors.",Brazil nut; Brazilian Amazon; Conservation genetics; Microsatellite markers; Tropical tree,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041915612

By comparing capsules and seeds resulting from cross versus self-pollination treatments, we determined that self-pollination reduces seed quality while having no detectable effect on capsule production or seed numbers. A smaller percentage of seeds resulting from selfpollination contained an embryo (18%) relative to seeds from cross-pollination (46%). Seeds that had an embryo were scored for the size of the embryo, small or large. A smaller proportion of seeds from self-pollination contained a large embryo (75%) relative to seeds from cross-pollination (92%).

In order to investigate the reproductive system of this species, a suite of characters was assessed: phenology, floral morphology and biology, nectar production dynamics, and fruit and seed production and germination, as a result of controlled pollination crosses. The study was conducted during two flowering seasons in wild populations in Yucatán, Mexico. Results suggest an annual flowering pattern with one flowering peak; flowers were diurnal, showing partial dichogamy (protandry)-herkogamy, anthers and stigma become mature before floral aperture, which could lead to self-pollination, nectar is produced during anthesis, varying in volume and total sugar concentration during the day; fruits and seeds were produced in all experimental crosses (cross-pollination, obligated cross-pollination, assisted and unassisted selfing, geitonogamy and apomixis), as well as high percentage seed germination. Several species of Aechmea are reportedly self-compatible and autogamous, as suggested by results of selfing and non-assisted selfing crosses, but these results are negated by the presence of apomixis, indicating that the species is apomictic. This is the first report of this breeding system for subgenus Aechmea and the sixth for Bromeliaceae. Polyembryony is here suggested for the first time in this genus and family based on the fact that more seeds were recorded that expected based on ovule numbers. Finally, when performing experimental crosses, estimating reproductive success based on number of seeds is a better approach than number of fruits, due to the effect of pseudogamy. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Apomixis; germination; polyembriony; pseudogamy; reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034754774

How pollination services respond to such stressors depends on the capacity of pollinator assemblages to function in the face of environmental disruption. Here, we quantify how pollination services provided to a native plant change upon removal of the non-native, western honey bee (Apis mellifera)a numerically dominant floral visitor in the native bee-rich ecosystems of southern California. We focus on services provided to clustered tarweed (Deinandra fasciculata), a native, annual forb that benefits from outcross pollination. Across five different study sites in coastal San Diego County, tarweed flowers attracted 70 insect taxa, approximately half of which were native bees, but non-native honey bees were always the most abundant floral visitor at each site. To test the ability of the native insect fauna to provide pollination services, we performed Apis removals within experimental 0.25 m2 plots containing approximately 20 tarweed plants and compared visitation and seed set between plants in removal and paired control plots (n = 16 pairs). Even though 92% of observed floral visits to control plots were from honey bees, Apis removal reduced seed production by only 14% relative to plants in control plots. These results indicate that native insect assemblages can contribute important pollination services even in ecosystems numerically dominated by introduced pollinators. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Introduced species; Native bees; Pollination services; Pollinator visitation; Seed set,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034227277

These mutualisms, like other ecological interactions, are currently threatened by different drivers of global change, mainly habitat loss, fragmentation, or modification of its quality. Most studies so far have focused on the impact of such disturbances on particular species interactions and we thus need more empirical evidence on the responses at a community-level. Here we evaluated how habitat loss influenced the pattern of interactions between plants and their flower visitors in a coastal dune marshland community. Using data from four years (20082011), we assessed the effect of a large disturbance in the area (occurring in 2010) that represented the loss of more than 50% of the vegetation cover. We found a considerable decrease in species richness and abundance of flower visitors, which resulted in a lower number of interactions after the disturbance. Not all functional groups, however, responded similarly. Contrary to the expected from previous findings, bees and wasps were less negatively influenced than beetles, flies and ants, possibly due to their higher movement capacity. Species interactions in the community were more specialized after habitat loss, resulting in a lower level of network nestedness and a higher modularity. At a species level, the number of flower visitors per plant decreased after the disturbance, and plants were visited by less abundant flower visitors. Our findings lead us to predict that the overall plantflower visitor network became less robust and resilient to future perturbations. However, the fact that each functional group responds distinctly to disturbances makes it more difficult to foresee the final consequences on community composition and ecosystem functioning. © 2017 The Authors",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021705336

In populations composed of plants with temporally separated sexual phases (i.e. dichogamous or heterodichogamous populations), pollen-mediated gene flow is assumed to reflect phenological overlap between complementary sexual phases. In this study, we conducted paternity analyses to test this hypothesis in the temporally dimorphic tree Acer opalus. We performed spatially explicit analyses based on categorical and fractional paternity assignment, and included tree size, pair-wise genetic relatedness and morph type as additional predictors. Because differences between morphs in flowering phenology may also influence pollination distances, we modelled separate pollen dispersal kernels for the two morphs. Extended phenological overlap between male and female phases (mainly associated with inter-morph crosses) resulted in higher siring success after accounting for the effects of genetic relatedness, morph type and tree size, while reduced phenological overlap (mainly associated with intra-morph crosses) resulted in longer pollination distances achieved. Siring success also increased in larger trees. Mating patterns could not be predicted by phenology alone. However, as heterogeneity in flowering phenology was the single morph-specific predictor of siring success, it is expected to be key in maintaining the temporal dimorphism in A. opalus, by promoting not only a prevalent pattern of inter-morph mating, but also long-distance pollination resulting from intra-morph mating events. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Acer opalus; dichogamy; microsatellites; neighbourhood model; phenology; separate pollen dispersal kernels,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034262063

In some circumstances, however, this attraction towards conspecifics may lead to suboptimal foraging performance because the presence of multiple pollinators typically results in a faster rate of nectar depletion in the flower. We tested the capacity of bees to learn to avoid flowers occupied by conspecifics when they offered a lower reward than unoccupied similar flowers. Bumblebees were able to discriminate between poorly and highly rewarding flowers by using the presence of a nonsocial cue (a wooden rectangular white block). When poorly rewarding flowers were indicated by social cues (model bees), however, bees did not discriminate between the two flower types except when an additional cue was provided (flower colour). These findings indicate that bumblebees attach particular meaning to conspecific presence on flowers, even when this could lead to suboptimal foraging performance.

Resulting loss, isolation and degradation of flower-rich habitats are threatening pollinators. Agri-environmental schemes (AES) aim to counteract these negative effects, including measures to enhance floral resources in agricultural landscapes. The impact of plant species composition on their efficiency to mitigate pollinator loss, however, is largely unexplored. We tested four recommended seed mixtures for their attractiveness to wild bees and hoverflies in a replicated plot design over two consecutive years against the background of the seedbank. Of the 94 available plant species, 14 key plant species were crucial for the whole flower-visiting bee and hoverfly community. Approximately one third of each originated from the seedbank. The four top plants already supported 80% of flower visitors. Although seed mixtures differed significantly in attracting flower visitors at the plot level, the presence of key plants was more important than plant species diversity per se. Seed mixtures showed contrasting attractiveness for wild bees and hoverflies. Identification of plant species exclusively utilised by specific taxonomic groups opens opportunities for assorting plant mixtures for specific ecosystem functions or taxa of conservation concern. Plant species shared by common pollinators are valuable for overall pollinator diversity. The fact that rare and specialised pollinator species were mostly absent, however, substantiates that within 2 years of establishment, flowering resources are not the sole limiting factor in modern agricultural landscapes. Considering additional resources seems indispensable to maximise the conservation of species-rich pollinator communities. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",Apoidea; flowering fields; greening; habitat fragmentation; pollinator loss; supporting ecosystem services; Syrphidae; wildflower plantings; wildflower strips,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040116293

In such species, sterile reproductive structures may indirectly increase fitness of the cryptic morph. This study manipulates pollination mode to investigate two hypotheses regarding the influence of sterile stamens on female fitness in the cryptically dioecious Thalictrum macrostylum. Pollination mode and the presence of pollen limitation in natural populations were also investigated. In two natural populations, pollen receipt on pistils was quantified in open-pollinated and pollinator-exclusion flowers with varying numbers of stamens. Seed set was quantified in additional open-pollinated flowers, a subset of which received supplemental pollen to test for pollen limitation. Females were not significantly insect pollinated at either site. Number of sterile stamens per flower was positively related to pollen receipt in open-pollinated flowers at one site, but had no influence on seed set at either site. In one population, seed set was significantly pollen limited, and high variance in seed set among pollen-addition flowers in both populations indicates that high pollen loads do not always increase seed set. In the wind-pollinated and cryptically dioecious Thalictrum macrostylum, sterile stamens in females do not appear to increase female fitness.

However, the reproductive consequences of producing a single flower are poorly understood. Here, we test if plants producing a single flower have a reproductive disadvantage compared with plants producing multiple flowers by combining field investigation of five deceptive orchids and a survey of published literature. Pollen limitation was estimated by comparing fruit production between hand pollination and open pollination. Flowering frequency was monitored over years to assess the potential advantage of producing a single flower. Both single- and multiple-flowered species suffered strong pollen limitation. However, single-flowered species had significantly lower fruit set and produced fewer seeds per individual, although they had a significantly higher pollen removal than species with multiple flowers. A phylogenetically independent contrast of 28 species representing four of the five subfamilies of Orchidaceae revealed that fruit set was significantly positively associated with flower number. Both pollen removal and fruit set had a positive relationship with flower number within the multiple-flowered species. Synthesis. Current data and phylogenetically independent contrast support the hypothesis that producing a single flower has reproductive disadvantages. Single-flowered species may compensate for low female success through high flowering frequency over years.

Thus far, little is known about the role of alternative splicing in the regulation of maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm development. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of endosperms from two maize inbred lines, Mo17 and Ji419, at 15 and 25 days after pollination (DAP), respectively, were used to identify genes that were alternatively spliced during endosperm development. Intron retention (IR) in GRMZM2G005887 was further validated using PCR and re-sequencing technologies. In total, 49,000 alternatively spliced events and ca. 20,000 alternatively spliced genes were identified in the two maize inbred lines. Of these, 30 genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and starch biosynthesis were identified, with IR occurring only in a specific sample, and were significantly co-expressed with ten well-known genes related to maize endosperm development. Moreover, IR in GRMZM2G005887, which encodes a cysteine synthase, was confirmed to occur only in the endosperm of Mo17 at 15 DAP, resulting in the retention of a 121-bp fragment in its 5? untranslated region. Two cis-acting regulatory elements, CAAT-box and TATA-box were observed in the retained fragment in Mo17 at 15 DAP; this could regulate the expression of this gene and influence endosperm development. The results suggest that the 30 genes with IR identified herein might be associated with maize endosperm development, and are likely to play important roles in the developing maize endosperm. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Alternative splicing; endosperm development; intron retention; maize; RNA sequencing,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037985439

This knowledge gap is critical, as climate change poses a major threat to ecosystems, especially in the Mediterranean. This study focuses on one of the hottest parts of the Mediterranean Basin, the Aegean Archipelago, Greece, and examines how climate affects species richness and network properties (e.g. nestedness, modularity and specialisation)  either directly or indirectly through species richness. We sampled systematically 39 local plantpollinator networks on eight islands along a northsouth climate gradient in the Aegean. All plantpollinator material used in the analyses was collected in 2012 and identified to species level. Aspects of climate used in the models were expressed as average conditions (mean temperature and annual precipitation) or as seasonal variability (isothermality and temperature seasonality). Structural properties of plantpollinator networks were found to be strongly associated with species richness, which was in turn affected by climate, implying that pollination network structure is driven indirectly by climate. In addition, climate had a direct effect on network structure, especially on modularity and specialisation. Different aspects of climate affected network properties in different ways. We highlight that even in a relatively narrow latitudinal gradient, such as within the Aegean Sea region, climate constitutes a significant driver of plantpollinator interactions. © 2017 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Climate effect; Mediterranean shrublands; network properties; phrygana; plantpollinator networks; precipitation; species richness; temperature,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039852044

We examined how tropical deforestation affects hummingbird community structure in premontane forest patches embedded in a tropical countryside of Coto Brus Canton, Costa Rica. We captured hummingbirds in fourteen landscapes representing a gradient in patch size and forest amount, and tested for the effects of these variables on (1) hummingbird captures at flowers (pollinator availability); (2) species richness; and (3) filtering of functional traits. After accounting for sampling effects, both hummingbird availability and species richness declined by 40% and 50%, respectively, across the gradient in deforestation that we observed (966% forest within 1000 m). Focal patch size was the strongest predictor, even after statistically accounting for the amount of forest and matrix composition of landscapes. These reductions in availability and richness were well predicted by functional traits; morphologically specialized species with the capacity to transport long-distance outcrossed pollen and low functional redundancy within the pollinator network showed the greatest sensitivity to landscape change. We hypothesize that declines in hummingbird availability, diversity, and functional traits are important mechanisms driving the observed pollen limitation of ornithophilous flowers in fragmented tropical landscapes.

Pollen placed on a pollinators body can be picked up by conspecific stigmas or it can be collected by the pollinator as food. Hypothetically, one solution is for pollen to be placed on safe sites on the pollinators body, sites where the pollinator cannot easily remove it, leaving the pollen for stigmas. We compared 14 sites on the bumblebee body in terms of the ability of the bee to groom off fluorescent power, a dust that may be thought of as analogous to pollen. The safest sites were along the midline of the dorsal thorax, the dorsal abdomen, and the ventral abdomen. Next, we counted how much pollen is borne on the 14 sites by bees visiting one nectariferous and three nectarless Pedicularis species. In the four species, only 7, 26, 28, and 30% of pollen found on the bees were on safe sites. Finally, we observed that the 14 sites were contacted by stigmas of the four Pedicularis species; none of the most contacted sites were safe sites. Across all four Pedicularis species, pollen is mainly positioned on sites of the bee body that were beneficial for both the plant and the bee, not on sites detrimental to either of them. Our analysis showed that the conflict of interest between flowers and bees can be solved by cooperation.

Here, we ask how fire-induced changes in flowering affect the abundance of bumble bee foragers (Bombus vosnesenskii) and whether differences in floral resource availability are due to changes in plant species composition or lengthened bloom of a consistent set of species within burned and unburned grasslands. Following fire, burned and unburned sites had similar early spring bee and floral abundances. However, after the early bloom, forager activity remained high only in burned sites, where floral abundance persisted for longer. Importantly, the increased floral abundance following fire was due to a lengthening of within-species flowering phenology, as burned areas later in the season retained floral abundance and composition similar to that of unburned areas early in the season. Furthermore, density of flower patches chosen by bumble bee foragers was significantly higher at burned sites, suggesting an increase in patch quality for foragers in post-fire communities. Our results suggest positive effects of fire for bumble bee foragers and forb communities in California grassland ecosystems in the year following disturbance, namely through differences in plant phenology and floral density.

Plant-pollinator interactions provide a convenient system to test such predictions because floral resources are often temporally patchy, thus requiring long-lived pollinators to switch resources seasonally. Furthermore, flowering phenologies range from steady-state (low-rewarding but highly reliable) to big-bang (high-rewarding but ephemeral) plant species. We assessed how nectarivorous Old World bats respond to this temporally variable floral environment by examining their diets throughout the year. Over 15 months of fieldwork in southern Thailand, we simultaneously: (1) recorded the flowering phenologies of six bat-pollinated plant taxa; and (2) assessed the diets of seven common flower-visiting bat species. As predicted, the generalist nectarivore (Eonycteris spelaea) frequently switched diets and utilized both big-bang and steady-state resources, while the specialist nectarivores (Macroglossus minimus and M. sobrinus) foraged on one or two steady-state plant species year-round. Our results suggest that larger and faster bat species are able to fly longer distances in search of big-bang resources, while smaller bat species rely on highly predictable food resources. This study supports the theory that generalist foragers have flexible diets, while specialist species restrict foraging to preferred floral resources even when other floral resources are more abundant. Moreover, these findings demonstrate how plant flowering phenology and pollinator diet breadth can shape the frequency and constancy of pollinator visits; we further discuss how such interactions can influence the potential extent of gene flow within a patchy floral environment. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation",big-bang resources; chiropterophily; diet switching; phenology; pollination; Pteropodidae; steady-state resources; Thailand,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030153094

FPA is compared with a genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and a conventional PI controller. During large load disturbance in the areas, controllers are incapable of reducing frequency deviations and tie-line power oscillations due to the slow response of the speed governor mechanism. Hence, to improve the dynamic response of the LFC, redox ow batteries (RFBs) are added to both areas due to their quick response and lower time constant. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the RFBs and FPA, especially in terms of overshoots, undershoots, and settling time, thereby improving the performance of LFC in the deregulated power system.

Using flight cages, we simulated (i) a perfect synchronization (from a bee perspective): bees and flowers occur simultaneously, (ii) a mismatch of 3 days and (iii) a mismatch of 6 days, with bees occurring earlier than flowers in the latter two cases. A mismatch of 6 days caused severe fitness losses in all three bee species, as few bees survived without flowers. Females showed strongly reduced activity and reproductive output compared to synchronized bees. Fitness consequences of a 3-day mismatch were species-specific. Both the early-spring species Osmia cornuta and the mid-spring species Osmia bicornis produced the same number of brood cells after a mismatch of 3 days as under perfect synchronization. However, O. cornuta decreased the number of female offspring, whereas O. bicornis spread the brood cells over fewer nests, which may increase offspring mortality, e.g. due to parasitoids. The late-spring specialist Osmia brevicornis produced fewer brood cells even after a mismatch of 3 days. Additionally, our results suggest that fitness losses after temporal mismatches are higher during warm than cold springs, as the naturally occurring temperature variability revealed that warm temperatures during starvation decreased the survival rate of O. bicornis. We conclude that short temporal mismatches can cause clear fitness losses in solitary bees. Although our results suggest that bees have evolved species-specific strategies to mitigate fitness losses after temporal mismatches, the bees were not able to completely compensate for impacts on their fitness after temporal mismatches with their food resources. © 2017 The Authors.

Using a common bumblebee species from the western United States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region. Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel, phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources in pollinator habitat management. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.",Bumblebee; Dispersal; Phenology; Pollination; Spatial ecology,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038398234

In this study, 150 years of Bombus records in the state of New Hampshire from the University of New Hampshire Insect Collection were examined. This allowed for changes in abundance and distribution to be tracked over time, with focus on species designated of greatest conservation need by NH Fish & Game Department. Floral records also provided insight into the diet breadth of these species, which may affect their vulnerability. Evidence of drastic decline was found in Bombus affinis, Bombus fervidus, and Bombus terricola, as well as significant decline in Bombus vagans with data suggesting it has been ecologically replaced by Bombus impatiens over time.

At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation. © 2018 Dickel et al.

Sex ratio did not differ from the expected 1:1 in the two studied populations. As expected, hermaphrodite flowers were larger than female flowers, but in contrast to the general pattern, hermaphrodite flowers did not produce nectar or produced much less than female flowers. Flower visitors were flies (68%) and bumblebees (24%), both of which showed a preference for female flowers.

However, despite the large amount of accumulated data, the impact of the complex repetitive DNA fraction on genome reorganization and functioning and the mechanisms balancing and maintaining the structural integrity of the genome are not fully understood. Homologous recombination is thought to play a key role in both genome reshuffling and stabilization, while the contribution of nonhomologous recombination seems to be undervalued. Here, tandem repeat patterns and dynamics during pollen mother cell development were addressed, with a focus on the meiotic recombination that determines chromosome/genome repatterning and stabilization under cross-pollination and artificial hybridization in wild goatgrass, Aegilops speltoides. Native plants from contrasting allopatric populations and artificially created intraspecific hybrids were investigated using a FISH approach. Cytogenetic analysis uncovered a wide spectrum of genotype- and cell-specific chromosomal rearrangements, suggesting intensive repatterning of both parental and hybrid genomes. The data obtained provide evidence that repetitive elements serve as overabundant and ubiquitous resources for maintaining chromosome architecture/genome integrity through homologous and nonhomologous recombination at the intraorganismal level, and genotype-specific repatterning underlies intrapopulation polymorphisms and intraspecific diversification in the wild. © 2018 S.

To determine how the diversity and quantity of resources for larvae and adults affect hoverfly abundance and species richness at three spatial scales, we recorded insect visitors of five target plant species in Belgian heathlands, habitats that have decreased considerably due to human activities. Hoverflies represented the most abundant visitors on two plant species, and the second most abundant visitors (after bumblebees) on the other target plant species. A large proportion of hoverflies observed were aphidophagous species associated with coniferous and deciduous forests. Resources for the larvae and floral resources for the adults influenced interactions among hoverflies and plants, but acted at different scales: larval habitat availability (distance to larval habitat) was relevant at the landscape scale, whereas adult resource availability (floral density) was relevant at the plot scale. Hoverfly abundance and species richness decreased with distance to larval habitat but increased with floral density. Moreover, landscape structure and composition had different effects according to hoverfly ecological traits. Landscape composition influenced aphidophagous but not saprophagous hoverflies, in that their abundance and species richness decreased with distance to forests.

Inter-annual variability in flowering patterns may have important consequences for attractiveness to pollinators, and ultimately, plant reproductive output. To understand the consequences of flowering pattern variability, a community approach is necessary because pollinator flower choice is highly dependent on flower context. Our objectives were: 1) To quantify yearly variability in flower density and phenology; 2) To evaluate whether changes in flowering patterns result in significant changes in pollen/nectar composition. We monitored weekly flowering patterns in a Mediterranean scrubland community (23 species) over 8 years. Floral resource availability was estimated based on field measures of pollen and nectar production per flower. We analysed inter-annual variation in flowering phenology (duration and date of peak bloom) and flower production, and inter-annual and monthly variability in flower, pollen and nectar species composition. We also investigated potential phylogenetic effects on inter-annual variability of flowering patterns. We found dramatic variation in yearly flower production both at the species and community levels. There was also substantial variation in flowering phenology. Importantly, yearly fluctuations were far from synchronous across species, and resulted in significant changes in floral resources availability and composition at the community level. Changes were especially pronounced late in the season, at a time when flowers are scarce and pollinator visitation rates are particularly high. We discuss the consequences of our findings for pollinator visitation and plant reproductive success in the current scenario of climate change. © 2018 Flo et al.

Results of generalized linear models indicate that colony growth and reproduction increased with floral diversity and species turnover, and declined with site area and the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The sex ratio of reproductive offspring was significantly more male-biased on sites with low flower diversity, underscoring the importance of floral diversity for meeting the higher resource demands of queen production. Floral resource composition and consistency were influenced by site age and surrounding landscape. Older sites had higher floral diversity and species turnover throughout the season than younger sites, and included high-quality native bee forage plants. We discuss the implications of this study for reclamation project managers seeking to promote bee reproduction and conservation. © 2017 Society for Ecological Restoration",bee forage; Bombus; floral resources; landscape; mine reclamation; pollinator conservation; pollinator habitat,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040358038

How these strips affect flower visitors with carnivorous larvae, however, is almost unknown. We studied the impact of wildflower strips and their surroundings on two common solitary wasps: the caterpillar-hunting Ancistrocerus nigricornis Curtis and the spider-hunting Trypoxylon figulus Linnaeus. Trap-nest locations at 22 semi-natural habitats in central Germany formed independent gradients in landscape complexity and distance to either one or several wildflower strips in their surroundings. For each brood cell, we recorded the number of prey items, total caterpillar weight and spider species richness. Ancistrocerus nigricornis built more cells in proximity to wildflower strips and with increasing amount of surrounding grassland. Fewer prey items provided in landscapes with large shares of semi-natural habitats suggest that in these landscapes high-quality prey is available. In contrast, T. figulus built more cells with increasing distance of nests to wildflower strips. If there were few strips, T. figulus built more cells in grassland-rich landscapes, whereas low shares of grassland were compensated when several wildflower strips were present. Benefits of flowering strips for T. figulus seem related to flower resources for adults, rather than through prey provisioning. In conclusion, wildflower strips promote prey-hunting wasps through species-specific effects on adult and larval food provisioning. Considering the differential effects of wasps on crop pests (caterpillars) and natural enemies (spiders), the functional role of wildflower strips in agroecosystems may be much greater than assumed when solely focusing on pollination. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",Agri-environment schemes; ecosystem service; farmland biodiversity; flower-visiting insects; grassland matrix; habitat fragmentation; land-use change; landscape connectivity; pollinator loss,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032191991

However, endosperm is composed of distinct tissue types. For example, the maize (Zea mays) endosperm is constituted by two major tissues, starchy endosperm and aleurone. Previous studies in imprinted gene expression have generally assumed that the different tissues constituting endosperm would behavior the same, and hence have not examined them separately. Here, to examine parental-specific expression of imprinted genes in different parts of the seed, eight previously reported maize protein-coding imprinted genes were selected, and analyzed by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) coupled with Sanger sequencing for transcripts from the various seed tissues collected at 18 days after pollination (DAP). The studied tissues included seed coat, embryo, starchy endosperm and aleurone, which were collected from a pair of reciprocal F1 hybrids produced by crossing inbred lines B73 and Mo17. Six of these eight analyzed imprinted genes showed the same imprinted expression pattern between the starchy endosperm and aleurone, but two showed imprinted expression only in the starchy endosperm. Comparison of the expression pattern of 20 selected imprinted genes in multiple seed tissues and vegetative tissues indicated that the majority (~ 75%) of these imprinted genes exhibited seed-specific or endosperm-specific expression. Our results also uncovered that imprinted genes have a high propensity to be alternatively spliced via intron retention in the developing embryo compared with the other tissues. © 2017, The Genetics Society of Korea and Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aleurone; Alternative splicing; Imprinted genes; Maize; Starchy endosperm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030153682

Morphological convergences of flower traits have allowed flowers to maximize their attraction to pollinator agents leading to the concept of pollination syndromes. Due to habitat heterogeneity, low water retention and resource availability in the soil, as well as broad altitudinal range of the system, plants often show restricted distributions in rupestrian grasslands. The present study aimed to describe the floral biology and reproductive aspects of Collaea cipoensis, a shrub restricted to small patches alongside watercourses in rupestrian grasslands of Serra do Cipó Brazil. Specifically, we examined the dependence on pollinators to set fruits and the functional role of floral visitors (i.e. pollinators, nectar-robbers, nectar-thieves, and florivores). Collaea cipoensis is a strictly xenogamous species and two hummingbirds (Colibri serrirostris and Eupetomena macroura) are its potential pollinators. Although C. serrirostris also behaves as illegitimate visitor, it represents 90% of legitimate visits, thus being the most important pollinator. However, the most common flower visitors are two important nectar-robbers, the bee Trigona spinipes and the syrphid Toxomerus musicus. The species is self-incompatible and pollen-limited, as hand-pollination increased fruit production more than 50%. Still, hand-pollination set only 20% of fruits and 48% of seeds. Overall, the dependence on cross-pollination, the stressful environmental conditions and the high floral visitation rates by illegitimate visitors may limit reproduction of this species, leading to a fitness reduction. Our results reinforce the idea that rupestrian grasslands conform a complex scenario that restricts the species distribution. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Hummingbird pollination; Illegitimate visitors; Mating system; Nectar-robbing; Pollination; Reproductive success,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018869600

We aimed to determine the nature of the interaction via flower visitors between Leucospermum conocarpodendron and Mimetes fimbriifolius, two shrubs in the Proteaceae that share many ecological traits and coexist on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. To assess the extent of pollinator sharing we analysed nectar properties and recorded the pollinator fauna, their behaviour and contribution to seed set. To test for competition via interspecific pollen transfer, we recorded the movement patterns of pollinators and quantified pollen loads. To determine the effect of co-flowering on visitation rates we recorded visits in stands that varied in the density of the two species. We found that the species produce similar rewards and share pollinating Cape Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer). Interspecific pollen transfer is avoided by placing pollen on different parts of the bird. Both species are visited by nectar-thieving Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea). Insects and autonomous self-pollination contributed little to seed set. Pollinator visits increased with conspecific density in both species, and the slope of the increase was steepest in the presence of high densities of the co-occurring plant species. Nectar thief visits also increased with conspecific density in both species, but the slope declined with increasing density of the co-occurring species. Co-occurrence enhanced pollinator visits and alleviated nectar robbing in both plant species, consistent with mutualisms.

One of the lineages where heterostyly and related stylar conditions appear more frequently is Linum (Linaceae). This group is particularly suitable for testing competing hypotheses about ancestral and transitional stages on the evolutionary building up of heterostyly. We generated a phylogeny of Linum based on extensive sampling and plastid and nuclear DNA sequences, and used it to trace the evolution of character states of style polymorphism. We also revised available data on pollination, breeding systems, and polyploidy to analyse their associations. Our results supported former phylogenetic hypotheses: the paraphyly of Linum and the non-monophyly of current taxonomic sections. Heterostyly was common in the genus, but appeared concentrated in the Mediterranean Basin and the South African Cape. Ancestral character state reconstruction failed to determine a unique state as the most probable condition for style polymorphism in the genus. In contrast, approach herkogamy was resolved as ancestral state in some clades, giving support to recent hypotheses. Some traits putatively related to heterostyly, such as life history and polyploidy, did show marginal or non-significant phylogenetic correlation, respectively. Although pollinator data are limited, we suggest that beeflies are associated with specific cases of heterostyly. The consistent association between style polymorphism and heteromorphic incompatibility points to ecological factors as drivers of the multiple evolution of style polymorphism in Linum. Albeit based on limited evidence, we hypothesised that specialised pollinators and lack of mating opportunities drive evolution of style polymorphism and loss of the polymorphism, respectively. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Cape Floristic Region; divergence time; heterostyly; life history; phylogeny; pollination; polyploidy,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039855309

Here, we combined neutral genetic markers (AFLPs), morphometrics and floral scent analysis (GC-MS) to investigate two mixed Platanthera populations where morphologically intermediate plants were found. Self-pollination experiments revealed a low level of autogamy and artificial crossings combined with assessments of fruit set and seed viability, showed compatibility between the two species. The results of the genetic analyses showed that morphologically intermediate plants had similar genetic patterns as the P. bifolia group. These results are corroborated also by floral scent analyses, which confirmed a strong similarity in floral scent composition between intermediate morphotypes and P. bifolia. Therefore, this study provided a much more detailed picture of the genetic structure of a sympatric zone between two closely allied species and supports the hypothesis that intermediate morphotypes in sympatry could reflect an adaptive evolution in response to local pollinator-mediated selection. © 2018 Esposito et al.",Female fitness; Floral scent; Genetic markers; Hybridization; Morphometrics; Moth pollination; Orchidaceae; Phenotypic selection; Platanthera; Reproductive isolation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040976829

Recently, researchers recognized that not only pollinators but also herbivores are important agents in the evolution and maintenance of gynodioecy, when herbivory is hermaphrodite biased. In this study, we investigated whether there is hermaphrodite-biased herbivory in a gynodioecious plant, Dianthus superbus var. longicalycinus, and if so, what floral traits influenced hermaphrodite-biased herbivory. We measured flower morphology (flower diameter, calyx tube length, corolla height and petal width) and phenology of flowers of female individuals, hermaphrodites and gynomonoecious individuals in a natural population. We also investigated seed predation and predator species. At the study site, Sibinia weevils (Curculionidae; Coleoptera) and Coleophora moths (Coleophoridae; Lepidoptera) were common pre-dispersal seed predators in this species. The weevil appeared early in the flowering season, and weevil predation correlated with flower phenology. Because female individuals did not flower early in the season, weevil predation was less frequent in female individuals. Moth predation correlated with calyx length. The calyx length of flowers of female individuals was smaller than those of hermaphrodites, but a direct comparison of moth predation rates failed to find a significant difference among sex morphs. We found that the two seed predators had different effects on floral traits in D. superbus var. longicalycinus. We suggest that weevil predation contributes to the maintenance of gynodioecy because female individuals successfully escaped weevil predation by flowering late. It remains unclear why flower phenology is different among sex morphs. © 2017 The Society for the Study of Species Biology",flower phenology; gynodioecygynomonoecy; herbivory; seed predation; sexual dimorphism,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039901175

Differences in C and N allocation among HGs explained more variation in all indices than respective differences in allocation among endosperm (E) textures, while variation decreased with sequential inbreeding compared to OP germplasm. Specific color space coordinates indicated either large macronutrient densities and M-Index, or large micronutrient densities, m-Index, and FeZn-Index. These results demonstrated the importance of genotypes and the C:N ratio in nutrient allocation, as well as bivariate and multiple interrelationships. © 2018 by the authors.",Essential micronutrients; Genetic resource; Heterotic groups; Ionome; Opaque endosperm,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043994304

Therefore, several bi-level thresholding algorithms are widely used to increase the bacilli segmentation accuracy. However, bi-level microscopic image thresholding problem has not been solved using optimization algorithms. This paper introduces a novel approach for the segmentation problem using heuristic algorithms and presents visual and quantitative comparisons of heuristic and state-ofart thresholding algorithms. In this study, well-known heuristic algorithms such as Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Cuckoo Search, Flower Pollination are used to solve bi-level microscopic image thresholding problem, and the results are compared with the state-of-art thresholding algorithms such as K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, Fast Marching. Kapur's entropy is chosen as the entropy measure to be maximized. Experiments are performed to make comparisons in terms of evaluation metrics and execution time. The quantitative results are calculated based on ground truth segmentation. According to the visual results, heuristic algorithms have better performance and the quantitative results are in accord with the visual results. Furthermore, experimental time comparisons show the superiority and effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms over traditional thresholding algorithms. © 2018 AECE.",Heuristic algorithms; Image segmentation; Information entropy; Particle swarm optimization; Terms-computer aided analysis,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043229405

Thus, changes in plant mating system and traits linked to it are expected in populations colonising new environments where selection would favour selfing and floral traits that maximise reproductive output. To test this, we studied native (Mexico) and non-native (Spain) populations of the obligate sexual reproducing annual weed Datura stramonium. Flower size, herkogamy, total number of seeds per plant, number of visits by and type of pollinators, and inbreeding depression were assessed in native and non-native populations. Finally, we measured phenotypic selection on corolla size and herkogamy in each population. Flower size and herkogamy showed wide and similar variation in both ranges. However, the largest average flower size was found in one non-native population whereas the highest average positive herkogamy was detected in one native population. On average, flowers in the native range received more visits by pollinators. Hawkmoths were the main visitors in the native populations while only bees were observed visiting flowers in Spain's populations. Only in the native range was inbreeding depression detected. Selection to reduce herkogamy was found only in one native population. Absence of both inbreeding depression and selection on floral traits suggest a change in mating system of D. stramonium in a new range where generalist pollinators may be promoting high reproductive success. Selection against deleterious alleles might explain the reduction of inbreeding depression, promoting the evolution of selfing. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Herkogamy; inbreeding depression; invasive weeds; mating system; mediterranean; phenotypic natural selection; reproductive assurance; selfing syndrome,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038246764

The emergent pattern is that a majority of Mediterranean plant clades split from their sister groups between the Miocene (235 Ma) and the Oligocene (3423 Ma), far earlier than the onset of the Mediterranean climate (ca. 3.2 Ma). In addition, 12 of 14 clades of the species-poor group have stem ages inferred for each clade in the Miocene or older, and six of 13 clades within the species-rich group show divergence of each stem clade within the Oligocene and/or Miocene. High levels of species diversity are related to an ancient (PaleoceneMiocene) origin and also to recent origin (PliocenePleistocene) followed by active speciation and even explosive radiations: some species and lineages diversified over a short period (Aquilegia, Cistus, Dianthus, Linaria sect. Supinae, Reseda). In the species-rich group, key reproductive characters were found to be significantly more important for species recognition than key vegetative characters in eight clades, but no difference was found in four clades, and vegetative characters were predominant in one clade (Saxifraga). Geographical differentiation is proposed as predominant over divergence driven by pollination ecology. We hypothesise an evolutionary process in which lineages adapted to pre-Mediterranean (pre-Pliocene) conditions in relatively small, xeric areas became strongly competitive and expanded as the Mediterranean climate became dominant (PlioceneQuaternary) across the Mediterranean Basin. © 2017 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands",Angiosperm evolution; clade divergence; Mediterranean climate; Mediterranean floristic region (MFR); phylogeny; pre-Pliocene,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039857282

To identify differentially expressed proteins in a high-oleic acid rapeseed line, self-bred seeds (20 to 35 days after pollination) of a high- and a low-oleic acid rapeseed near-isogenic line (oleic acid contents of 81.4 and 56.2%, respectively) were used as raw materials for iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) analysis. In total, 24,755 peptides, 14,455 unique peptides, and 4726 proteins were identified. Among them, 137 differentially expressed proteins were assigned pathway annotations, accounting for 3.84% of the total proteins (3568). Three differentially expressed proteins, PSaB (gi|383930478), Lhcb6 (gi|50313237), and ALD (gi|15227981) were subjected to western blotting analyses. The results were consistent with the iTRAQ data, demonstrating the satisfactory quality of the iTRAQ experimental procedures and data. The transcript levels of 19 genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and photosynthesis were analyzed by qPCR. The transcript levels were consistent with the protein levels for 10 of these genes, but inconsistent for the other nine genes. Among the differentially expressed proteins were key enzymes in fatty acid biosynthesis and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (acyl-CoA thioesterase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase, omega 6 reductase, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), oleic acid biosynthesis (acyl-CoA thioesterase and omega 6 reductase), and seed lipid content (long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase).

The floristic diversity and structure of inselberg flora receives much attention in international conservation research, yet our understanding of how recruitment influences population genetic structure of plants endemic to granite outcrops is limited. To determine the immediate genetic consequences of recruitment and to quantify mating and dispersal patterns by parentage analysis, I conducted an opportunistic study following a wildfire in a stand of the lignotuberous tree Eucalyptus caesia Benth. (Myrtaceae) at Boyagin Nature Reserve. The entire adult stand (n?180) plus seedlings (n?115) were genotyped with 14 microsatellite loci. Compared with adults, seedlings had low heterozygosity and a high inbreeding co-efficient, but similar levels of allelic diversity. There was no evidence of post-germination selection against homozygous seedlings over the 20 month survey period. Seedlings that resulted from cross-pollination were more heterozygous than seedlings resulting from selfing, but could not be distinguished based on height measurements or survivorship. Parentage analysis in CERVUS revealed mostly limited seed dispersal, assuming that candidate parents closest to seedlings were the maternal parent. By comparison, pollen movement was more extensive, yet still restricted to plants within the stand. Recruitment has increased the population size, but appears insufficient to enhance genetic diversity in the Boyagin stand of E. caesia. Nonetheless, E. caesia appears adept at persisting as extremely small populations. © CSIRO 2018.",genetic diversity; granite-outcrop endemism; parentage analysis; recruitment; seed and pollen dispersal.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042695654

They are products of repeated rounds of recurrent selection on enhanced, broadly based populations of >120 B. vulgaris subsp. maritima accessions (selected for rhizomania resistance) crossed with sugar beet. Allelic relationships between R21 and R40 are unknown. Each was derived from a different set of donor accessions, making it unlikely that they are the same gene.

Two sources of dust have been reported: abrasion by talc which is added as seed lubricant during planting, and seed-to-seed abrasion occurring during seed handling, distribution and planting. We report a third important source that warrants remediation. Here, soil dust stirred up by planters was found to enter the vacuum air intake near seed metering devices. RESULTS: The mean quantity of dust collected from the exhaust of a commercial pneumatic planter over a number of field sites and situations was 46 g ha?1, ranging from 5.8 to 184.2 g ha?1. While the clothianidin concentration in exhaust dust declined with increasing quantity of dust, total clothianidin recovered increased linearly within the study parameters. Up to 2.4 g ha?1 of clothianidin was recovered from planter exhaust, representing approximately 12.6% of the active ingredient applied to seed. A similar pattern occurred in the laboratory on a single standing planter unit using diatomaceous earth as surrogate field dust. CONCLUSION: Field dust in pneumatic metering systems contributes significantly to clothianidin contamination in planter exhaust by seed abrasion.

Among those, Crithidia bombi and C. expoeki, are common parasites in bumble bees around the world, and phylogenetically close to Leishmania and Leptomonas. They have a simple and direct life cycle with one host, and partially castrate the founding queens greatly reducing their fitness. Here, we report the nuclear genome sequences of one clone of each species, extracted from a field-collected infection. Using a combination of Roche 454 FLX Titanium, Pacific Biosciences PacBio RS, and Illumina GA2 instruments for C. bombi, and PacBio for C. expoeki, we could produce high-quality and well resolved sequences. We find that these genomes are around 32 and 34 MB, with 7,808 and 7,851 annotated genes for C. bombi and C. expoeki, respectivelywhich is somewhat less than reported from other trypanosomatids, with few introns, and organized in polycistronic units. A large fraction of genes received plausible functional support in comparison primarily with Leishmania and Trypanosoma. Comparing the annotated genes of the two species with those of six other trypanosomatids (C. fasciculata, L. pyrrhocoris, L. seymouri, B. ayalai, L. major, and T. brucei) shows similar gene repertoires and many orthologs. Similar to other trypanosomatids, we also find signs of concerted evolution in genes putatively involved in the interaction with the host, a high degree of synteny between C. bombi and C. expoeki, and considerable overlap with several other species in the set. A total of 86 orthologous gene groups show signatures of positive selection in the branch leading to the two Crithidia under study, mostly of unknown function. As an example, we examined the initiating glycosylation pathway of surface components in C. bombi, finding it deviates from most other eukaryotes and also from other kinetoplastids, which may indicate rapid evolution in the extracellular matrix that is involved in interactions with the host. Bumble bees are important pollinators and Crithidia-infections are suspected to cause substantial selection pressure on their host populations. These newly sequenced genomes provide tools that should help better understand host-parasite interactions in these pollinator pathogens. © 2018 Schmid-Hempel et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041270309

Previous studies of plantanimal mutualistic networks have shown that the occurrence of interactions varies substantially across years. We analyzed interannual variation of a quantitative mutualistic network, in which links are weighted by interaction frequency. The network was sampled over six consecutive years, representing one of the longest time series for a community-wide mutualistic network. We estimated the interannual similarity in interactions and assessed the determinants of their persistence. The occurrence of interactions varied greatly among years, with most interactions seen in only one year (64%) and few (20%) in more than two years. This variation was associated with the frequency and position of interactions relative to the network core, so that the network consisted of a persistent core of frequent interactions and many peripheral, infrequent interactions.

We previously identified a significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for endosperm amylose content on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5S). In that study, both parental lines, GEMS-0067 and H99ae, were homozygous recessive for amylose extender 1 (ae1), which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5L). The dominant allele encodes starch branching enzyme 2b (SBE2b). Centered within the 5S QTL interval is another starch branching enzyme, starch branching enzyme 1 (sbe1), which also plays a role in the branching of amylopectin. We sought to determine if this QTL is due to allelic segregation of sbe1 or, instead, a closely linked locus. A Mutator-induced allele of sbe1 (sbe1-Mu) was employed to address this question. If sbe1-Mu behaves as a simple recessive allele, it could eliminate the additive nature of the 5S QTL, which would indicate that segregation of the sbe1 alleles present in the original GEMS- 0067 × H99ae hybrid are responsible for the QTL. If not, it would implicate segregation of alleles at a closely linked locus. Pollen possessing sbe1-Mu was crossed onto a GEMS-0067 × H99ae hybrid, which separated the high amylose factor from the low amylose factor. A sample of these progeny was grown and self-pollinated to generate kernels segregating for sbe1-Mu. Kernels were genotyped for sbe1 alleles and assayed for relative amylose and amylopectin content. Kernels heterozygous or homozygous for the GEMS-0067 allele of sbe1 had a higher amylose/amylopectin ratio than kernels possessing the H99ae allele. Importantly, sbe1-Mu behaves as a simple recessive allele regardless of the other sbe1 allele. This implicates allelic variation of sbe1 as being responsible for the high endosperm amylose QTL. © Crop Science Society of America.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040731365

We surveyed the composition of vascular plant species for 33 paired residual (unconverted) and secondary (postagricultural) forest sites across three physiographic regions in New York to assess the recovery of residual forest species in secondary successional stands. There were 169 vascular plant species recorded among the 33 study sites. The residual stands exhibited slightly greater mean (± SE) species richness (26.8 ± 1.7 species per site) than secondary-interior (21.4 ± 1.2, P = 0.001) and secondary-edge (24.1 ± 1.6, P = 0.02) zones. Plant communities differed across the three physiographic regions (P = 0.001) and by stand history within regions (P = 0.004). Of the vascular plant species occurring at our sites, 22 (13%) were indicators of residual forest stands and 27 (16%) were indicators of secondary, postagricultural forest stands. Within 10 to 25 m of the historic field-forest ecotones, the relative frequencies of many residual woodland indicator species fell to 0-20% of the maxima they attained in the residual stands. Ant-dispersed (myrmecochorous) taxa represented 23% of residual and 0% of secondary forest indicators and exhibited lower migration rates (P < 0.001) than plants possessing other diaspore dispersal modes (anemochory, zoochory, barochory). In addition to plant dispersal mode, we found pH and forest-floor depth to be important determinants of plant species. Our results indicate that impoverishment of plant communities in postagricultural forests represent a regionally pervasive phenomenon with important resource management implications in the eastern USA. Residual woodlands remain important source populations for recovery of herbaceous species in postagricultural landscapes. However, given the slow historic recovery rates that we and others have observed in postagricultural secondary forests, in addition to other contemporary factors potentially inhibiting dispersal and establishment (e.g., herbivory, pollinator disruptions, invasive species), it seems likely that active restoration efforts are needed to promote full recovery of diverse, native temperate-forest herb communities. © Copyright 2018 by The Torrey Botanical Society.",eastern deciduous forest; forest herb colonization; land-use history; plant dispersal; succession,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041050622

Water depth can be an important factor structuring wetland plant communities, which often include cattails (Typha spp., Typhaceae). In eastern North America, native Typha latifolia regularly hybridizes with introduced T. angustifolia to produce the invasive F1 hybrid T. × glauca, which can backcross to parental species. Hybridization in this wind-pollinated species complex may be facilitated by overlapping niches among taxa, but previous studies have yielded contradictory results, possibly because these studies were limited to shallow sites or single locations. We investigated patterns of depth occupancy in ditches (mean depth 3.4 cm) and permanent wetlands (mean depth 25.0 cm) with various mixtures of T. latifolia, T. angustifolia, and T. × glauca across a 1700 km transect from Michigan, USA, to Nova Scotia, Canada. Overall, we found that water depth cannot on its own explain patterns of cattail occupancy. We therefore conclude that niche partitioning by water depth does not promote mating isolation in Typha. Previous findings of habitat segregation by depth may be attributable to a combination of idiosyncratic features of individual sites, multi-dimensional niches, and phenotypic plasticity, which could prevent consistent niche segregation among Typha taxa. A lack of spatial segregation between Typha taxa should promote hybridization and introgression. This, coupled with the competitive superiority of hybrids, appears to be facilitating the displacement of native T. latifolia across a wide geographical range. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Habitat partitioning; Hybridization; Mating isolation; Niche segregation; Typha; Water depth,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033225430

Rich. (Lesser Twayblade; Listera cordata (L.) R. Br.) that are relevant to an understanding of its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characteristics, herbivores, history and conservation. Neottia cordata is an inconspicuous orchid, confined to humid heathlands and woodlands rich in bryophytes in the British Isles. Neottia cordata is a polycarpic, perennial herb with populations maintained predominantly by vegetative reproduction from root suckers. The main perennating organ is a short rhizome that produces two new internodes each year. The long adventitious roots are mainly colonized not only by mycorrhizal basidiomycetes from the Sebacinales (clade B, Serendipitaceae) but also by several other fungal groups. The species flowers from mid-April to August depending on latitude and altitude. The flowers possess a sensitive rostellum that releases a viscid fluid when touched, ensuring that the pollinia are glued to the pollinator. The flowers produce nectar and are pollinated mainly by fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae and Sciaridae). Between 60% and 80% of open flowers set fruits. Neottia cordata is classified as Least Concern in Great Britain. It is still locally abundant in north and west Scotland but has declined elsewhere, especially at lower altitudes, because of burning on grouse moors, drainage of swamps and cutting of wet forests. It is likely to have been under-recorded throughout its range, particularly in earlier surveys, due to its inconspicuousness. © 2017 The Authors.

This decline is expected to continue with climate change as the main driver. However, at the local scale, land use and land cover (LULC) change strongly affects the occurrence of bumblebees. At present, LULC change is rarely included in models of future distributions of species. This study's objective is to compare the roles of dynamic LULC change and climate change on the projected distribution patterns of 48 European bumblebee species for three change scenarios until 2100 at the scales of Europe, and Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg (BENELUX). We compared three types of models: (1) only climate covariates, (2) climate and static LULC covariates and (3) climate and dynamic LULC covariates. The climate and LULC change scenarios used in the models include, extreme growth applied strategy (GRAS), business as might be usual and sustainable European development goals. We analysed model performance, range gain/loss and the shift in range limits for all bumblebees. Overall, model performance improved with the introduction of LULC covariates. Dynamic models projected less range loss and gain than climate-only projections, and greater range loss and gain than static models. Overall, there is considerable variation in species responses and effects were most pronounced at the BENELUX scale. The majority of species were predicted to lose considerable range, particularly under the extreme growth scenario (GRAS; overall mean: 64% ± 34). Model simulations project a number of local extinctions and considerable range loss at the BENELUX scale (overall mean: 56% ± 39). Therefore, we recommend species-specific modelling to understand how LULC and climate interact in future modelling. The efficacy of dynamic LULC change should improve with higher thematic and spatial resolution. Nevertheless, current broad scale representations of change in major land use classes impact modelled future distribution patterns. © 2017 The Authors.

Information on elaiophore location, structure and functioning is likely to provide valuable insights into pollination ecology and evolution of the family. We characterized the elaiophores in three Malpighiaceae species and compared the patterns of distribution and dimensions of these glands, their structural organization, their histochemistry and their life spans. Intact elaiophores from buds and 1-day flowers (bagged and un-bagged) of Banisteriopsis variabilis, Byrsonima coccolobifolia and Peixotoa reticulata were collected for structural, histochemical and ultrastructural studies. We also reported the behavior of elaiophore-visiting insects. Elaiophores exhibit uniseriate secretory epithelium covered by a thick cuticle and vascularized parenchyma. The secretory surfaces can be flat (B. coccolobifolia and P. reticulata) or convoluted (B. variabilis). In B. variabilis and P. reticulata the epithelium has longer cells than in B. coccolobifolia and these become papillose, taking an appearance similar to trichomal elaiophores. The mixed secretions accumulate within subcuticular spaces and may be released either by a natural rupture of the cuticle (B. coccolobifolia and P. reticulata) or by a sudden rupture caused by the bee activity (B. variabilis). Different bees were observed exploiting the elaiophores, acting as potential pollinators or oil robbers. A greater diversity of oil-collecting bees was registered in B. variabilis. The differences identified, mainly in relation to the location of the glands on the sepals, in the fine structure of secretory epithelia and cuticle architecture, and in their secretion release mechanisms, in some way, can affect the behavior of visitors. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",Banisteriopsis; Byrsonima; Electron microscopy; Light microscopy; Oil secretion; Peixotoa,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025839288

In an attempt to reduce the impact of forestry on natural systems, networks of natural corridors and patches of natural habitat are often maintained within the afforested matrix, yet these can be subject to degradation by invasion of non-native species. Both habitat fragmentation and alien invasive species disrupt the complex interaction networks typical of native communities. This study examines whether an invasive plant and/or the fragmented nature of the forestry landscape influences natural flower visitation networks (FVNs), flowervisitor abundance and richness or flower/visitor species composition. Location: The species rich and diverse grasslands in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa is under threat from transformation, particularly by commercial forestry plantations, restricting much of the remaining untransformed grasslands into remnant grassland patches (RGPs). Remaining patches are under additional threat from the invasive Rubus cuneifolius Pursh (bramble). Sites were established in RGPs and in a nearby protected area (PA), with and without brambles present for both areas. Results: Flower abundance and flower area of native plant species were greater within RGP than in PA, but only in the absence of R. cuneifolius. Flowervisitor assemblages differed between invaded and uninvaded sites and also differed between PA and RGP sites. Both areas lost specialist flowervisitor species in the presence of brambles. Network modularity was greatly reduced by the presence of bramble, indicating a reduction in complexity and organization. The structure of FVNs was otherwise unaffected by presence of bramble or being located in RGPs or the PA. Main conclusions: The RPGs contribute to regional biodiversity conservation through additional compositional diversity and intact FVNs. Rubus cuneifolius reduces ecological complexity of both RGPs and PAs, however, and its removal must be prioritized to conserve FVNs. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",ecological networks; flower network analyses; food web; insect conservation; landscape ecology; pollination,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030147892

This genus is characterised by sexual polymorphism and functionally unisexual flowers. Gleditsia amorphoides is the southernmost species of the genus, and is widely used as a source of timber and derived products for industrial applications (galactomannans are extracted from its seeds and saponins are derived from its fruits). The species is endemic to the Chaquenean Forest of South America. It is described as morphologically androdioecious, with male and perfect flowers appearing on different plants. In the current study, we characterised floral morphology, experimentally tested the breeding system and analysed flower visitors. Results indicated that G. amorphoides staminate flowers produce viable pollen grains and that perfect flowers have a functional gynoecium and empty anthers, where pollen abortion occurs early in floral development. The species relies on outcrossing, which depends mainly on pollen carried by insect pollinators, to produce seeds and fruits. We conclude that G. amorphoides is functionally dioecious, with staminate and pistillate floral morphs. © CSIRO 2018.",Caesalpinioideae; Chaquenean Forest; plant reproduction; sexual polymorphism; unisexuality.,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042695274

These changes predict the identities of winners and losers of future global change, and also reveal which environmental variables drive a taxon's response to land use change. We explored how the biodiversity of native bee species changes across forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. We collected bee community data from 36 sites across a 75,000 km2 region, and analyzed bee abundance, species richness, composition, and life-history traits. Season-long bee abundance and richness were not detectably different between natural and anthropogenic landscapes, but community phenologies differed strongly, with an early spring peak followed by decline in forests, and a more extended summer season in agricultural and urban habitats. Bee community composition differed significantly between all three land use types, as did phylogenetic composition. Anthropogenic land use had negative effects on the persistence of several life-history strategies, including early spring flight season and brood parasitism, which may indicate adaptation to conditions in forest habitat. Overall, anthropogenic communities are not diminished subsets of contemporary natural communities. Rather, forest species do not persist in anthropogenic habitats, but are replaced by different native species and phylogenetic lineages preadapted to open habitats. Characterizing compositional and functional differences is crucial for understanding land use as a global change driver across large regional scales. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Apoidea; fourth-corner; global change; land use; phenology; pollinator; richness; traits,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039694666

Its fertilization relies on Cyclocephala sp. (Scarabaeidae). The absence of these pollinators could lead to lack of production of seed and therefore its vegetative propagation is obligatory. This study was carried out to determine the optimum concentration of benzylaminopurine (BAP), alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) and sucrose to be used in the Murashige and Skoogs (MS) media for in vitro propagation of Cyclanthus bipartitus and to evaluate the variation in DNA sequence of regenerated plants. Materials and Methods: Explants were cultured on sterilized MS medium containing different combinations of BAP, NAA and sucrose. The preparations were cultured for 10 weeks at temperature 25-28EC under 16 h of photoperiod with light intensity of 30 µmol m-2 sec-1 and the growth of the plantlets were monitored. Somaclonal variation amongst mother plants, daughter plants and the plantlets generated from the following three subculturing at the DNA level and was analyzed by using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC GLM of SAS software. Results: Multiple adventitious shoots of Cyclanthus bipartitus were induced from lamina explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with various combinations of BAP, NAA and sucrose concentrations. The highest number of shoots, tallest shoots, highest number of roots and longest root were recorded in medium with a combination of 1.0 mg L-1 BAP, 0.5 mg L-1 and 30 g L-1 sucrose. Results of DNA analysis showed that 18 out of 26 score able bands were polymorphic and eight were monomorphic, which gave 69.2% polymorphism frequency. Conclusion: Optimum concentrations of BAP, NAA and sucrose for shoot and root development in vitro propagation of Cyclanthus bipartitus was 1.0 mg L-1 BAP, 0.5 mg L-1 NAA and 30 g L-1 of sucrose. 69.2% polymorphism was detected in regenerated plants indicating genetic variation had occurred amongst somaclones. © 2018 Nur Fauzana Mohd Kasim et al.",Alpha-naphthalene acetic acid; Benzylaminopurine; Random amplified polymorphic DNA; Sucrose; Tissue culture,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041100873

F1 progeny plants derived from the interspecific hybridization PI 500945 × Sweet basil were resistant, indicating that the gene controlling resistance (Pb1) is dominant, but sterile due to the genetic distance between the parents. Despite their sterility, F1 plants were pollinated with the susceptible parent and 115 first backcross generation to the susceptible parent (BCs1) embryos were rescued in vitro. The emerging BCs1 plants segregated, upon inoculation, 5:1 resistant/susceptible, suggesting that resistance in F1 was controlled by a pair of dominant genes (Pb1A and Pb1A'). Thirty-one partially fertile BCs1 plants were self-pollinated to obtain BCs1-F2 or were backcrossed to Sweet basil to obtain the second backcross generation to the susceptible parent (BCs2). In total, 1 BCs1-F2 and 22 BCs2 progenies were obtained. The BCs1-F2 progeny segregated 35:1 resistant/susceptible, as expected from a tetraploid parent with two dominant resistant genes. The 22 BCs2 progenies segregated 1:1 resistant/susceptible (for a BCs1 parent that carried one dominant gene for resistance) or 5:1 (for a BCs1 parent that carried two dominant genes for resistance) at a ratio of 4:1.

Thanks to the small size of the watersheds and the close proximity of the depositional environment to the mainland, the Bay of Brest represents an ideal case study for palynological investigations. Palynological data were then compared to published palaeo-genetic analyses conducted on the same core and to various available instrumental data, allowing us to better characterize past environmental variability since the second half of the 19th century in Western Brittany. We provide evidence of some clues of recent eutrophication and/or pollution that affected phytoplankton communities and which appears linked with increased runoff (higher precipitations, higher percentages of riparian forest pollen, decline of salt marsh-type indicators, and higher values of the XRF Ti/Ca signal), mainly explained by the evolution of agricultural practices since 1945 superimposed on the warming climate trend. We assume that the significant relay observed between dinocyst taxa: Lingulodinium machaerophorum and Spiniferites bentorii around 1965 then followed by Spiniferites membranaceus after 1985, attests to a strong and recent eutrophication of Bay of Brest surface waters induced by high river runoff combined with abnormally elevated air temperatures, especially obvious in the data from 1990. The structure of the dinocyst community has thus been deeply altered, accompanied by an unprecedented increase of Alexandrium minutum toxic form at the same period, as confirmed by the genetic quantification. Despite this recent major anthropogenic forcing, the fossil pollen sequence also records natural climate variability. We highlight, for the first time, a possible connection between climate (AMO modes) and fossil pollen records (especially tree pollination rates) in coastal sediments using tree percentage fluctuations as an indirect proxy for past sea surface and atmospheric temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Climate variability; Dinoflagellate cysts; Estuarine dynamics; Pollen grains; River runoff,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034960481

Common among these is that the angiosperms alone developed leaves with smaller, more numerous stomata and more highly branching venation networks that enable higher rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, and growth. Yet, how angiosperms pack their leaves with smaller, more abundant stomata and more veins is unknown but linkedwe showto simple biophysical constraints on cell size. Only angiosperm lineages underwent rapid genome downsizing during the early Cretaceous period, which facilitated the reductions in cell size necessary to pack more veins and stomata into their leaves, effectively bringing actual primary productivity closer to its maximum potential. Thus, the angiosperms' heightened competitive abilities are due in no small part to genome downsizing. © 2018 Simonin, Roddy.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041464825

Alternatively, remaining mutualists may respond to altered competition by reducing the breadth or intensity of their interactions, exacerbating negative impacts on biodiversity. Despite the importance of these responses for our understanding of the dynamics of mutualistic networks and their response to global change, the mechanism and magnitude of interaction compensation within real mutualistic networks remains largely unknown. We examined differences in mutualistic interactions between frugivores and fruiting plants in two island ecosystems possessing an intact or disrupted seed dispersal network. We determined how changes in the abundance and behavior of remaining seed dispersers either increased mutualistic interactions (contributing to interaction compensation) or decreased interactions (causing an interaction deficit) in the disrupted network. We found a rich-get-richer response in the disrupted network, where remaining frugivores favored the plant species with highest interaction frequency, a dynamic that worsened the interaction deficit among plant species with low interaction frequency. Only one of five plant species experienced compensation and the other four had significant interaction deficits, with interaction frequencies 5695% lower in the disrupted network. These results do not provide support for the strong compensating mechanisms assumed in theoretical network models, suggesting that existing network models underestimate the prevalence of cascading mutualism disruption after defaunation.

We argue here, however, that chronically rare species (those with low population densities over many generations across their entire ranges) may have individual-level traits that make populations more resistant to extinction. The major obstacle to persistence at low density is successful fertilisation (union between egg and sperm), and chronically rare species are more likely to survive when (1) fertilisation occurs inside or close to an adult, (2) mate choice involves long-distance signals, (3) adults or their surrogate gamete dispersers are highly mobile, or (4) the two sexes are combined in a single individual. In contrast, external fertilisation and wind- or water-driven passive dispersal of gametes, or sluggish or sedentary adult life habits in the absence of gamete vectors, appear to be incompatible with sustained rarity. We suggest that the documented increase in frequency of these traits among marine genera over geological time could explain observed secular decreases in rates of background extinction.

Backcrosses to the wild B. rapa (BC1) produce aneuploids with variable chromosome numbers between 20 and 29. How does survival and performance relate to DNA content of plants? Growth of the BC1 plants was measured in the lab. One plant in the F1 self-pollinated spontaneously and produced abundant F2 seeds that were also examined. The number of C-chromosomes was estimated from DNA values obtained with flow cytometry. Average DNA value of the BC1 was similar to that of the parents, which shows that C-chromosomes do not reduce success of pollen or embryos. The average DNA value in the F2 was 13% higher than in the F1, suggesting that extra C-chromosomes facilitated gamete success and/or embryo survival. Under both optimal and drought stress conditions growth and survival of BC1 hybrids was similar to that of B. rapa. No significant correlations existed between growth or survival and DNA value. Aneuploid plants were not inferior under the conditions of the growth room and may persist in nature.

Hence, variable susceptance controllers are being adopted to mitigate these oscillations. However, improper modulation of control parameters also leads to system instability. Therefore, we propose an optimization methodology for mitigating low frequency oscillations in wind power generation system. To visualize our methodology, we use a lead-lag type variable susceptance controller for fixed speed induction generator (FSIG) based wind generation system. Then, we optimize gain and time constants of lead-lag controller using three optimization algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). Later, we perform non-linear time domain simulation and quantitative analysis to find average fitness, standard deviation, run time, and iteration number for these optimization algorithms. Moreover, non-parametric statistical analysis, such as KolmogorovSmirnov and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are employed for identifying statistically significant differences among these algorithms. © 2017 The Franklin Institute",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039073290

This odd phenomenon, known as River disease by beekeepers, can lead to colony death by depopulation. The aim of this study was to detect the causes of larvae death. Different experiments and analyses were performed using affected apiaries located between two important water courses. 1 day old larvae were the most susceptible and substances that killed the larvae were present in the nectar but not in the pollen. A palynological analysis of nectar samples showed that bees collect this resource from commonly pollinated floral species in the country. However, abundant fungi spores and conidia were found, which indicates that the bees also collected honeydews. In the riparian vegetation, bees were observed collecting the secretions of the planthopper Epormenis cestri on Sebastiania schottiana trees. It was found that the mortality period of larvae overlaps with the presence of E. cestri. Larvae maintained in the laboratory were fed (i) nectar from healthy colonies, (ii) nectar from affected colonies, and (iii) secretions of E. cestri. The mortality of the larvae that received nectar from colonies affected with River disease and secretions of E. cestri was higher than the mortality of those receiving nectar from healthy colonies. This represents the first report of planthopper honeydew causing mass larval mortality in honey bees. © 2018 Invernizzi et al.

The final MAXENT model was constructed based on 83 occurrence records from Austria, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia and six abiotic environmental variables. The jackknife test revealed that annual temperature range, mean temperature of wettest quarter, and minimum temperature of coldest month had the highest gain for the training and test data when used alone, whereas precipitation seasonality, precipitation of coldest quarter, and precipitation of warmest quarter reduced the gain the most when excluded from the model and thus contributed the most information not presented with the other variables. A high probability of occurrence (>0.6) for S. × niederederi was found in 12 countries, namely Austria, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast), Slovenia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. Our results showed in which areas the hybrid may be established under the European temperate climatic conditions; however, we do not indicate which areas exactly may be under invasion by the hybrid because such a statement needs population dynamic data for proper investigation. To prevent the negative impact of S. × niederederi on native S. virgaurea (i.e. competition for pollinators and introgression) we suggest that it should be controlled first in areas of high probability of occurrence, especially in Lithuania, Kaliningrad Oblast, Slovakia, Poland, and Austria, where the areas of high probability of hybrid occurrence account for more than 5% of the territory concerned. © TÜB?TAK.",Alien species; MAXENT; Plant hybridization; Species distribution modeling,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040744168

FLR aims to restore multiple functions of forests at a landscape scale. It is predicated on the hypothesis that restoration produces enabling conditions for ecosystem services, including regulating services such as carbon sequestration and pollination, and provisioning services such as food and energy. As FLR gains greater uptake, it is increasingly important to monitor progress. The types of indicators required are influenced by the degree of forest loss and degradation. To measure the status of land under restoration, one or more abiotic and biotic threshold indicators are required, measuring the return of enabling conditions for restoration (soil quality, water, etc.), along with progress indicators measuring the reemergence of the ecosystem services. Although all elements of the proposed monitoring framework are well known, compiling them into a coherent system, suitable for application in a wide range of conditions, will take much further development. © 2018 Society for Ecological Restoration",ecosystem functions; ecosystem services; forest; monitoring; restoration; thresholds,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040349569

Two sets of trials were conducted side by side, one with an open pollinated maize variety (OPV) and the other one with a hybrid maize variety and each set had six equal treatments laid out in 198 farmers fields. The treatments comprised (i) a control, (ii) a PK (?N, without N), (iii) an NK (?P, without P), (iv) an NP (?K, without K), (v) an NPK and (vi) an NPK + S + Ca + Mg + Zn + B (+SMM, NPK plus secondary macro- and micro-nutrients). Moderate to a large variability in most soil characteristics was observed in the studied fields. Consequently, cluster analysis revealed three distinct yield-nutrient response classes common for the two types of maize varieties. These define classes were fields that have (i) no-response to any nutrient, (ii) a large response to N and P and (iii) a large response to N alone. Although overall yield performance of OPV and hybrid varieties was similar, a distinct fourth class was identified for the hybrid variety, (iv) fields with a large response to N and secondary macro- and micro-nutrients. The results indicate that the large variability in soil nutrients related constraints need to be accounted for to optimize maize yield in the northern Nigerian savanna. The development of field- and area-specific fertilizer recommendations is highly needed, using simple decision support tools that consider variable soil fertility conditions and yield responses as obtained from this study. © 2018 by the authors.",Multivariate cluster analysis; Northern Nigerian savanna; Nutrient omission trial; Soil nutrient limitation; Yield response; Zea mays,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043975001

The genus Populus has persistent natural hybrids because clonal and sexual reproduction is common. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of land use management of poplar plantations on the spatial genetic structure and species composition in poplar stands. Specifically, we studied the potential breeding between natural and cultivated poplar populations in the Mediterranean environment to gain insight into spontaneous hybridization events between exotic and native poplars; we also used a GIS-based model to evaluate the potential threats related to an intensive land use management. Two study areas, both near to poplar plantations (P. × euramericana), were designated in the native mixed stands of P. alba, P. nigra and P. × canescens within protected areas. We found that the spatial genetic structure differed between the two stands and their differences depended on their environmental features. We detected a hybridization event with P. × canescens that was made possible by the synchrony of flowering between the poplar plantation and P. × canescens and facilitated by the wind intensity and direction favoring the spread of pollen. Taken together, our results indicate that natural and artificial barriers are crucial to mitigate the threats, and so they should be explicitly considered in land use planning. For example, our results suggest the importance of conserving rows of trees and shrubs along rivers and in agricultural landscapes. In sum, it is necessary to understand, evaluate, and monitor the spread of exotic species and genetic material to ensure effective land use management and mitigation of their impact on native tree populations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cross-pollination; Gene flow; Genetic diversity conservation; Land management; Populus spp.; Spatial genetic structure,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028304817

However, this phenomenon is poorly understood in tropical dryland tree species. In the present study, we investigated how Acacia senegal reproduces in two different environmental contexts in Kenya. Open-pollinated progeny arrays of 10 maternal trees from each environmental context were genotyped using 12 nuclear microsatellite markers. Overall, A. senegal displayed a predominantly allogamous mating pattern. However, higher multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) was found in Lake Bogoria (tm = 1.00) than in Kampi ya Moto population (tm = 0.949). Higher biparental inbreeding (tm ? ts = 0.116) and correlation of outcrossed paternity (rp = 0.329) was found in Kampi ya Moto than in Lake Bogoria population (tm ? ts = 0.074, rp = 0.055), showing the occurrence of mating among relatives. Coefficient of coancestry (? = 0.208) showed that full-sibs constitute about 21% of the offspring in Kampi ya Moto population compared to about 14% (? = 0.136) in Lake Bogoria population. The results demonstrate that low adult tree density of A. senegal may be promoting seed production through consanguineous mating and suggest that man-made disturbance can affect mating patterns of the species.

However, the majority of studies on cognition involve captive animals in laboratory settings. While controlled settings are required to accurately measure aspects of cognition, they may not yield realistic estimates of learning performance in natural environments. Wild bees offer a useful system in which to study cognitive ecology and comparative cognition more broadly: they encompass around 20,000 species globally, varying in characteristics such as life-history strategy, degree of sociality and dietary specialization. Yet, the limited number of protocols currently available for studying insect cognition has restricted research to a few commercially available bee species, in almost exclusively laboratory settings. We present a protocol (Free-Moving Proboscis Extension Response [FMPER]) to measure wild bees colour preferences, learning performance and memory. We first used laboratory-reared bumblebees Bombus impatiens to establish that FMPER yielded results consistent with learning theory. We then successfully tested wild honeybees Apis mellifera in the laboratory and Bombus vosnesenskii at field sites. Free-Moving Proboscis Extension Response is straightforward to implement, is low cost, and may be readily adapted to other flower-visiting insects. We believe it will be useful to a broad range of evolutionary biologists, behavioural ecologists and pollination ecologists interested in measuring cognitive performance in the wild and across a broader range of species. © 2017 The Authors.

Naturally, however, G. hirsutum-G. australe chromosome exchanges were very limited, impeding the stable transference of useful genes from G. australe (G2G2 genome) into the most cultivated cotton, G. hirsutum (AADD). Results: In the present report, the pollen from a pentaploid (2n = AADDG2) of G. hirsutum-G. australe was irradiated with seven different doses ranging from 10 to 40 Grays and used to pollinate emasculated flowers of G. hirsutum over three consecutive years. Irradiation greatly increased the genetic recombination rates of the G. hirsutum and G. australe chromosomes and a total of 107 chromosome introgression individuals in 192 GISH-negative (with no GISH signal on chromosome) survived individuals, 11 chromosome translocation individuals (containing 12 chromosome translocation events) and 67 chromosome addition individuals were obtained in 70 GISH-positive (with GISH signal(s) on chromosome(s)) survived individuals, which are invaluable for mining desirable genes from G. australe. Multicolor genomic in situ hybridization results showed that there were three types of translocation, whole arm translocation, large alien segment translocation and small alien segment translocation, and that all translocations occurred between the G2-genome and the A-subgenome chromosomes in G. hirsutum. We also found that higher doses induced much higher rates of chromosome variation but also greatly lowered the seed viability and seedling survivability. Conclusions: Irradiation has been successfully employed to induce chromosome introgressions and chromosome translocations and promote chromosome exchanges between cultivated and wild species. In addition, by balancing the rates of chromosome introgression and translocation to those of seed set, seed germination, and seedling rates in the M1 generation, we conclude that the dosage of 20 Grays is the most suitable. The established methodology may guide the utilization of the tertiary gene pool of Gossypium species such as G. australe in cotton breeding in the future. © The Author(s). 2018.",Chromosome introgression; Chromosome translocation; Genomic in situ hybridization; Gossypium Australe; Gossypium hirsutum; Microsatellite marker,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042511891

For example, pollinator abundance might decrease at range limits due to harsh environmental conditions, and reduced plant density can reduce attractiveness to pollinators and increase or decrease herbivory. We tested for variation in the strength of pollen limitation and herbivory by ungulates along a gradient leading to the upper elevational range limits of Trillium erectum (Melanthiaceae) and Erythronium americanum (Liliaceae) in Mont Mégantic National Park, Québec, Canada. In T. erectum, pollen limitation was higher at the range limit, but seed set decreased only slightly with elevation and only in one of two years. In contrast, herbivory of T. erectum increased from <10% at low elevations to >60% at the upper elevational range limit. In E. americanum, we found no evidence of pollen limitation despite a significant decrease in seed set with elevation, and herbivory was low across the entire gradient. Overall, our results demonstrate the potential for relatively strong negative interactions (herbivory) and weak positive interactions (pollination) at plant range edges, although this was clearly species specific. To the extent that these interactions have important demographic consequenceshighly likely for herbivory on Trillium, based on previous studiessuch interactions might play a role in determining plant species' range limits along putatively climatic gradients. © 2017 The Authors.

Materials and methods A consensus map of lentil (Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris Medikus) was constructed using three different lentils recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, including CDC Redberry x ILL7502 (LR8), ILL8006 x CDC Milestone (LR11) and PI320937 x Eston (LR39). Results The lentil consensus map was composed of 9,793 DArT markers, covered a total of 977.47 cM with an average distance of 0.10 cM between adjacent markers and constructed 7 linkage groups representing 7 chromosomes of the lentil genome. The consensus map had no gap larger than 12.67 cM and only 5 gaps were found to be between 12.67 cM and 6.0 cM (on LG3 and LG4). The localization of the SNP markers on the lentil consensus map were in general consistent with their localization on the three individual genetic linkage maps and the lentil consensus map has longer map length, higher marker density and shorter average distance between the adjacent markers compared to the component linkage maps. Conclusion This high-density consensus map could provide insight into the lentil genome. The consensus map could also help to construct a physical map using a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome library and map based cloning studies.

The European dark bee, Apis mellifera mellifera (L.) is widely used for crop pollination. However, pesticide usage in modern agriculture has threatened the plant-bee pollinator interaction. There is lack of data regarding lethal time, insecticide concentration and poisoning symptoms, especially for formulated insecticides that are widely used in insect management. This study shows that the intrinsic toxicity of insecticides (LC50) to A. mellifera mellifera (L.) was in the following order: imidacloprid (0.0070) &gt; fipronil (0.0125) &gt; indoxacarb (0.0266) &gt; cypermethrin (0.0370) &gt; dimethoate (0.0385). The lethal time (LT50) values (h) in the ascending order of toxicity of insecticides were as follows: fipronil (6.56), cypermethrin (6.69), dimethoate (8.00), imidacloprid (9.85) and indoxacarb (13.45). Distinct poisoning symptoms observed in A. mellifera mellifera were extended proboscis, expanded wings, unhooked wings, extended legs and twisted bodies, defecation on cage covers, sting in release-out position and anus with excreta. All the tested pesticides are harmful to the honey bee except azadirachtin. The tested pesticides exhibited different poisoning symptoms in bees, which could be useful for beekeepers in identifying the cause of colony mortality. In conclusion, the pesticide toxicological research on bees is an important safety aspect for beneficial organisms. This study reveals a realistic acute toxicity in the field of commonly used insecticides. The information is important for insecticide selection in order to minimize direct killing of foraging honey bees while maintaining effective management of crop pests. © 2018 by the Serbian Biological Society.",Apis mellifera mellifera L.; Bioassay; Intrinsic toxicity; LC50; Time mortality,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043708912

Given the important role birds play in forest ecosystem functions via seed dispersal and pollination, a bird community's response to forest restoration is an important measure of the success of such conservation actions. We evaluated the bird response to reforestation at an important bird sanctuary, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, Hawai?i Island, using 26 years of bird count data. We show that most species from within the diverse avian community increased significantly, but species colonized the restoration forest at different rates. Distance from intact forest and time since restoration were both important predictors of colonization rate, interacting such that for most species it took more time to colonize areas farther from the intact forest. In addition, both forest cover and understory diversity helped to explain bird densities, but the effect varied among species, suggesting that different habitat requirements may help drive variation in colonization rates.

We examined the patterns and causes of oviposition preference in the monarch butterfly, a rapidly declining species, in southwestern Ontario at both landscape and milkweed patch spatial scales. Additionally, we measured the abundance of invertebrate predators, parasitoids and parasites across these same spatial scales. Oviposition preference was dependent on both the size of the milkweed patch and the density of milkweed within the patch, as well as landscape type. Small (&lt; 16 m2), low-density (0.12 milkweed per m2) milkweed patches in agricultural landscape had the highest egg density compared to all types of milkweed patches in non-agricultural and roadside landscapes. Medium-sized patches had the highest predator abundance. Variation in the abundance of parasitoids, and occurrence of parasites of monarch eggs and larvae did not appear to coincide with preferred egg laying habitats. Our results suggest that investing heavily in milkweed restoration in roadside habitats should be done cautiously. Instead, a better strategy may be for managers to develop incentive programs with landowners to plant and maintain milkweeds in agricultural landscapes, which could complement other pollinator initiatives or ecosystem service programs in agricultural landscapes that focus on increasing nectar availability. Our results have important implications for restoring milkweed as an approach to counteract monarch butterflies declines. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Conservation; Danaus plexippus; Monarch butterfly; Parasites; Parasitoids; Predators,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042152978

We assessed the effectiveness of this policy in reducing the exposure risk to honeybees by collecting 130 samples of honey from bee keepers across the UK before (2014: N = 21) and after the moratorium was in effect (2015: N = 109). Neonicotinoids were present in about half of the honey samples taken before the moratorium, and they were present in over a fifth of honey samples following the moratorium. Clothianidin was the most frequently detected neonicotinoid. Neonicotinoid concentrations declined from May to September in the year following the ban. However, the majority of post-moratorium neonicotinoid residues were from honey harvested early in the year, coinciding with oilseed rape flowering. Neonicotinoid concentrations were correlated with the area of oilseed rape surrounding the hive location. These results suggest mass flowering crops may contain neonicotinoid residues where they have been grown on soils contaminated by previously seed treated crops. This may include winter seed treatments applied to cereals that are currently exempt from EU restrictions. Although concentrations of neonicotinoids were low (&lt;2.0 ng g-1), and posed no risk to human health, they may represent a continued risk to honeybees through long-term chronic exposure. © 2018 Woodcock et al.

Individual trees of A. oblongum possess three types of flower morphs. Though morphologically all flowering morphs appear to be bisexual, the male or female function is temporally suppressed to achieve successful cross-pollination. We studied the role of endothecial thickenings in the selective dehiscence of anthers. Anatomical analysis showed the presence of fibrous thickenings in the endothecium cells of staminate type I flowers. However, minimal opening of anther along the line of dehiscence was observed in hermaphrodite flowers that showed poor differentiation of endothecium. Although an endothecium is formed also in anthers of hermaphrodite flowers, the anthers fail to dehisce because not all endothecial cells have fibrous thickenings, especially towards the stomium. In hermaphrodite flowers, mature pollen grains were formed only after stigma divergence when the receptivity was already lost (after stage 3). Furthermore, pistil anatomy revealed a functional embryo sac only in hermaphrodite flowers. Functionally male flowers, with an undeveloped pistil, serve as the only source of pollen for fertilization. © 2017 The Authors",Acer oblongum; andromonoecy; anther anatomy; endothecial thickenings; pistil structure; receptivity; stigma; stomium,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042471508

In the current deleterious context for pollinators, the invasive yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, represents an additional threat to the domestic honeybee, Apis mellifera, in Europe. Therefore, understanding the impact of this predator on honeybee colonies is of major importance. In the present study, we tried to assess the impact of V. velutina on the honeybee foraging and defence behaviour based on the video monitoring of two hives. Balling behaviour is reported here for the first time under natural conditions in A. mellifera against V. velutina in Europe. Although these results are preliminary and should be carefully considered, we found that the number of hornets impacted honeybee foraging and defence behaviours. More defensive behaviours were notified in the hive, which survives slightly longer. This may suggest that selecting for more defensive colonies may provide an interesting perspective. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Balling behaviour; Defence behaviour; Domestic honeybee; Foraging; Yellow-legged hornet,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039705325

We parameterized species distribution models (SDMs) for 135 plant species from the Algerian steppes. We interpreted low false-positive rates as reflecting a high capacity to follow optimal environmental conditions and high false-negative rates as a high capacity to persist under suboptimal environmental conditions. We also measured functional traits in the field and built a unique plant trait database for the North-African steppe. For both perennial and annual species, we explored how these two capacities can be explained by species traits and whether relevant trait values reflect species strategies or biases in SDMs. We found low false-positive rates in species with small seeds, flowers attracting specialist pollinators, and specialized distributions (among annuals and perennials), low root:shoot ratios, wide root-systems, and large leaves (perennials only) (R2 =.5258). We found high false-negative rates in species with marginal environmental distribution (among annuals and perennials), small seeds, relatively deep roots, and specialized distributions (annuals) or large leaves, wide root-systems, and monocarpic life cycle (perennials) (R2 =.38 for annuals and 0.65 for perennials). Overall, relevant traits are rarely indicative of the possible biases of SDMs, but rather reflect the species' reproductive strategy, dispersal ability, stress tolerance, and pollination strategies. Our results suggest that wide undirected dispersal in annual species and efficient resource acquisition in perennial species favor both capacities, whereas short life spans in perennial species favor persistence in suboptimal environmental conditions and flowers attracting specialist pollinators in perennial and annual species favor following optimal environmental conditions. Species that neither follow nor persist will be at risk under future environmental change. © 2017 The Authors.

The present paper focused on two morphological categories of S. sellowianum (MC-I and MC-II) with distinct morphological traits. Morphological, cytogenetic, reproductive biology and genetic studies were performed, aiming to elucidate and better characterize such variation. The basic chromosome number established for the species was x = 9 and diploid and tetraploid populations were observed for MC-I, whereas MC-II showed only diploid populations. Different pollen morphologies were recognized in each morphological category. Based on pollination experiments, MC-I is out-crossing, whereas MC-II is selfing. The populations were highly differentiated (FST = 0.46, ?B = 0.62). In MC-I, observed variation was greater within populations (69%) than among populations (31%), whereas in MC-II, 61% of the variation was among populations and 39% within populations. This study evidenced that the two morphological categories correspond to distinct and reproductively isolated species and that floral traits reflect their breeding system, with allogamous plants in MC-I and autogamous in MC-II. Furthermore, MC-II is unveiled as S. platycaule, a neglected taxon of Sisyrinchium in Brazil. The tools applied in this study were substantially able to check the identity of the two morphological categories as two different species and present the variation encountered in the taxa. © 2017 The Society for the Study of Species Biology",biological diversity; breeding system; chromosome number; Sisyrinchium platycaule; Sisyrinchium sellowianum,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039907118

Thus, a particular attention should be paid to their protection, not only for their ecological importance by contributing to the maintenance of wild plant diversity, but also for their economic value as honey producers and crop-pollinating agents. For all these reasons, the environmental protection requires the resort of risk assessment of pesticides. The goal of this work was therefore to develop a validated QSAR model to predict contact acute toxicity (LD50) of 111 pesticides to bees because the QSAR models devoted to this species are very scarce. The analysis of the statistical parameters of this model and those published in the literature shows that our model is more efficient. The QSAR model was assessed according to the OECD principles for the validation of QSAR models. The calculated values for the internal and external validation statistic parameters (Q2 and rm2¯) are greater than 0.85. In addition to this validation, a mathematical equation derived from the ANN model was used to predict the LD50 of 20 other pesticides. A good correlation between predicted and experimental values was found (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.14). As a result, this equation could be a means of predicting the toxicity of new pesticides. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Acute contact toxicity; ANN-based equation; Bees; Domain applicability; Pesticides; Prediction,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032016580

Abstract: In diverse crop plants, male-sterility has been exploited as a useful approach for production of hybrid varieties to harness the benefits of hybrid vigour. The promoter region of Os12bglu38 gene of rice has been isolated from the developing panicles and was designated as P12. The promoter was fused with gusA reporter gene and was expressed in Arabidopsis and rice systems. Transgenic plants exhibited GUS activity in tapetal cells and pollen of the developing anthers indicating anther/pollen-specific expression of the promoter. For engineering nuclear male sterility, the coding region of Brassica napus cysteine protease1 (BnCysP1) was isolated from developing seeds and fused to P12 promoter. Transgenic rice plants obtained with P12-BnCysP1 failed to produce functional pollen grains. The F1 seeds obtained from BnCysP1 male-sterile plants and untransformed controls showed 1:1 (tolerant:sensitive) ratio when germinated on the MS medium supplemented with phosphinothricin (5 mg/l), confirming that the male sterility has been successfully engineered in rice. For male fertility restoration, transgenic rice plants carrying BnCysP1Si silencing system were developed. The pollination of BnCysP1 male-sterile (female-fertile) plants with BnCysP1Si pollen resulted in normal grain filling. The F1 seeds of BnCysP1 × BnCysP1Si when germinated on the MS basal medium containing PPT (5 mg/l) and hygromycin (70 mg/l) exhibited 1:1 (tolerant:sensitive) ratio and the tolerant plants invariably showed normal grain filling. The overall results clearly suggest that the customized male-sterility &amp; fertility-restoration system can be exploited for quality hybrid seed production in various crops. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brassica napus; Cysteine protease; Fertility-restoration; Hybrid seed production; Male-sterility; Transgenic rice,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032657165

In flowering plants, the domain of reproductive biology includes structural details of reproductive units such as flower or inflorescence, formation of viable gametes, pollination dynamics, role of pollinators, pollen-pistil interactions as determined through compatibility, breeding system and mating strategies, fertilization and embryogeny, seed development, dispersal and germination. The importance of reproductive biology in species conservation has been demonstrated through a case study of Illicium griffithii Hook f. & Thomson, a threatened plant species from Arunachal Pradesh. I. griffithii (Illiciaceae) is a member of the ANITA clade and a representative taxon of the three most basal angiosperms. The flowers of I. griffithii are obligate xenogamous, and hence compatible pollen grains only germinate on the stigmatic papillae. Esterase and phosphatase enzymatic activities are absent in most stigmatic surfaces. Therefore, stigmatic receptivity is absent in many carpels. The ovules are anatropous and bitegmic with a four-celled/four-nucleate structure of embryo sac at maturity. Antipodals and filiform apparatus are absent. Presence of mucilage cells in the embryo sac facilitates the entry of pollen tubes into it. Embryolike organization of the endosperm is present, with one pole globular having smaller cells and the other pole roughly filamentous with larger cells resembling that of a suspensor. Extragynoecial compitum is not observed in I. griffithii. The flowers are brooding sites for the midges and the young ovules are eaten by larvae of the midges. Only 10% of the flowers mature into 13-seeded fruits and the carpels of the remaining 90% of the flowers have seeds ranging from 1 to 5. The seedling survival rate is only 7%. In addition to the above-mentioned reproductive bottlenecks, the species is also being over-harvested. It is now categorized as endangered. The findings of the present study on reproductive biology of I. griffithii should help in improving its conservation status.",Embryological studies; Floral biology; Illicium griffithii; Reproductive bottlenecks; Threatened species conservation,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041501406

However, the complex interactions between gut microbes and environment are still unclear. Honey bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that host a core gut microbial community that is thought to be constant across populations. Here, we examined whether the composition of the gut microbial community of honey bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are exposed to. We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two main landscape types for 6 weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or agricultural farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape. The gut bacterial communities of adult bees from the colonies were then characterized and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. While previous studies have delineated a characteristic core set of bacteria inhabiting the honey bee gut, our results suggest that the broad environment that bees are exposed to has some influence on the relative abundance of some members of that microbial community. This includes known dominant taxa thought to have functions in nutrition and health. Our results provide evidence for an influence of landscape exposure on honey bee microbial community and highlight the potential effect of exposure to different environmental parameters, such as forage type and neonicotinoid pesticides, on key honey bee gut bacteria. This work emphasizes the complexity of the relationship between the host, its gut bacteria, and the environment and identifies target microbial taxa for functional analyses. © 2017 The Authors.

The diverse scales confirm a (Late) Triassic radiation of lepidopteran lineages, including the divergence of the Glossata, the clade that comprises the vast multitude of extant moths and butterflies that have a sucking proboscis. The microfossils extend the minimum calibrated age of glossatan moths by ca. 70 million years, refuting ancestral association of the group with flowering plants. Development of the proboscis May be regarded as an adaptive innovation to sucking free liquids for maintaining the insects water balance under arid conditions. Pollination drops secreted by a variety of Mesozoic gymnosperms May have been non-mutualistically exploited as a high-energy liquid source. The early evolution of the Lepidoptera was probably not severely interrupted by the end-Triassic biotic crisis. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042185011

The taxonomically confused group of bumblebees has reaped the benefit of this approach through the analyses of cephalic labial gland secretions (CLGS). Most of currently available CLGS descriptions concern species from the West-Palearctic region but few from the New World. Here, the CLGS of four East-Palearctic species Bombus deuteronymus, B. filchnerae, B. humilis, and B. exil (subgenus Thoracobombus) are analysed. Our results show high levels of variability in the major compounds in B. exil. In contrast, we describe a low differentiation in CLGS compounds between B. filchnerae and its phylogenetically closely related taxon B. muscorum.

Here, we introduce a quantitative framework to assess global aggregate ecosystem services from existing vegetation in cities and an intensive UA adoption scenario based on data-driven estimates of urban morphology and vacant land. We analyzed global population, urban, meteorological, terrain, and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) datasets in Google Earth Engine to derive global scale estimates, aggregated by country, of services provided by UA. We estimate the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas to be on the order of $33 billion annually. We project potential annual food production of 100180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes, and avoided storm water runoff between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. In addition, we estimate that food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological control of pests could be worth as much as $80160 billion annually in a scenario of intense UA implementation. Our results demonstrate significant country-to-country variability in UA-derived ecosystem services and reduction of food insecurity. These estimates represent the first effort to consistently quantify these incentives globally, and highlight the relative spatial importance of built environments to act as change agents that alleviate mounting concerns associated with global environmental change and unsustainable development. © 2018 The Authors.",earth engine; ecosystem services; food security; remote sensing; urban agriculture; urban resilience,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040254441

In Europe, the restricted use of chemicals and therapeutic agents in the beekeeping sector has stimulated the search for natural alternatives with a special focus on gut symbionts. The modulation of the gut microbiota has been recognised as a practical and successful approach in the entomological field for the management of insectrelated problems. To date, only a few studies have investigated the effect of bacterial supplementation on the health status of colonies, colony productivity and gut symbionts. To this purpose, a preparation of sugar syrup containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli isolated from bee gut was sprayed on the frames of an apiary located in open field once a week for four weeks. Treated and control hives were monitored for two months for brood extension, honey and pollen harvest. The presence of beneficial gut microorganisms within bee gut was investigated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and next generation sequencing. The administered bacteria led to a significant increase of brood population (46.2%), pollen (53.4%) and harvestable honey in honey supers (59.21%). Analysis of the gut microbiota on the new generation of bees in treated hives showed an increase in relative abundance of Acetobacteraceae and Bifidobacterium spp., which are known to be involved in bee nutrition and protection. © 2017 Wageningen Academic Publishers.",DGGE; Gut community; Honey; NGS; Probiotics,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042750997

Here, we used direct ambient corona discharge ionization mass spectrometry (MS) to study the volatile chemical composition behind the semen-like odor emitted by the fresh flowers of Photinia serrulata, Castanopsis sclerophylla and Stemona japonica without any chemical pretreatment. Chemical identification was performed using high-resolution MS analysis in combination with tandem MS analysis and whenever possible was confirmed by the analysis of standard reference compounds. A total of 19 compounds, mostly belonging to nitrogenous volatiles, were identified in P. serrulata, C. sclerophylla, and S. japonica flowers, 1-pyrroline, 1-piperideine, 2-pyrrolidone, and phenethylamine being common in all the three studied species. Several lines of evidence indicate that the major component responsible for the semen-like odor is most likely 1-pyrroline. 1-Pyrroline is most probably formed via the oxidative deamination of putrescine, as indicated by the observation of signal from 4-amino-butanal intermediate. Flower visitation observations suggest that the released volatiles serve to attract dipterans, including Syrphidae, Calliphoridae, and Muscidae. On the analytical side, the comparison of our results to earlier studies also indicate that compared to the traditional GC-MS approach the direct corona discharge ionization mass spectrometry provides more sensitive detection of VOCs with high proton affinity, in particular volatile amines, and therefore can be used to complement traditional GC-MS approach for the highest chemical coverage of VOC analysis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",1-Pyrroline; Castanopsis sclerophylla; Direct ambient corona discharge ionization mass spectrometry; Photinia serrulata; Pollination; Sapromyophily; Semen-like odor; Semiochemicals; Stemona japonica,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032978382

Although many eukaryotes express two eIF4G isoforms that are highly similar, those in plants, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, are highly divergent in size, sequence, and domain organization. Species of the Brassicaceae and the Cleomaceae also express a divergent eIFiso4G isoform, referred to as eIFiso4G2, not found elsewhere in the plant kingdom. Despite their divergence, eIF4G and eIFiso4G interact with eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF4E isoforms needed for binding an mRNA. eIF4G and eIFiso4G also interact with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) which promotes ribosome recruitment to an mRNA. Increasing the complexity of such an interaction, however, Arabidopsis also expresses three PABP isoforms (PAB2, PAB4, and PAB8) in vegetative and reproductive tissues. In this study, the functional interactions among the eIF4G and the widely-expressed PABP isoforms were examined. Loss of PAB2 or PAB8 in combination with loss of eIF4G or eIFiso4G had little to no effect on growth or fertility whereas pab2 pab8 eif4g or pab2 pab8 eifiso4g1/2 mutants exhibited smaller stature and reduced fertility. Although the pab4 eifiso4g1 mutant grows normally and is fertile, pab4 eif4g or pab4 eifiso4g2 mutants could not be isolated. Even pab4/PAB4 eif4g/eIF4G heterozygous plants exhibited growth defects and low fertility. Mutant co-inheritance analysis in reciprocal crosses with wild-type plants revealed that most ovaries and pollen from pab4/PAB4 eif4g/eIF4G plants were PAB4 eif4g. Similarly, co-inheritance studies with pab4/PAB4 eifiso4g2/eIFiso4G2 plants suggested most ovaries were PAB4 eifiso4g2. These results suggest that a functional interaction between PAB4 and eIF4G and between PAB4 and eIFiso4G2 is required for growth and normal fertility. © 2018 Daniel R. Gallie.

In the present study, we examined the relative contributions of different habitat types to the landscape-scale species richness of vascular plants within farmland of varying landscape complexity. We also analysed pollen collected by bees to examine the extent to which the different habitat types contributed towards the provisioning of floral resources for three taxa (Bombus terrrestris, Megachile sp. and Osmia bicornis). We found that plant species richness increased with landscape complexity (defined as the proportion of semi-natural habitats). The relative contribution of small fragments of non-arable habitat to total plant species richness was high within all landscape types, especially in relation to the small area they covered. The importance of small non-arable fragments for the provisioning of floral resources to bees varied over time and between taxa. Bombus terrestris used the different habitat types differently during different parts of the growing season: arable fields were important early in the season, leys late in the season, and small non-arable habitat fragments during the mid-season when no mass-flowering crops were in bloom. In contrast, Megachile sp. and O. bicornis mainly foraged on plants occurring within grasslands. We conclude that small fragments of non-arable habitat are important for plant species richness at the landscape-scale and that their importance for plants may cascade to the bees that use them as foraging resources. Consequently, it is important to consider the entire landscape mosaic when taking actions to conserve farmland species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Habitat specificity; Landscape complexity; Pollen; Pollinators; Resource plants; Small biotopes; Vascular plants,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029789738

It is reputed to be a good honey producer, and has potential to be used as a pollinator of tropical crops. The provision of beeswax foundation in honey bee hives was possibly the technique that most improved honey production in apiculture. In meliponiculture, the use of a similar technology is unknown or does not exist. In the present work, honey production was evaluated after the introduction of cerumen to colonies of M. fasciculata in the form of: artificially-constructed pots (the beeswax foundation analog for meliponiculture); amorphous masses (balls); and recovered naturally-made pots after honey extraction. After the provision of natural pots, honey production was 2.7 times higher than in the control treatment, so, this technique is likely to be adopted as a practice in the beekeeping of M. fasciculata during high foraging season. With the offering of the cerumen in balls, honey production was 1.6 times higher than in the control treatment, but this difference was not significant, which may be a consequence of the high variability in honey production among hives. The introduction of artificially-constructed cerumen pots can be considered an equivalent technique to beeswax foundation in terms of improving honey production and facilitating its harvest. Therefore, this technique has the potential to revolutionize stingless beekeeping by saving labor; furthermore, the compartmentalization of honey pots to a super, would facilitate harvesting and diminish stress for larvae and young bees. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.",Amazonia; cerumen; honey production; meliponiculture; stingless bees,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021099589

Marker-assisted selection was used to select for plants containing the three AGQTL named AG3QTL, AG4QTL, and AG11QTL from self-pollinated populations derived from an interspecific backcross population of CU071026 x (CU071026 x S. pennellii LA716). High acylglucose-accumulating lines were selected from these populations that possess these three AGQTL and the fewest number of extraneous S. pennellii LA716 introgressions. Incorporation of these three acylglucose QTL in the presence of the five standard S. pennellii introgressions of CU071026 altered acylsugar level and sugar moiety, demonstrating epistatic interactions between the acylglucose QTL on both of these traits. Comparison of the lines generated from the two breeding techniques indicated the three acylglucose QTL are essential but not necessarily sufficient for the production of elevated levels of acylglucose acylsugars. Fine-mapping of AG3QTL, AG4QTL, and AG11QTL resulted in less than 1 Mbp intervals for the locations of AG4QTL and AG11QTL; proposals of the causal genes underlying these acylglucose QTL are discussed. Characterization of the fatty acid profile of lines selected out of the interspecific backcross populations revealed an increase in the proportion of acylsugar n-C10 fatty acid acyl chains, possibly governed by one or more of the three acylglucose QTL. Characterization of the acylsugar profile of acylglucose lines selected from the interspecific backcross populations also demonstrated interactions among the acylglucose QTL to further modulate the diversity of acylsugars accumulated. Evaluation of an acylglucose line and controls against the tomato insect pest Frankliniella occidentalis demonstrated that levels of resistance differed among these lines and that the acylsugars accumulated by the acylglucose line were effective at reducing both F. occidentalis oviposition and incidence of Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus.

The crossings were found to be partially compatible. In P. sylvestris × P. mugo crossing, the paternal transmission of cpDNA to the offspring takes place corroborating the generally acknowledged concept of the paternal cpDNA inheritance in gymnosperms. On the contrary, in P. mugo × P. sylvestris crossing the seed progeny exhibited P. mugo haplotype of the mother tree deviating conspicuously from the above concept. In the open pollination offspring of the putatively hybrid individuals of the Scots and mountain dwarf pines, a biparental inheritance of cpDNA was revealed in mother tree with P. mugo haplotype indicating a loosened control of the maternal inheritance of cpDNA in the putative hybrids. Implications and impacts of this finding for further studies are discussed. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",CpDNA inheritance; Crossings; Hybrid swarms; Pinus mugo; Pinus sylvestris,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028624031

The soil and water resources contained in this region have historically supported highly diverse and productive agriculture enterprises that provide a significant proportion of the food, feed, and oilseed for the nation. The region also provides ecological services that influence air, water, and soil quality along with biological diversity. Combined with livestock production and a biofuel industry, crop production forms an integrated system that can offer producers flexibility in management decisions. Projected climatic changes for this region include increasing atmospheric CO2, a longer, warmer growing season, and increased precipitation, likely received in more frequent extreme events. These changes will impact soil and water resources in the region and create opportunities and challenges for land managers. The objectives of this paper are to describe anticipated impacts of projected mid-(2050) and late-(2085) climatic changes on crop production systems in the Northern Great Plains and provide adaptation strategies that should be developed to take advantage of positive and mitigate negative changes. Projected climatic changes will influence agricultural productivity directly as well as indirectly due to changes in weed pressure, insect populations, and diseases. A warmer, longer growing season will change the crops and distribution of those crops grown within the region. An increase in the number of extreme temperature events (high daytime highs or nighttime lows) will decrease crop yields due to increased plant stress during critical pollination and grain fill periods. Adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability of soil and water resources to projected climatic changes include increasing cropping intensity, reducing tillage intensity, and use of cover crops to provide surface cover to reduce erosion potential and improve nutrient and water use efficiency. Increased use of perennial forages, crop residue, and failed crops in integrated crop-livestock systems will add biological diversity and provide options for converting vegetation biomass into animal protein. Socio-economic changes will need to be incorporated into adaptation strategies planning to insure that sustaining ecosystem services and meeting desired production and conservation goals is accomplished. Education and extension services will be needed to transfer adaptive knowledge in a timely manner to producers in the field. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019890848

The goal of this study was to identify gene expression differences in PM-treated plants (harvested at 24 h and 48 h after inoculation) and untreated (control) plants of inbred line 1122 using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The inbred line 1122 has been purified over 8 consecutive generations of self-pollination and shows high resistance to PM. More than 7600 transcripts were examined in pumpkin leaves, and 3129 and 3080 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in inbred line 1122 at 24 and 48 hours post inoculation (hpi), respectively. Based on the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway database and GO (Gene Ontology) database, a complex regulatory network for PM resistance that may involve hormone signal transduction pathways, transcription factors and defense responses was revealed at the transcription level. In addition, the expression profiles of 16 selected genes were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. Among these genes, the transcript levels of 6 DEGs, including bHLH87 (Basic Helix-loop-helix transcription factor), ERF014 (Ethylene response factor), WRKY21 (WRKY domain), HSF (heat stress transcription factor A), MLO3 (Mildew Locus O), and SGT1 (Suppressor of G-Two Allele of Skp1), in PM-resistant 1122 were found to be significantly up- or down-regulated both before 9 hpi and at 24 hpi or 48 hpi; this behavior differed from that observed in the PM-susceptible material (cultivar Jiujiangjiaoding). The transcriptome data provide novel insights into the response of Cucurbita moschata to PM stress and are expected to be highly useful for dissecting PM defense mechanisms in this major vegetable and for improving pumpkin breeding with enhanced resistance to PM. © 2018 Guo et al.

While diverse functions have been ascribed to queen- and worker-produced compounds, few studies have explored the identity and function of male-produced (drone) compounds. However, several lines of evidence suggest that drones engage in a variety of social interactions inside and outside of the colony. Here we elucidate the chemical composition of extracts of the drone mandibular gland, and test the hypothesis that compounds produced in these glands, or a synthetic blend consisting of the six main compounds, mediate drone social interactions in and out of the colony. Drone mandibular glands primarily produce a blend of saturated, unsaturated and methyl branched fatty acids ranging in chain length from nonanoic to docosanoic acids, and both gland extracts and synthetic blends of these chemicals serve to attract drones outside of the hive, but do not attract workers inside the hive. These studies shed light on the role drones and drone-produced chemicals have on mediating social interactions with other drones and highlight their potential importance in communicating with other castes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Attraction; Drone; Honey bee; Pheromone; Pollinator; Social behavior,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037641442

Flower development is highly coordinated and involves developmental associations between size and shape, ontogenetic allometry, which in turn affect the morphology of mature flowers. Although ontogenetic allometries can act as a developmental constraint and may influence adaptive evolution, allometries can evolve themselves and may change rapidly in response to selection. We explored the evolution of ontogenetic allometry in the flowers of 11 species of Loasoideae. Seven species belong to Caiophora, which radiated recently in the central Andes, and contains species that are pollinated by bees, hummingbirds, and small rodents. According to a previous study, the diversification of Caiophora involved departures from simple allometric scaling, but the changes to allometry that enabled flower diversification have not been explored yet. We characterized the ontogenetic allometry of each species with the methods of geometric morphometrics. We studied the evolution of allometries by constructing allometric spaces, in which the allometry of each species is represented by a point and the arrangement of points indicates the relations among allometric trajectories. To examine the history of changes of ontogenetic allometries, we projected the phylogeny into the allometric spaces. Inspection of allometric spaces suggests that ontogenetic variation is limited to a few dominant features. The allometries of the two main functional flower parts under study differ in their evolutionary labilities, and patterns of variation reflect pollination systems, differences in structural organization, and abiotic environmental factors. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038020486

Don.]. The inheritance of growth habit and flower form was also studied. Internode cross sections revealed that phloem fiber was distributed at the inner cortex in upright cultivars but not in trailing cultivars. Except the youngest internode, the upright Vitesse Pink had the highest MOE throughout the 1st- 13th internodes above the cotyledon. The more trailing Cora Cascade Strawberry had consistently lowerMOE than a less trailing Cora Cascade Polka Dot. All F1 plants between upright and trailing cultivars were upright, and the F2 generation derived from self-pollinating F1 fit a 3 upright: 1 trailing segregation ratio. All F1 plants between upright/ double-flower and trailing/single-flower exhibited upright and single-flowers, whereas plants in the F2 generation fitted a 9 upright/single-flower: 3 trailing/single-flower: 3 upright/double-flower: 1 trailing/double-flower ratio.
